   Federal agents searched a remote mining camp southwest of
Flagstaff on Friday, looking for clues to the theft of nearly 1,000
pounds of explosives and questioning workers with access to the
locked area where the missing materials were stored.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said 750 pounds of fuel-soaked ammonium nitrate, 250
pounds of dynamite; 6,000 feet of detonation cord and about 20
blasting caps were stolen after 5 p.m. Monday from the 3 Wins
Mining Co. camp near the tiny community of Drake.
</P>
<P>
   The materials all are commonly used in mining, authorities said,
but they also can be used to make a bomb. Officials stopped short
of connecting the theft to terrorism, but the amount taken _ enough
to level a high-rise _ worries them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no security. This is a very remote site,'' said
Special Agent Larry Bettendorf of the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   He said the thieves could easily have carted off the explosives
in a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   The materials were inside two locked steel-plated boxes beside a
dirt road on the property.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities would not discuss how the thieves opened the boxes,
but said that only about a dozen workers had access to the storage
area.
</P>
<P>
   Ammonium nitrate was the primary ingredient in the 4,800-pound
bomb that exploded outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in
Oklahoma City in April 1995, killing 138 people.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide last year, Bettendorf said, 4,000 pounds of ammonium
nitrate was stolen, and 26,000 pounds has been stolen during the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone knew what they were doing, they could do a lot of
damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not clear whether the theft was part of some New Year's
terrorist plot or whether the timing was merely coincidental. The
FBI recently warned of potential terrorism around Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Whitted, deputy chief with the Coconino County Sheriff's
Department, said no threats have been linked to the theft and no
group has claimed responsibility for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the use of this material is pure speculation,''
Whitted said. ``We just don't know at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers with California-based 3 Wins Mining, which operates the
M.C. Sandstone Quarry, noticed the theft Monday night or Tuesday
morning but didn't report it until midday Thursday, officials said.
An investigation into that delay was under way Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said workers with access to the area where the
explosives were stored are being questioned about the theft, as are
other quarry workers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Scott Sterne, owner of Phoenix Demolition Co. and
Salvage, said the amount of explosives stolen is worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   The 750 pounds of ammonium nitrate alone, Sterne said, ``is
enough to create a major national disaster on the order of the
Oklahoma City bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that 250 pounds of missing dynamite: enough, Sterne
estimates, to bring down the Bank One building in downtown
Phoenix. &QL;

TEACHER DONATES A KIDNEY TO A STUDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (CLARIFIES reference to father in 5th graf) 
 (DW) 
 By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Jane Smith, a middle school teacher in
Fayetteville, was always telling Michael Carter, a student of hers,
to pull up his baggy pants. What Ms. Smith did not know was that
Michael suffered from kidney disease and that the illness, and
resulting dialysis, left him routinely sore.
</P>
<P>
   So when she made one too many demands about those pants,
``finally he got exasperated with me,'' Ms. Smith recalled, ``and
said: `I can't. I'm on dialysis. I need a kidney transplant.' And I
said: `Well, I have two. Do you want one?'''
</P>
<P>
   That extraordinary offer led the 14-year-old Michael and the
42-year-old Ms. Smith to the University of North Carolina Hospitals
on Thursday for transplant surgery. Michael is to get his new
kidney, and Ms. Smith is to add organ donor to the roles she
already has in his life, as his teacher for both home room and
general science.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, scheduled for Friday, was postponed after Michael
developed a low-grade fever. The antibiotics that he is now being
given at the hospital to fight the infection, so far of
undetermined cause, meant that he could not be given immune
suppressant drugs that transplant patients receive to ensure that
their bodies will not reject the new organ.
</P>
<P>
   But the delay is only a minor setback to Michael and his
parents, Richard and Deborah Evans who have learned to endure a lot
more. ``This too shall pass,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, the second of five children of Mrs. Evans and her
husband, Richard, a 50-year-old home builder, was found to have
kidney disease when he was only 16 months old. At 13 years, one
kidney stopped functioning entirely. He has been receiving dialysis
treatment ever since.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, a donor was sought from among Michael's
friends and relatives. But medical tests failed to find a match.
</P>
<P>
   Then, soon ater the beginning of the current school year, Ms.
Smith, an eighth-grade teacher at the R. Max Abbott Middle School
in Fayetteville, learned of Michael's illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I instantly knew that this was something I could do,'' she
said, ``that there was no pain I could suffer that would be as
great as what Michael was going through.''
</P>
<P>
   After a battery of tests and many anxious moments, teacher and
student were told that they were a match, and the surgery was
scheduled to coincide with the school's Christmas break.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, the divorced mother of a 12-year-old boy, says she
has never had second thoughts about her decision. Michael's illness
``is holding him back,'' she said. ``He's got a good mind, and he's
got the desire. But he just hasn't had the physical energy to
follow through.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Evans says she and her family are still stunned by Ms.
Smith's generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had anyone to reach out like that,'' she said,
``someone outside my family. It says a lot. No matter what you're
going through, no matter how difficult the situation may appear,
there is an answer out there. You just have to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   That Michael is black and Ms. Smith white has also inspired
many, not only people here in North Carolina but those across the
country who have seen reports about the two of them on national
television.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, though, Ms. Smith has played down her role,
saying she hopes the story will simply call attention to the need
for organ donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this world you need to realize that there's a bond,'' she
said. ``There's a connection between you and everybody else you
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith and Mrs. Evans are both devout Baptists, and say their
religious faith has helped them through the experience. ``God chose
us together,'' Mrs. Evans said, ``to accomplish his purpose'' _ to
extend Michael's life and raise consciousness about organ donating.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith says that when she found out in October that she was a
match for Michael, she spoke to her own son first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I was not going to be taken away from him because
of it,'' she said, ``and that Michael had a need, and this was
something that was a miracle that we could fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Evans remembers that when she learned of the match, she
went to the school and found Ms. Smith, and they hugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like our whole soul became one,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Mrs. Evans says, she offered up special prayers for Ms.
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to the Lord, `thank you for that lady, thank you for
Jane Smith.' I was so grateful, but I was getting bold with the
Lord. I was getting tough. I said: `Don't you ever let her want for
anything, Lord. Don't even let her want for a Kleenex. God, don't
you let her tire go flat.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I was going down the list, because I couldn't ever
repay her enough for what she had done.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday
ordered 392 plants in a dozen states, mostly electric generating
stations, to cut in half emissions of chemicals that drift with
winds and add to smog along the Eastern seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   The federal regulators acted at the request of New York,
Connecticut, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, which said they needed
help to meet national smog standards.
</P>
<P>
   The plants are in 12 states, as far west as Indiana and as far
south as North Carolina. Agency officials said they might soon
issue similar orders for plants in Illinois. Most of the plants
meet existing federal limits on the chemicals, nitrogen oxides, and
are in areas that do not exceed smog standards, but now the EPA is
tightening the limits.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 states are West Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Michigan, New Jersey, Kentucky,
Delaware, New York and Indiana. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The states that requested the action are among a group on the
East Coast that had already agreed among themselves to impose the
stricter standard on nitrogen oxide emissions within their borders.
The areas that would for the first time be forced to take action
under Friday's order are in the South and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The areas covered by the action must reduce emissions by 2003 by
a total of about half a million tons a year, all in the summer smog
season, the federal regulators said. The EPA said that compliance
would cost companies, which include Ford, General Motors, Dow
Chemical and most power providers in Ohio, West Virginia and
Pennsylvania, about $950 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Browner, the EPA administrator, said the order would
raise the cost of electricity by about 1 percent above what it
would otherwise have been, but that because of deregulation of the
industry, costs to consumers are still expected to decline.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in several industries, though, said Friday that they
were not sure what compliance would cost. Many executives and state
officials from areas covered by the order denounced it, saying that
they already met strict standards, that Eastern smog was little
affected by Midwestern emissions and that the EPA would ultimately
be rebuffed by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of some of the plants are already in court to block
tighter limits on nitrogen oxide emissions that the EPA proposed
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's track record in court has been poor in the last few
months. In May, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit barred the agency from enforcing a stricter
standard on smog levels, one calculated over an eight-hour period
instead of the current one-hour. In a separate decision, it blocked
the EPA from requiring the states to order a new round of
reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions from sources within their
borders.
</P>
<P>
   So now the EPA is trying a third means.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Browner said Friday in a conference call with reporters,
``Our commitment is to solve the long-distance ozone-transport
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get there, one way or the other,'' she said.
``We are going to get there. We are going to get people clean
air.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The EPA did not rank the plants cited on its list Friday. David
Cohen, a spokesman for the EPA, said the four states that filed the
petitions provided information based on computer modeling and ``we
looked at the broad categories to verify the fact that the sources
were contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, one of the states with plants covered by the order,
Russ Harding, director of the Department of Environmental Quality,
said: ``I think it's highly inappropriate for the administrator to
be doing this. It may make good headlines, but it's not going to
solve clean-air issues. She's just creating more lawsuits, wasting
more taxpayer dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Michigan had already been planning to publish new
regulations next month putting stricter controls on nitrogen oxide
emissions, but not as strict as the ones ordered Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At First Energy, the parent company of Ohio Edison, Ralph
DiNicola, a spokesman, said, ``The EPA's own studies have indicated
that under heavy ozone- loading days the Midwest plants contribute
to less than 5 percent of the problem in the industrialized
Northeast cities.''
</P>
<P>
   DiNicola said that in the East, people could see stone statues
eroding, another effect of nitrogen emissions, as they stood next
to roads with ``12 lanes of stalled traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little hard to then take a look at plants 500 miles
away and claim they are the cause of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Browner, the EPA administrator, was not able to say Friday how
many fewer days of ozone violations the East would record with the
new controls in place.
</P>
<P>
   The order uses a procedure outlined in the Clean Air Act
amendments of 1990 under which the states can petition the EPA to
take action against specific smokestacks beyond their borders. The
EPA set out to use the procedure in April, when several states
petitioned, saying they could not meet the strict new ozone
standards the agency had promulgated. But then the appeals court
here held up the new eight-hour standard, and the states withdrew
the petitions, to rewrite them based on the older ozone standard.
Then several industries sued on the basis of the original
petitions. One issue was how much difference a smokestack in
Cincinnati or Detroit could make to the air in Philadelphia or New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania cited vast swaths of
states near and far, and categories of plants within those areas
Massachusetts, the other state whose petition was approved Friday,
named individual plants, some as far away as Michigan. Another four
jurisdictions filed petitions later that are still under review,
including New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the complaining states hailed the order. ``The EPA
has come to the realization that we have come to a long time ago,
that trans-boundary pollution exists, and that there are specific
facilities outside New York's borders that are seriously affecting
quality of air here in New York,'' said William Cahill, New York's
commissioner of environmental conservation.
</P>
<P>
   In 30 years of determined work, government regulators have
forced extensive changes in cars, fuels, power plants and even
hairspray to reduce emissions of chemicals that cause smog. But
paired with 30 years of economic growth, they have not succeeded in
eliminating violations.
</P>
<P>
   At the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit group, David Wooley, a
lawyer, said that the federal limit for smog was 120 parts ozone
per billion parts of air, and that often in the summer, air
drifting into densely populated areas of the Northeast was already
at 90 parts per billion. Health damage occurs even below 120 parts,
Wooley said, so any reduction would be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Others were skeptical. In Marshall, Mich., a town of less than
7,000, situated 100 miles west of Detroit, Maurice Evans, the city
manager, said he doubted that his town's municipal electric plant
could be affecting air in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a small electric utility,'' Evans said. ``We've got
very little pollution that's coming out of that plant.''

GILBERT CRITICIZED FOR HATE-CRIME STAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By EDYTHE JENSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A member of Gilbert's ``Devil Dogs'' White supremacist gang had
some powerful people standing up for him before he was sentenced in
the gang beating of strangers who were taunted with shouts of
``homo'' and ``White power.''
</P>
<P>
   The town's former mayor sent the judge a letter to vouch for
Glenn Cribbin's character, and a high school athletic director
testified in an attempt to spare his former wrestling star from
jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times have we seen a young man inappropriately use
his strength rather than his brains?'' former Mayor James Farley
asked in his letter. ``That is what happened here _ nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Such high-powered support has the head of the area chapter of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
questioning whether Gilbert really is serious about combating hate
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changed the way I think of Gilbert,'' said Floyd
Galloway, who had helped the town host school diversity meetings
after reports of gang violence and intimidation began surfacing
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he believes the meetings were a sham, and he doubts he'll
continue to attend them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gilbert seems more concerned with its public image than with
justice,'' Galloway said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy County Attorney Hugo Zettler, who is prosecuting Devil
Dog members, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are high school jocks and privileged kids who think it's
OK to pick on Blacks, Asians and Hispanics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Gilbert would just as soon hide it than blemish its
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mark Aceto of Maricopa County Superior Court wasn't swayed
by Cribbin's influential supporters. On Nov. 30, he sentenced the
19-year-old former Highland High wrestling champion to a year
behind bars and three years' probation for felony assault.
</P>
<P>
   Cribbin and seven teenagers were accused in the March beating of
two Taco Bell customers, who were picked at random for attack.
Witnesses heard the young people barking like dogs and yelling,
``Hey homo!'' and ``White power!''
</P>
<P>
   Both victims, who are White, were hurt. One was hospitalized for
injuries to his face, eyes and arms.
</P>
<P>
   Town spokesman David Cannella said it's unfair to accuse Gilbert
of tolerating such attacks when town officials have worked hard to
promote tolerance through a ``Community With Character'' program.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are entitled to testify on behalf of whomever they
want,'' Cannella said. ``The Police Department investigates crime.
. . . When it gets to the judicial system, that's separate from the
town.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, however, has been criticized by some civil rights
leaders for failing to take up the Justice Department on its
4-month-old offer to send in a special team that deals with racial
tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks linked to the Devil Dogs gang have included the May
beating of a Mesa boy who must undergo plastic surgery to repair
damage to his face. In April, three teens approached an
Asian-American couple who were boating in Gilbert's Val Vista Lakes
development. They stole the man's cellular phone, yelled racial
slurs and tried to tip over the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Highland High Athletic Director Kevin Fagan said he was a
character witness at the request of Cribbin's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``His father won a state championship in wrestling . . . and his
son was a good kid in school, very respectful,'' Fagan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't know that Cribbin had a juvenile record or
that he admitted abusing alcohol and drugs while in high school,
information contained in court records.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert Schools Superintendent Walter Delecki said he didn't
know Fagan testified in Cribbin's behalf. But he was familiar with
the Taco Bell attack.
</P>
<P>
   Delecki said his teenage son, Jacob, was with some of the
defendants the night of the assault and was listed in police
reports as a witness to the beatings.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent said his son is a law-abiding boy whose only
offense is being kind to the assailants.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I told him, `You can't run with these kids _ it's guilt by
association.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In Farley's letter pleading for leniency for Cribbin, the former
mayor said he was assured by an ``impeccable source'' that the Taco
Bell violence was not gang-related. Farley later said the source
was his teenage son.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that steroids may have been the catalyst for the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're muscle-bound goofballs you don't want at your party
because they fight,'' Farley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has been monstrously blown out of proportion. I've
known the Cribbin family for years; they're good people, and I'm
proud to call them my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert police gang Detective Terry Burchett said in a
presentence report that she believes Cribbin is one of the town's
main gang players. But, Burchett said, building cases is hard
because victims are too scared to come forward for fear of
retribution.
</P>
<P>
   One victim has been threatened through phone calls and
vandalism, and his mother asked that the family not be identified
because of the threats.
</P>
<P>
   Zettler, the deputy county attorney, said the harassment has
included veiled messages that harken to the Taco Bell case, taco
wrappers littered one man's front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Gilbert and Mesa say they are cooperating in an
ongoing investigation of the White supremacist gang.
</P>
<P>
   They confirmed that police seized a photograph from one youth's
home that depicts a group photograph of gang members flashing their
hand signs on a Gilbert high school campus. &QL;

FIRST LADY IN KANSAS CITY FOR FUND-RAISER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ First lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton was expected to pull $100,000 out of Kansas City on
Friday to bolster her campaign for the U.S. Senate from New York
and for Democratic Senate candidates nationwide.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton attended two private events: one at the home of Kansas
City jeweler Harold Tivol, and another at the home of Democratic
backer Farhad Azima.
</P>
<P>
   The Tivol event cost $1,000 a person. The Azima event, which
included dinner with Clinton, was $5,000 a couple.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was expected to raise $100,000 in Kansas City, said
David DiMartino, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee. Proceeds were to go to a fund called ``New York Victory
2000'' that benefits Clinton's campaign and the senatorial campaign
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Among those attending the event at the Tivols were Mayor Kay
Barnes, former Mayor Emanuel Cleaver and U.S. Rep. Dennis Moore of
Lenexa, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Cleaver described Clinton's talk as ``very eloquent''
and said it was important to send her to the Senate. ``Anytime we
have a chance to put somebody into the column of compassion and

   The Kansas City events, including her arrival at Downtown
Airport, were closed to reporters.

   ``I've known both of them,'' Azima said, referring to the
president and his wife. ``I've supported both of them. They are
friends. I'm delighted to be able to do whatever I need to do to
help her in her campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Azima, an aviation executive, was caught up briefly in the
troubles around Democratic fund raising for the 1996 elections. The
Democratic National Committee announced it would return more than
$140,000 of his contributions, but changed its mind and apologized
to Azima after discounting questions of impropriety.

DIVIDED COUNCIL APPROVES ARMS INSPECTION SYSTEM FOR IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (REWRITES 18th graf to update, clarify) 
 (th) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A divided Security Council voted Friday to
create a new arms inspection system for Iraq with the promise to
President Saddam Hussein that sanctions against his country could
be suspended within a year and eventually lifted if he cooperates.
</P>
<P>
   The plan immediately removes the ceiling on the amount of oil
Iraq may sell abroad _ now set at $5.26 billion every six months _
to buy food and necessary goods for a population struggling under
economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   It also relaxes some controls on Iraq's import of medical,
agricultural and educational supplies, though the sanctions _
including a ban on international flights except for pilgrimages to
Mecca _ formally remain in place.
</P>
<P>
   An arduous process of persuading Iraq to respond to these
incentives to cooperate with the arms inspection plan will now
begin.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's envoy at the United Nations, Saeed Hassan, restated his
government's earlier rejection of the resolution. Iraq had already
insisted it would not permit any U.N. inspectors back into Iraq and
demanded that the sanctions _ which under terms ending the 1991
Persian Gulf war are to remain in place until Iraq proves it has
eliminated weapons of mass destruction _ be unconditionally halted.
Iraq has barred inspectors since last December after American and
British warplanes struck Baghdad for not cooperating with the
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the 15-member Security Council was 11 in favor with
four abstentions. At the decisive moment, France broke ranks with
the United States and the European Union and abstained along with
Russia, China and Malaysia, which holds a nonpermanent Security
Council seat.
</P>
<P>
   With only two of the five permanent council members voting in
favor, some diplomats predicted that Iraq will be emboldened in its
resistance to the plan. The two permament members who voted for it,
Britain and the United States, are portrayed in Iraq as the
country's worst enemies, and they now appear isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burleigh, the departing American deputy chief
representative, who has negotiated the Iraqi issue for the United
States here for more than a year, called the vote ``a profoundly
important moment for the Security Council'' and added that what is
now required of Iraq ``could not be more clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, he said, will be required to allow weapons inspectors to
return, to maximize benefits for the Iraqi people from its earnings
and to cooperate in the accounting for Kuwaitis missing since the
1990 invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vote today was not unanimous,'' Burleigh told the council,
``but no member asserts that Iraq has met its obligations under the
council's resolutions. No council member argues that Iraq has
disarmed as required.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy Greenstock of Britain, president of the council for
December and the sponsor of Friday's resolution, called its
adoption ``an exceptional achievement'' in linking relief for
Iraqis living under sanctions with assigned disarmament tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret,'' he said, ``that on this point, some have been
more inclined to listen to the voice of the Iraqi leadership than
the needs of the Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   British and American diplomats played down the abstentions,
saying that the important fact was that no nation voted against the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of arms control experts said that whether or not
Iraq eventually agrees to the stationing of inspectors and the
installation of sophisticated monitoring devices, the damage is
already done as far as close surveillance of Iraq is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   To arms control experts, the mystery is why the Clinton
administration agreed to these more lenient provisions, or how
American officials allowed themselves to be drawn into compromises
that in the end did not deliver a united Security Council. Many
believe that compromise was pointless, given strong Russian and
Chinese opposition to sanctions and France's unwillingness to
jeopardize its commercial and diplomatic relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Gambia's representative, Baboucar-laise Jagne, reflecting on
more than a year of debate on how to deal with Iraq since the last
inspectors left a year ago, called the resolution ``the lowest
common denominator.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a sense among many diplomats and officials here
that the Clinton Administration does not L want Iraq to resurface
as a crisis that might intrude in next fall's elec- tion. Even if
Iraq accepted the plan, it is unlikely that sanctions could be
suspended before late next year, giv- en the timetable set up under
the resolution.
 &UR;  &LR;  Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms
Control in Washington, said in an interview that under the new plan
``a much greater amount of equipment is going to go to Iraq without
anybody looking at it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know already that the Iraqis have abused the medical
exception to import things that can be used to make nuclear
weapons,'' he said. ``Under the new system there is going to be
this whole category of things that don't have to be individually
approved. If the past is any guide, you have to assume that a lot
of those things will be useful for making weapons, and nobody will
be the wiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Milhollin, who reported recently in The New Yorker about an
Iraqi order last year for half a dozen lithotripters, said that
this was an example of how Baghdad may be trying to hide purchases
intended for building weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The lithotripters, sophisticated machines for pulverizing kidney
stones, require electronic switches that produce a high-power burst
of electricity _ enough to trigger a nuclear bomb if 32 of them are
used, Milhollin said. In buying the lithotripters, Iraq tried to
get 120 extra switches from Siemens, the German electronics
company, which turned over the order to a supplier, the Thomson-CSF
company of France, at which point the French government stepped in
and barred the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The case suggests that the French are aware of Iraq's continuing
efforts to assemble the components of nuclear weapons. Moreover,
Iraq is blocking routine inspections of its low-enriched uranium
and natural uranium stocks by the International Atomic Energy
Agency, raising speculation about what it may be trying to hide.
Yet President Jacques Chirac of France said in an interview this
week that nuclear weapons are no longer an issue in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An informal discussion paper put together by the experts at
UNSCOM _ the U.N. Special Commission that was created after the
Persian Gulf war to disarm Iraq and dismantle industries that could
rebuild biological, chemical and missile systems _ said that there
should be cause for alarm also in a Security Council decision to
remove from Friday's resolution an earlier provision calling for
the new monitoring system to include UNSCOM inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Without some institutional memory to augment the archives that
the new commission will inherit, experts say, inspectors may not
know what questions must be asked of Iraq, especially on biological
and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM inspectors also complain that the new resolution turns
the burden of proof upside down. Where Iraq had formerly been
expected to set out the tasks it would accomplish _ like accounting
for certain materials or equipment _ which could be accepted or
rejected by UNSCOM, the new system calls for the tasks to be
assigned by inspectors. That allows Iraq to meet only those
requirements, while concealing other activities outside the purview
of the list.
</P>
<P>
   Like Milhollin and other independent arms control experts,
UNSCOM inspectors fear that blanket permission to import certain
relief goods will inevitably be used by the Iraqis to buy equipment
or material usable in making arms. A lifting of controls over spare
parts used in the oil industry could also allow what experts call
``dual use'' items suitable for civilian or military projects to
flow relatively easily into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At the Nuclear Control Institute in Washington, Paul L.
Leventhal, president of the independent organization, said that
once in the country, clandestine equipment for a range of tasks
including enriching uranium for use in bombs, could be hidden in
what look like ordinary factories.
</P>
<P>
   International experts who follow Iraq in a number of agencies
and private institutes believe that Iraq's Military Industrial
Commission has reassembled some manufacturing processes critical to
making a range of prohibited weapons. Scientists and researchers
who built Iraqi weapons before 1991 are also available to the Iraqi
government, some of them held as virtual hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution passed Friday creates a new organization to be
called the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission.
It will have an executive chairman to be appointed within 30 days
by Secretary-General Kofi Annan and approved by the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new resolution, a ``college of commissioners'' will be
created to review the work of the new monitoring system. Within the
first 45 days on the job, the executive chairman must submit an
organizational plan for the staffing and administration of the
commission and its work in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Not later than 60 days after inspectors from the new commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency have started working in
Iraq, the commission is to draw up a work program, listing tasks to
be accomplished by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution says that what is required of Iraq ``shall be
clearly defined and precise.'' It is this provision that concerns
arms control experts who say it leaves inspectors little room to
maneuver if they see something unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Once the monitoring systems have been working for 120 days with
Iraqi cooperation, sanctions on Iraq can be suspended for renewable
periods of 120 days. Financial controls and import surveillance
except on newly excluded items will continue. The existing ``oil
for food'' program, which has allowed Iraq to sell oil to buy
civilian goods, will be folded into the new resolution.

FROM 1999, SOME WORDS FROM OTHERS TO PONDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In a world awash with
balderdash, those who speak words of wisdom deserve their due.
Here, for your pondering pleasure, are some of 1999's most
insightful observations:
<TEXT>
<P>
   - The hallmark of the 1999 stock market is the devaluation of
knowledge. What is there to know? The stock market is going up;
ergo, buy stocks. Small wonder that what passes for financial
analysis...more and more tastes like brain candy. Knowing that,
people ought to eat less of it. (Jeremy Diamond, financial
publisher)
</P>
<P>
   - As we excitedly enter upon the Information Age, we would do
well to recall T.S. Eliot's lament: Where is the wisdom we have
lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in
information? (Herbert Stein, economist)
</P>
<P>
   - (Peter) Drucker teaches us that organizations perform only
when their purpose is clearly defined and that profit is not a
purpose, but a result....Profits are important because they tell
you whether your theory (of business) is working. (Joan Magretta
and Nan Stone, in The Wall Street Journal)
</P>
<P>
   - Historically, political unification has always preceded
monetary unification. (The euro) is a shot in the dark. Europe is
like someone who first buys a computer and then asks, ``What do I
do with it?'' (Antonio Martino, former Italian foreign minister)
</P>
<P>
   - I have begun to feel foolish being a fan. I feel foolish
giving allegiance to any team made up of players whose loyalty to
the team is patently a good deal less than my own. (Joseph Epstein,
writer)
</P>
<P>
   - Tolerance is amoral: It needs to be morally directed or one
can never know what should be tolerated and what should not be
tolerated....If we continue to teach about tolerance and
intolerance instead of teaching about good and evil, we will end up
with tolerance of evil. (Dennis Prager, writer)
</P>
<P>
   - As risk hyperbolists (chip) away at our country's
technological arsenal _ pesticide, food additives, pharmaceuticals,
industrial chemicals _ they threaten our enviable high standards of
living while offering no health benefits in return. (Elizabeth
Whelan, science advocate)
</P>
<P>
   - The leaders of this new neo-earnestness use the same weapon
earnest people have always used, their ability to bore the rest of
us into submission. (David Brooks, writer)
</P>
<P>
   - Mr. Reagan is like a political North Star: Candidates define
themselves in comparison to him. (Gerald F. Seib, The Wall Street
Journal)
</P>
<P>
   - Never in the course of human history have so many of us
depended on so many other humans not to screw up. (Ed Yardeni,
economist, on lack of Y2K concern)
</P>
<P>
   - In our era, the wealth of nations lies in their human
resources....A debilitated, unhealthy Russia is unlikely to be
capable of maintaining a highly productive economic system.
(Nicholas Eberstadt, economic analyst)
</P>
<P>
   - To congratulate one's self on one's warm commitment to the
environment, or to peace, or to the oppressed, and think no more is
a profound moral fault. (Robert Conquest, historian)
</P>
<P>
   - The idea that you can take smart but inexperienced
25-year-olds who have never managed anything or anybody and turn
them into effective managers via two years of classroom training is
ludicrous. (Henry Mintzberg, business school professor)

SUN FLARES UNLIKELY TO ADD TO Y2K CONFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES and FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Cross one more thing
off your Y2K worry list.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunspots probably won't knock out satellites or interfere with
radio or television broadcasts over the New Year's weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The worst of a massive solar storm that had been expected to
heat up late this year won't occur until long after Jan. 1,
scientists now believe. Scientists and Y2K watchers had been
concerned that the storm might be at its worst right around Jan. 1,
compounding any Y2K problems that occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not likely at this point,'' said Gary Heckman, senior
forecaster at the Space Environment Center in Boulder, Colo.
``They're more likely to appear later in the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Space Environment Center, part of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, tracks solar disturbances. Solar
radiation storms, commonly known as sunspots, occur in cycles 11
years apart.
</P>
<P>
   The last cycle, which peaked in March 1989, knocked out the
electrical grid that serves the Canadian province of Quebec for
nine hours and disrupted some radio and television broadcasts. In a
two-week period, NOAA received thousands of calls about problems,
Heckman said.
</P>
<P>
   The current solar storm cycle had been expected to be among the
two or three strongest on record.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, there hasn't been as much activity as the last one,''
Heckman said. ``My opinion is that we're going to get hit with some
major storms, but not until later on.''
</P>
<P>
   The current storm cycle will continue until the Year 2002.
 &LR; brk:Mouths of babes
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three out of four school-age children say adults have
overreacted to Y2K and the potential for computer problems,
according to a recent poll by Junior Achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found students are overwhelmingly upbeat about the
future.
</P>
<P>
   About 72 percent of the children polled say adults have gone off
the deep end about Y2K, according to the survey, which polled 1,449
children ages 8 to 18. It was conducted during the first week of
December.
</P>
<P>
   Older students, the survey showed, are more likely to think mom
and dad have been making too big a deal of Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds correctly identified the bug as a computer's
inability to recognize the year 2000, while 36 percent think it is
either a computer virus, the newest Pokemon character, a
genetically engineered insect or a seasonal flu.
</P>
<P>
   One in four think their Nintendo 64 or Playstation will be on
the fritz.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:Clinton: Job done
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the White House has launched a campaign to
convince us technology fails all the time, even without Y2K,
President Clinton is boasting that the federal government's mission
critical systems are 99.9 percent Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said this week that only 16 of 6,159 mission critical
systems are not ready for the Year 2000, but would be by Jan. 1.
Six systems will be replaced and 10 will be repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Problems were found at the departments of defense and justice,
including glitches with M1A2 tanks and programs at the FBI's
foreign offices. The total federal pricetag for Y2K fixes: $8.38
billion, $37 million more than the estimate given in September.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pushed small businesses and local governments to make
every effort to fix as many computer systems as possible before
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:Bank on it
</P>
<P>
   Every federally insured bank and savings and loan _ all 10,200
of them _ have now met stringent Y2K challenges set by federal
regulators, say both the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The last bank in the country to do so, a small unidentified
thrift in Jacksonville, Fla., met its Y2K requirements on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That satisfies the feds. And to satisfy customers, yet another
Kansas City area bank is planning to open its doors Saturday, Jan.
1.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Blue Valley's main office will be open from 11 a.m.
to 3 p.m. to give customers an added measure of assurance that
their money is safe, said Bob Regnier, president of the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have expressed a concern about what will happen to
their bank accounts as we enter Y2K,'' Regnier said. ``By staying
open, we will prove to our customers that their accounts are
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, First National Bank of Olathe said it will be open from
9 a.m. to noon Jan. 1.  &LR; brk:Y2K blast
</P>
<P>
   Those who fear that panic could be the biggest danger poised by
the Y2K computer bug need look no further than Benton Township,
Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Resident Alonzo Anderson had a brush with death Dec. 10 when
leaking gas from one of several 120-pound propane tanks exploded,
pushing out sections of his cement-block structure and bowing his
walls. He had been stockpiling propane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he survived,'' said Lt. Ken Doroh of the
Benton Township Fire Department. Anderson's hair was singed and his
cheek was burned, but he had no other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Afraid of what might happen Jan. 1, the homeowner told
firefighters he was storing large amounts of propane in case the
utilities failed.  &LR; brk:Hackers, have mercy
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual plea for mercy, government Y2K Czar John Koskinen
has asked computer hackers to give him a week to sort through
potential computer problems before launching any cyber strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Some hackers view piercing computer networks to be a great
public service because it exposes cracks in security, Koskinen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully those people will recognize we're going to have
enough things going on that weekend that this will not be a
particularly good weekend to demonstrate the need for more
information security,'' Koskinen said. ``If you want to, in fact,
make those points, my hope is you'll make them the following
weekend.''

INVESTOR GROUP AIMS TO BID FOR FLAMINGO HILTON CASINO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _An investor group led
by casino operators William Grace and Joseph J. Canfora is still
interested in buying the Flamingo Hilton Casino in Kansas City. The
group will make a bid now that Station Casinos Inc. has pulled its
$22.5 million offer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grace said Friday _ the day after it was announced the Station
offer was off _ that his group would soon get in touch with Hilton
Hotels Inc. and the Missouri Gaming Commission about its intents.
He said it was premature to disclose any information about what the
group's bid might entail.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Canfora said the group was prepared to pay more
than the $22.5 million Station bid.
</P>
<P>
   Grace, principal owner of the St. Jo Frontier Casino and The
Woodlands racetrack, is president and chief executive of W.M. Grace
Cos. He said W.M. Grace Cos., which recently had its gaming license
renewed by Missouri, would hold the license for the Flamingo if the
group were to acquire it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are a logical purchaser, since we are here and
already licensed,'' said Grace. ``That would make it easy for the
Gaming Commission.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had heard there was another party within the industry
that was interested in bidding on the Flamingo, but he had not
heard who.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Park Place Entertainment, which is selling the
casino for Hilton, were unavailable for comment, as were commission
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Park Place was created when Hilton spun off most of its gambling
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Canfora, who recently became president of Horseshoe Gaming, was
the first general manager of Station Casino. Executives who worked
with Canfora at Empress Entertainment, where Canfora previously was
president, would be investors, as would five local investors.
</P>
<P>
   They are Georgia Buchanan, president of All Pro Construction
Inc. and widow of Kansas City Chiefs player Buck Buchanan; Roger
Cohen, co-executive chairman of Cohen-Esrey Real Estate Services;
Rafael Garcia, president and chief executive of Rafael Architects
Inc.; Mary Jane Kelly, president of J.P. Kelly Properties and a
Northland political activist; and Tula Turner Thompson, president
of Supreme Insulation Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Station, based in Las Vegas, owns two casino boats in Kansas
City, which hold the largest share of the market. Its bid for the
Flamingo apparently had been held up by an investigation into a
substantial payment it made to a St. Louis lawyer, Michael
Lazaroff, after gaining its license for its Kansas City casino in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Station said in an announcment that its deal with Hilton had
required it to close the transaction by Friday, and that an
extension could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   The payment to Lazaroff came to light during an audit of
Station's books as part of its bid for the Flamingo. Station had
denied doing anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaroff has declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second deal for the Hilton Flamingo to fall apart.
Earlier this year, Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino Resorts withdrew a $15
million offer. There were indications that the commission would not
approve that sale over concerns about the strength of Trump Hotels'
finances.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton put the Flamingo on the block after it ran into problems
with the commission over accusations that it had funneled $250,000
to Elbert Anderson, chairman of the Kansas City Port Authority in
1993 when the agency selected Hilton to build on city property.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton last year paid the federal government about $650,000 to
avoid criminal prosecution over the allegations. A former Hilton
senior vice president faces charges related to the case. Anderson
is serving a two-year sentence after being convicted of separate
charges relating to bribing public officials to steer public money
to his companies.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal put Hilton to the brink of being fined, suspended or
stripped of its Missouri gaming license.

   SEATTLE _ Terrorism experts in the United States and Canada
scrambled Friday night to determine whether a cache of powerful
explosives and the Algerian who carried them to an isolated Olympic
Peninsula port are part of a larger plot to bomb American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Ressam, 32, was in federal custody Friday, facing
explosives and immigration charges. Ressam was arrested in Port
Angeles, Wash., after he drove off a ferry from Victoria, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   He had reserved a room at a Seattle hotel near the landmark
Space Needle, but intended to stay in the United States only a day
before flying to London.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement sources could not identify possible bombing
targets Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities apparently are searching for a second man who was
with Ressam for several weeks in Vancouver, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Agents, in a stroke of luck, arrested Ressam in Port Angeles on
Tuesday night and found in his rented car liquid nitroglycerin and
118 pounds of urea, a component of fertilizers and explosives that
was used in the February 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're definitely going to take a building out with this
stuff,'' a military explosives expert told the Post-Intelligencer
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Urea produces a slow explosion said to be ideal for destroying
concrete structures, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive Ressam made an appearance in federal court in
Seattle on Friday under high security. He was charged with bringing
nitroglycerine into the United States from Canada and with making
false statements to U.S. Customs Service inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   During proceedings that were translated into Arabic, Federal
Magistrate David Wilson ordered Ressam to appear Wednesday for a
detention and preliminary hearing. He will be in federal custody
until then.
</P>
<P>
   Security was so tight at the courthouse that anyone entering _
even employees _ had to produce photo identification. U.S. marshals
blocked the door to Wilson's courtroom and armed officers patrolled
the streets as Ressam was brought to the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The case began as a Customs investigation that ultimately
brought in the Border Patrol and the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms. By Friday, the FBI and CIA had taken over.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam first entered the United States on Feb. 7, when he flew
to Los Angeles from Seoul. He showed up again this fall on a flight
from Quebec to British Columbia, where he lived in a motel 15
minutes from downtown Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   He and a second man checked into the 65-unit 2400 Motel in East
Vancouver in late November, stayed about three weeks, and checked
out one day last week, said a desk clerk who identified herself
only as Joanne.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police questioned motel workers
Wednesday about Ressam and the man who checked in and out with him,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Both were clean-shaven, slender and spoke English with what
seemed to be a French accent. ``There was just nothing about them,
no distinguishing marks or anything, that stands out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam rented a car in Canada and crossed into the United States
on Tuesday aboard the Coho, a privately run ferry between Victoria
and Port Angeles. His rented Chrysler was the last auto on the
ferry.
</P>
<P>
   He became so nervous that his hands reportedly shook when
Customs inspectors questioned him upon arrival in Port Angeles.
Inspectors were curious because he was headed for Seattle and had
taken an out-of-the-way route to get there.
</P>
<P>
   He had a passport, Quebec driver's license and several credit
cards in the name of Benni Noris and a second Quebec driver's
license in the name of Mario Roig, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Customs inspectors searched the trunk of his car and found in
the spare-tire well 10 plastic bags of a fine white powder, two
plastic bags of a crystalline powder and two 22-ounce jars that
were three-quarters full of a yellowish liquid, according to court
documents. A federal agent also said the liquid contained sawdust,
which is sometimes used to pack nitroglycerine.
</P>
<P>
   They also found four black boxes, each containing a circuit
board, digital watch and 9-volt battery connector.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam fled when the material was discovered. He ran up to the
door of a passing car but the woman driver sped off and Customs
inspectors tackled Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington State Patrol laboratory identified the fine white
powder as urea, the liquid as nitroglycerine and the crystalline
powder as a sulfate used to absorb water. The laboratory in Tacoma,
Wash., described the tested samples of nitroglycerine as extremely
volatile and explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Wilson ordered the remainder of the liquid to be
destroyed despite objections from Ressam's federal public defender
that the defense had not been able to test it.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies throughout the nation have been warned
about possible terrorism attacks as 2000 approaches. The federal
government has included Algeria as a possible source of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   However, law enforcement officials said the arrest in Port
Angeles was the result of good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was essentially a cold hit, so we're starting at ground
zero,'' said a federal law enforcement source. ``We're looking for
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   A local law enforcement source called it ``pretty scary'' that
the suspect and bomb materials surfaced by chance.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are looking for links to any known
associates in Seattle or groups the suspect might be connected to,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam had reservations at the Best Western Loyal Inn near
Seattle Center for Tuesday night. On New Year's Eve, thousands of
people are expected at a celebration at the nearby Space Needle.
</P>
<P>
   Local law enforcement sources said Friday that federal agents
have warned them that such large structures and public gathering
places could be targets for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   After learning of Ressam's arrest, Seattle Center officials
stepped up security Friday, and announced they would put gated
fences around the campus for the millennium celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to feel safe,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam apparently had no plans to be in Seattle for the New
Year.
</P>
<P>
   He made the reservations Tuesday for only one night, the motel
manager said. He had plane tickets under another name to fly
Wednesday from Seattle to New York, then London, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Agents said Ressam also had maps and travel guides in his car
for Washington, Oregon and California.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Cannistraro, former chief of counterterrorism at the
CIA, said the purpose of bringing the explosives into the United
State was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an operation to blow something up. It's hard to see
what else it could be,'' said Cannistraro, now a security
consultant in McLean, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents said Ressam was wanted in Canada under an
immigration warrant and for theft under $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, NBC and CNN reported Friday night that Ressam may have ties
to Osama bin Laden, accused of heading and funding a terrorist
campaign against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But no one could link Ressam directly to any terrorist
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal, where an apartment was rented under one of the names
Ressam used, has a large Algerian population. Earlier this week,
Montreal police warned citizens that Algerians were extorting money
in that city and using the proceeds to fund the activities of
extremists. Eleven men accused of operating a theft ring to raise
money for Algerian extremists are awaiting trial in the Quebec
city.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night in Montreal, officers evacuated a downtown block
that included the apartment building that was given as the address
for Benni A. Noris, according to the Montreal Gazette. The bomb
squad from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police found no explosives.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, agents described Ressam, who spoke
primarily in French, as uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Cannistraro, the former CIA official, suggested that Ressam may
have been a courier, rather than a ``professional.''
</P>
<P>
   The question authorities are now trying to answer is whether
``there is an infrastructure in place'' in the United States that
is behind this or ``is he the vanguard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cannistraro noted that bin Laden's training camps in Afghanistan
have included Algerians. Bin Laden, an exiled Saudi militant, has
been indicted for conspiracy and murder in U.S. embassy bombings in
1998 in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Friday in Jordan, police were questioning a man linked to bin
Laden and suspected of leading a group planning terror attacks on
tourist sites and U.S. targets in that country during millennium
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The man, identified by the Jordanians as Khalil Deek, was
extradited from Pakistan on Thursday, two days after he was
apprehended in his home in Peshawar on that country's border with
Afghanistan, a Jordanian official said.
</P>
<P>
   The extradition brings to 14 the number of people detained this
week in Jordan and said to be affiliated with bin Laden. Detained
are 12 Jordanians, one Iraqi and one Algerian.
</P>
<P>
   Two more suspects remain at large outside Jordan, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   NASHUA, N.H. _ Sen. Frank Lautenberg, a three-term Democrat from
New Jersey, announced Friday his endorsement of Vice President Al
Gore over his state's favorite son, former Sen. Bill Bradley, for
the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg, who served alongside Bradley in the Senate for 14
years, flew here Friday afternoon to make the announcement to
reporters prior to a debate between Gore and Bradley at a college
here.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey senator, who will retire from Congress at the end
of next year, said he had made up his mind to support Gore a year
ago, when Bradley had not declared his intention to run. But he
said Friday that even if he had known Bradley was going to run, he
would have endorsed the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience of Al Gore was the deciding factor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign tried to play down the announcement, saying
that Lautenberg told people months ago that he was supporting Gore.
But the Gore campaign said it had not made a formal announcement of
the endorsement until Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Friday the Bradley campaign an- nounced that it had picked up
the endorsement of Archibald Cox, the former Watergate special
prosecu- tor and chairman of Common Cause, the nonpartisan govern-
ment watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   While the Gore camp touted the Lautenberg endorsement as an
important coup that would perhaps be embarrassing for Bradley,
Lautenberg had many kind words for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both are men of integrity, both are honest men,'' Lautenberg
said of the rivals. ``You couldn't get me to say anything bad about
Bill Bradley.'' He added that if Bradley wins the nomination, he
will support him in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg's comments about Bradley are in contrast to those of
some other New Jersey Democrats, including Rep. Robert Menendez of
Union City, who have criticized Bradley for being aloof and
unhelpful to local politicians while a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg was also known to occasionally clash with Bradley,
and many New Jersey Democrats say he privately resented Bradley's
celebrity when he was doing much of the work of delivering federal
funds for the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Lautenberg said Bradley had been helpful to him
during his early years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And he fondly recalled that Bradley had refused to appear at
Lautenberg's victory party in his first election, out of concern
that he would draw the limelight from Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You've worked too hard for this,''' Lautenberg said.
``I was struck by that.''

DUCKS OVERCOME STICKY SITUATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg said the two illegal-stick
penalties called in Wednesday's game in Colorado actually motivated
his team.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim had been dominating play before Teemu Selanne and
Dominic Roussel were caught with illegal sticks just over a minute
apart midway through the third period. The Avalanche pulled within
3-2 with a goal on the two-man advantage, but the Ducks killed off
the balance of Roussel's penalty and Selanne got revenge by scoring
a goal to put the game on ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly got the guys on the bench excited,'' Hartsburg
said of the calls. ``They got fired up, Teemu responded, and got a
huge two points.''
</P>
<P>
   Illegal sticks, Part II: Hartsburg said he was a member of a
Canadian team at the World Championships that caught a Russian team
with illegal sticks three times in one period, but the coach said
he couldn't recall ever seeing two such calls so close together in
the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Part III: Roussel said he hasn't been checking his sticks and
was shocked when one of his was found to be a quarter-inch too
thick at the tip.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie sticks have no curve limitations, so Roussel said there
was no way Colorado coach Bob Hartley could detect an illegal stick
from the bench. The Anaheim backup goalie wonders if there was some
snooping going on at the Pepsi Center, where a door connects the
two locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's taking a pretty big risk,'' said Roussel of asking for
the measurements. ``Unless you are sure, they are really lucky
guesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Roussel said he was just glad the Ducks held on for the win and
that ``it was a good lesson'' for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sticks are) something we all have to check.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I could check every stick, but I trust our players,''
Hartsburg said. ``Every team has guys with illegal sticks, but we
have to be smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: Defenseman Pavel Trnka missed his fourth consecutive game
with a groin strain. He did take part in Friday's morning skate and
hasn't been ruled out of Sunday's game against Detroit. . . .
Center Antti Aalto missed his fifth consecutive game with a
strained left elbow and is not expected to play again until after
New Year's. . . . Defenseman Fredrik Olausson is still not 100
percent after a bout with the flu. He was again replaced by Kevin
Haller, who had missed 12 games with a knee injury before returning
to action Wednesday.

<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Displaying a calm persistence and aggressiveness,
former Sen. Bill Bradley tried to poke holes Friday night in Vice
President Al Gore's health care, education and gun control
proposals in their second televised encounter. Gore, in turn,
questioned his rival's own commitment to education, health care and
managing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two months after their first debate, when he declined to
engage Gore, Bradley tried a strikingly different approach in their
90-minute encounter at Daniel Webster College here, which was
televised Friday on the ABC News program ``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in his usual low voice, Bradley again and again
badgered Gore with a refrain that his health care plan would extend
insurance to all Americans while Gore's would not: ``Who will you
leave out?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't leave out anyone,'' Gore replied at one point. But
Bradley would not stop asking the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one,'' the vice president said once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley homed in on health care, Gore scolded his opponent
as lacking a comprehensive education plan and for supporting a
school voucher program when he was in the Senate. This week, Gore
unveiled an education plan that would spend $115 billion over 10
years to increase teacher salaries and improve public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single time vouchers came up in the Senate, Bill, for 18
years, you voted for them,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley defended his education proposals, saying: ``If your
staff had checked the proposals I've made, they would have found
that there's an education component of almost each one of the
proposals. The difference is, I view education as integrated into
the lives of people where they're living their lives, not as a
program that comes from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Ted Koppel, the moderator, cut in as both men
tried to talk over one another on health care. ``Hold it. Hold
it,'' he said. ``Hold it just one second gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You made a mistake, Al,'' Bradley interjected. ``You asked
another question.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a mistake at all,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such clashes, the rivals for the Democratic presidential
nomination agreed more than they disagreed. In fact, they agreed so
much _ on everything from maintaining an even-handed relationship
with China and Taiwan to calling on the entertainment industry to
better police itself to advocating gay rights _ that the moderator,
Ted Koppel, noted at the close that their differences did not seem
significant. He asked them to contrast their leadership styles.
</P>
<P>
   The political terrain has changed significantly since Gore and
Bradley's first debate. As Bradley moved up in the polls here in
the state that holds the first primary on Feb. 1, Gore has
repeatedly, and aggressively, attacked his programs. Bradley did
not begin fighting back until about two weeks ago. But his climb in
the polls has stopped and the two men are in a dead-heat in this
state, according to several surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's assertiveness Friday night seemed intended to respond
to criticism that his campaign was too passive.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore was less combative than in the first debate, he was
still far more aggressive than Bradley. More than once, he cut off
Bradley in mid sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in both camps had predicted far more fireworks
Friday night because of an open format in which an audience of
local residents and Koppel could ask questions _ and the contenders
could quiz each other. The only requirement was that the candidates
had to sit on their stools and could not roam around the stage (as
Gore did last time.)
</P>
<P>
   There were barbed comments, however, such as when Bradley sought
to portray his agenda as more sweeping on gun control. ``I'm the
only candidate in this race who's called for mandatory licensing
and registration and of all handguns in this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The evening became particularly heated when the questions turned
to health care, the major point of contention between the two
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do to get his proposal to expand health care
coverage to more Americans through a Republican-controlled
Congress, Gore instead talked about how his plan could be paid for
without raising taxes or jeopardizing other entitlement programs,
like Medicare, the government health care program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has frequently asserted that Bradley's more expensive
health care plan might require raising taxes and would leave none
of the federal surplus for other programs, including for Medicare.
The vice president then asked Bradley what he would do to bolster
Medicare as the number of senior citizens rises sharply over the
next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than answer Gore's question, Bradley threw a question
back. Bradley asserted that his health care plan would extend
health insurance to almost all Americans, while Gore's would not.
``Who will you leave out,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't leave out anyone,'' Gore said as the two men proceeded
to talk over each other.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gore focused on another part of Bradley's health care plan
that he has frequently criticized in recent weeks: his proposal to
replace Medicaid, the government health care program for the poor,
with subsidized private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also used his remarks on health care to tout his role in
the Clinton administration's management of the strong economy,
saying that protecting Medicare and Social Security would keep the
nation strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our achievements of the last six and a half years has
been to have a strong economy,'' the vice president said. ``And
that has been to get the big questions right,'' including
protecting Medicare. ``Bill does not set aside a penny'' for
bolstering Medicare, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley responded by saying he considered Medicare ``the most
important government program on health care that we now have'' but
said that it was not yet essential to set aside to bolster the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, there were no direct mentions of President Clinton
during the entire debate. And neither contender mentioned the
Republican front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidates did respond to a question about how Bush and
two other candidates mentioned Christ when they were asked about
their favorite philosopher-thinkers in a Republican debate this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he considered religion a personal subject that he
did not want to discuss. But Gore said, ``I affirm my faith when
I'm asked about it.'' He added that ``atheists have just as much of
a right to the public discourse as any _ as people of any religious
faith in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he did not cite Clinton, Gore seized on a question on
terrorism to embrace a Republican presidential candidate, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona. On Thursday, Bradley made a joint appearance in
New Hampshire with McCain to call for overhauling the campaign
finance system. Polls show McCain is very popular among independent
voters in New Hampshire, a group that Bradley is also trying to
court.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Gore would do to fight terrorism, he noted that he
had sponsored with McCain a bill to control nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The forum began with Koppel asking both about their wives and
what sort of first ladies they would be. Gore responded that his
wife, Tipper, would be active in the role and pointed out how she
had ``worked hard on the issue of health care'' and had a graduate
degree in psychology. He also said Mrs. Gore ``spends a lot of time
on the plight of the homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about his wife, Ernestine, Bradley said, ``In this case
people will find Ernestine a unique human being; she would be the
first immigrant first lady, having been born in Germany.'' He
added: ``She's real; she's dynamic. She will chart her way.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first questions from the audience involved the issue
of drug use and the questions about whether Bush had or had not
used cocaine. Bradley openly acknowledged that he has smoked
marijuana in the past, and pointed out that Gore had made a similar
acknowledgment, but said, ``I think people have an understanding of
the nuances of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates also spoke forcefully about the responsibility
of the news media and the entertainment industry in policing the
amount of violence and sex that young people can see. Bradley
recalled the high school seminars he gave in New Jersey and
mentioned how he once asked the students if they had seen someone
killed. Bradley said that two youths said that they had and then he
offered a graphic description of someone being shot in the head.
Speaking of one student, Bradley said, ``Then he said, `You know
senator, it was nothing like it was on TV.'''

<P>
   Gore called for ``self-restraint in the media'' and said, ``Some
kids are vulnerable to having seeds planted that bear bitter
fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats met for their first televised encounter in
Hanover, N.H., on Oct. 27. That event was notable more for what the
two agreed on than for their differences. Although Gore harshly
criticized the cost of the Bradley health care plan in the debate,
Bradley sought to stay above the fray.

   As the primary date nears, the pace of the debates will pick up
considerably. On Sunday, Gore and Bradley will appear on the NBC
News program ``Meet the Press.'' Both candidates have agreed to
five televised encounters in January.

<P>
   Despite Friday night's contentious tone, the Gore campaign
offered a nod to the holiday season. People driving on the road to
Daniel Webster College were greeted with Christmas lights that
blinked, ``Gore 2000.''

A QUESTION OF BANKING FAIRNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Banks and other lending institutions can be penalized heavily if
they deny credit to an individual on the basis of race. But in
dealing with broader patterns of discrimination, federal law makes
an irrational distinction between home mortgages and other loans.
</P>
<P>
   A helpful proposal from the Federal Reserve Board to lessen that
distinction deserves support in Congress but has run into equally
irrational opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, lenders are required to collect data on the
race and gender of people applying for mortgages but are prohibited
from collecting similar data from people applying for
small-business loans, car loans, and other credit.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed proposal would allow collection of such data only on a
voluntary basis, but it is still opposed by lenders, ostensibly on
grounds that it would be costly and might become mandatory.
Republican Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and others in Congress are
supporting the industry. Representative Ron Paul, another Texas
Republican, gathered two-dozen signatures of congressmen on a
letter warning that collecting this information ``would very likely
result in a new scheme of government-mandated, race-based lending
quotas.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the tip-off. The letter is inflamatory in that no one is
talking about quotas; even the Community Reinvestment Act regulates
mortgage lending without coming close to quotas. More to the point,
no ``scheme'' to alleviate racial or gender discrimination will be
proposed unless such bias is shown to exist.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to uncover patterns of bias is to collect the data.
The Community Reinvestment Act, passed in 1977, uprooted deep
traditions of race-based mortgage lending practices in many parts
of the country. More than rigid regulations, disclosure has led to
marked progress. The same might be true of other loans.
</P>
<P>
   America is not colorblind, not yet, not by a long shot. If
Congress continues to bar the collection of evidence that would
uncover discrimination, it is just plain blind.

BITTER PILL FOR FRENCH CHEFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans ought to be cautious about criticizing French ways.
Since New Worlders all too often find cause to complain about
French critiques of the American way of life, any carping from this
side of the pond about the Cartesian bizarreness of France might
seem a mimicry of Gallic kibitzing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, something has to be said about the treatment
accorded to French restaurants by the ``hauts fonctionaires'' who
run the government in Paris. Even the most unworldly hick from
these shores realizes that if there is one enduring glory of French
civilization, it is the traditional French restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Something truly irreplaceable is preserved in those culinary
establishments. To savor the genius of French cooking one need not
visit some precious, pricey place that has received three stars
from the Michelin guide, the little red book that is still worth
reading. In any unstarred restaurant of ``la douce France,'' the
questing diner may find a gustatory epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   So how does the state treat this national treasure? Do the
rule-makers lavish incentives and protections on these monuments of
haute cuisine?
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, the taxocrats of Paris burden the nation's
``chefs-proprietaires'' with a value-added tax of 20.6 percent on
every meal. This disincentive is added to the same high social
security charges that encourage unemployment in other businesses.
Most infuriating of all for the chefs who own their restaurants is
the injustice of paying a confiscatory 20.6 percent tax while
fast-food joints such as McDonald's pay a mere 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,500 chefs and restaurant owners who took to the streets of
Paris last fall to protest their plight could be forgiven for
believing there was an Anglo-Saxon conspiracy to ruin France's
culinary heritage in favor of American fast food.
</P>
<P>
   Every year thousands of real French restaurants close their
doors and disappear, and the truth is that Paris bureaucrats are
killing the geese that produce the golden eggs. Pretty soon, nobody
will want to visit France. Why go there when you can eat fast food
here at the mall?

IMPEACHMENT A YEAR LATER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, December 19, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year later, the impeachment of President Clinton is receding
into memory like a high fever that racked the body politic for a
while and then passed, leaving the patient fatigued.
</P>
<P>
   On this first anniversary of the House votes to impeach the
president for perjury and obstruction of justice, it seems not so
hard to foresee how future generations will regard that
impassioning melodrama. As the emotions of the peculiar moment fade
away, the recklessness of the president stands forth clearer than
ever, as does his obtuse refusal to accept advice from those who
told him, publicly as well as privately, that honesty would be his
best policy.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever recollects in tranquillity the turmoil of that time may
also recognize the excessive zealotry of congressional Republicans
who were so avid to disable Clinton that they lowered the barrier
to impeachment so Clinton's tawdry lies in a civil suit would
qualify as an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons learned from that time by the politicians aspiring
to succeed Clinton in the White House are hardly subtle. Vice
President Gore and his Democratic rival, Bill Bradley, have been
going out of their way to present themselves as candidates of sound
moral character, men who would never disgrace the office they seek
as Clinton had.
</P>
<P>
   With political symmetry, the main Republican contenders for the
presidency, Governor George W. Bush of Texas and Senator John
McCain of Arizona, have been campaigning for their party's
nomination by taking their distance from the party's congressional
leadership. The impeachment imbroglio is certainly not the only
reason for Bush and McCain to present themselves as conservatives
who are not to be confused with Richard Armey, Tom DeLay, or Trent
Lott. Nevertheless, the behavior of those legislative leaders
during the Punch and Judy show of impeachment left a legacy that
Bush and McCain wisely want to reject.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Clinton's congressional pursuers had published the
salacious narrative of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report
and after the House had voted for two articles of impeachment, only
38 percent of Americans told pollsters they favored impeachment.
Those who opposed impeachment were not indulgent toward Clinton's
irresponsible and dishonest actions. What DeLay, Armey, and the
Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee refused to accept was
that most Americans did not regard Clinton's actions as a threat to
the nation's constitutional order.
</P>
<P>
   If America was able to recover swiftly from its impeachment
fever, it was because of the good sense of citizens. They concluded
that both parties to the spat had lost the ability to distinguish
what is important from what is not.
</P>
<P>
   Chastened lawmakers early this year let the independent counsel
statute lapse largely because the voters had seen Starr abuse the
extraconstitutional powers available to his office and wanted to
make sure such abuses would not be repeated. The legislators were
doing what the people wanted them to do. They were correcting an
error the way a system of accountable self-government is supposed
to correct errors.
</P>
<P>
   Because journalists tend to present even a constitutional crisis
as a personal conflict between politicians or a saga of one
politician's mythy trials, the impeachment story was too often told
as if it were Clinton's psychodrama. It was not. It was a test of
America's political system that Clinton and Congress should never
have imposed on the public.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the psychological effect on Clinton, his brush with
impeachment had a lasting effect on his presidency. After a series
of blunders over Kosovo that he never should have made, he retained
enough power to bomb the roads, bridges, and factories of Serbia
but was never able to achieve the backing of Congress for any
further action if that had become necessary. Vestigial bitterness
over impeachment may have played a role in his bungled campaign to
get ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. He
has become the mother of lame ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Long after impeachment passions have disappeared into the mists
of history, Clinton will be remembered for prodigious gifts that
were too often squandered but also for presiding over a golden age
of peace and prosperity. Until then, the public's fatigue both with
Clinton and the congressional zealots who pursued him lingers.

STORMY WEATHER IN VENEZUELA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Monday, December 20, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The torrential floods and mudslides sweeping away shantytowns in
Caracas this week were inevitably compared to Wednesday's
overwhelming vote for a new constitution that President Hugo Chavez
sold to voters as a democratic tide to obliterate Venezuela's
corrupt political system.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, with his mixture of democracy and demagoguery, raises
crucial questions not only about the future of oil-rich Venezuela
but about other corrupt and mismanaged countries in Latin America
and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to patriotism, religious symbols, and revolutionary
rhetoric, Chavez persuaded 72 percent of voters to approve his new
constitution. Venezuelans assented to the radical revision of
institutions Chavez calls a ``peaceful revolution'' because they
were disgusted with the old order.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their country's oil wealth, four-fifths of Venezuelans
are living in poverty. Their political parties and courts had
become notoriously corrupt. The combination of poverty, egregious
inequality, and a blatantly rigged system prepared the way for
Chavez and his promises to sweep away all the old rotten
structures.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with their new constitution, Venezuelans have voted for the
possibility of an elected dictatorship. Chavez himself will be able
to run for two six-year terms. The army will be released from
civilian control and will become a base of political power, the
equivalent of a ruling party. Hundreds of new judges and new court
officers will be appointed. The old Senate will be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial test for this new order will not be political,
however, but economic. In the year since Chavez took office, there
has been a massive flight of capital from Venezuela _ nearly $4
billion. This represents a telling vote of no confidence in the
statist economic programs Chavez has tried to pursue with funds
from rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez may be able to charm voters with his invocations of Simon
Bolivar, but markets cannot be charmed by anything other than sound
fiscal and monetary policies. Sooner or later, Chavez will have to
do what it takes to reverse the flight of capital. In the meantime,
democracy is the loser.

STOCK CAR RACING SETS ITS SIGHTS ON THE NEW YORK REGION

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASCAR has the answer, and it is that stock car racing is coming
to the New York region, and the closer to the Manhattan skyline,
the better.
</P>
<P>
   The 17 million people who live in New York's vast archipelago of
city and suburb may still be contemplating the question: Are people
this far north ready for the foot-stomping,
Confederate-flag-waving, rebel-yelling, hard-charging world of
stock car racing? Will Manhattan sophisticates, Greenwich
stockbrokers, Hoboken artists and the general run of suburban
homebodies really want to jam the front-row seats to exult at the
sting from bits of tar, tire tread and unburned hydrocarbons as the
big cars go shrieking down the straightaway?
</P>
<P>
   The country's two biggest promoters of National Association for
Stock Car Auto Racing events are certain that enough people in the
New York region want to do that to justify building a $200 million
speedway somewhere in the region, most likely in New Jersey. To
them, the New York market represents a $2 billion racing industry's
final step onto the national stage as oval-track racing grows up
and away from its Southern roots, where moonshiners first developed
a taste for cars that looked showroom-normal, or ``stock,'' but
that could be souped up to outrun the revenue agents.
</P>
<P>
   Speeding through the piney woods gave way to racing on the sands
of Daytona Beach, Fla., and from there racing moved onto dozens of
oval tracks, four fast left-turns to the lap, that spread
throughout the South.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the market saturated in NASCAR's Southern birthplace
and as auto racing proves its pull at the gate and among television
viewers nationally, the promoters are building 200,000-seat
superspeedways near Kansas City and Chicago and, soon, in Denver.
But New York, the promoters say, would be the crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to build a track where we could see the New York
City skyline,'' said Jim Talley, a spokesman for the International
Speedway Corporation of Daytona, the country's biggest race
operator. ``That skyline. That would be the ultimate!''
</P>
<P>
   ISC, as it is known, last March signed no less than Donald
Trump, the real estate developer, as its partner in a search for a
New York regional site for a superspeedway, so called because it
would be able to handle the fastest cars.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Speedway Motor Sports of Charlotte, N.C., a pioneer
at packaging motor speedways with hotels, resorts and convention
centers, has been looking for a place to race around New York City
as well. ``We are committed to the region, and we've looked at
various sites in and around New York City,'' said Laurie Wilks,
Speedway Motor Sport's general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City?
</P>
<P>
   ``In, out and around New York City,'' Ms. Wilks said. ``I really
can't be more specific.''
</P>
<P>
   The very scent of high-octane gas and burning rubber in the
local air has inspired a group of South Jersey elected officials
and business people to lobby speedway promoters for a track near a
World War II airfield at Millville, in Cumberland County, below
Atlantic City. Donald DiFrancesco, president of the state Senate,
and Jack Collins, speaker of the Assembly, either one of whom could
be New Jersey's next governor when Gov. Christie Whitman's term
ends next year, have endorsed putting a track in the sandy soil of
the state's economically depressed southern reaches.
</P>
<P>
   O. Bruton Smith, chairman of Speedway Motor Sports, has visited
the state five times since 1992, officials associated with the
South Jersey effort said, and has met with Whitman and other state
officials, without reaching a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Trump, however, has already rejected the South Jersey site, as
well as a location in Suffolk County on Long Island, but local
promoters hope he will change his mind. Trump's group, ISC,
apparently favors a site closer to the New York skyline. The New
Jersey Meadowlands offers such a skyline view, and Whitman is said
to favor a site that would help the financially ailing Meadowlands
Authority, which now requires a huge annual state subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   But a modern superspeedway along with its attractions and
amenities takes about 1,000 acres of land, Talley said, and the
Meadowlands, with Giants Stadium, the Meadowlands Racetrack and
Continental Airlines Arena already on it, has only 759 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an appropriate use of the Meadowlands,'' DiFrancesco
told the New Jersey Conference of Mayors in September. The
Meadowlands Authority, after confirming earlier in the week that it
had been in contact with race promoters, has since gone mum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot comment on whether we had a meeting with NASCAR,''
said Dan Emmer, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There may be other problems to overcome before people in the
region see their first checkered flag. Speedway developers are
accustomed to large public subsidies to help build their tracks _
taxpayers contributed $146 million of the $228 cost of ISC's new
track outside Kansas City. But that level of tax support for sports
promoters is a tougher sell in both New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway supporters like Donald Fauerbach, executive director of
the New Jersey Conference of Mayors and a NASCAR racing team owner
himself, say that the state that wins a speedway would have to put
in no more than the usual access roads and sewer lines, which New
Jersey has done for Atlantic City casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, plenty of people could not care less whether NASCAR
moves north. ``I don't understand the mentality of people who pay
good money to watch those cars go around and around,'' said Eric
Mihan, a retired Princeton haberdasher. ``But then those people
will probably say they don't understand the mentality of people who
go and watch someone hit a tennis ball back and forth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Fauerbach said people here would pay $50 to $90 for three
hours of racing because NASCAR racing had grown up. ``NASCAR racing
is not just a bunch of rednecks anymore,'' Fauerbach said. ``It's
champagne helicopter executives who come in and follow this sport.
It's Fortune 500 captains of American industry wining and dining
themselves and their employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly NASCAR racing has changed with the boom in television
coverage. The sport known for custom-made muscle cars that are
festooned with advertising logos used to be nearly entirely
dependent on products you had to be 18 or 21 to buy: snuff,
cigarettes and beer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, although the Winston Cup series and the Busch (beer) series
are still the premier events in NASCAR racing, federal and state
tobacco suit settlements have reduced tobacco's role in NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco settlement has sharply curtailed the kinds of
advertising tobacco companies may do at NASCAR events, forbidding,
for example, a display of tobacco logos on the race cars
themselves. Just as the restrictions on tobacco companies
increased, however, NASCAR promoters started looking beyond the
Southern males who were the sport's first and most devoted fans.
</P>
<P>
   According to NASCAR, 39 percent of the most dedicated fans are
women, and more than a third report incomes of more than $50,000.
Advertisers now include the likes of Proctor &AMP; Gamble's Tide, Home
Depot, Visa and Perdue chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Now only National Football League games earn a higher television
rating than NASCAR's premier races, and race attendance has grown
65 percent since 1990, to 6.3 million people last year. Last month,
NASCAR signed a six-year, $400 million television package with Fox,
NBC and Turner Sports.
</P>
<P>
   But will they come? There are NASCAR-sanctioned tracks in
Flemington, N.J.; Pocono, Pa., and at Watkins Glen, in upstate New
York. None are the 1.5-mile, steeply banked ovals that are used for
top events like the Winston Cup, however.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Kuhl is the co-promoter, with his father Paul, at
Flemington Speedway, in central New Jersey. It is a short-track
course, where racing speeds stay below about 85 mph, compared with
speeds approaching 200 miles at superspeedways, and Kuhl has seen
his business fall off as NASCAR developed its new generation of
supertracks.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhl charges $14 admission, compared with an average price of
$90 per admission to a Winston Cup series race. But he thinks the
national promoters have little to worry about in trying to break
into the New York market. ``You're talking millions and millions of
people in the New York area, and all they need is 150,000 people to
be interested,'' Kuhl said. ``They'll find them.''

promoters hope he will change his mind. Trump's group, ISC,
apparently favors a site closer to the New York skyline. The New
Jersey Meadowlands offers such a skyline view, and Whitman is said
to favor a site that would help the financially ailing Meadowlands
Authority, which now requires a huge annual state subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   But a modern superspeedway along with its attractions and
amenities takes about 1,000 acres of land, Talley said, and the
Meadowlands, with Giants Stadium, the Meadowlands Racetrack and
Continental Airlines Arena already on it, has only 759 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an appropriate use of the Meadowlands,'' DiFrancesco
told the New Jersey Conference of Mayors in September. The
Meadowlands Authority, after confirming earlier in the week that it
had been in contact with race promoters, has since gone mum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot comment on whether we had a meeting with NASCAR,''
said Dan Emmer, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There may be other problems to overcome before people in the
region see their first checkered flag. Speedway developers are
accustomed to large public subsidies to help build their tracks _
taxpayers contributed $146 million of the $228 cost of ISC's new
track outside Kansas City. But that level of tax support for sports
promoters is a tougher sell in both New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway supporters like Donald Fauerbach, executive director of
the New Jersey Conference of Mayors and a NASCAR racing team owner
himself, say that the state that wins a speedway would have to put
in no more than the usual access roads and sewer lines, which New
Jersey has done for Atlantic City casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, plenty of people could not care less whether NASCAR
moves north. ``I don't understand the mentality of people who pay
good money to watch those cars go around and around,'' said Eric
Mihan, a retired Princeton haberdasher. ``But then those people
will probably say they don't understand the mentality of people who
go and watch someone hit a tennis ball back and forth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Fauerbach said people here would pay $50 to $90 for three
hours of racing because NASCAR racing had grown up. ``NASCAR racing
is not just a bunch of rednecks anymore,'' Fauerbach said. ``It's
champagne helicopter executives who come in and follow this sport.
It's Fortune 500 captains of American industry wining and dining
themselves and their employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly NASCAR racing has changed with the boom in television
coverage. The sport known for custom-made muscle cars that are
festooned with advertising logos used to be nearly entirely
dependent on products you had to be 18 or 21 to buy: snuff,
cigarettes and beer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, although the Winston Cup series and the Busch (beer) series
are still the premier events in NASCAR racing, federal and state
tobacco suit settlements have reduced tobacco's role in NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco settlement has sharply curtailed the kinds of
advertising tobacco companies may do at NASCAR events, forbidding,
for example, a display of tobacco logos on the race cars
themselves. Just as the restrictions on tobacco companies
increased, however, NASCAR promoters started looking beyond the
Southern males who were the sport's first and most devoted fans.
</P>
<P>
   According to NASCAR, 39 percent of the most dedicated fans are
women, and more than a third report incomes of more than $50,000.
Advertisers now include the likes of Proctor &AMP; Gamble's Tide, Home
Depot, Visa and Perdue chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Now only National Football League games earn a higher television
rating than NASCAR's premier races, and race attendance has grown
65 percent since 1990, to 6.3 million people last year. Last month,
NASCAR signed a six-year, $400 million television package with Fox,
NBC and Turner Sports.
</P>
<P>
   But will they come? There are NASCAR-sanctioned tracks in
Flemington, N.J.; Pocono, Pa., and at Watkins Glen, in upstate New
York. None are the 1.5-mile, steeply banked ovals that are used for
top events like the Winston Cup, however.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Kuhl is the co-promoter, with his father Paul, at
Flemington Speedway, in central New Jersey. It is a short-track
course, where racing speeds stay below about 85 mph, compared with
speeds approaching 200 miles at superspeedways, and Kuhl has seen
his business fall off as NASCAR developed its new generation of
supertracks.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhl charges $14 admission, compared with an average price of
$90 per admission to a Winston Cup series race. But he thinks the
national promoters have little to worry about in trying to break
into the New York market. ``You're talking millions and millions of
people in the New York area, and all they need is 150,000 people to
be interested,'' Kuhl said. ``They'll find them.''

FUND-RAISER DENIES WRONGDOING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A businessman who has raised tens of thousands of
dollars for the campaigns of Gov. George Pataki and other
Republicans pleaded not guilty Friday to federal charges that he
promised favorable state parole rulings to the families of three
convicted violent felons in exchange for $36,000 in campaign
donations.
</P>
<P>
   The businessman, Yung Soo Yoo, 63, was released on $100,000 bond
after his arraignment in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn before
Magistrate Judge Robert M. Levy. A nine-count indictment unsealed
on Wednesday charged Yoo with conspiracy, obstruction of justice,
violating campaign finance laws and making false statements.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to asserting that he promised favorable parole
decisions for campaign contributions, the indictment accuses him of
soliciting $40,000 from a South Korean yogurt maker and illegally
funneling about $15,000 to Alfonse D'Amato's unsuccessful 1998
Senate re-election campaign. The indictment also alleges he
collected $20,000 for the 1996 GOP presidential campaign of Bob
Dole. But the indictment says Dole never received the money because
a fund-raising dinner was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, Loretta E. Lynch, said in a
statement on Wednesday that there was no evidence that the
governor, D'Amato or Dole took part in, or had knowledge of, any of
the crimes charged in the case. The Pataki administration has
denied wrongdoing by its officials, and after the indictment it
cited Ms. Lynch's statement as support of its position.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo's lawyer, Nicholas M. De Feis, said that his client
``promised nothing to these people and he received nothing
personally.'' And he dismissed suggestions that the Pataki
administration would trade a felon's freedom for money.

Bowden a natural as Bryant candidate
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bowden will never have to say, ``I coulda been a
contender,'' as Marlon Brando's character grumbled in the movie
classic On the Waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby is the only coach in history whose team finished among the
top four in the wire service polls for 12 straight years. This
means he has been a contender for half of his 24 seasons at Florida
State, and now for the second time since 1993 his Seminoles are
undefeated with a chance to win the national title.
</P>
<P>
   They did just that on the New Year's night of '94, with a
tumultuous 18-16 victory over mighty Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.
Now the scene shifts to the Sugar Bowl, and a date with a
Cinderella team, Virginia Tech, on Jan. 4. The timing seems a bit
odd, except for those who enjoy the tradition of Tuesday Night
Football. Perhaps they are trying to avoid the Y2K bug, whatever
that is.
</P>
<P>
   But where and when become minor details when teams are playing
for the national championship. It is simply about ringing out the
old, ringing in the new.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bear Bryant Coach of the Year Award is up for
grabs and Bobby Bowden is baaaack.
</P>
<P>
   When Bobby appeared in Houston at the end of 1993 as one of the
four finalists, the evening had a special twist. He brought his kid
with him. Terry Bowden had coached Auburn to a perfect record in
his rookie year, 11-0, which is just about as good as coaching
gets. And wouldn't you know it, Terry upstaged his old man and
walked off with the Bryant trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, the Bryant dinner, kicking off the year
2000, is shaping up as the most compelling of them all. It takes
place in Houston, for the benefit of the American Heart
Association, two nights after the Nos. 1 and 2 teams face off for
the title in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association
announced the seven semifinalists this week and, besides the elder
Bowden, the list includes five newcomers. One of them is Mike
DuBose, of Alabama, who played and coached under Bryant Himself,
and who made _ along with his team _ one of the season's most
notable comebacks. He went from the brink of being fired to 10 wins
and a conference title.
</P>
<P>
   The other first-timers are Wisconsin's Barry Alvarez, who did
most of his coaching on crutches after knee replacement surgery;
Frank Beamer of Virginia Tech; June Jones, who did a total
renovation at Hawaii, not previously known as a football factory;
and Bob Pruett, who guided Marshall to a 12-0 record and then held
the University of Houston job for nearly 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   It might not qualify as a homecoming for Pruett, who is prepared
for some good-natured kidding over his flip-flop. Pruett wasn't
taking any calls from Houston until he learned it had to do with
the Bryant Award. He answered the phone with a sheepish laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The other repeater is Glen Mason, nominated once before at
Kansas and returning this time as the salvage master at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep coming,'' Mason said, ``until I win the
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is no stranger to the city, having coached for the Oilers
under Jerry Glanville and Jack Pardee, when the run-and-shoot was
as popular as Christmas lights.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in memory, there are three undefeated
finalists _ Bowden, Beamer and Pruett.
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush, who once played first base for
Yale and in sports and politics has set a standard for
sportsmanship, will be the keynote speaker. A lifetime achievement
award will be presented to Darrell Royal, who becomes more of a
legend the longer he stays out of coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Bobby Bowden, the game's current
patriarch. There is no intention here to lobby for any candidate,
but the Florida State coach has an advantage. A country boy from
Alabama, he knew Bryant and had a long and enduring friendship with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was coming up,'' Bowden says, ``he was the guy. Bear
came to Alabama in 1958. In '59, I got the job at Howard College, a
little Baptist school 50 miles from Tuscaloosa. So I'd drive down
there and watch and learn. Gene Stallings was a graduate assistant
then.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first year at Howard we went 9-1. I was getting my name in
the Birmingham papers. So I wrote Bear a letter, said I wish I
could work for him. He wrote me back, `I appreciate that, but if I
hired you I'd have every Baptist in the state mad at me.' A nice
way of saying no.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always good to me. Bear would give me a list of kids he
didn't want; he already had all he needed. He'd say, `Pick out the
ones you want and I'll call 'em.' I used to get a lot of my players
from him.''

STARS LOSE HATCHER FOR 6-8 WEEKS IN TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ The Stars salvaged a 2-2 tie with the
Edmonton Oilers last night at the SkyReach Centre but lost captain
Derian Hatcher for at least six to eight weeks and center Joe
Nieuwendyk indefinitely. Hatcher left the game midway through the
second period after suffering a calf laceration that cut through
the muscle. He'll be on crutches for at least four weeks. Hatcher
was on crutches and heavily iced and taped after the game.
Nieuwendyk left not long after Hatcher with cartilage damage in his
chest. The game, the Stars could afford to lose. It's one of 82 in
the course of the season. The players they could not. ``That'a a
big blow for us; they had been our two best players,'' Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock said. Hatcher has been the Stars' best player for
most of this season, mounting a Norris Trophy-like season. He has a
pair of goals and 14 assists while ranking among the NHL leaders in
ice time at almost 30 minutes per game. Nieuwendyk, meanwhile, was
centering what had been the Stars' most productive line recently.
He has 10 goals and 12 assists this season. Hatcher had to be
helped off ice with 9:56 remaining in the second period. He had
been skating behind the Stars' net when Edmonton winger Todd
Marchant tried to check him into the boards. Marchant missed, but
Marchant's skate clipped Hatcher in the back of his right calf.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher immediately dropped to all fours. He was taken directly
to the locker room and wasn't able to put any weight on his right
leg. He didn't return. ``You could see the blood coming out of
Hatch's sock as he was coming off the ice so you knew it was bad,''
Mike Modano said. Trainer Dave Surprenant had been attending to
Nieuwendyk on the bench when Hatcher went down. Nieuwendyk
attempted to come out for another shift but quickly followed
Hatcher into the locker room. The loss of their best defenseman and
one of their leading scorers further handicapped a Stars team that
had been struggling offensively all night. Their loss was felt
almost immediately. The rest of the second period was spent just
trying to escape with a 1-all tie still intact. The score didn't
last long into the third period, though. Stars winger Jamie
Langenbrunner and Oilers defenseman Tom Poti opened the third
period with a fight. Langenbrunner, however, had a two-minute minor
for roughing added to his five minutes for fighting, and the Oilers
went on the power play. With 19 seconds remaining with a man
advantage, the Oilers scored. Edmonton winger Ryan Smyth tried to
center a pass from behind the Stars goal. The puck went off Stars
goalie Ed Belfour's stick and into the net 128 seconds into the
third period. Whatever momentum the Stars had begun with was
officially gone, lost until 15:33 of the third period when Stars
winger Chris Murray grabbed it back with his second goal of the
season. He poked the game-tying goal past Oilers goalie Tommy Salo
after a wild scramble in front. The Stars opened the first period
with all of the good chances and the only goal. Defenseman Brad
Lukowich scored on a wraparound at 17:59 of the first period. He
beat Salo, who was slow to close off the post. The Stars outshot
the Oilers, 13-8. If their power play had been working, the Stars
could have put the game out of reach in the first period. They had
four power plays, failing to score on any of them and failing to
record a shot on three of them. But while the first period belonged
to the Stars, the second was all Oilers. They outshot the Stars,
17-3, including the game-tying goal by Poti at 6:41. The 17 shots
in a period tied the Oilers previous high this season. The period
could've been a lot worse for the Stars if not for Belfour and an
ineffective Edmonton power play. The Oilers failed to capitalize on
three power plays, including two that were back-to-back and 14
seconds with a two-man advantage.

LAKERS ARE PASS PERFECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ That steadily rising mountain of wins is testament
enough to the Lakers' strength this season, but a closer inspection
of the terrain reveals a team that is, dare we say, bordering on
the unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   There's proof enough in the scoring averages of Shaquille
O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice. But anyone with a passing
interest can see the more deadly underside of that threesome.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more to the point, their interest in passing.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' triumvirate accounted for 75 points in a 97-88
victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves at Target Center on Friday.
Bryant led the way with 28, followed by O'Neal's 24 and Rice's 23.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the figures that leapt off the page were the career-high 12
assists by Bryant and the season-high-tying seven by O'Neal as the
team combined for 28.
</P>
<P>
   So much for that ``selfish'' label tacked to the Lakers' stars.
</P>
<P>
   And so much for double-teaming them into turnovers and miscues.
The Lakers' new weapon is definitely the pass. It was the key to
winning their fifth straight game (12th of their last 13) while
sending the slumping Timberwolves to their eighth straight defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just trying to dissect them,'' said Bryant, whose
assist total was also the highest for any Laker in the last two
seasons. ``We just wanted to take our time and really pick them
apart. We were able to do that. We were able to cut them up in
certain parts of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal distributed the ball nicely out of the low post. Bryant
penetrated and kicked, often feeding O'Neal for the easy score.
Even as the Lakers flogged themselves for letting a 20-point lead
dwindle to single digits by late in the fourth, they took pride in
the way they earned the cushion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three amigos do it again,'' O'Neal said. ``We got three
weapons on this team. Nice to have.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bryant, who missed seven weeks with a broken hand, the
passing performance was a sign that he's getting comfortable again
with his teammates and a new offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``My (court) vision is coming back,'' he said, and the result
has been some nifty passing to O'Neal. ``That kind of comes from
playing with each other. . . . We're still getting to learn one
another, but we're getting better at it. Like I knew he was going
to be there before I made the move to the baseline (in the fourth
quarter).''
</P>
<P>
   That play, an O'Neal hook shot, netted Bryant his 11th assist
and helped the Lakers push the lead back to 12 with 4:35 to go.
Bryant also scored seven points in the last 5:18 of the game as the
Lakers held off the Timberwolves' charge.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota had pulled within six points by the 2:07 mark, but a
Bryant 6-foot jumper (assist, Rice) and a pair of O'Neal free
throws followed, sealing the win. Bryant then capped the night with
his 12th assist on a Rice 15-foot jumper that made it a 10-point
game with a minute to go.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it shouldn't have come down to such a dramatic
finish.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers worked their offense to precision and dominated the
rebounding game 31-12 as they took a 56-38 lead by halftime. But
then Kevin Garnett, Terrell Brandon and Rasho Nesterovic got loose.
Garnett got eight of his team-record 21 rebounds in the third
quarter, Nesterovic zipped past O'Neal for eight quick points in
the period, and Brandon added eight of his own on the way to a
22-point night.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was reduced to seven by the time the fourth quarter
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the game was played sporadically, if anything,''
Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. ``It was a poorly focused effort by
the Lakers in the second half, although you have to give the
Timberwolves some credit for scrapping. . . . They got back in the
ballgame just purely on hustle.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is pleased enough that his team has won the first two
games of the four-game road trip, but he's still looking for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very unusual, strange game. We just blew it open in
the second quarter and then sat on a lead in the third quarter and
were willing to play when we had to play. That's not the way I like
a team to play basketball, so we had a discussion after the game
about that.''

BIG CITY COLUMN: ALLOWING SOME LEEWAY OUT IN PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Down and Out in Nyack and Chappaqua, Chapter II.
</P>
<P>
   At last someone has taken pity on me. In my recent foray posing
as a bum in suburbia, recounted in Wednesday's column, I was
prevented from lounging on the pavement outside the houses of Rosie
O'Donnell and Hillary Rodham Clinton. But now Norman Siegel has
come to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have called me from Nyack,'' said Siegel, executive
director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, after reading about
my ejection from the sidewalk in front of Ms. O'Donnell's house.
Unshaven and unkempt, I'd spent a frigid hour huddled next to Ms.
O'Donnell's wall until Officer J.M. Coyle ordered me to move on or
face arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have gotten in the car,'' Siegel said, ``and gone up
immediately to defend you. As long as you weren't obstructing the
sidewalk, they had no authority to make you leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I was on solid legal ground, but I wasn't sure I wanted to
win this case. Never mind the law. Should anyone be allowed to lie
down on the sidewalk in front of someone else's home?
</P>
<P>
   I tried putting the question to Ms. O'Donnell and Mrs. Clinton,
with no luck. ``That's a hard question,'' was the best I could
extract from Ms. O'Donnell's spokeswoman, Lois Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, dodged the question by
reiterating her desire not to arrest people ``whose only offense is
that they have no home.'' Her sentiments were echoed this week by
Andrew M. Cuomo, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development,
who accused Giuliani of ``criminalizing'' the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   But no one wants to arrest anyone for being homeless. No one
denies the right of homeless people to be in public spaces. The
question is what they or any other New Yorkers can do there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We faced these same accusations of criminalizing homelessness
when we started the quality-of-life campaign in the subways,'' said
George L. Kelling, a professor of criminal justice at Rutgers
University and co-author of the famous ``broken-windows'' theory of
preserving social order. He trained the police in the subway to
enforce bans on panhandling and to prevent passengers from lying
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said we were taking the subways away from the poor and
giving them to the rich,'' he said, ``which was a cruel joke on the
poor and the working class people who had to use the subway. They
deserve hassle-free public spaces just as much as the suburbanites
in Nyack and Chappaqua.''
</P>
<P>
   But how do you legally distinguish ``disorderly'' behavior? A
lemonade stand would probably take up more of the sidewalk than my
sprawled body did. But the neighborhood would gladly tolerate the
children's obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The simple libertarian solution would be to privatize sidewalks,
as in gated communities. If Rosie O'Donnell and her neighbors owned
the sidewalks, they could kick me off and allow the lemonade stand
without being taken to court. The libertarian approach is
essentially what Mrs. Clinton followed in moving to a cul-de-sac in
Chappaqua with no sidewalks or other public spaces for a bum like
me to rest.
</P>
<P>
   But private sidewalks don't seem terribly realistic for today's
New York City. A more practical approach would be a law like the
one in Seattle, which bans people from sitting or lying on
sidewalks in commercial districts during business hours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A law much broader than Seattle's could be passed here and
probably be upheld in court,'' said Dennis Saffran, executive
director of the Center for the Community Interest, a group based in
New York that helps municipalities draft and defend quality-of-life
laws. ``What you would want to do is give police authority, but
also encourage them to be flexible on a case by case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelling also stressed flexibility. ``You can't nail everything
down in a law,'' he said. ``It all depends on the time and place.
One person sleeping in a park at night is no big deal; with 10, you
have problems. Two people begging outside a busy subway station at
8 a.m. is no problem. If they're accosting an elderly woman by
herself at 10 p.m., it can be extortion. The police need to
exercise discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy seemed to be guiding Coyle when he ordered me
off Ms. O'Donnell's sidewalk. ``If you need to sleep, go to a
park,'' he said. ``You won't bother anyone, and we won't bother
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, according to a strict interpretation of the law, I had
just as much right to sleep on the sidewalk as in the park. But at
the moment Coyle's interpretation seemed a lot more sensible.

 WINNIE MANDELA DELAYED AT AIRPORT OVER VISA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Winnie Madikizela-Mandela arrived for a visit in the
United States Friday with two bodyguards but no visa, setting off
an early morning boomlet of excitement that entangled federal
agencies, congressional offices and her New Jersey hosts in an
effort to liberate her from Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The intervention worked.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mandela, politically prominent as a longtime anti-apartheid
leader and the former wife of Nelson Mandela but ineligible for a
visa because of a criminal conviction in South Africa, received
State Department permission to enter the country after a three-hour
enforced wait in an airport office.
</P>
<P>
   She is scheduled to speak at a dinner Saturday in Newark that
has been organized by a group called Black Cops Against Police
Brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. DeLacy Davis, an East Orange, N.J., police officer who is
president of the group, said he learned of Mrs. Mandela's detention
when he arrived at the airport with a welcoming committee and a
women's choir that was set to regale her with the South African
national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, armed with cell phones, he and his committee mobilized
black police officers all over the Northeast to call and complain
to every elected official they could reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were on the telephone and moving in eight states,'' said
Davis, who turned up the heat by alerting newspapers and television
stations to Mrs. Mandela's situation. ``We called every black
official.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was released, he put her in a limousine and headed for
Newark immediately. ``I just want to get her onto New Jersey
soil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mandela, who was in the limousine, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Mrs. Mandela was convicted of the assault and
kidnapping of a 14-year-old boy who was later murdered in Soweto.
Because of the conviction, she is not eligible for a visa unless
she requests and receives a specific waiver.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman said that Mrs. Mandela had received
waivers from the U.S. Embassy in South Africa in the past. ``She
did not do so this time,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   He would not say who at the State Department granted the waiver
for Mrs. Mandela after she arrived at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two guards traveling with Mrs. Mandela also arrived
without a valid visa. He also received permission to enter the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mandela's traveling arrangements have caused a fuss before.
She was criticized in South Africa earlier this year when it was
learned that she was traveling on a diplomatic passport, although
she may not have been entitled to one.

PENDING DECISION NOT END OF BELTRE STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even though the decision from the commissioner's
office is slated for early next week, the saga regarding the
Dodgers and third baseman Adrian Beltre may be months from being
settled.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported Thursday night that baseball would fine the
Dodgers but not grant Beltre free agency, which is what he and his
attorney, Scott Boras, are seeking. Officials from the Dodgers and
Major League Baseball said they heard that decision discussed, but
the Dodgers haven't heard from the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Two sources said the fine for illegally signing Beltre as a 15
year old would be as much as $500,000. It's also expected the
Dodgers will be banned from signing foreign-born players for a
specified time.
</P>
<P>
   An official from Major League Baseball said the announcement
would come Monday or Tuesday. Sandy Alderson, executive vice
president of baseball operations for the commissioner's office, met
with commissioner Bud Selig on the matter Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson didn't return phone calls Friday, and baseball
officials said no decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the story isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a hearing, this is a procedure,'' Boras said.
``This a procedure conducted by baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Orza, associate general counsel of the players union, said
during the recently completely winter meetings that a grievance
would be filed if Beltre's request to be a free agent was denied.
Once a grievance is filed, there will be a hearing and an
independent arbitrator will make a binding decision after hearing
testimony from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, it takes a month before a grievance goes to the
arbitrator; from there a decision could take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dodgers refused comment on the Beltre issue Friday,
general manager Kevin Malone said earlier in the week that the club
would move forward on the free-agent market based on baseball's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Boras already sent documents to New York to begin the grievance
process. A source said Boras will be in New York on Monday when
baseball makes the expected decision.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports, baseball will rule that the statute of
limitations expired because Beltre signed more than five years ago.
The rule states a player has a year from the claim date to file a
complaint. While Beltre signed with the Dodgers in 1994, Boras said
Beltre didn't know about the rule and didn't learn of it until last
March.
</P>
<P>
   The grievance procedure could buy the Dodgers more time to
ultimately keep Beltre because it would allow them to renegotiate a
contract. If an agreement is reached, Beltre could then drop his
grievance and remain with the Dodgers, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were fined $200,000 during the season as punishment
for illegally scouting and signing minor leaguers Juan Carlos Diaz
and Josue Perez out of Cuba. The Dodgers were also banned from
signing foreign-born players until Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, through Boras, asked to be declared a free agent after
it was learned the Dodgers signed him at the age of 15. The Dodgers
listed Beltre as being born in 1978, while Beltre said he was born
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Boras obtained Beltre's personnel files from the Dodgers last
month and said it contained two birth certificates _ one with the
year 1979 whited-out and 1978 typed over it _ and several work
visas confirming Beltre was born in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Boras also claims that Beltre was signed in April. Clubs aren't
allowed to sign players before July 1.

<P>
   Professor Donald Fraser Tapley, dean of the Columbia University
College of Physicians and Surgeons during 10 years of robust
growth, died on Thursday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.
He was 72 and lived in Palisades and Hamden, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiac arrest, the university reported.
</P>
<P>
   Tapley led the college from 1973 to 1984. At his death he was
alumni professor of medicine and senior deputy vice president at
Columbia's Health Science Division.
</P>
<P>
   Under his stewardship, the endowment of the college rose to more
than $160 million from $78 million, federal financing for research
doubled, and the institution's international reputation grew
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Tapley recruited all but one chairman of the college's basic
science departments, along with fresh leadership for the School of
Public Health and the School of Nursing.
</P>
<P>
   He raised funds for student scholarships and helped carry out
the planning for what has become New York City's first research
park, the Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Park at
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Tapley was medical editor of ``The Columbia University College
of Physicians and Surgeons Complete Home Medical Guide,'' issued by
Crown Publishers in 1984, with a third revised edition in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Companion guides, written and edited by Columbia specialists,
were published on pregnancy (1988), early child care (1990), mental
health (1992) and dental health (1997); the books' proceeds are
earmarked for the college's scholarship funds.
</P>
<P>
   Tapley's own specialty was endocrinology and he published many
papers on the topic, with special emphasis on the role of hormones
of the thyroid gland.
</P>
<P>
   Tapley was born in Woodstock, New Brunswick, and graduated in
1948 from Acadia University in Wolfville, Nova Scotia. He received
his medical degree from the University of Chicago in 1952, the year
he first established ties to Columbia as an intern at Presbyterian
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He undertook further studies at Johns Hopkins University and
Oxford University. At Columbia he steadily rose through the ranks,
to attending physician and professor of medicine in 1972. He was
named acting dean in 1973, and dean the following year.
</P>
<P>
   He supported the Morris-Jumel Mansion, a museum in Manhattan's
oldest remaining house, and served as its trustee and treasurer. He
also was a board member of Bassett Healthcare of Cooperstown, N.Y.,
O'Connor Hospital in Delhi, N.Y., and Hudson Riverkeeper, an
environmental watchdog program.
</P>
<P>
   Tapley is survived by his wife of 42 years, Caroline Southall
Tapley; three daughters, Kate, of Washington, Elisabeth, of Tappan,
N.Y., and Sarah T. Banks of South Nyack, N.Y.; and five
grandchildren.

VICTIM'S MOM WANTS MERCY FOR SON'S KILLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Donna Huffaker  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Sona Demirchyan knelt Friday over the flowers,
candles and Christmas teddy bear on her 15-year-old son Avo's grave
at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park near downtown Los Angeles and read the
poems she has written in her grief.
</P>
<P>
   It has been her daily ritual for the 15 months since a bullet
allegedly fired by a close friend during a student melee near
Hoover High School in the Los Angeles-area city of Glendale claimed
Avo's life.
</P>
<P>
   With his friend, Artiom Badalyan, facing sentencing next month,
Demirchyan has joined 15 other people who wrote letters to Pasadena
Superior Court Judge Victor Person asking that the 19-year-old be
spared jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Artiom to be in jail would not ease my sadness at all,''
Demirchyan says in the letter to be read at sentencing Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Artiom) wouldn't wish for my son Avo's loss. And also my son
wouldn't want Artiom to be jailed,'' Demirchyan said in the court
document filed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Badalyan, 19, pleaded no contest to involuntary
manslaughter in the death on Sept. 10, 1998. Charges were reduced
from murder because the shooting was unintentional and there was
confusion in witnesses' statements, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear what actually happened that afternoon on
School Street, said Mark Geragos, Badalyan's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   It was only three days into the school year when an argument
arose during lunch between Avo and another student. The two
students agreed to settle the dispute after school and each arrived
on School Street with a group of friends.
</P>
<P>
   The groups got into a fistfight, a gunshot sounded and Avo fell
to the ground with a bullet in his stomach. He died two days later.
</P>
<P>
   The groups scattered after the gunshot. Some witnesses testified
Badalyan had a gun in his waistband while others said they saw
nothing. Police issued an arrest warrant for him but the teen-ager
did not turn himself in for 29 days.
</P>
<P>
   Police found the handgun tossed under a bush in Brand Park on
Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we'll ever really know what happened,''
Geragos said. ``All we know is this is a tragedy for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Geragos on Jan. 10 will ask that Badalyan receive probation,
given the fact the 19-year-old served more than a year in Los
Angeles County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy District Attorney Patricia Wilkinson will ask that
probation be denied and that Person sentence Badalyan to six years
in state prison half of the maximum sentence
</P>
<P>
   because of his
</P>
<P>
   Although Wilkinson declined to comment until the case is closed,
court documents said Badalyan should receive six years because his
conduct exposed the entire group of students to the risk of serious
injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed out that Badalyan, who attended Allan Daily
Continuation High School, had been arrested as a juvenile on
suspicion of battery and disruption of school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant ... does have a record evidencing violent
behavior and now he has engaged in conduct that has resulted in
death,'' Wilkinson said in court documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence'' isn't a word Sona Demirchyan would have ever linked
to her son or his friends, she said, flipping through a three-ring
binder packed with poems, sketches and a stack of sympathy letters
addressed to her and her husband from Hoover High students.
</P>
<P>
   It is because of those students, Avo's friends, and her own
prayers that she has risen from her bed every day for the last 15
months. On Dec. 9, the day that would have been Avo's 17th
birthday, Demirchyan baked a cake and invited her son's friends
into her Raymond Avenue home.
</P>
<P>
   The students gave her a booklet stuffed with more drawings and
prayers. On the cover is a picture of Avo and the words: ``We have
lost an angel but we have not forgotten him. In our hearts and
souls forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Demirchyan, who emigrated with her husband and sons from Armenia
in 1992, said Avo preferred being at home with his family unless he
was playing sports. Seated under one of three photographs of her
youngest son, Demirchyan looked around her tidy living room and
said Avo would always do the dusting and cleaning. He liked things
spotless, she said.
</P>
<P>
   So now, Demirchyan returns the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Every day when she visits her son, she pulls a cloth from her
bag and polishes his grave marker. She wipes away any grass
clippings, even getting between the engraved letters.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, wearing all black as she does most days, Demirchyan
knelt on the ground and kissed her son's picture goodbye. She would
be back the next day, she assured -- the cemetery is her second
home, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he is in a place where there is no violence,'' Demirchyan
said.

HENRY HELSTOSKI DIES AT 75; SERVED 6 TERMS IN CONGRESS

<P>
   Henry Helstoski, a former New Jersey congressman whose bright
career in government all but ended in 1976 when he was indicted _
but never tried or found guilty _ on charges of accepting a bribe,
died on Thursday at a hospice in Wayne, N.J. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, said his son, Henry Helstoski Jr.
of Boonton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Helstoski, a Democrat who served six terms in the House
of Representatives representing the Ninth Congressional District in
Bergen County, was charged with taking more than $8,000 for
introducing legislation allowing several Chileans to immigrate to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Helstoski said he was framed by political opponents. The
charges, which included obstruction of justice, led to defeat in
his bid for a seventh term in 1976. But the charges were dropped in
1980, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that legislation
could not be used as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wheels of justice grind slowly,'' Helstoski said in 1980.
``When all this nonsense started, I said it was without merit, but
it has taken all this time to set the record straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vindication, by 1980 Helstoski's political career
was permanently damaged; he failed to regain his seat in 1978 and
in 1980. In an interview in 1991 with The Record in Hackensack,
N.J., he expressed bitterness toward Washington and the
prosecutorial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a dim view of politics, what people do to advance
themselves,'' Helstoski said. ``You certainly get a good
perspective of what human nature is; the extent of greed, ambition,
the standards and morality of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Helstoski was born on March 21, 1924, in Wallington, N.J. He
received a bachelor's degree from Paterson College and a master's
degree from Montclair State College. He also served in the Army Air
Forces during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   His first civilian jobs were in education; he worked as a
teacher, principal and school superintendent in East Rutherford,
Cedar Grove and Wallington before serving as a councilman and then
mayor of East Rutherford between 1956 and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to Congress in 1964 and was a member of the House
Ways and Means Committee. He was considered a supporter of
anti-pollution laws before they became popular in Washington. He
also sponsored legislation that increased life insurance and
pensions for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for
governor in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Helstoski was an early critic of American military involvement
in Vietnam. And he was one of the first congressmen to call for the
impeachment of President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   After his final unsuccessful bid in 1980 to win back his seat in
Congress, Helstoski became a grants administrator in Bergen County.
In 1988, he was a substitute English teacher in Passaic, N.J., and
later a full-time teacher in Irvington.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the publisher of The Passaic Citizen, a weekly
newspaper, and an accountant. For the last decade he had been
mostly retired.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Victoria;
two daughters, Andrea Cahill of Woodridge and Renata Helstoski of
Rutherford; a stepson, Kenneth Baldanza of Wayne; a brother, Robert
J. Helstoski of Saddle Brook; a sister, Lillian Helling of Denver;
and two grandchildren.

DISNEY LETS MOUSE OUT OF BAG ON WIDE RELEASE OF `FANTASIA'
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Walt Disney Co. has confirmed it will release
``Fantasia 2000'' next year in the regular 35 millimeter format
after its exclusive four-month run at 71 large-format Imax sites.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Disney had been vague about whether it would move
the update of the animated classic, which will open on New Year's
Day, into conventional theaters. But its holiday card _ sent this
week to thousands of friends, associates and vendors of the
entertainment conglomerate _ spilled the beans by listing a July
opening as part of its key ``Disney dates'' for the upcoming year.
</P>
<P>
   Distribution chief Chuck Viane admitted that the film, featuring
seven new sequences plus ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' from the
1940 original, will receive a nationwide rollout sometime next year
but added that July is not necessarily when it will open. ``We will
definitely have a 35 mm break for the film but it's a little
premature to say what the date is,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are good that the opening date for ``Fantasia 2000''
will not be in May, since Disney has already set May 12 for
``Dinosaur,'' a high-cost project with leading-edge animation and
one of its ``tentpole'' releases for the summer season. Trailers
for ``Dinosaur,'' which appears aimed squarely at children and
families, were launched last month along with the opening of ``Toy
Story 2.''

DISNEY LETS MOUSE OUT OF BAG ON WIDE RELEASE OF `FANTASIA'

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Walt Disney Co. has confirmed it will release
``Fantasia 2000'' next year in the regular 35 millimeter format
after its exclusive four-month run at 71 large-format Imax sites.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Disney had been vague about whether it would move
the update of the animated classic, which will open on New Year's
Day, into conventional theaters. But its holiday card _ sent this
week to thousands of friends, associates and vendors of the
entertainment conglomerate _ spilled the beans by listing a July
opening as part of its key ``Disney dates'' for the upcoming year.
</P>
<P>
   Distribution chief Chuck Viane admitted that the film, featuring
seven new sequences plus ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' from the
1940 original, will receive a nationwide rollout sometime next year
but added that July is not necessarily when it will open. ``We will
definitely have a 35 mm break for the film but it's a little
premature to say what the date is,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are good that the opening date for ``Fantasia 2000''
will not be in May, since Disney has already set May 12 for
``Dinosaur,'' a high-cost project with leading-edge animation and
one of its ``tentpole'' releases for the summer season. Trailers
for ``Dinosaur,'' which appears aimed squarely at children and
families, were launched last month along with the opening of ``Toy
Story 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment analyst Kevin Skoslock of Laguna Research Partners
said it makes sense for Disney to keep its strategy undercover.
``It's smart of them to leave themselves some flexibility in
scheduling,'' he added. ``I've got a feeling that this is going be

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: DIVIDING UP THE MONEY FROM THE BUSH TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas projects genuine sympathy when he
talks about the single mother earning $20,000 a year and struggling
to move her family into the middle class. The identification with
salaried workers is a key ingredient of the ``compassionate
conservatism'' that he says can remake the image of the Republican
Party. For that reason, Bush says, his plan, which would cost $480
billion over five years, focuses ``on low- and moderate-income
families,'' and provides the ``greatest help for those most in
need.'' In fact, Bush's plan is fairer than the 10-year, $800
billion plan passed this year by the Republican-controlled Congress
and vetoed by President Clinton. It would have tilted dramatically
in favor of wealthy families, throwing financial crumbs to nearly
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's description of his own plan's distribution of
benefits exaggerates the benefits to low-income people. Given the
mathematics of revenue collection, the poor cannot come away the
big winners. High-income families pay an overwhelming share of all
income taxes. Sweeping cuts of the sort designed by Bush have to go
to many of those privileged families. On the other hand, many
low-income families pay no tax, so even a whopping tax cut does
them not a penny's worth of good.
</P>
<P>
   Bush does try to mitigate the regressive impact of income tax
cuts by proposing to cut the bottom rate by a third, to 10 percent
from 15 percent, and doubling the credit for each child to $1,000.
His plan would thereby remove millions of low-income families from
the income tax rolls entirely, a clear benefit to those families.
But the amounts involved would be modest compared with the big
prizes Bush's plan would hand to the country's wealthiest families
through eliminating the estate tax and making more high-income
families eligible for tax breaks that are now limited to less
wealthy families.
</P>
<P>
   On net, low-income families wind up paying only a slightly
smaller share of total income taxes under the Bush plan. Wealthy
families come away with the biggest prizes. The Center for Tax
Justice, a liberal research group that uses standard economic
models to study tax incidence, estimates that the bottom 60 percent
of taxpayers would get only about 10 percent of the Bush tax-cut
money. By contrast, the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers would get
almost 40 percent of the money. The average tax cut for the bottom
20 percent of taxpayers would be less than $50 a year; for the top
1 percent it would be over $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's supporters defend the plan by reciting a tired mantra:
The rich pay an overwhelming share of the income tax, so it is fair
that they reap an overwhelming share of any tax cut. But nothing
forces Bush to rely entirely on income taxes to fulfill his
tax-cutting pledge. He could have proposed cutting payroll taxes
instead. Perhaps two-thirds of all families pay more in payroll
taxes _ the roughly 15 percent of wages and salaries that employees
and their employers pay into the Social Security and Medicare trust
funds _ than income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   That makes payroll taxes far more burdensome on low-income
families. The bottom 40 percent of families pay less than 1 percent
of income taxes, but about 4 percent of payroll taxes. Said another
way, the top 1 percent of taxpayers pay almost 40 percent of all
income taxes but less than 5 percent of all payroll taxes. Had Bush
chosen to cut payroll taxes, poor families would reap substantially
larger savings.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush's plan is doubly unequal. By cutting a tax that
poor people do not much pay, Bush would force Congress to reduce
spending by between $1 and $2 trillion over 10 years. The programs
almost certainly destined to absorb the largest reductions _
housing, education and other nonmilitary programs _
disproportionately help low- and middle-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Bush promotes his plan with the startling claim that ``roughly
$3 out of every $6 returned to taxpayers would finance changes that
help low-income families gain access to the middle class.'' This
boast is misleading. It invites voters to believe that half of the
cash goes to poor families. Bush is counting the entire cost of the
provisions to cut the lowest tax rate to 10 percent and to double
the tax credit for children as helping the poor escape poverty. But
upper-income families also take advantage of these two provisions,
and in fact they reap most of the benefits. Bush counts the cost of
making rich families even richer as a benefit for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, then, Bush exaggerates how much his plan favors the
poor. But it is also true that his plan goes further in that
direction than anything else the Republicans have proposed. With
more careful design, he could put even more compassion into his
conservatism. &QL;

ICE COMPANY DELIVERS CHILLED CHEER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Harrison Sheppard  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The mercury topped 80 degrees, but it was a white
Christmas at Kristie McLean's house Friday, thanks to some ice men
with warm hearts.
</P>
<P>
   With her mother suffering from cancer, McLean was hoping to
throw an extra-special Christmas party for her and her suburban Los
Angeles neighborhood this year, topping it off with a blanket of
snow on the lawn like they remembered from growing up in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Pete DeGrandis and Tony Floria from Union Ice Co. in the Van
Nuys area of Los Angeles heard her pleas for help on the radio, and
came to her rescue. Friday, the company sprayed roughly seven tons
of artificial snow on her front lawn for free, a service that would
normally cost upward of $800.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my, I'm in snow heaven!'' shouted a grateful McLean as a
neighborhood girl charged at her with a handful of the white stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Floria, the company's route superintendent, said he heard McLean
on station STAR 98.7 (KYSR-FM) Wednesday talking about how she
wanted to make her mom happy, but another ice company refused to
give her a discount.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, We gotta get a hold of them,'' Floria said. ``We'll do
it for free, just out of a good heart for the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which normally makes artificial snow for movie
studios and provides ice for restaurants, fed 48 blocks of ice,
weighing 300 pounds each, into a snow machine and spritzed it all
over her once-green lawn. Neighborhood children watched in awe,
just waiting to roll around in it.
</P>
<P>
   The moment they finished, the kids went to work, rolling around
on the ground making snow angels, throwing snowballs at each other
and the adults, and just giggling their heads off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' said 7-year-old Madison Reeb, as she rolled up
what she described as ``the perfect snowball that's so big that I
can hit anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   McLean throws the party for her neighbors on Bloomfield Street
every year, a tradition she picked up from her mother. Neighbors
say she has brought together a community that didn't talk that much
before she moved in a few years ago. She goes all-out in putting
the parties together, including renting a horse-driven sleigh to
parade down the street, but paying for the snow was simply too
much, she said, especially with her mother's condition.
</P>
<P>
   McLean's mother, Gwen Allen, whom her daughter describes as
``everybody's mama and everybody's grandma'' said she was thrilled
with the ice men's generosity. She gingerly walked out to the front
yard and tossed a few snowballs at some of the kids with a broad
smile on her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, isn't this something,'' she said. ``I was just enjoying
watching the kids play. Isn't this great?''
</P>
<P>
   Allen, 70, developed cancer about three years ago, and had a
successful operation. But the disease returned last month. She
undergoes weekly chemotherapy treatments, which leave her tired,
but she remains optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of drains you,'' she said. ``Because by the time you
recover from one weekly treatment, it's time to do another. But I'm
blessed. I beat it once, I'm gonna do it again.''

EDITORIAL: THE WRONG VENUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Dec. 18:
</P>
<P>
   The decision by a state appellate court to move the criminal
trial of four New York City police officers charged with the
killing of Amadou Diallo to Albany County seems unjustified. The
accused officers are presumed innocent and deserve a fair and
impartial trial, but there is no evidence that the people of the
Bronx and New York City cannot be trusted with this trial. Moving
the trial to Albany, a predominantly white area, could lessen the
respect with which many residents of New York City view the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, crimes are to be tried in the communities where
they are committed. The community has a legitimate interest in
observing the trial and seeing that the judicial process is open
and fair. Only in the rarest of cases have courts allowed a change
in venue on grounds that the defendants cannot get a fair trial by
an impartial jury because of prejudicial publicity.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court argued that the Diallo shooting ``is that
rare case.'' But its reasoning is inadequate. The court approved
the transfer to Albany before beginning the jury selection process.
Instead of allowing a careful voir dire process to weed out biased
jurors, the court baldly declared that even making an attempt to
find unbiased jurors would be ``fruitless.'' It is simply not
credible that there are not a dozen people in the Bronx who have
the fairness and courage to resist community pressures to render a
verdict based on the evidence, when no effort has been made to test
the prospective jury pool.
</P>
<P>
   The court based its ruling on what it calls a ``tidal wave of
prejudicial publicity.'' It cited a New Yorker magazine cover
showing a police officer firing at a cutout target in human shape
at a carnival shooting gallery, a column in The New York Post, and
a newspaper ad by the American Civil Liberties Union that showed 41
bullet holes for the 41 shots fired at Diallo. The court fails to
mention the large quantity of balanced press coverage about the
defendants, their job records and various scenarios that might
explain the shooting. The court also pointed to demonstrations
after the shooting and public opinion polls as indicative of a
prejudicial atmosphere. But those do not bear on whether impartial
jurors can be found in the Bronx who can do their duty as required
by law.
</P>
<P>
   Many highly publicized, politically charged cases _ from the
trial of the officers charged with attacking Abner Louima to the
World Trade Center bombing _ were not transferred to other venues.
Even if the court was worried that passions are too high in the
borough where the shooting occurred, the choice of Albany, a
community that does not in any way resemble the Bronx, is
inappropriate. The court could have moved the trial to Manhattan,
Queens or Brooklyn, where surely 12 fair-minded jurors could have
been found. By moving the trial without making any effort to find
unbiased jurors in the Bronx, the court may heighten suspicions in
minority communities about the fairness of the criminal justice
system.

A CENTURY ENDS IN PANAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Saturday, Dec. 18: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may be emblematic of our headlong, high-tech rush into the
next millennium that a chance to reflect on one of the signal
achievements of the American Century _ and one of its less noble
subplots _ passed this week with hardly a ripple. The United States
handed over the Panama Canal to Panama in a ceremony so bereft of
American interest that neither President Clinton nor a single top
official in his administration bothered to attend. It was a shabby
way to treat a monumental human achievement created at the dawn of
this century. Further, it slighted a profound and welcome evolution
of American power as the century comes to a close.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of a water passage across Panama linking the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans was a phenomenal undertaking, the moon
shot of its time. It relied on an ingenious ``lake-and-lock''
scheme whereby ships as long as the Empire State Building is tall
were hoisted 80 feet into vast freshwater lakes created by dams and
fed by torrential rains, connected by a cut through the Isthmus of
Panama. But it was achieved at great human cost. Between 1904 and
1915 more than 5,600 lives, mostly Barbadian, were lost to disease
and accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The canal represented a coming of age for the United States as
an assertive global power, better and worse. Theodore Roosevelt
famously personified America's turn-of-the-century can-do ideal
when, as the first United States president to travel overseas, he
posed at the controls of a 95-ton Bucyrus shovel. But that zeal was
inherently coercive, and over the decades it took on a neo-colonial
dimension. Not a few United States armed interventions in Central
America were aimed largely at protecting the canal from hostile
powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no Panama Canal! There is an American Canal
(italics)at(end italics) Panama,'' ran the slogan of opponents of
the 1977 treaties signed by Jimmy Carter and Gen. Omar Torrijos
that authorized a phased handover of the canal to Panama by 2000.
Carter, who led the United States delegation at this week's
handover, wisely persevered with a deal that signaled a more equal
partnership between the United States and the nations of Latin
America and removed the onus of maintaining a colonial enclave in a
country whose people opposed it. Reflecting a belated respect for a
small nation's sovereignty and pride, the world's only remaining
superpower has voluntarily given up an immensely valuable asset.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Americans can shrug off the deal is that the canal is
no longer strategically or economically essential to American
interests. Supertankers, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines
cannot pass through the canal, and software does not need to. Few
doubt that Panamanians possess the wherewithal to make a seamless
transition, but there remain legitimate fears of corruption and
patronage in a country with little history of transparent
government. Conservative critics of the deal have questioned
Panama's decision to award port concessions to a Hong Kong company
they say has Chinese military ties. But the treaties explicitly
permit United States intervention if the canal's security is
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's lamentable reluctance to risk conservative
ire by attending this week's transfer merely underscored the
courage shown two decades ago by Carter and his Senate allies, who
at great political cost forged an agreement that recognized how
America's long-term interests in that important region were best
served by partnership rather than domination.

CAPITALS BEAT RANGERS IN OVERTIME, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rangers' season-high, five-game unbeaten streak
ended Friday night, and the villain was Washington Capitals
goaltender Olaf Kolzig.
</P>
<P>
   Kolzig stopped 16 third-period shots _ and at least a half-dozen
outstanding scoring opportunities _ to enable the Capitals to force
overtime. In the extra session, Calle Johansson blasted a slap shot
from the top of the right circle over Mike Richter's left shoulder
and into the top right corner of the goal only 31 seconds into the
session to give the Capitals a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was set up by a cross-ice pass by Adam Oates from the
bottom of the right circle and through the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Oates had a goal and an assist, and overshadowed two goals by
Adam Graves and two assists by Theo Fleury as the Rangers were
saddled with their first loss since Dec. 1. Thanks to the new
National Hockey League rules, however, the Rangers were able to
salvage a point in the standing.
</P>
<P>
   Over their last six games, the Rangers are 4-1-1 with one
regulation tie, giving them 10 out of a possible 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals were without two of their top goal scorers, Peter
Bondra (knee) and Jan Bulis (groin). The Capitals play the trap,
and most of the scoreless first period resembled a football game
played between the 30-yard lines.

HERSHISER WILL DO WHATEVER DODGERS NEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before Fox _ before the turmoil and before Mike
Piazza was traded in a move still rued by fans _ Orel Hershiser
defined toughness and the underdog mentality in the Dodgers
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Behind one of the most dominant runs in major-league history, he
carried the Dodgers to the 1988 World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   Friday _ less than a week after the top two Dodgers personnel
decision-makers said the chance of it was close to nil _ Hershiser
returned to his original club five seasons after he left, signing a
one-year contract with the Dodgers worth $2 million plus
incentives. There's a club option for the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone said Hershiser, 41, would pitch out
of the bullpen. Of course that can change as quickly as a Carlos
Perez fastball changes direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm elated,'' Hershiser said. ``I just can't wait. I'm going
back into a culture that I know. I'm going to walk back into an
organization that I understand. It's a sweet, sweet possible
ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone and Dodgers chairman Robert Daly said last weekend they
thought Hershiser would sign with a club who could guarantee the
aging right-hander a spot in the starting rotation. That stance
changed.
</P>
<P>
   The move spanks of symbolism for the Dodgers. Already there's
speculation Hershiser could become the team's pitching coach the
moment he decides to end his career.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers also believe Hershiser can still pitch, and
he'll be counted on heavily next season. He was 13-12 with a 4.58
ERA in 32 starts for the New York Mets last season and has 69 wins
in the past five years away from the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been having my last season probably for the last five
years,'' Hershiser said. ``Everyone, including my wife and kids, at
times have been writing me off. So I've kept myself in shape and
kept my nose to the grindstone and looking for every rock to
uncover to keep this body in shape and go out and compete.''
</P>
<P>
   However, this is a very different organization than the one
Hershiser left before the 1995 season. Then, it was a family-owned
club run by the popular O'Malleys, where loyalty and tranquillity
reigned.
</P>
<P>
   The perception of the Dodgers changed the moment Rupert Murdoch
bought the team and transferred power from the offices at Chavez
Ravine to the skyscrapers of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the past eight weeks did the path of the club shift back
toward Los Angeles when Daly purchased a minority ownership stake
in the club and assumed day-to-day control.
</P>
<P>
   And while Daly tried to ease the mind of fans since his Oct. 28
appointment, the memory of the unpopular Piazza trade, the $105
million signing of Kevin Brown and an utterly embarrassing '99
season all remain engrained in everyone's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know (the organization) completely of what I left,''
Hershiser said. ``I'm not that naive. But I do have a lot of
relationships there. I know where to turn, what offices to go to,
to get things done. I know when there's a problem in the locker
room with certain things. I know how to communicate back to
management ... so we can go over these bumps in the road a lot
quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, the signing follows the Dodgers' offseason
path of revamping the club's makeup both on the field and in the
clubhouse. Since the season ended, the Dodgers clubhouse
distractions Raul Mondesi, Eric Young and Ismael Valdes are gone,
replaced by model citizen Shawn Green, Terry Adams and now
Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser brings experience and is considered one of the
foremost students of pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about bringing in winners who can change the
chemistry of the club, trying to find a leader, and I think Orel
represents a quality leader we really need in the clubhouse,''
Malone said. ``Orel will pitch out of the bullpen, or if he needs
to, be a starter. He's dedicated to doing whatever it takes to help
(manager) Davey (Johnson), and help the Dodgers win.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Dodgers lacked the swing pitcher, a veteran who
could eat innings out of the bullpen or make a spot start. For the
time being, Hershiser provides that.
</P>
<P>
   With a rotation of Brown, Chan Ho Park and Darren Dreifort, that
leaves Perez and one of the rookie pitchers _ Eric Gagne, Jeff
Williams or Mike Judd _ going for the last two spots in the
rotation. If any falter, Hershiser can step in. It can even happen
by opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orel is a perfect person to have on the team,'' Daly said.
``He adds so much to the team, not only as a terrific pitcher but
as a leader and somebody for our young pitchers. He's such a
positive asset to the Dodgers, in every respect.
</P>
<P>
   During a 17-year career that includes the 1988 Cy Young, the
World Series MVP and a record 59 scoreless innings, Hershiser is
203-145 with a 3.41 ERA. He pitched for the Dodgers from 1983 to
1994 and then pitched for Cleveland, San Francisco and the Mets.
He's been to the playoffs in four of the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a welcomed addition,'' said Dodgers first baseman Eric
Karros, who played with Hershiser from '92 to '94. ``It's good to
have someone come back to the Dodgers who appreciates the Dodgers
and understands the history of the Dodgers and wants to be part of
the Dodgers.''

BY GEORGE, HOMECOMING IS PERFECT TIMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Devean George's first trip home in a Lakers
uniform didn't look like much on the surface: a token one minute
played, no field-goal attempts, no points, no assists. Just a lot
of zeros.
</P>
<P>
   But there was plenty for the Lakers' rookie to rejoice about. He
was briefly reunited with family and friends in his hometown and
had a healthy contingent of 30-plus on hand at Target Center to
watch his brief appearance (which, officially, lasted just 28.4
seconds).
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, George was here to inspect the new, $360,000
home he purchased for his family. The deal will close soon, and the
George family will be able to leave a troubled North Minneapolis
neighborhood for the comforts of a suburb called Champlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out there and looked at the house. . . . Actually (this
trip) was perfect timing,'' George said.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been more perfect for the Augsburg College product
had the Lakers held their 20-point lead over the Minnesota
Timberwolves long enough for him to see some action in front of the
friendly home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we get out there and jump on them,'' he said
wishfully before tipoff. ``If we get a big enough lead, I'm sure
coach will put me in.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson accommodated George with a spell at the end
of the first half, but the Timberwolves made it a game in the
second half, and George was stuck on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Devean's learning basketball and he's learning it the hard
way,'' Jackson said, ``and from where he's come (Division III) to
where he's at now, he's had a lot of growth so far. He's got a
chance to be a player in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, George was just happy to be home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw my family and friends today, saw the people that I've
missed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Fish: Derek Fisher's field-goal percentage has plummeted
ever since he was moved to the bench to make room for Kobe Bryant,
but his offense re-emerged Friday against the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher scored 11 points on 4-of-5 shooting, collected three
rebounds and three assists and played a key role in the Lakers'
29-12 second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on him a little bit about his choice of shots, make
sure that it's a shot that's legitimately coming out of our
offense, not something that's forced,'' Jackson said. ``It's
natural coming off the bench that you're not going to have the same
level of play or be quite as proficient as you were before (as a
starter).
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's also advantages to being an impact player, to
being a spark plug, or giving some things, just because the
(opponent) isn't prepared for you to come out and score. Those are
a couple of the things that I've been watching for him to do.''

GIRL'S CREATION WINS STATE'S ICE CREAM CONTEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Chris Sieroty  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- I scream. You scream. We all scream for Gold
Miner's Dream ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-month taste-off, the frozen creation of
11-year-old Elysa Hill of Woodland Hills in suburban Los Angeles
has been named the official flavor of the California
Sesquicentennial.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's ice cream will be in stores from Eureka to San Diego in
Dreyer's famous half-gallon barrel beginning in mid-January, said
Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream spokeswoman Jennifer Howard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really cool,'' said Elysa, a fifth-grader at Woodlake
Avenue Elementary School in Woodland Hills, who presumably had no
pun intended.
</P>
<P>
   Gold Miner's Dream also will be served at a number of state
functions next year, including at California's 150th birthday party
Sept. 9 in Sacramento. Elysa's mom, Doreen Hill, said, ``The family
has been told to keep that date open and intends to attend as many
events next year as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Elysa: ``It's going to be an opportunity to see a lot of
different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Elysa's winning ice cream is made of mountains of chocolate and
vanilla swirl blazoned with trails of rich milk chocolate and
caramel with hidden toffee nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Union City-based Dreyer's ran a contest to
pick the official ice cream of California. All entries had to
include a creative name and description of the flavor, somehow
based on how the flavor represents the state of California. And it
had to be a flavor the company could produce on a mass scale.
</P>
<P>
   Elysa developed the unique flavor after her teacher at Woodlake,
Verdell Gurnee, passed out entry forms to her class, which had been
studying the California Gold Rush.
</P>
<P>
   After several elimination rounds, Gold Miner's Dream beat out
Hurray for Hollywood by a margin of 56 percent to 44 percent in the
three-month, statewide taste-off to take the crown as California's
official ice cream. ``It's not very often an 11-year-old wins a
contest in which 8,000 people entered,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   There's been an extra side benefit to Elysa's victory. Since her
daughter won the contest, Doreen Hill said, ``I no longer feel
guilty when I eat ice cream.''

BRUINS STRUGGLE TO BEAT EXPANSION ATLANTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's the kind of game that keeps coaches up at night,
the kind that induces nightmares. When your team is struggling, the
last opponent a coach wants to see is the second-worst club in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   In a season that has already proven that nothing will come easy
for the Bruins, there was a little bit of danger associated with
Friday night's matchup against the first-year Thrashers, a club
made up of either young kids just starting out or journeymen who
had changed teammates several times in their careers.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had only one win in their last eight games (1-4-3),
but they prevailed over the game and hard-working Thrashers, 3-1,
at sold-out Philips Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were thrilled to get the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really matter who we're playing against,'' said
Anson Carter, who had two goals and an assist. ``Two points is two
points, and that's the bottom line for our hockey club right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns said he knew it would be tough sledding because
the Thrashers were shut out in their own building Wednesday night
against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't expect a team that just got beat, 4-0, in their own
rink to stand by and watch that go, but we had a lot of chances,''
said Burns. ``I think we kept them to four chances after two
periods and we didn't bury the ones we had again. They're a tough
team to play against.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins knew full well there would be a different flavor and
a different atmosphere than existed in Pittsburgh Tuesday. Against
the Penguins, it was a finesse game, geared toward skating and
trying to prevent Jaromir Jagr and his teammates from being able to
complete their tic-tac-toe maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night was much more rough and tumble. The Bruins knew
they'd be in for a fight with the desperate expansion club. It took
all of nine seconds for the fisticuffs to begin (Bruins right wing
Joe Murphy taking on Atlanta left wing Johan Garpenlov) and the
rough play continued throughout.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Bruins' many objectives was to get on the scoreboard
early. They achieved that at 5:49, with defenseman Hal Gill potting
his second goal of the season, with help from Dave Andreychuk and
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Boston made it a two-goal advantage later in the period, with
Gill setting up the score. Gill, positioned in the right circle,
backhanded a pass across for Carter in the slot. Carter drilled it
past goalie Norm Maracle for the 2-0 lead at 12:42.
</P>
<P>
   About a minute and a half later, the Thrashers rallied to close
the gap to 2-1 on a power-play strike by center Ray Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Dean Sylvester, behind the net, dished a centering
pass out in front. Defenseman Kyle McLaren tried to sweep it away
but missed, and the puck went to Ferraro, who beat Byron Dafoe at
14:11.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had several other offensive opportunities in the
period but Maracle made some tough stops.
</P>
<P>
   Not much changed in the scoreless second period as the teams
continued to bruise each other. Both Maracle and Dafoe were called
on to make some difficult saves. At 12:36, Maracle came up big when
the Bruins had a three-on-two rush. Carter blasted a shot from the
right circle that Maracle saved, and Jason Allison was in the slot
for the rebound but he couldn't bury it as the puck rolled off his
stick.
</P>
<P>
   Just 11 seconds later, Allison came barreling in on Maracle and
tried a backhanded bid, but it hit Maracle in the right arm and he
was able to corral it.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, the Bruins closed it out with Carter's power-play
goal at 19:01 as defenseman Ray Bourque earned his 1,100th career
assist.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe, who had 26 saves, said he was impressed with how hard
Atlanta played.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really work it hard behind the net,'' he said. ``We got
running around a few times, especially in the second. They didn't
get shots on net but there were a lot of chances that went wide.
They crash the net very well. You've got to give them credit, we
knew they'd come hard and they did.''

SPURS BEAT CELTICS

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ There's not much suspense these days with the
Celtics. With two starters ailing, there simply is not a lot of
wiggle room. Whatever room they might have had Friday night
disappeared quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The world champion Spurs finally played the role for most of the
evening and emerged with a 103-94 victory before 17,264 at the
Alamodome. San Antonio took control of things in the middle
quarters and turned it over to the reserves, who almost Heathcliff
Slocumbed it away. Fortunately for the Spurs, Tim Duncan &AMP; Co. had
provided a safe cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan played long enough (35 minutes) and well enough (30
points, 17 rebounds, 5 blocks) to do most of the damage. David
Robinson (12 points, 5 rebounds) sat out the last 16 minutes and
Avery Johnson watched the final 19; the Spurs play Saturday night
in Denver. The victory was the ninth straight over Boston here and
the 11th in the last 12 meetings between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was Boston's eighth straight on the road and fourth in
a row overall. The Celtics are now 10-12 with one roadie left
Saturday night (Houston) in what is turning out to be a week from
you-know-where. Things even got a little testy, when Antoine Walker
and Malik Rose jawed too much for ref Joe Crawford and were tossed
with 5:23 left.
</P>
<P>
   The way Walker was going (2 of 13), he should have blown the
notoriously short-fused Crawford some kisses instead of some
naughty words. He said the matter ``was no big deal'' and ``it's
bound to happen over the course of 82 games.'' Rick Pitino said he
wasn't sure what had transpired, but added, ``You can't do that
with Joe Crawford.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, however, had company in the misery department. Eric
Williams was 3 of 14 and said, ``This was a rough night. I might
not have 30 games like this in my whole career. I got great
looks.'' The Celtics were under 40 percent shooting while the game
was remotely competitive; they finished at 41.1 percent. They did
manage to cause some angst among the Spurs _ Duncan had to go back
in for the final 73 seconds _ when they got to within 6.
</P>
<P>
   But all that really did was unnecessarily lengthen the game (the
fourth quarter took 48 minutes) and succeed in delaying the start
of the epic tilt between Brownsville Pace and Corpus Christi Tuloso
Midway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were kind of desperate,'' said Duncan, who was 7 of 14
from the field and 16 of 18 from the line. ``But to finish a game
like that, you do what you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs didn't break much of a sweat in this one. Coach Gregg
Popovich, who has been critical of the team's ragged play of late,
said, ``The guys played great defense. It was one of our better
games.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio had a 46-35 rebounding advantage, an 8-3 advantage
in blocked shots, and took 54 free throws (22 in the fourth) to
Boston's 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``They dominated us inside,'' Pitino said. ``But our effort was
A-plus and our attitude was A-plus. It's just hard when you get
behind on the road. You have a hard time winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana Barros led Boston with 18, scoring 10 in the fourth as the
Celtics' helter-skelter style forced six turnovers. Tony Battie had
16 and Walter McCarty 15. Adrian Griffin had 13, but came out for
good with 6:45 left after bruising his left knee. He said he'd be
able to go Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio put this one away in the third quarter. The Spurs
led by 10 at the break, thanks mainly to Duncan, who had a 22/7
first half. They led, 58-47, in the third when Robinson started and
finished what turned out to be a game-deciding 10-2 run. He had 6
in the spurt as the Celtics fell behind by 19. It was a 15-point
spread entering the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   It was still a 15-point game with 3:13 left. But the Celtics
kept at it and ripped off an 11-3 run in the next two minutes. It
was now a 7-point game and back came Duncan, who had left with 8:10
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to lose the game trying to get practice, so we
put Tim back in,'' Popovich said.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing had happened when the teams met last month in
Boston. The Celtics threatened. The Spurs' big guys came back and
ended the threat. Duncan returned this time to score 4 more points,
grab two more rebounds, and that was that.

UCLA WOMEN BEAT FULLERTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FULLERTON _ A pulse beats within the UCLA women's basketball
team. It has been faint at times, but Friday, it became stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Vital signs are becoming more normal now that point guard Erica
Gomez has returned.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, playing for the first time since undergoing surgery to
repair a torn labrum, breathed life into her inconsistent team in
sixth-ranked UCLA's 108-75 victory Friday over Cal State Fullerton
before 518 fans. It was the team's highest total since scoring 128
in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez played 15{ minutes and scored 10 points, had eight assists
and two steals. But it was the confidence teammates showed that
made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   In recent games, UCLA (5-2) has had trouble starting fast
against mediocre-to-bad teams like Pepperdine and Fullerton (0-7).
This time, however, Gomez sparked an 8-0 run with three assists and
a basket later in the first half, and UCLA never led by less than
eight again.
</P>
<P>
   Six Bruins scored in double figures, led by Maylana Martin's 22,
Michelle Greco's 18 and Marie Philman's season-high 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to sit on the bench. We looked kind of flat,''
Gomez said. ``I felt really good. I've been anxious to come back,
to get ready for the East Coast trip.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be upcoming games at nationally ranked Rutgers on
Tuesday and No. 1 Connecticut on Thursday. UCLA struggled in its
last two games against ranked teams, so Gomez's return is
fortuitous.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez said Wednesday she couldn't play until she reached her
surgeon in New York, David Altchek. She succeeded in tracking him
down by telephone Thursday night and found him willing to clear
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked how I felt and he asked about my range of motion,''
Gomez said. ``I said I felt fine and I've been going all out for a
long time. He said, `Well, if you're practicing in full, I can't
hold you back.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of faxes later, Gomez's return became official.
</P>
<P>
   She entered the game with 9:53 remaining in the first half and
the Bruins struggling to pull away from a Fullerton team with no
one taller than 6-foot-1.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez's first-half totals: Seven minutes, 10 points, four
assists. While she was in there, UCLA outscored the Titans 26-16
and led 54-45 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   She was just beginning. After entering with 12:44 left in the
second half, Gomez had LaCresha Flannigan, Janae Hubbard, Ayesha
Rembert and Natalie Jarrett on the floor with her.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a lineup that will inspire fear on the coming road
trip, but in 40 seconds, Gomez had three assists and a steal as
part of an 8-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't look like she missed a beat,'' said UCLA coach Kathy
Oliver, who also noted that team also had a slow start from UCLA to
Fullerton because five players had finals that lasted until 2:30
p.m. ``She brings a lot of leadership to her team. As good as she
is, we were a good basketball team that will be a great team with
her.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday
ordered 392 plants in a dozen states, mostly electric generating
stations, to cut in half emissions of chemicals that drift with
winds and add to smog along the Eastern seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   The federal regulators acted at the request of New York,
Connecticut, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, which said they needed
help to meet national smog standards.
</P>
<P>
   The plants are in 12 states, as far west as Indiana and as far
south as North Carolina. Agency officials said they might soon
issue similar orders for plants in Illinois. Most of the plants
meet existing federal limits on the chemicals, nitrogen oxides, and
are in areas that do not exceed smog standards, but now the EPA is
tightening the limits.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 states are West Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Michigan, New Jersey, Kentucky,
Delaware, New York and Indiana. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The states that requested the action are among a group on the
East Coast that had already agreed among themselves to impose the
stricter standard on nitrogen oxide emissions within their borders.
The areas that would for the first time be forced to take action
under Friday's order are in the South and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The areas covered by the action must reduce emissions by 2003 by
a total of about half a million tons a year, all in the summer smog
season, the federal regulators said. The EPA said that compliance
would cost companies, which include Ford, General Motors, Dow
Chemical and most power providers in Ohio, West Virginia and
Pennsylvania, about $950 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Browner, the EPA administrator, said the order would raise
the cost of electricity by about 1 percent above what it would
otherwise have been, but that because of deregulation of the
industry, costs to consumers are still expected to decline.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in several industries, though, said Friday that they
were not sure what compliance would cost. Many executives and state
officials from areas covered by the order denounced it, saying that
they already met strict standards, that Eastern smog was little
affected by Midwestern emissions and that the EPA would ultimately
be rebuffed by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of some of the plants are already in court to block
tighter limits on nitrogen oxide emissions that the EPA proposed
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's track record in court has been poor in the last few
months. In May, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit barred the agency from enforcing a stricter
standard on smog levels, one calculated over an eight-hour period
instead of the current one-hour. In a separate decision, it blocked
the EPA from requiring the states to order a new round of
reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions from sources within their
borders.
</P>
<P>
   So now the EPA is trying a third means.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Browner said Friday in a conference call with reporters,
``Our commitment is to solve the long-distance ozone-transport
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get there, one way or the other,'' she said.
``We are going to get there. We are going to get people clean
air.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The EPA did not rank the plants cited on its list Friday. David
Cohen, a spokesman for the EPA, said the four states that filed the
petitions provided information based on computer modeling and ``we
looked at the broad categories to verify the fact that the sources
were contributors.''
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, one of the states with plants covered by the order,
Russ Harding, director of the Department of Environmental Quality,
said: ``I think it's highly inappropriate for the administrator to
be doing this. It may make good headlines, but it's not going to
solve clean-air issues. She's just creating more lawsuits, wasting
more taxpayer dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Michigan had already been planning to publish new
regulations next month putting stricter controls on nitrogen oxide
emissions, but not as strict as the ones ordered Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At First Energy, the parent company of Ohio Edison, Ralph
DiNicola, a spokesman, said, ``The EPA's own studies have indicated
that under heavy ozone- loading days the Midwest plants contribute
to less than 5 percent of the problem in the industrialized
Northeast cities.''
</P>
<P>
   DiNicola said that in the East, people could see stone statues
eroding, another effect of nitrogen emissions, as they stood next
to roads with ``12 lanes of stalled traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little hard to then take a look at plants 500 miles
away and claim they are the cause of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Browner, the EPA administrator, was not able to say Friday how
many fewer days of ozone violations the East would record with the
new controls in place.
</P>
<P>
   The order uses a procedure outlined in the Clean Air Act
amendments of 1990 under which the states can petition the EPA to
take action against specific smokestacks beyond their borders. The
EPA set out to use the procedure in April, when several states
petitioned, saying they could not meet the strict new ozone
standards the agency had promulgated. But then the appeals court
here held up the new eight-hour standard, and the states withdrew
the petitions, to rewrite them based on the older ozone standard.
Then several industries sued on the basis of the original
petitions. One issue was how much difference a smokestack in
Cincinnati or Detroit could make to the air in Philadelphia or New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania cited vast swaths of
states near and far, and categories of plants within those areas
Massachusetts, the other state whose petition was approved Friday,
named individual plants, some as far away as Michigan. Another four
jurisdictions filed petitions later that are still under review,
including New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the complaining states hailed the order. ``The EPA
has come to the realization that we have come to a long time ago,
that trans-boundary pollution exists, and that there are specific
facilities outside New York's borders that are seriously affecting
quality of air here in New York,'' said William Cahill, New York's
commissioner of environmental conservation.
</P>
<P>
   In 30 years of determined work, government regulators have
forced extensive changes in cars, fuels, power plants and even
hairspray to reduce emissions of chemicals that cause smog. But
paired with 30 years of economic growth, they have not succeeded in
eliminating violations.
</P>
<P>
   At the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit group, David Wooley, a
lawyer, said that the federal limit for smog was 120 parts ozone
per billion parts of air, and that often in the summer, air
drifting into densely populated areas of the Northeast was already
at 90 parts per billion. Health damage occurs even below 120 parts,
Wooley said, so any reduction would be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Others were skeptical. In Marshall, Mich., a town of less than
7,000, situated 100 miles west of Detroit, Maurice Evans, the city
manager, said he doubted that his town's municipal electric plant
could be affecting air in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a small electric utility,'' Evans said. ``We've got
very little pollution that's coming out of that plant.''

DUCKS WIN THIRD STRAIGHT

   ANAHEIM _ The Mighty Ducks have been huffing and puffing most of
the 1999-2000 season. No matter how hard they tried, it seemed like
.500 was their lot in life.
</P>
<P>
   But it's amazing how three consecutive wins can lift a team's
spirits and standing, especially when it hadn't been able string
more than two victories in a row through the first 32 games of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Five times Anaheim had tried, and failed, to win a third game in
a row, but the Ducks overcame that obstacle Friday night with a 2-0
victory over the Chicago Blackhawks in front of 12,632 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The victory wasn't especially artistic, but the Ducks were never
really threatened by the lowly Blackhawks. And once Niclas
Havelid's point shot deflected off Chicago defenseman Sylvain
Cote's stick and broke the spell of goalie Jocelyn Thibault at
12:35 of the second period, the outcome seemed inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The second power-play unit chipped in with a goal by Ruslan
Salei three minutes after Havelid scored, and just like that the
Ducks are tied with Dallas, trail Phoenix and the Kings by only two
points, and are within three of San Jose in the Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's 37 points is its franchise-best total after 33 games.
The Ducks had 34 points in the first 33 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks came into the game tied for fifth in the league in
defense _ allowing 2.25 goals a game. They had given up two or
fewer goals 20 times, but their offense was averaging only 2.6
goals a game and had been limited to two goals or fewer 18 times.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim was 4-12-2 in those games, so Friday's contest was very
much up for grabs when the teams were scoreless after 30 minutes
and Thibault was on his game.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Ducks got some motivation with just under nine
minutes to play in the second period, when Tony Amonte and Pascal
Trepanier came together and the Ducks defenseman hit his head hard
on the ice. After Trepanier fell, Amonte skated by and pushed his
head into the ice for good measure. Trepanier left the ice looking
dazed and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   The play certainly raised the ire of the small crowd, one member
of which was ejected for heckling a Chicago player.
</P>
<P>
   Thibault was brilliant all game, but the Ducks finally broke
through via a combination of hard work and good luck. Steve Rucchin
won a face off, Paul Kariya battled to get the puck back to Havelid
at the point and the defenseman's shot bounced off Cote's stick and
trickled in.
</P>
<P>
   Thibault had no chance on Anaheim's second goal. Matt Cullen did
some good work on the boards to keep the puck in, got a return pass
from Ted Donato and then set up Salei for a shot from the base of
the left circle.

CLIPPERS EDGE WARRIORS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers, who've been going low enough to
eliminate a dachshund at high-stakes limbo, needed a heroic hoop
from Lamar Odom to avoid spinal disaster and survive Friday's date
with the Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game definitely was on the line,'' said the rookie Odom,
who persevered through unreasonably cold shooting to produce 23
points, 13 rebounds and 7 assists. ``Somebody had to make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   And because the NBA says so, somebody had to win.
</P>
<P>
   In a scheduled NBA event that was every bit as compelling as a
spitball fight between Third World nations, the Clippers rang up a
92-91 victory in front of 11,217 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams began the evening 5-17, making it almost impossible
to notice they weren't at full strength. The Warriors had three
injured starters - Mookie Blaylock, Antawn Jamison and Adonal Foyle
- back in Oakland, while the Clips matched them on the grief index
with ankle injuries for Derek Anderson and Brian Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of style, the event lived down to its billing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a pretty game,'' said Clippers coach Chris Ford, who
ranks as an authority on the subject. ``We got some breaks.
Christmas came early.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's start at the 1:11 mark of round four.
</P>
<P>
   That's how much time remained before the Clippers followed
Tuesday's mighty Laker clouting by coughing up a loss against the
weakened Warriors, who held a 91-84 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Golden Stater Chris Mills acquired a double-technical when
Odom was fouled on one of his kamikaze drives to the hoop. ``If I
had it to do again, I hopefully wouldn't do it the same way
again,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Hudson (20 points) drilled both technical free throws. Odom
- who missed 13 of 20 field-goal attempts and 6 of 15 free throws -
nailed his final two from the line, cutting the deficit to three.
</P>
<P>
   Odom stole a pass on the Warriors' next possession, fed Tyrone
Nesby for a hoop, then finished Golden State's collapse with an
8-foot runner with 11 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put the team on his back and made some plays,'' Ford said
of Odom, who's been fighting an 11-game funk. ``At the end, he was
magnificent.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Taylor (26 minutes, 10 points, 6 fouls), who was a few
miles south of magnificent thanks to the flu, said such sensations
are in Odom's job description.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's supposed to do that,'' Taylor said. ``He'll be doing that
here for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some guy named Tony Farmer scored 19 points to lead the
Warriors, who were limited to 39.4-percent shooting by the nasty
Clipper defense. Michael Olowokandi had 16 points and 9 rebounds
for the Clips, who led by 11 in the first quarter and had the
advantage after each quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Odom took it upon himself to make sure they led after the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the guts to make the big plays,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Odom: ``It's just the way basketball has to be played.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Clippers placed Skinner (ankle sprain) on the injured
list Friday and signed journeyman Marty Conlon. The 31-year-old,
6-foot-11 Conlon is in his ninth NBA season and has career numbers
of 6.5 points and 3.5 rebounds per game. He began this season on
the Boston Celtics' roster, but remained on their injured list
(sprained toe) until getting waived Dec. 13.

   ANAHEIM _ The Mighty Ducks have been huffing and puffing most of
the 1999-2000 season. No matter how hard they tried, it seemed like
.500 was their lot in life.
</P>
<P>
   But it's amazing how three consecutive wins can lift a team's
spirits and standing.
</P>
<P>
   Five times Anaheim had tried, and failed, to win a third
consecutive game this season, but the Ducks overcame that obstacle
Friday night with a 2-0 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks in
front of 12,632 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is hungrier than at the beginning of the year, we
want it more,'' Teemu Selanne said. ``It's not enough to win, lose,
win, lose. We are harder on each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Ducks have been more than willing to come to each
other's defense in recent games. Friday, a frustrated Tony Amonte
made questionable hits on Paul Kariya and Pascal Trepanier and both
times he had to answer to Selanne of all people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you have to do,'' the winger said with a grin when
asked about his enforcer role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the guys coming together as a team,'' Ducks coach Craig
Hartsburg said. ``They are standing up for each other and they
actually seem to like these kind of games. This group won't back
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory wasn't especially artistic, but the Ducks and goalie
Guy Hebert _ who posted his 25th career shutout _ were never really
threatened by the lowly Blackhawks. Once Niclas Havelid's point
shot deflected off Chicago defenseman Sylvain Cote's stick and
broke the spell of goalie Jocelyn Thibault at 12:35 of the second
period, the outcome seem inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The second power-play unit chipped in with a goal by Ruslan
Salei three minutes later and just like that the Ducks are tied
with Dallas, trail Phoenix and the Kings by only two points, and
are within three of San Jose in the Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't talk about it, but we are on the right track and know
we can make a push for a top-four playoff spot,'' Hartsburg said.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's 37 points is its best total after 33 games. The Ducks
had 34 points in the first 33 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks came into the game tied for fifth in the league in
defense _ allowing 2.25 goals per game. They had given up two or
fewer 20 times, but their offense was averaging only 2.6 goals and
had been limited to two goals or fewer in 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim was 4-12-2 in those games, so Friday's contest was very
much up for grabs when the teams were scoreless after 30 minutes
and Thibault was on his game.

</P>
<P>
   The play certainly raised the ire of the small crowd, one member
of which was ejected for heckling a Chicago player.
</P>
<P>
   Thibault was brilliant all game, stopping 28 of 30 shots, but
the Ducks finally broke through with a combination of hard work and
good luck. Steve Rucchin won a faceoff, Kariya battled to get the
puck back to Havelid at the point and the defenseman's shot bounced
off Cote's stick and trickled in.
</P>
<P>
   Thibault had no chance on Anaheim's second goal. Matt Cullen did
some good work on the boards to keep the puck in, got a return pass
from Ted Donato and then set up Salei for a shot from the base of
the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks improved to 13-0-0 when leading after two periods
thanks to a scoreless third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we could score more goals, but whatever it takes to
win,'' Selanne said. ``We should never lose when we allow two goals
or less.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks outshot the Blackhawks only 8-7 in the first period,
but Anaheim had the best of the scoring chances. The best come off
a rebound of a hard shot by Kariya that bounced off Thibault's
shoulder. Selanne was looking at a wide-open net, but the puck
bounced over his stick and Thibault was able to get back in
position to stop a shot by Salei.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx,
fragrant white blooms with a pink blush are breaking out on
specimens of a popular landscaping shrub called the Koreanspice
viburnum _ four to five months early. Snowdrops, among the earliest
bulbs to send up shoots when winter ends, have already poked up
their noses. In some New York suburbs, yellow forsythia blossoms
have brought a premature touch of spring to December.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little confusion out there,'' said Wayne Cahilly, an
arborist at the botanical garden, and he expressed no doubt as to
the reason: abnormal warmth. Or is it so unusual? ``I think this
warm weather is becoming normal,'' Cahilly said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it seems that way of late. Last month was the warmest
November in 105 years of record-keeping in the contiguous 48
states, and the fourth-warmest in the Northeast. The trend
continued into December in most of the country; as of Friday, the
average temperature for the month in New York, for example, was 5.7
degrees Fahrenheit above normal.
</P>
<P>
   But that is almost the least of it. Federal scientists reported
last week that in the contiguous 48 states and on other global land
masses, 1999 is certain to join 1998 as one of the two warmest
years on record, continuing a long-term trend toward a warmer
climate that has been especially sharp in the last quarter of the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, this year is turning out to be slightly less warm than
the record year of 1998, the scientists said, because of the
general cooling influence of the phenomenon known as La Nina, a
great pool of cool water that develops naturally from time to time
in the eastern tropical Pacific. Since this year's ocean surface is
cooler than last year's, the average global surface temperature in
1999, which includes both land and water surfaces, is not expected
to reach the 1998 record of about 58 degrees; it will probably rank
as the fifth-highest reading since 1880. Nevertheless, a planetary
heating trend that made the 1990s the warmest decade on record is
continuing.
</P>
<P>
   La Nina's counterpart, the pool of extra-warm Pacific water
called El Nino, imparted an extra shot of warmth in 1998, and the
global temperature had been expected to drop off this year. But
despite La Nina's coolness, the temperature of the Northern
Hemisphere's land masses is turning out to be the second-highest
ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   At 55.7 degrees, for instance, this year's average temperature
in the 48 states is projected to fall just shy of a record 56.4
degrees set in 1998. The projected 1999 average global land
temperature is 56.9 degrees, 1.42 degrees above the average for the
years 1880-1998.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas R. Karl, the director of the National Climatic Data
Center in Asheville, N.C., which reported the latest figures, said
he was surprised at the persistent warmth on land in a La Nina
year. ``We haven't seen anything like this in the observed
temperature record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from their broad effect on global temperatures, La Nina
and El Nino also change patterns of atmospheric circulation, with
strong short-term effects on weather around the world. Last winter,
largely because of La Nina, the Eastern United States experienced
highly variable weather, with stretches of warmer-than-normal
temperatures punctuated by sharp bouts of cold. Overall, warmth
dominated. But it was snowier and colder than normal in the Pacific
Northwest and the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   A similar pattern is forecast for this winter, but there is a
wild card: Although it is too early to tell, federal experts say
that if atmospheric conditions in the North Atlantic develop in a
certain way, the mid-Atlantic coast could see some heavy snow.
</P>
<P>
   The experts say that later next year, other natural fluctuations
in circulation could bring a repeat of last summer's drought in
some parts of the country, including the Middle Atlantic region and
the Northeast, as well as a more active hurricane season.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying these natural machinations of atmospheric behavior _
and possibly modifying them in ways not yet clear to scientists _
is a centurylong global warming trend. The average global surface
temperature has risen by more than 1 degree Fahrenheit in the last
century, according to the federal experts. The dominant scientific
view is that emissions of heat-trapping atmospheric gases like
carbon dioxide, produced by the burning of coal, oil and natural
gas, are at least partly responsible.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last quarter-century, the rate of warming has been
more than double that of the 20th-century average. Karl's group
reported last week that since the mid-1970s, the global temperature
has risen at a rate of about 0.35 degrees per decade, which would
add up to a rate of 3.5 degrees per century. Scientists predict
that the planet will warm by 2 to 6 degrees over the next 100 years
(the best estimate is 3.5 degrees) if emissions of the
heat-trapping gases are not cut.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the world has warmed by 5 to 9 degrees since the
depths of the last ice age, 18,000 to 20,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A warming of 3.5 degrees, experts say, would cause widespread
climatic and environmental dislocations, producing more extreme
weather, raising the global sea level, causing precipitation
patterns to change and shifting climatic and agricultural zones.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The United States experienced record-breaking warmth in both of
the two most recent winters, said scientists at the government's
Climate Prediction Center in Camp Springs, Md. The center predicted
last week that on average, most of the nation will be warmer than
normal over the January-through-March period just ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1997-98, circulation patterns influenced by El
Nino played a crucial role in the warmth. Last winter, different
circulation patterns associated with La Nina had a similar effect.
Both La Nina and El Nino modify North America's climate by changing
the position of the jet stream, the high-altitude river of air that
generally runs from west to east and marks the boundary between
cold northern air and warm southern air.
</P>
<P>
   In a La Nina winter, the jet stream typically plunges down
through Montana and the northern Plains and then into the central
part of the country before curving northeastward. This curve would
normally take place in the East, but in a La Nina year it tends to
take place farther west, leaving the Eastern Seaboard on the warm
side of the warm-cold division marked by the jet stream.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually this whole pattern drifts eastward, bringing cold
weather to the East. An influx of cold northern air is in fact
expected for the latter part of this month in the Northeast, said
Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University.
This progression happens repeatedly. Sometimes in a La Nina regime,
the course of the jet stream temporarily flattens out and whisks
warm Pacific air all the way across the continent. Gadomski said he
would not be surprised if such a nationwide warm spell developed
after the upcoming cold snap passes.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors, too, are shaping the winter, scientists at the
prediction center say. In addition to the general warming of the
atmosphere, for instance, year-to-year flip-flops in circulation
patterns over the North Atlantic can have a major effect on weather
in the Eastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   If this so-called North Atlantic oscillation is typified by low
atmospheric pressure over the ocean, the East tends to be warm. If
high pressure dominates, said Vernon Kousky, a research
meteorologist at the prediction center, the jet stream tends to
follow a southerly course into the ocean in the vicinity of
Virginia and North Carolina. North of that line, big snowstorms can
develop, Kousky said, as happened in 1995-96, a La Nina winter in
which a January blizzard dropped record snows from Washington to
New York, essentially shutting down the nation's capital for days.
</P>
<P>
   The North Atlantic oscillation's effect ``never makes itself
felt till the end of December or early January,'' Kousky said,
adding that forecasters at this point cannot predict its behavior
this winter.
</P>
<P>
   A similar oscillation in the North Pacific may influence next
summer's American weather, he said. The sea-surface temperature
there flips back and forth between warm and cool states similar to
those of El Nino and La Nina, but stays in one phase for several
years. Researchers believe it may recently have flipped into its
warmer state. If it has, Kousky said, it could set off atmospheric
chain reactions next summer that will bring a repeat of last
summer's drought in much of the country's Northeastern quadrant, as
well as a more active Atlantic hurricane season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to alert people to that possibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's drought established records for dryness in the
Northeast, the Middle Atlantic and the Ohio Valley, Karl's group
reported last week. The April-to-July period was the driest or
second-driest in all states from West Virginia to Maine. The
drought was followed by record rainfall as hurricanes Dennis and
Floyd struck the East Coast. Intensified drought and heavier rain
are both expected to result from global warming, although no
particular weather event of any kind can be attributed to it.

<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Dec. 19:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   MACAU-CHINA (Macau) _ Five hundred years of European colonialism
in Asia sputters to a close here this weekend on a desolate,
rain-swept waterfront dredged out of Macau's once-beguiling harbor.
At the stroke of midnight on Sunday, China will reclaim this tiny
enclave from Portugal, raising its red flag over another patch of
Chinese soil and setting the stage for what it hopes will be
eventual reunification with Taiwan. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ELECT (Moscow) _ The race to elect Russia's third
parliament since the end of the Soviet Union has been suffused with
slander, manipulation and unvarnished peculiarity. It is in keeping
with the surreal nature of Sunday's election for the lower house of
parliament, the Duma, that no one sees the Communists _ who are
once again predicted to capture a plurality of the 440 seats at
stake _ as potential victors, or even much of a force. By Michael
Wines.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Moscow) _ Russian paratroopers have cut the
road between Chechnya and Georgia in an effort to block the
southern escape routes for Islamic rebels. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-TERROR-THREATS (Washington) _ Without knowing where, when or
whether something terrible might happen, U.S. government officials
are trying to prepare for the threat of violence at the millennium,
whether at home or abroad. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-U.N. _ Iraq formally rejected the new arms inspection plan
adopted by the Security Council on Friday, and sent demonstrators
into the streets of Baghdad on Saturday to protest what the
government called ``another trick'' perpetrated by the United
States and Britain. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   RWANDA-TRIBUNAL (Arusha, Tanzania) _ Little has been tidy or
efficient in the last four years here as an international court has
wrestled with the incomprehensible: how to mete out blame for at
least 500,000 deaths in Rwanda in 1994. Maybe that is no surprise.
But a furor over the order by appeals judges to release a top
suspect because the tribunal had held him too long before charging
him has made the last few weeks more than difficult for the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   VENEZUELA-CATHOLICS (Caracas, Venezuela) _ Since voters swept
him to power 12 months ago, President Hugo Chavez has quarreled
with and berated nearly every part of the establishment here:
political parties, business leaders and intellectuals. So it was
probably inevitable that he would also end up feuding with the
Roman Catholic Church. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA-QUEBEC (Montreal) _ With popular support for Quebec's
independence in remission, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada
made a bold gamble with his country's future last week by
introducing legislation that lays out Canada's first road map for
national division, but one so littered with obstacles that he bets
the separatists will never follow it. By James Brooke.
</P>
<P>
   KOREA-POLITICS (Seoul, South Korea) _ Frustrated by months of
mudslinging, corruption scandals and legislative gridlock, South
Koreans are demanding an end to the rivalry between the governing
and opposition parties that has mired the political system for
nearly a year. By Calvin Sims.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY-POLITICS (Rome) _ Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
was widely expected to resign after a ``back me or sack me'' speech
following a call from a small coalition partner for the center-left
to dump him as leader. By Alessandra Stanley.

</P>
<P>
   POET-BOOK-BATTLE _ Billy Collins is the most popular poet in
America. And now this very popularity has provoked one of the odder
publishing battles of recent memory, pitting a huge commercial
publisher against a small academic press over a literary poet. By
Bruce Weber. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-COMPUTER-CODE (Waltham, Mass.) _ The government and most of
corporate America have declared that virtually all of their
critical systems will function normally when Jan. 1 arrives. But
because only a portion of most computer code is actually tested to
make sure the year ``00'' will be correctly interpreted, even the
most confident computer managers anticipate at least minor flaws
that cannot be indefinitely ignored. By Barnaby J. Feder.
</P>
<P>
   MD-BOOTCAMP-CLOSING (Baltimore) _ In the face of a looming
scandal, Maryland shut down its once ballyhooed boot-camp regimen
for juvenile offenders last week, providing further evidence of
grave second thoughts across the nation about the ``get tough''
camps avidly favored by politicians during the last decade. By
Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   HOMELESS-PROFILE (San Francisco) _ Every morning when Kathleen
Gray leaves for work, she worries that her van will be gone when
she gets back. And then where will she be? The van is her home. How
Ms. Gray ended up homeless is a complicated story. Such stories
usually are. But in one crucial respect, her case is like those of
many homeless people she meets: She got in a bind, and had no way
to get out of it. No money. No help. By Evelyn Nieves. (With
photo.)
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-WARMING _ Last month was the warmest November in 105
years of record-keeping in the contiguous 48 states, and the
fourth-warmest in the Northeast. The trend continued into December
in most of the country; as of Friday, the average temperature for
the month in New York, for example, was 5.7 degrees Fahrenheit
above normal. But that is almost the least of it. Federal
scientists reported last week that in the contiguous 48 states and
on other global land masses, 1999 is certain to join 1998 as one of
the two warmest years on record, continuing a long-term trend
toward a warmer climate. By William K. Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   MA-BIKEPATH-DISPUTE (Williamsburg, Mass.) _ A
two-and-a-half-mile abandoned rail corridor in this Connecticut
Valley hill town of 2,500 residents is at the center of a heated
dispute between champions of privacy and community. Opponents of a
bike path planned for the corridor where the New Haven &AMP;
Northampton Railroad once ran cast the debate as a property rights
issue. Supporters see narrow-minded self-interest blocking a
project that could preserve the environment, promote health and
help people connect.

the Bush campaign. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-TV _ For politicians the close-up, one-on-one approach
(say a ``60 Minutes'' feature or a ``Meet the Press'' format) can
present a much different image than sound bites from speeches and
debates, and also reaches far more people. By Caryn James.

in October, it represented a remarkable journey from relative

 By BRUCE WEBER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the podium in a makeshift lecture hall at Brooklyn
College recently, Billy Collins was not exactly a commanding
figure. A balding 58-year-old with crows' feet around the eyes, he
looked like the college professor he is, a little weary after
almost 30 years of teaching English at Lehman College in the Bronx.
It was hard to imagine him holding the attention of the 150 high
school students, squirming a bit as they waited to hear him read
his poems.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what happened. Reading in a voice that leavens
gravitas with a hint of mischief _ about a barking dog and
Beethoven or how and why the three blind mice became blind _
Collins had the students in his thrall for nearly an hour. It was
the kind of winning performance that has characterized his
appearances on National Public Radio and that has built a rare
bridge of admiration for his work between serious literary folk and
poetry novitiates.
</P>
<P>
   John Updike is a fan. So are the poets Edward Hirsch and Richard
Howard, and numerous other people as well. It can be argued that
with his books selling briskly and his readings packing them in,
Collins is the most popular poet in America.
</P>
<P>
   And now this very popularity has provoked one of the odder
publishing battles of recent memory, pitting a huge commercial
publisher against a small academic press over a literary poet. It
is an argument about money, with a distinct David-and-Goliath plot,
but it is also about publishing ethics and the right of an author
to determine the direction of his own career.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Random House, the trade publishing giant, signed
Collins to a six-figure contract for his next three books _ an
expression of confidence virtually unheard of in commercial
publishing for a serious poet. The first of the three books, a
collection of new and selected poems called ``Sailing Alone Around
the Room,'' was, until this month, set for publication in February.
Bound galleys have already been printed.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the University of Pittsburgh Press, the
publisher of Collins' previous three books, has denied Random House
permission to reprint the 61 older poems that have been requested
for the new volume.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, said Cynthia Miller, director of the Pittsburgh
Press, is that Collins' books are moneymakers, a relatively rare
occurrence for any academic press that like Pittsburgh is a
nonprofit arm of a university. The press publishes 45 to 50 titles
a year, mostly of scholarly and regional interest (and seven books
of poems), earning revenues of about $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Its three books by Collins _ ``The Art of Drowning'' (1995),
``Picnic, Lightning'' (1998) and ``Questions About Angels,'' a 1991
book from William Morrow that Pittsburgh reprinted last year, have
sold more than 50,000 copies. Ms. Miller said she thought the
Random House collection would include too many poems too soon after
their publication and would diminish Pittsburgh's sales. Citing her
financial obligation to the university, she said that allowing
Random House to proceed would be irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting those sales at risk would be quite wrenching for us,''
she said, after informing Random House last week that the
negotiations were closed. ``We certainly value Billy's work, but
publishing is a collaborative effort. We put a lot of time and
effort into making our books successful, and I don't think it's
unreasonable to get some kind of return on that investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins and Random House dispute the contention that the new
book would threaten sales of the old ones; to the contrary, they
say that all of Collins' books would benefit from the marketing
muscle of a large commercial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to address Ms. Miller's concerns, Collins has offered to
take a reduced royalty if the sales of his Pittsburgh books dip,
and Random House was willing to include the Pittsburgh titles in
its advertising. Random House has offered between $20,000 and
$40,000 for the rights. No one will confirm the exact figure, but,
said Chris Calhoun, Collins' agent, it is still a pittance compared
with the sum Ms. Miller has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pittsburgh asked for a price that was more than double the
advance for Billy's entire three-book deal,'' Calhoun said. ``And
two complimentary review copies.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the University of Arkansas Press, which published
Collins' first book, ``The Apple That Astonished Paris,'' in 1988,
contributed 15 poems to the Random House collection for $751.50.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an infrequent occurrence that an author from an
academic press will attract the interest of a trade publisher. When
that happens, several publishing executives said, it is more or
less expected that the academic presses will make the best deal
they can but not unduly stand in the way of an author's success _
and wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here at Random House this is an anomalous hurdle,
unprecedented for poetry,'' said Mary Barr, the associate publisher
of the Random House imprint. ``It would have been beyond prophetic
for us to predict that Pittsburgh would be this obstinate.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins does not stand to lose his contract. Random House will
publish his three next books, and one of them is likely to be a
``new and selected'' volume, said his editor, Daniel Menaker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller said that down the line, Pittsburgh would be more
likely to relent because its own books would be older and a
collection could draw on more books. But the already completed book
now seems likely to be canceled, an affront to Collins, who says he
feels he has already earned what is generally considered the
special honor of having a ``new and selected'' volume published.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense of timeliness in terms of my own career,'' he
said. ``I have four books to draw on, I'm a poet of a certain age
and a `new and selected' is a kind of milestone.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An unprepossessing but droll man, a lover of jazz and good
whiskey in the manner of a 1950s-style hip intellectual, Collins
lives in Westchester County with his wife, Diane, an architect. The
son of an electrician from Lowell, Mass., he was born in 1941 in a
small New York hospital, where, he likes to say, William Carlos
Williams worked as a pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   He went to parochial schools and Holy Cross College, then earned
a doctorate in romantic poetry at the University of California at
Riverside. For many years, writing was a sidelight in a teaching
career that began ``with this idea I had of myself as a
scholar/gypsy, teaching at Caribbean College and the University of
South Hawaii,'' he said. But he settled in at Lehman in the early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   His poems appeared first in obscure journals like Flying Faucet
Review, and Oink, names he loves to recite (``especially Oink,'' he
said). Later he was published in university publications.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after his first book was published by the University
of Arkansas, his manuscript ``Questions About Angels'' was selected
by the poet Edward Hirsch as a winner of the annual National Poetry
Series competition. It was published by Morrow. That began
establishing his literary reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a remarkably American voice,'' said Richard Howard, a
translator, poetry editor and poet, ``that one recognizes
immediately as being of the moment and yet has real validity
besides, reaching very far into what verse can do''
</P>
<P>
   It was after ``Questions About Angels'' that the University of
Pittsburgh Press approached him. ``And I went with them for two
reasons,'' Collins said. ``First, the Pitt Poetry Series is well
known, with a real litany of first-rate authors. And second because
they have a reputation for always keeping books in print as long as
they are selling.''
</P>
<P>
   The crucial moment for Collins came in early 1997. Pittsburgh
brought out ``Picnic, Lightning'' in January, and within a few
weeks, Garrison Keillor, who had read several of Collins' poems
during the ``Writer's Almanac'' feature on National Public Radio,
invited him to appear on his show, ``A Prairie Home Companion.''
Shortly after that, Collins was interviewed by Terry Gross, the
host of the NPR show ``Fresh Air.''
</P>
<P>
   His book sales spiked sharply; since then, requests from schools
and colleges for his readings have multiplied.
</P>
<P>
   Of Collins' four books, three are among the 16 top-selling
poetry titles at the online bookseller Amazon.com, wedged among
those by writers like E.E. Cummings, Robert Frost and Walt Whitman
(not to mention Jewel and Jim Morrison).
</P>
<P>
   ``As I'm writing, I'm always reader conscious,'' Collins said,
explaining the quick connection to his work experienced by many
readers encountering him for the first time. ``I have one reader in
mind, someone who is in the room with me, and who I'm talking to,
and I want to make sure I don't talk too fast, or too glibly.
Usually I try to create a hospitable tone at the beginning of a
poem. Stepping from the title to the first lines is like stepping
into a canoe. A lot of things can go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was a theme to his work, he continued: ``I think
my work has to do with a sense that we are attempting, all the
time, to create a logical, rational path through the day. To the
left and right there are an amazing set of distractions that we
usually can't afford to follow. But the poet is willing to stop
anywhere. The ur-poem for this is Frost's `Stopping by Woods on a
Snowy Evening.' There's no reason to stop there; the horse knows
that. But the human is willing to stop for some reason that is
beyond the comprehension of the horse. And it's that willingness to
slow down and examine the mysterious bits of fluff in our lives
that is the poet's interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy was on display at his recent Brooklyn College
reading, from the very first poem, ``Another Reason Why I Don't
Keep a Gun in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Narrated in the first person, it is about a neighbor's
incessantly barking dog. For two stanzas it is literal and
descriptive, about how annoying the barking is, how the narrator
puts on a Beethoven symphony full blast to shut it out.
</P>
<P>
   ... but I can still hear him muffled under the music
</P>
<P>
   barking, barking, barking.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the crucial moment, as the poem takes a fanciful leap
that turns its tone toward a gently rueful anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ... and now I see him sitting in the orchestra,
</P>
<P>
   his head raised confidently as if Beethoven
</P>
<P>
   had included a part for barking dog.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on the students was palpable: a perking of the ears
at the invention, a straightening of the posture as the image
resonated, appreciative laughs as though they had been surprised by
an unexpected invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, those were the funniest poems I ever heard,'' one
17-year-old said to the poet afterward. To which Collins, alert to
the context of the compliment, replied: ``Oh yeah? How many
readings have you been to?''
</P>
<P>
   The boy smiled. ``I don't know,'' he said. ``Two?''
</P>
<P>
   The new book from Random House, Collins said, would be an
opportunity to reach readers more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much hand-wringing from cultural quarters about the
sad size of the audience for poetry,'' he said. ``But here I am,
writing poetry that is getting out there, and we've reached this
impediment. It's really frustrating. I'd like to forget all about
rights and permissions and royalties and get back to writing
poems.''

   MACAU _ Five hundred years of European colonialism in Asia
sputters to a close here this weekend on a desolate, rain-swept
waterfront dredged out of Macau's once-beguiling harbor. At the
stroke of midnight on Sunday, China will reclaim this tiny enclave
from Portugal, raising its red flag over another patch of Chinese
soil and setting the stage for what it hopes will be eventual
reunification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Britain's hand-over of nearby Hong Kong two years ago,
which was heralded by years of Chinese anticipation and British
angst, this is not the reluctant surrender of a prized possession.
Portugal tried to give back this enclave of 430,000 people once
before, after the revolution that ended decades of dictatorship in
Portugal in 1974, but China's leaders, consumed by the political
turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, demurred.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Portuguese administration has presided over
Macau's steady deterioration into a louche, vaguely sinister
gambling destination for weekend wagerers from Hong Kong. As feuds
between rival Chinese gangs have terrorized the colony over the
last few years, the economy has withered and Macau has become ever
more hooked on the casinos, which generate more than half of its
tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a local, I'd have to say the Portuguese haven't done a good
job,'' said Eric T.M. Yeung, a prominent Macau businessman who
makes toys. ``But in fairness, they had their own problems and
couldn't pay attention to a little spot of land on the other side
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Chinese official in the future local government, who
asked not to be identified to avoid offending the Portuguese, said:
``Hong Kong is so successful that Hong Kong people always think
they are superior to the Chinese. We are happy in Macau, but I
don't think anyone is proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese officials are keenly aware of their checkered legacy.
They were the first Europeans to colonize in Asia, driven by a lust
for adventure and discovery, and a desire to spread the
Christianity that had helped free Portugal of Moorish, Muslim rule.
But for all the centuries they have lingered here, the Portuguese
have left behind no lasting political culture.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, they have worked diligently to promote
the artifacts, old and new, of 442 years of colonial rule:
meticulously restored buildings in Portuguese pastels, a
state-of-the-art airport and gleaming causeways that connect Macau
with its outer islands.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's president, Jorge Sampaio, said that in the last
decade Macau had taken on many of the hallmarks of a liberal
Western state, including the rule of law, freedom of religion and a
free press. ``Well, it could have been done 300 years ago,'' he
said in an interview on the eve of the hand-over, ``but that was
not the habit of time.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday's ceremony, the departing colonial masters from a
small nation on the other side of the world have produced the
trappings of a momentous occasion. Last week, workers frantically
hammered the last planks on an $8 million pavilion where President
Jiang Zemin of China will take control of the 8-square-mile
territory from Sampaio. Officials say the translucent building is
meant to resemble a Chinese lantern. In truth, it looks more like a
giant, softly lighted bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese have also sought to account for the dark side of
their rule: a stunted political system, with few local Chinese
trained to take over the government, shaky courts, a corrupt police
force, and a democracy movement that can be summed up by the fact
that it has exactly one elected legislator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can build an airport in five years; we can build a bridge
in two,'' said Jorge Alberto Rangel, the secretary for public
administration, who is coordinating the hand-over ceremony. ``But
forming people takes time. We really did what we thought was best
for Macau.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel's sense of conflict is deeply felt. A native Macanese _
part Portuguese, part Chinese _ he comes from one of the colony's
oldest families.
</P>
<P>
   But he also served in the Portuguese Army as an infantry
commander in Guinea-Bissau, in West Africa. There, Rangel witnessed
Portugal's chaotic departure from its African colonies after the
1974 revolution. With no leadership and no capacity to govern
themselves, formerly Portuguese Mozambique and Angola fell into
bloody strife, which in Angola continues today.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in Africa was disaster,'' Rangel said. ``We made
no preparations, like we have here. I believe Macau deserved to
have it done differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's sudden renunciation of empire was not just a tragedy
in Africa. Its retreat from East Timor 25 years ago opened the door
for Indonesia to invade and turn the colony into an unwilling
province. Guerrilla rebels fought the Indonesian army until this
year, when Jakarta unexpectedly agreed to allow the East Timorese
to decide their own future. The Indonesian army left, but not
before reducing much of the territory to cinders and attacking the
Roman Catholic Church, whose strength in East Timor is arguably
Portugal's most lasting legacy there.
</P>
<P>
   Macau was spared such predations, mainly because China
effectively gave Portugal squatter's rights after its seafarers
landed here in 1557. Satisfied as long as the Portuguese paid
tribute, the Chinese allowed them to build a bustling trading post
in the 17th and 18th centuries. Along with the traders came the
Jesuit priests, who used Macau as a base to launch missions into
China. The richly detailed facade of Sao Paulo, the surviving
fragment of a church that burned down in 1831, attests to the
church's deep roots here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that a European power could remain on Chinese
soil for all this time,'' said Fok Kai Cheong, a professor of
history at the University of Macau. ``They survived every kind of
Chinese government: dynastic, xenophobic, nationalistic,
Communist.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Macau kept the peace with China, it could do little
about the thrusting British colony 38 miles across the Pearl River
delta. Hong Kong, which was ceded to Britain in 1842 after the
Opium War, rapidly supplanted Macau as the preferred trading hub in
the region. By the early 20th century, Macau was a backwater known
mostly as a refuge for families fleeing from China's war with
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Macau's next shock came in 1966, when Chinese laborers caught up
in the fever of the Cultural Revolution rose up against the
Portuguese. The unrest was quelled, but it shook Macau's
administrators and soured Lisbon's appetite for its vestigial
foothold in Asia. As the Portuguese retreated, local Chinese _
mostly bankers and traders _ emerged as the de facto powers in the
colony.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among those shadow leaders was Ho Yin, a banker who is revered
by many here for mediating between the Chinese and the Portuguese.
His son, Edmund Ho, was chosen to be the first postcolonial chief
executive of Macau by a Beijing-appointed committee last May.
</P>
<P>
   Like his counterpart in Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, Ho is a
conservative businessman who is not likely to ruffle the feathers
of the Chinese leaders. He even looks a bit like Tung, with
razor-cut hair that would pass muster in boot camp. But unlike the
courtly Tung, he can be blunt.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here on the eve of taking control, Ho, 44, came
across like a big-city mayor who wanted to let people know who was
boss. His target was the Chinese gangs, or triads, which have waged
an ugly war for control of Macau's casinos since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``My basic policy on the triads is that they have to learn how
to behave,'' he said. ``I don't think we'll have to go house to
house, arresting people and putting them in concentration camps.
But they must know how to behave. If you are in the underworld,
learn to keep it under.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho also welcomed Beijing's decision to deploy army troops in
Macau after the hand-over. Portugal had protested the move, noting
that it had withdrawn its troops in 1974. Sampaio even briefly
threatened to boycott the ceremony Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although Ho said the troops would not be used for police work,
he clearly relished having a garrison at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``One major advantage is that I will have psychological support
for making drastic changes in the police,'' he said. ``Because if
they say, `We're not happy, we don't want reforms, we don't want to
do our jobs,' I'll say, `You can just step aside and I'll put in
the soldiers.'''
</P>
<P>
   Remarks like that would cause a tempest in Hong Kong, where
pro-democracy leaders are on the lookout for any authoritarian
tendencies in the government. Among Macau's overwhelmingly Chinese
population, however, they are seen as an overdue return to law and
order.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Most local people don't object to the Chinese army coming to
Macau,'' said Ng Kuok Cheong, the lone pro-democracy member in the
territory's legislature. ``They believe that mainland China can
control crime, but that the Portuguese government can't.''
</P>
<P>
   China is happy that most Macanese see it that way. For Beijing,
the ceremony Sunday is another step in its push to reunify all of
China, including Taiwan, the seat of the Chinese Nationalist
government whose 22 million people seem unlikely to accept any move
that would place them under Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Ng, a soft-spoken former loan officer at the Bank of China who
lost his job because of his politics, said that democracy had
little future in Macau. But he blames that less on China than on
Portugal. ``The British established a pro-Western capitalist elite
in Hong Kong,'' Ng said. ``The Portuguese never did that. Their
primary concern was preserving Portuguese culture.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A magnificent salmon-pink edifice housing the public security
department here attests both to that Portuguese concern and to the
accompanying failure to curb the gang wars that have killed
government officials, scared off tourists and brought gun battles
and car bombings to otherwise tranquil streets.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Macau sentenced its most flamboyant triad leader,
Wan Kuok-koi, to 15 years in prison. It was a victory for the
authorities, who had seethed as Wan strutted around town with an
aura of invincibility. Yet Wan, who goes by the nickname Broken
Tooth, got in some telling last words. As he was being led away, he
screamed at the police: ``You're corrupt. You've taken dirty
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people here believe Wan's demise will end the mayhem. But
they note approvingly that China has arrested hundreds of suspected
triad members in neighboring Guangdong Province. Now, they say, the
new government must figure out how to clean up Macau's casinos,
which have contributed to the crime wave by allowing gangs to take
control of VIP rooms that cater to high rollers.
</P>
<P>
   Cramped, dark and crawling with prostitutes, Macau's casinos are
worlds away from the theme-park ambience of Las Vegas. The gambling
industry is controlled by Stanley Ho, a Hong Kong billionaire who
has held an exclusive government license since 1961. That license
expires in 2001, and Edmund Ho, who is not related to Stanley, has
not revealed whether it will be renewed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For now, Macau's next leader is busy building a government
``from ground zero,'' Edmund Ho notes in a swipe at the decamping
colonials. He is also putting out the word that Macau intends to
remain a distinct enclave, with its own laws and customs. Even he
acknowledges, however, that it will live mostly in memory _
Europe's last foothold in Asia, soon to be lost in the enormity of
modern China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here would like the world to remember that there's a
Macau somewhere in this region,'' Ho said a bit wistfully. ``But we
have to be realistic.''

IN FINAL YEAR 2000 TESTING, FOCUS IS ON SMALLEST FLAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Mass.)  (nk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ The strings of letters and numbers flashing on
his computer screen were unintelligible to Kishore Parwani, but he
knew that each was the name of a computer program with hundreds or
even thousands of lines of code. He also knew something was wrong
because the screen was telling him the code was free of Year 2000
faults, a result as believable as a report that a unicorn had won
the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The programs, sent by one of the nation's largest commercial
real estate companies for testing by Data Integrity Inc., had been
certified as Year 2000-ready by the large software company that
created them. But Data Integrity and other companies that review
code to verify software claims typically find scores, even hundreds
of serious oversights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best clients still have 40 to 50 errors per millions of
lines of code,'' said Richard E. Evans, an analyst with Meta Group
of Stamford, Conn., a consulting firm that provides information on
verification tools and services. ``Half of those could corrupt data
or crash systems.''
</P>
<P>
   That adds up to thousands of potentially serious flaws for
banks, insurance companies and others.
</P>
<P>
   The government and most of corporate America have declared that
virtually all of their critical systems will function normally when
Jan. 1 arrives. But because only a portion of most computer code is
actually tested to make sure the year ``00'' will be correctly
interpreted, even the most confident computer managers anticipate
at least minor flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, as the repairs and testing wind up, Year 2000 is boiling
down to one pressing question: Since stamping out every Year 2000
date problem is impossible, have they at least reduced the caseload
of miscalculations and crashes to manageable levels?
</P>
<P>
   For the real estate company, the mirage of clean code
disappeared when Parwani adjusted his scanning tactics for the
obscure code in which the program was written. A three-day review
of close to 2.5 million lines of the software vendor's supposedly
Year 2000-ready code identified about 250 flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found at least 10 flaws that would have required several
days to fix,'' said a programmer for the real estate company, which
allowed a reporter to observe the procedure on the condition that
it not be identified. ``They would not have stopped business but
they might have interfered with things like tracking how long rents
are overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   While true showstoppers rarely turn up in such inspections, the
number of flaws uncovered naturally raises questions about whether
the government and many corporations are overstating their
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing confidence is probably justified as far as the
New Year's weekend goes, but the longer-term picture is murkier,
according to verification-tool providers like Data Integrity. As
with software flaws in general, system crashes are usually less
troublesome than malfunctions that generate faults that are not be
immediately apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less than 10 percent of the problems we find would cause
something to stop,'' said Scott Hilson, director of technical
support for Reasoning Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif.-based rival of Data
Integrity. ``This is more like termites than an earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 termites might be more dangerous than normal bugs
because signs of the infestation are expected to peak in the first
few weeks of January, when many computer workers are already
stretched thin handling malfunctions that occur as the old year
ends and the new one begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere from 2 percent to 5 percent of computer jobs normally
fail in late December and early January,'' Evans of Meta Group
said. The Gartner Group, a technology consulting firm in Stamford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, thanks to the Year 2000 challenge, even the
normal problems are likely to be more common in coming weeks. In
addition to the Year 2000 flaws, programmers will be wrestling with
other errors inadvertently added to the code during repair efforts.
Based on an examination of 30 years of softward records, Capers
Jones, chairman of Softward Productivity Research Inc. in
Burlington, Mass., predicts that Year 2000 workers have introduced
seven flaws for every 100 they fixed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many computer users bought new software to retire
programs that had date problems. But newly installed software tends
to have more bugs than average.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, vendors like Data Integrity have found contracts
harder to come by than analysts had originally projected. Total
sales for the tools have probably reached about $200 million,
according to industry estimates, but expectations had been higher.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The tools are generally modified versions of programs that find
and repair date flaws. One of their biggest selling points, beyond
blazing speed, is that they scan every line in a program. By
contrast, although running test programs provides a better window
on real-world use, such tests require intricate scripts _ and even
complex simulations, like those conducted by Wall Street in March
and April, can exercise only a small percentage of a large user's
code.
</P>
<P>
   Most verification tools start with vast glossaries of all terms
that might be used for dates in coding and for operations using
them, like tracking how many days a payment is overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Data Integrity's approach is somewhat different. It looks not
for date terms but for coding that indicates a mathematical
operation, like ``compare.'' It then tries to filter out commands
that could not involve Year 2000 errors. But regardless of
approach, users generally pay for verification tools based on the
number of lines of code that will be scanned.
</P>
<P>
   Rates generally run between four to 10 cents a line, with a
typical contract covering hundreds of thousands of lines at a
minimum. ``Price can be a sticking point for some smaller
organizations,'' Burgess said, adding that Data Integrity's
contracts have run from $90,000 to more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that the big computer users in the United
States with comprehensive Year 2000 programs have used either tools
or human checks on 40 to 60 percent of their repaired code. ``Once
you get outside the U.S. and a few countries, you get down to
single digits in how much of the code has been independently
verified,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   The first generation of automated Year 2000 tools in the
mid-1990s was difficult to use. The tools frequently overwhelmed
programmers with lists of potential glitches that on closer
inspection had nothing to do with dates. Many computer users turned
instead to so-called body shops like IBM, CAP Gemini and Keane,
which relied more heavily on human programmers than automation for
verifying code.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the tools now have better filters, but programmers
acquainted with how the code is used must still determine which of
the flaws are worth investigating.
</P>
<P>
   As Data Integrity's contract with the real estate company
demonstrated, the independent verification business has not dried
up even though January is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   But many prospective clients are suffering from ``Y2K fatigue,''
Burgess said. ``At the end of October, they started saying it was
too late to do anything more.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Today, the rooms in Data Integrity's office in a business park
near Route 128 outside Boston are mostly empty. But it is not
because the company is shriveling as demand for its main product
slows. The office is a new one that the company moved into
anticipating adding to its staff of 30 next year as its tools, like
those of its rivals, are adapted to cleaning up other faults in
software. Thanks to Year 2000, they should get at least a chance to
make pitches to most of the world's biggest computer users.

MARYLAND QUITS BOOT CAMP PROGRAM FOR YOUNG OFFENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Colo., N.D., Ariz., Fla., Calif., S.D.)  (mk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ In the face of a looming scandal, Maryland shut down
its once ballyhooed boot camp regimen for juvenile offenders last
week, providing further evidence of grave second thoughts across
the nation about the ``get tough'' camps avidly favored by
politicians during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   After an emergency investigation concluded that there was a
pattern of guards' punishing teen-age inmates with roughhouse
abuses, Gov. Parris Glendening suspended the paramilitary methods
and trappings at the state's three camps and removed his top five
justice executives. At the same time, 14 of the
quasi-drill-sergeant camp guards were suspended as criminal and
civil rights investigations began. One guard has already been
charged with child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trust of the people of Maryland has been violated,'' the
governor declared as the scandal, spurred by a series of articles
in The Sun newspaper, reached crisis proportions with a Baltimore
judge intervening to remove 26 juveniles from the camps and
expressing ``grave concern'' at the teen-age offenders' many
complaints about abusive guards.
</P>
<P>
   The boot camp approach to juvenile criminals, based on enforcing
rugged military-obedience techniques of verbal and physical
regimentation, has been adopted in recent years in many states
frustrated by youth crime. But lately some of the 52 boot camps
housing 4,500 juveniles across the country are being scrutinized
because of instances of excessive force and, even more, because of
mounting research findings that the camps, for all their attempts
at esprit de corps and rigid discipline, offer no improvement on
traditional detention methods.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, where a former Marine received national attention in
pioneering the boot camp approach, the state decided this month to
begin phasing out its five boot camps after a stinging conclusion
by the U.S. Justice Department that ``the paramilitary boot camp
model is not only ineffective, but harmful'' to juvenile offenders.
Colorado, North Dakota and Arizona have also dropped their
programs, while Florida and California are scaling theirs back.
</P>
<P>
   Official doubts have been growing in the face of some notorious
examples of abuses. In South Dakota, Gina Score, a 14-year-old
convicted of shoplifting, died from heat exhaustion after her drill
instructors concluded that she was faking illness during a forced
march. Last year, Nicholaus Contreraz, a 16-year-old convicted of
robbery, died in an Arizona boot camp after being punished for
discipline violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boot camps are just the crisis of the day,'' said Jann
Jackson, executive director of Advocates for Children and Youth, a
private justice agency, who served here on the governor's emergency
investigation of the camps. ``It reflects far deeper systemic
problems in a justice system that has been failing kids for years
from the moment of intake to after-care.''
</P>
<P>
   Various juvenile justice and welfare advocates said in
interviews that Maryland officials had received repeated earlier
warnings of widespread problems in youth detention centers but had
ignored them until The Sun reported a pattern of abuses by boot
camp guards and pressed political leaders for reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening and Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who is
charged with overseeing the criminal justice system, announced the
firings on Thursday after a week of front-page accusations that
teen-agers were struck and gratuitously humiliated by overzealous
guards in the three years of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boot camp is a model that lends itself to abuses,'' said
Jim McComb, chairman of the Maryland Juvenile Justice Coalition, a
group of professional specialists that was warning of problems long
before the current scandal. There is no evidence that the camps do
any good, McComb said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why take the risk of abusing children to defend the camps?''
he asked after Glendening asserted that, despite current problems,
a way might yet be found to make the boot camp an effective tool.
</P>
<P>
   Various members of the coalition opposed to boot camps expressed
concern that the Glendening administration would retain a ``get
tough'' philosophy to protect itself politically, while leaving
unsolved large and expensive problems, like crowding, throughout
the juvenile system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answers go far beyond firing five people,'' said Vincent
Schiraldi, executive director of the Center on Juvenile and
Criminal Justice. For all the news media attention to the boot
camps, Schiraldi said, state officials have long been warned about
less dramatic problems at the Cheltenham detention center, where,
he said, 100 detainees were sleeping crowded into a day room
designed for recreation by 26 people.
</P>
<P>
   In a national study of recidivism this year by the Koch Crime
Institute, a research organization in Topeka, Kan., the rates for
juveniles from boot camps ranged from 64 percent to 75 percent,
while the rates for those from traditional detention centers was 63
percent to 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were aware of the boot camp problem and terminated seven of
the guards even before this brouhaha,'' said Jack Nadol, Maryland's
deputy secretary of juvenile justice, who refused to resign and was
fired by the governor. ``I think the articles sensationalized the
problem and didn't show the kids who have gone on to college or the
military.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Nadol conceded in an interview that the camps failed to
have on-site monitors of the guards' behavior and that a boot camp
supervisor, empowered to use force against abrasive detainees under
limited circumstances, ``can get carried away with his sense of
influence and power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was some abuse,'' Nadol acknowledged, while
emphasizing that when the camps were first unveiled in an
optimistic burst of publicity, the assigned detainees consisted of
``the best that was out there, and we rejected the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon drug abusers and ever-tougher cases were assigned to
the camps, he said, putting added pressure on supervisors to
maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not excusing abuses,'' he said, ``but the real systemic
problem in the agencies is that we do not have enough mental health
treatment, substance abuse treatment, and a whole range of
after-care that is lacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadol insisted that his was a token firing and he said he
intended to pursue the cause from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is people will get their 20-second sound bites and
the whole thing will disappear,'' he said, echoing the concern of
system watchdogs like McComb, the head of the state juvenile
justice coalition and director of the Maryland Association of
Resources for Families and Youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, the department of juvenile justice for 15 or 20
years has done nothing to respond to all the symptoms of trouble,''
McComb said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So here's the real test: to see if they do something more than
fire a secretary who never had a true background in juvenile
justice,'' he said of the ousted state justice secretary, Gilberto
de Jesus. ``The systemic problems have lasted through the best and
worst of secretaries.''

CRISIS POINTS UP TOUGH CHOICES FOR TRIBUNAL ON RWANDA

<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania _ Little has been tidy or efficient in the last
four years here as an international court has wrestled with the
incomprehensible: how to mete out blame for at least 500,000 deaths
in Rwanda in 1994. Maybe that is no surprise. This is the first
time the world has formally prosecuted the crime of genocide, the
attempt of one people to exterminate another.
</P>
<P>
   But a furor over the order by appeals judges to release a top
suspect because the tribunal had held him too long before charging
him has made the last few weeks more than difficult for the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The chief judge,
Navanethem Pillay, put her worries bluntly the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a crisis,'' she said. ``We really have to worry what
is the future of this tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the starkest terms, the tribunal faces a difficult choice:
either prosecute suspects as harshly as Rwanda wants and risk its
judicial integrity, as the appeals judges see it, or worry strictly
about legal issues and risk having Rwanda cut off its help
permanently. While unlikely, that move would mean an end to the
tribunal, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   There are many problems, but the case of the suspect, Jean-Bosco
Barayagwiza, has heightened concerns about the court's independence
and unveiled a conflict between blind justice and the realities of
prosecuting crimes committed in a time and place as ugly as Rwanda
was in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is much sympathy for Rwanda's anger over the case,
many analysts say Rwanda's leaders have another agenda: to show
their power over the tribunal and keep at bay any prosecution for
their own excesses during that time.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis began in November, when appeals judges at The Hague
ordered the release of Barayagwiza, a minister in the previous
Rwandan government who helped set up a radio station used to incite
violence against the Tutsi. The appeals judges said prosecutors had
violated his human rights by keeping him in jail too long without
charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing less than the integrity of the tribunal is at stake in
this case,'' the judges wrote. ``Loss of public confidence in the
tribunal, as a court valuing human rights of all individuals _
including those charged with unthinkable crimes _ would be among
the most serious consequences of allowing the appellant to stand
trial in the face of such violations of his rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The government of Rwanda _ currently led by ethnic Tutsi who in
1994 defeated the Hutu government that was behind the genocide _
was outraged. It immediately suspended cooperation with the
tribunal, a blow because nearly every witness must travel here from
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Though they later relented, Rwandan officials in fact refused a
visa last month for the new chief prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte. As
she waited for her visa, Mrs. Del Ponte made clear just how
dependent the tribunal is on Rwanda's help to prosecute nearly 40
suspects in detention here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't get cooperation with Rwanda, I can open the door of
the detention unit and set them all free,'' she said in an
interview in this northern Tanzanian town, where the tribunal is
based. ``Second, I can close the door to my office. Without Rwanda
I can do nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan officials argue strongly that Barayagwiza, who is still
being held, must face his day in court, regardless of the excessive
imprisonment the judges found before he was charged: from May 1996,
when he was arrested in Cameroon, to October 1997, when he was
indicted by the tribunal. (The prosecutors argue that the tribunal
is not to blame because he was being held at Rwanda's request, not
theirs, for much of that time.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If one would weigh the potential injustice to one man against
the injustice to millions of people, a strictly legal
interpretation of the issues would not be one to make,'' said
Richard Sezibera, the Rwandan ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one wanted to make a comparison _ that is not explicitly
accurate but indicative _ it would be like releasing Goebbels of
Nazi Germany on a technicality,'' he added. ``And that is not
acceptable. It should not be acceptable to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ((Indeed, the international community would like to avoid any
further accusation of callousness toward the events in Rwanda. On
Thursday, a report by an international panel held the United
Nations and its leading members responsible for failing to prevent
or end the genocide.))
</P>
<P>
   Though relations between Rwanda and the tribunal had improved
before last month, Rwandans still complain that the tribunal here
does not get sufficient attention because the same chief prosecutor
is also responsible for prosecuting war crimes in the Balkans. They
have also been angry that only six cases have been resolved in four
years.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rwandans are clearly concerned about the precedent the appeals
decision could set; four suspects have either filed for release on
similar grounds or say they intend to. This includes perhaps the
most sought-after suspect, Col. Theoneste Bagosora, considered to
have been the military organizer of the mass killings.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts Rwanda's stated concerns. But many experts believe
that the country will not break its cooperation because it would
then have to spend its own meager resources tracking down suspects
and having them extradited from countries that might be reluctant
to send suspects to Rwanda, where they could be put to death. (The
maximum penalty at the tribunal is life in prison.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rwanda's own prisons and courts are already swollen
with nearly 125,000 suspects whose cases are also being prosecuted
at an agonizingly slow pace.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here suspect, however, that Rwanda has been flexing
its muscles to send a message to the tribunal over one of the most
sensitive chapters of the genocide's history: massacres by the
Tutsi rebels who overthrew the former Hutu government and ended the
genocide. Human Rights Watch estimated the number of people they
killed to be at least 25,000 to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   What to do about Tutsi commanders who committed atrocities
clearly concerns the prosecutor's office. Tribunal officials say
they want to be viewed as an impartial international court, not a
``court of the victors'' as at the Nuremberg trials after World War
II. As she retired this fall, the former chief prosecutor, Louise
Arbour, said ``both sides'' should be investigated for crimes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A court official here, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
recently made a point of raising the issue of prosecuting Tutsi
soldiers. ``It will be incumbent on the court, if and when that
time comes, to have some spine,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Sezibera, the Rwandan ambassador, said his country does not
oppose the tribunal's right to prosecute anyone. ``There is no
doubt that they have a very clear mandate,'' he said. ``They should
go and fulfill that mandate. The government of Rwanda has nothing
to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As a condition for cooperating again, Rwanda has demanded a
reversal of the Barayagwiza decision. That condition is impossible
to meet, in part because the tribunal is not one entity. Rather it
is a mix of institutions _ prosecutors, administrators, trial
judges and appeals judges _ each with its own interests and agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Pillay, for example, has said flatly that the judges will not
trade prosecutions for Rwanda's cooperation. ``We will not be
influenced by any outside factors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she reportedly disagrees with the decision, she
noted that Rwanda itself had asked for ``an independent tribunal,''
and it should have patience with it. ``They didn't ask for a lynch
mob,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Mrs. Del Ponte has taken the unprecedented step of
asking the appeals chamber to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   But then there are the interests of the appeals chamber itself.
The language of the decision suggested that it was punishing the
prosecution and demanding a quicker pace to the trials.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors have in fact come under the most criticism for
incompetence; the judges regularly reprove them from the bench. But
court officials argue that their mistakes were largely growing
pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996 the tribunal was on a learning curve,'' said Kingsley
Moghalu, a tribunal legal adviser and its chief spokesman,
mentioning the year Barayagwiza was arrested. ``That sort of thing
would not happen now.''

SOUTH KOREANS FRUSTRATED BY POLITICAL SQUABBLING 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Frustrated by months of mudslinging,
corruption scandals and legislative gridlock, South Koreans are
demanding an end to the rivalry between the governing and
opposition parties that has mired the political system for nearly a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, traffic on the Sogang Bridge, a major transit link
here, ground to a standstill as motorists watched an unidentified
man scale the main supports and unfurl a banner that called for
reforming political system.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks earlier on a street corner, a group set up an ice
sculpture that depicted the National Assembly Building and offered
mallets to passers-by who readily smashed the ice to protest the
frozen state of relations in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has got to be the most vicious political fighting that
I've ever seen,'' Moon Jung-in, a professor of political science at
Yonsei University, said of the governmental gridlock. ``The worst
part is that there seems to be no compromising, no politics of
negotiation. Our current politicians have turned the possible into
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the crisis is a no-holds-barred battle between
President Kim Dae-jung's party, the National Congress for New
Politics, and the Grand National Party, the main opposition, for
votes in a parliamentary election scheduled for April.
</P>
<P>
   Few Koreans would argue that either party has behaved properly.
Each has hurled accusations against the other, followed by libel
charges and countercharges. In the last month, the rival parties
have filed eight defamation suits against each other.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most tantalizing scandals was the so-called furgate
affair, in which prosecutors have accused the wife of an insurance
tycoon of having tried to influence government policy by giving fur
coats and other expensive clothes to the wives of top officials.
</P>
<P>
   A former justice minister, Kim Young-jae, was arrested recently
and charged with illegally altering a secret government report on
his wife's involvement in the scandal. The opposition has contended
that a cover-up goes all the way to the president's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, the story was a simple corruption scandal,''
said Lee Shim-bom, an opposition legislator and frequent critic of
Kim. ``But now it's Watergate.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the fury, the legislative session has been deadlocked,
and decisions on important bills on the national budget, political
reform and other issues have been delayed. But the assembly
steering committee managed to pass a bill that raises assembly
members' salaries 14.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interparty squabbles have been going on for some time in
Korea, but today's verbal battles are so fierce that they are
keeping the legislature from passing important reforms,'' said Kim
Mi-young, a staff member of the Citizens' Legislative Committee, a
watchdog group. ``The legislators don't seem to have the ability to
put the public interest above their own selfish aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   A central figure in the jousting has been Chung Hyung-keun, an
assemblyman from the Grand National Party who is widely viewed here
as having made unfounded statements for political gains. At an
outdoor rally, Chung set off a furor when he accused the president
of using Communist guerrilla-style tactics in dealing with
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The governing party has accused Chung, a former senior officer
for the National Security Planning Agency, of operating, from his
office, a private intelligence team that consists of former
colleagues. At an assembly session in November, Chung released a
report that accused the government of trying to censor newspapers
critical of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Chung denied using former intelligence agents
to investigate officials from the governing party. He said he had
acquired much information on corruption from disgruntled employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the recent scandals reveal the true face of the
Kim Dae-jung administration, which had been covered under a veil
until now,'' Chung said. ``Today in Korea, it's very difficult to
differentiate between the true proponents of human rights and
democracy and those leftists who have covered themselves under a
mask.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said that scandals uncovered by the
opposition in recent months had damaged Kim's credibility and that
his coalition government could lose its majority in the assembly in
April. The president has publicly said he wants the corruption
allegations to be fully investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Korean people had a lot of expectations when President
Kim's `people's government' was launched two years ago,'' Kim of
the watchdog group said. ``But in reality the promises that the
president made have failed to materialize, and this has led to a
lot of disappointment.''

DRUG USE AMONG ADOLESCENTS LARGELY UNCHANGED IN 1999 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After receding modestly for two years, the use of marijuana and
other illicit drugs by American adolescents remained largely
unchanged in 1999, according to the latest findings in an annual
national study that is the leading barometer of teen-age substance
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The White House director of national drug policy, Gen. Barry R.
McCaffrey, said the study was encouraging because its findings
confirmed that a resurgence in drug use since 1992 had been
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now the third year in a row where a well-focused
education campaign has moved youth attitudes and behavior,''
McCaffrey said on Friday at a news conference in Washington, where
the results of the study were announced. ``We now appear to have a
trend line where the period of increased drug use is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, he noted, is the first to be conducted since the
government began its $195 million media campaign earlier this year
to discourage young Americans from experimenting with illicit
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The only significant increase involved Ecstasy, a synthetic drug
with a niche at nightclubs and dance parties. Eight percent of the
high school seniors surveyed said they had tried the drug, compared
with 5.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey expressed alarm at the use of steroids by teen-age
boys, which rose to 2.8 percent of sophomores, from 1.9 percent
last year, and to 2.5 percent of eighth-graders, from 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The study drew upon confidential questionnaires that 45,000
students from around the country filled out earlier this year.
Lloyd D. Johnston, who conducts the annual study at the University
of Michigan's Institute for Social Research, analyzed the responses
with his colleagues, Jerald G. Bachman and Patrick M. O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 14,100 high school seniors polled, 54.7 percent
reported having tried an illicit drug, which was slightly more than
the 54.1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 17,300 eighth-graders asked, 28.3 percent said they
experimented with an illicit drug, a decline from 29 percent last
year. The drop in drug use reported by eighth-graders is considered
a potential indicator that drugs may be losing their attraction for
the newest group of teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana remained the drug primarily used by adolescents. Among
high school seniors polled, 49.7 percent said they had tried
smoking marijuana, while 40.9 percent of sophomores and 22 percent
of eighth-graders said they had done so.
</P>
<P>
   In a more precise indicator of current use, 25.9 percent of
seniors surveyed said they had smoked marijuana in the last 30
days, an increase of three-tenths of 1 percent from last year.
Monthly marijuana use among eighth-graders remained unchanged, at
9.7. percent.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol remained far more popular among adolescents, with 62.3
percent of seniors, 48.9 percent of sophomores and 24.8 percent of
eighth-graders reporting that they had been drunk at least once.
</P>
<P>
   Binge drinking, defined as consuming five alcoholic drinks in a
row, was a particular problem. Thirty-one percent of the seniors,
26 percent of the sophomores and 15 percent of the eighth-graders
sampled said they had been binge-drinking within the previous two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While this reflected a slight rise among sophomores and
eighth-graders, the prevalence of binge drinking has remained
fairly constant since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Experimentation with cocaine rose slightly, to 9.8 percent of
seniors from 9.3 percent last year, and for sophomores, to 7.7
percent from 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Heroin use remained flat for the third consecutive year, with
2.3 percent of sophomores and eighth-graders but only 2 percent of
seniors saying they had tried heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The use of inhalants continued a decline that started in 1996.

GORE PUSHES BRADLEY BACK IN THE NEW YORK RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
(See also BUSH-CAMPAIGN) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He pronounces Israel as ``Iz-rul,'' and plays a bit
of the country rube.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just shakin' hands with ya and talkin' briefly to each one of
ya reminded me of what a diverse group this is, what a powerful
group this is.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is mixing it up, in his own way, on the Upper East Side.
He is talking to about 75 people who are forking over $1,000 each
for his presidential campaign. They are all crammed into the living
room of John and Margo Catsimatidis, the Red Apple supermarket
chain family and a force in the Greek-American community.
</P>
<P>
   The aw-shucks foot-shuffling and grand generalities help Gore
avoid the kind of specifics that have landed Hillary Rodham Clinton
in such hot water locally. And his charm offensive is helping him
smooth over some of the campaign's rough edges.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gore has pulled off a minor New York miracle. He
has united virtually all of the state's Democratic establishment
behind him, with the notable exceptions of Sen &UR; . &LR;  Daniel Patrick
Moynihan and Rep &UR; . &LR;  Jerry Nadler of Manhattan. And after months of
being clobbered in the polls here by former Sen &UR; . &LR;  Bill Bradley of
New Jersey, Gore has pulled statistically even with him. The latest
poll, conducted by Quinnipiac College and released last week, put
Gore at 42 percent and Bradley at 39 percent. This reversed the
findings in November, which had Bradley at 47 percent and Gore at
38.
</P>
<P>
   New York, where he was swamped in 1988 by fierce ethnic
rivalries and lost a searing primary that shredded his presidential
aspirations, still seems to have the vice president a little off
balance. This time, as he seeks the Democratic presidential
nomination, his approach is diffident. He reverts mentally to the
hog-slopping days of his Tennessee summers.
</P>
<P>
   While he takes on local issues elsewhere _ he has faced down
angry Microsoft employees in Seattle with his support for antitrust
laws _ here in New York he tends to offer platitudes and avoid
specifics. He is content to extol the virtues of the shining lamp
that America lifts to immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has carefully sidestepped some of the pitfalls that Mrs.
Clinton, who is running for the Senate, has plunged into. He has
refused to say what he thinks of President Clinton's grant of
clemency to a group of Puerto Rican nationalists, even though a
White House memo suggested that the clemency could help Gore with
Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, at a fund-raiser at the Brooklyn home of Abe
Biderman, a former city official prominent in the Orthodox Jewish
community, Gore fudged a question about whether the president
should pardon Jonathan Pollard, the Israeli spy, whom Israel wants
to serve out his time in Israel. Gore also skirted a question about
moving the U.S. Embassy now in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. (He did,
however, express his opposition to school vouchers, a position he
is advertising in a commercial in New Hampshire and one that would
have been hard to duck.)
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development and
one of Gore's closest advisers, as well as the son of the former
New York governor, Mario Cuomo, beams when discussing Gore's ginger
steps. ``Better you tiptoe through the tulips now than you step on
a land mine,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, Gore knows that soon enough he will have to
become more specific on matters like the homeless, immigration and
various ethnic policies that are not priorities in the early voting
states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Gore's New York campaign was widely acknowledged
to be disorganized and inept, with too many power brokers fighting
for a piece of the action. He was openly criticized by the likes of
Rep. Charles Rangel of Manhattan, who supports him, for failing the
basics of New York Politics 101 _ touching bases and assuaging the
egos.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was also hurt by the terrain. New York is Bill Bradley's
home court and, along with New Hampshire, represents one of
Bradley's best states. Bradley is relying on decades of exposure as
a star player for the New York Knicks and as a senator from
neighboring New Jersey to ignite support from New York voters. He
has delivered policy speeches here, and he staged his splashiest
fund-raising event of the season at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, Gore upended his national campaign and became a
more aggressive candidate, pointedly deconstructing Bradley's
health care and budget plans as budget busters that would undermine
the nation's Medicare and Medicaid systems and force a tax
increase.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some Bradley supporters, like Nadler, think the numbers have
flipped because Bradley has appeared lax in responding to Gore.
Nadler says Bradley needs to be more aggressive, even at the risk
of undermining his above-the-fray image. ``Bradley has answered the
attacks factually, but not politically,'' Nadler said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nadler says that the reason he supported Bradley over
Gore in the first place remains valid _ that Bradley has a better
chance than Gore of capturing New York against a Republican next
fall. And the polls that match each of the two Democrats against
George W. Bush bear him out.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, for the first time, the campaign was holding
simultaneous rallies in eight cities across the state to spur
volunteers to help Gore qualify in all of the state's 31
congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the pep talks were Karenna Gore Schiff, the candidate's
daughter, in Syracuse; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental
lawyer and son of the late senator, in Rochester, and Rangel in
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Raising money in New York has not been the problem for Gore that
some predicted it might be with Mrs. Clinton also competing for New
York dollars. In fact, both he and Bradley have raised more money
from the Upper East Side _ specifically ZIP code 10021 _ than they
have anywhere else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When his campaign hit the rocks earlier this year, Gore had been
coasting on a message aimed at suburban swing voters, bemoaning the
hassles confronting two-career couples and warning about suburban
sprawl. Now he is talking to the base of the Democratic Party,
sounding the alarm that Bradley would cut Medicaid, disregard
public education and raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is de-emphasizing his suburban strategy,'' said Lee
Maringhoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion.
``What he needed to do was establish some Democratic party roots.
Now he's proposing federal intervention into education. It's a long
way from where he was six months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   This has not gone unnoticed in the Bradley campaign. ``Gore is
trying to do what organizational Democratic candidates do _ go hard
and singularly at the traditional Democratic constituency,'' said
Michael J. Del Giudice, a co-chairman of Bradley's New York
campaign.

<P>
   A few years ago, Robert Ray was one of dozens of young federal
prosecutors in New York who spent their days trying to put drug
dealers and organized crime figures in prison, with little apparent
prospect of a coveted change of assignment to one specializing in
white-collar crime.
</P>
<P>
   So when he replaced Kenneth Starr as independent counsel in the
investigation of President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton in
October, it represented a remarkable journey from relative
obscurity to sudden prominence and enormous power.
</P>
<P>
   In his new role, Ray, a 39-year-old lawyer with no obvious
political predilections, will have the last say on whether either
of the Clintons should be indicted. In addition, he will be the
ultimate editor of the final report of the investigation, a
document that could have a profound effect on Mrs. Clinton's Senate
campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with the operations of the Office of the
Independent Counsel said Ray was working against an undeclared but
firm deadline of Aug. 1 to make those and other major decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Starr, who had never been a prosecutor or tried a case,
Ray is a member of that distinct species in the law _ career
prosecutors, people steeped in a culture aimed at bringing down the
bad guys while valuing zeal tempered with discretion.
</P>
<P>
   In that role, Ray built a reputation in New York as an
aggressive prosecutor with an enviable rate of success. But he was
also on occasion scolded by federal judges who warned him that he
had come close to the line in his eagerness to put people in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, for example, Ray and a colleague were admonished by
Judge Louis Freeh, now the director of the FBI, for their use of a
witness whose testimony was questionable. Another judge once
complained angrily that Ray had improperly tried to trick a witness
into giving information.
</P>
<P>
   But in his six-year tenure as a federal prosecutor, Ray also won
many admirers. In one complex heroin case, he was responsible for
the conviction of 48 defendants. The judge, Leonard Sand, recalled
that the case went smoothly under Ray. ``He was unflappable, no
histrionics,'' Sand said. ``From a professional standpoint, it was
a pleasure having him before me.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to Washington in 1996 to handle the trial work for
Donald Smaltz, the special prosecutor investigating Mike Espy,
Clinton's first agriculture secretary. There is wide agreement in
the legal world that the Espy case was a trouble-filled
prosecution. Espy was acquitted of all charges concerning
accusations that he accepted gifts from people in the industries he
was regulating, while some lesser figures were convicted. Defense
lawyers complained and a judge agreed that one of the cases was
wrongfully brought in California rather than in Washington, simply
to avoid a mostly black jury.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's role in those matters remains unclear. ``I respect Bob
Ray,'' said Elliot Peters, a former federal prosecutor in New York
who represented one of the defendants in the Espy investigation.
``But the Smaltz thing was a very ugly and unproductive exercise
and cannot be a positive in his resume. I think it's a vehicle to
question his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   William Jeffress Jr., who represented Archibald Schaffer, a
Tyson's Food executive who was convicted of a crime similar to the
one with which Espy was charged, complained that the prosecution
lacked even-handedness. ``The whole thing is topsy-turvy.
Prosecutors don't ordinarily proceed that way,'' Jeffress said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecutors make judgments all the time,'' Ray said in
response. ``People are always saying, `Why are you picking on
me?''' He said the fact that Espy was acquitted and Schaffer
convicted is out of the hands of the prosecutor. ``Ultimately it's
up to the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   A judge recently granted Schaffer a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ray joined the U.S. attorney's office in February 1989 after
being offered the job by the U.S. attorney at the time, Rudolph
Giuliani, now the mayor of New York and a probable candidate for
the Senate against Mrs. Clinton. But Ray never worked under
Giuliani, who left the office before Ray reported for work.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's associates jumped on the nominal association
with Giuliani to question Ray's fitness for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that I came to Washington with a mission to get the
Clintons is mistaken,'' Ray said in an interview, angrily
dismissing that speculation. ``It's just baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert William Ray was born on April 4, 1960, in Frankfurt,
Germany, the son of a colonel in the Army. After graduating from
Princeton he went to Washington and Lee law school in Virginia. His
first job after working as a clerk for a federal judge in New York
was as an assistant U.S. attorney in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In an environment in which Ivy League-educated prosecutors are
thrown together with street cops and federal agents, Ray was
someone who was thoroughly comfortable in both worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of those prosecutors can't relate to what's going on in
the street,'' said Joe Walsh, an FBI agent who worked with Ray on
several cases. ``But Bob was raised the right way. He's our kind of
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, few expected that he would follow in the job held by such
legal heavyweights as Starr and Robert Fiske Jr., a former U.S.
attorney in Manhattan who was the first Whitewater prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob was a solid assistant,'' said Paul Shechtman, chief of the
criminal division of the U.S. attorney's office from 1993 through
1995 when Ray was there, ``but I'm not sure one would have guessed
that we'd start with Bob Fiske and end with Bob Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray accepts his former colleagues' surprise gracefully. He said:
``A lot of life is about being at the right place at the right
time. Some would question whether or not this is the place one
would want to be.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In six years as an assistant U.S. attorney, prosecuting hundreds
of defendants, Ray went to trial dozens of times. One of his
biggest cases was ``Operation Horse Collar,'' a 2 1/2-year wiretap
investigation in which 48 people were charged with narcotics
trafficking in the Bronx and Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Lynch, chief of the criminal division in 1990 and 1991,
said that Ray managed a crushing amount of paperwork and technical
details even before the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was this relatively junior guy and doing this kind of
monumental thing,'' said Lynch, now a law professor at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   In another major case, Ray oversaw the investigation of a gang
called the 142nd Street Lynchmob, in which 10 members were indicted
in 15 murders, a string of armed robberies and a
multimillion-dollar narcotics ring on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Ray's approach got him into trouble, a review of court
records shows. In a 1992 cocaine-trafficking case, a defense lawyer
accused Ray of crossing the line by springing a surprise question
on a defendant who had been called in to provide a tape recording
of her voice, so that it could be compared to others heard on
wiretaps.
</P>
<P>
   After Ray asked her to repeat a few innocuous phrases onto the
tape, he asked her whether she knew another defendant in the case.
</P>
<P>
   She had answered yes, and her lawyer later complained that the
statement, which could tie her to the crime, was improperly
elicited and should not be used against her.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Kevin Duffy agreed. ``What the blazes were you playing
games like that for?'' he asked as he disallowed the statement.
``That stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficult moment before Freeh occurred in a 1992 narcotics
trial when one of Ray's witnesses had testified that she had
recognized a voice on a wiretapped phone call as that of a certain
defendant conducting a crack cocaine sale, then later told him and
a co-prosecutor that she was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Ray did not raise the problem with the court until the next
morning, leading to defense charges that he had allowed the jury to
go home that night believing the tainted testimony was true.
</P>
<P>
   After questioning Ray and his colleague, the judge blamed
``absolutely poor and inadequate preparation by the government''
for the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't find that Ray intentionally or willfully misled the
court,'' Freeh said, adding that Ray should have raised the problem
as soon as he learned of it. The judge repeated his criticism of
``incredibly poor preparation'' by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said he was willing to take ``fair responsibility'' for his
decision. ``You live and learn,'' he said. ``In retrospect and with
the benefit of hindsight,'' he said, ``maybe the better course
would have been simply to say, `Look judge, we may have a problem
here.'''
</P>
<P>
   But in another case, Ray was praised for revealing that a
government witness had lied in a trial. ``Indeed, the candid and
forthright disclosures of the assistant U.S. attorney followed the
highest traditions of that office,'' wrote Judge Robert Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   While a prosecutor, Ray ran unsuccessfully in nonpartisan races
for a local school board from Brooklyn, in 1993 and 1996, after
obtaining permission from his office.
</P>
<P>
   The first race took place during a raging debate in New York
over the ``rainbow curriculum'' and the teaching about gays to
children in elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   Election board records in New York show that Ray was part of a
group of candidates who called themselves ``the children's slate,''
and who fiercely opposed the ``rainbow curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote to a Brooklyn newspaper that while gays had the right
to press their demands in the political arena, they had ``no right
to use first-graders as a vehicle for acceptance of a lifestyle
that was objectionable to many parents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This does not mean that anyone is seriously interested in
bringing God back into the public classroom or that a rigid code of
behavior is being advocated,'' he added. ``Indeed, a public school
is fundamentally about tolerance and acceptance of all.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he told friends that he was seeking an opportunity to
leave the U.S. attorney's office. He was worried that he would
remain in the drug and organized crime unit for years, unable to
move to another specialty and grow.
</P>
<P>
   He decided, he recalled, that he needed some experience with
white-collar crime ``to round me out as a prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that he had never expected to be in Washington for
so long. His family still lives in Rumson, N.J., meaning that he
has established a routine in which he leaves his home before 6 a.m.
each Monday to preside over the office's 9 a.m. weekly meeting.
During the week he stays with his parents and sleeps in his boyhood
bedroom at their suburban Virginia home before heading back to New
Jersey late on Friday night.

Wednesday, tides will be exceptionally high and low, the Moon will

   RIORDAN-BESTYEAR (Los Angeles) _ By all accounts, 1999 was the
most successful political year for Mayor Richard Riordan as he
pushed through a new majority on the Los Angeles Board of Education
and a new City Charter while the economy continued to imrpove and
crime continued to drop. Yet, in an example of unintended
consequences, the mayor also has continued to fuel the seeds of
discontent because of rising expections with new calls for a
breakup of the Los Angeles Unified School District and widening
discontent with how the city of Los Angeles operates. Riordan
discusses this and his plans for 2000. By Rick Orlov (Will move on

L.A. MAYOR COUNTS 1999 AS HIS BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Rick Orlov  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- By his own account, Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan sees 1999 as the most politically successful and personally
satisfying year he has spent in office since being elected six
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And most of it had nothing to do with City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did God's work,'' Riordan said. ``By far the most important
thing I've ever done in my life is changing the Board of Education
and the culture of the Los Angeles Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the future of society, of our city. It will turn young
people from a life of crime to one with a future.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has done in the past, Riordan worked around the political
establishment by going directly to voters to change the school
district.
</P>
<P>
   It was Riordan who recruited candidates to challenge three
incumbent members of the Board of Education and then he used his
own personal wealth and that of friends to finance a $2 million
campaign to see those seats won.
</P>
<P>
   While the school district has been in near-constant turmoil
since then, Riordan professes it is an uncomfortable byproduct of
the revolution that was needed and will ease once a new
superintendent is in place permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a different board there and a different mentality,''
Riordan said. ``You have people who believe in reform, a strong
board that will hopefully pick a strong superintendent.''
</P>
<P>
   It was far from his only political success this year.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan also helped finance the campaign for passage of a new
City Charter that expands the power of the mayor, and the election
of two new City Council members _ Alex Padilla and Nick Pacheco _
whom he had backed.
</P>
<P>
   Relations with the City Council also were smoother this past
year than in other years as his $4 billion budget sailed through
with only token opposition, although some members attributed that
to the mayor's involvement with the school board and charter
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be polite, I'd have to say he's been disengaged with most
of the city matters,'' said one council member, who asked not to be
identified. ``You don't see him or his people down here like they
used to be, lobbying the council for something. He and his office
just don't seem that involved with the day-to-day running of the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, the mayor rejects that notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is running much better,'' Riordan said. ``We
generally have good strong general managers and I much prefer to be
in a position of macro-managing as opposed to micro-managing.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan has benefited from the improving local economy and the
steady drop in crime across the city, even as the Los Angeles
Police Department faced difficulties in the hiring of officers and
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the administration has been hampered by the
ongoing corruption scandal at the LAPD's Rampart Division and the
growing secession movement across the city, most recently fueled by
the decision to reopen the Sunshine Canyon Landfill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rampart situation started a long time ago and we are doing
all we can to resolve it,'' Riordan said. ``We have a police chief
who will not tolerate this sort of thing. What people forget is it
was the department that found this out and is investigating it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the secession drives, Riordan acknowledged they are
partly an unintended consequence that he himself might have fueled
with higher expectations from the city and his campaigns against
the city institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, that is true,'' Riordan said. ``Once you see you
can solve some problems, you expect more problems to be solved.
People are looking at that. They know things can get done by having
more involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the new charter which Riordan did not favor was
the concept of advisory neighborhood councils.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they work on quality-of-life issues and interact with
departments, it could head off some of that,'' Riordan said. ``If
they spend all their time on land-use issues, they won't be
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   What concerns Riordan and other city officials is what the
neighborhood councils would do on issues such as the Sunshine
Canyon Landfill by joining forces to become a political force and
take power from City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   To outside observers, Riordan had an up-and-down year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'd have to say it was a roller-coaster kind of year
and the jury is still out on what happens with all the changes he's
forced,'' Democratic consultant Richard Lichtenstein said. ``Now
that you have a new school board and a new charter and a new
council, it could be five or 10 years before we know the full
impact of all these.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we say in 10 or 15 years will be far different from what
we're saying now. Change does not come overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said that the mayor might
be in the position of regretting what he wished for.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted reform and he's getting it, and you could
say the secession movement is also a reform,'' Jeffe said. ``No one
really knows the depth of the anger and if it will last.''
</P>
<P>
   What concerns her, however, is the low profile the mayor has
taken after instituting change.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this whole debate over whether or not to keep
(Ruben) Zacarias as superintendent and you barely heard a peep from
the mayor,'' Jeffe said. ``It's like he started this change and
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan shrugs off the criticism and insists he has remained
involved and continues to look forward in his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I'm proudest of is what we are doing on the
quality of life and improving neighborhoods,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, if the city continues as it has, there will be a
strong middle class in every part of the city.''

FINANCE COMPANY RESCUES EVICTED COUPLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMDALE, Calif. -- Glen and Norma Jean Rambo didn't think
things could get any worse after they learned their house was in
foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until Norma Jean suffered a stroke the day the Rambos
were ordered out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past month things have begun to look much brighter
for the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Jean, 62, is recuperating and the couple is back in the
house where they have lived the past 10 years, thanks to a real
estate company, the Leona Valley-based Fernwood Group, that bought
their home from the mortgage company and allowed them stay at a
lower rent than their mortgage payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that kept me going was my Bible, trusting the
Lord,'' Norma Jean said. ``I kept reading Psalm 34 and Psalm 137
and 138, and Romans 8.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rambos moved into their house off 3rd Street East in
Palmdale, about 62 miles north of Los Angeles, about 10 years ago
so that they could take care of Norma Jean's father, who was will.
Her father passed away in 1994 and left them the house, which had
already been paid off.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rambos soon found out that Norma Jean's father owed
money for taxes and bills. They were forced to take out a second
mortgage worth about $33,000 to help pay the debt.
</P>
<P>
   But then Norma Jean was hospitalized with a broken hip and they
got behind in their payments, then $518 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The week before Thanksgiving, they were evicted.
</P>
<P>
   Glen, a retired builder, contacted Palmdale officials, who
directed him to South Antelope Valley Emergency Services, a food
bank that also helps people find shelter during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The couple packed up some belongings and moved into the Heritage
Hotel on Palmdale Boulevard, leaving behind their furniture and
three cats at the house.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Norma Jean suffered a stroke and went to a hospital.
Glen spent the first couple of nights alternating between the hotel
and the hospital visiting his wife. He was allowed back at the
house only to feed the couple's cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we're thankful for that room over there, that's
not like home,'' Glen said. ``Without that (room) I don't know what
we would have done because we has nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rambos spent a total of 29 days in the Heritage Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Before they were evicted, Glen had called Lloyd Cook, co-owner
with Alexis Upton-Knittle of the Fernwood Group, after picking up a
Fernwood Group business card advertising that the firm helps
homeowners in foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the house had been foreclosed on six days earlier,
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him what he wanted us to do,'' Cook said. ``He said,
`We just want to be able to stay in the house.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Suburban Realty owner Pete Dattilo, Cook and
Upton-Knittle spent three months negotiating with the mortgage
holder. Finally, a couple days after the Rambos were evicted, the
Fernwood Group's purchase offer was accepted. Cook said he tried to
do a 10-day escrow but it dragged into three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Rambos moved home Dec. 10 with an option to buy and rent at
$400 a month, less than their mortgage payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we do is to help people in foreclosure,''
Cook said. ``Some investment companies are in it for the money. We
are too, but we have hearts. ... I think we all fell pretty good
about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Glen and Norma Jean are happy that everything worked out in
the end and both are happy be back in their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so glad to be back home. It's such a blessing and a joy,''
Glen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a relief and my animals are so happy,'' Norma Jean
said. ``It was all the Lord.''

TUESDAY'S FULL MOON TO BE BIGGER, BRIGHTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Robert Monroe  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a rare celestial event, an exceptionally large, bright full
moon will appear Tuesday night on the shortest day of the year -- a
confluence of events that last occurred together in 1866.
</P>
<P>
   Between sundown Tuesday and dawn Wednesday, the full moon will
seem 14 percent larger than usual and bright enough to cast shadows
at night. That's the way it was that day 133 years ago when
American Indians used the brilliant evening to launch a devastating
ambush on U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   During a 10-hour period starting with moonrise Tuesday at 4:15
p.m. the moon will be at its perigee, its closest point to Earth,
at the same time the Earth will be at one of its closest points to
the sun. It also will be the winter solstice, when the Northern
Hemisphere experiences its longest night.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the confluence of those events, the sun will bear
down on the moon with greater intensity than normal and cause it to
shine at its brightest since 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Police and mystics said they expect this week's lunar confluence
coming 10 days before the new century will spur more lunacy than
typical during a full moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think everyone goes nuts and everything's bizarre,'' said
Burbank Police Lt. Chris Welker, adding that she plans to warn
officers at roll call to be especially on guard Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wiccans, believers in the divinity of the sun and moon, say that
just as the moon pulls ocean tides, it magnifies personality
traits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're an idiot, you're a bigger idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Devin of Covenant of the Goddess, one of the country's
largest Wiccan organizations, added: ``It's going to be a very
charged time. That's how I can put it.''
</P>
<P>
   This coincidence has influenced history.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Dec. 21, 1866, the moon was so bright that
Oglala Sioux used its light to stage an ambush of U.S. soldiers
stationed at Fort Phil Kearny in the Idaho Territory. A large Sioux
force killed all 80 soldiers who had been lured into chasing a
small party of warriors in the midst of trying to defend a pack
train of supplies. It became known as Fetterman's Massacre, the
second worst such incident after Little Big Horn.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomical events of a full moon, a moon at its closest
point to Earth and the winter solstice occurred over a 20-hour
period.
</P>
<P>
   Sky and Telescope magazine said the the moon's perigee, solstice
and a full moon have taken place in the same 24-hour period as
recently as 1991, but this time they will occur within the shortest
period on record.
</P>
<P>
   Associate Editor Roger Sinnott said he checked records back to
1850 and never found an instance when the three events took place
within 12 hours. Hawaiians, living two hours behind the West Coast,
will have the best chance to see all three in the same night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's event certainly is the most unusual in the last
150 years,'' said Sinnott.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Observatory Director Ed Krupp expressed bemusement that
the event is harnessing such attention. Even though the moon will
be nearly 25 percent brighter than a ``normal'' full moon, it won't
appear much different than last month's full moon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those minor congruences of phenomena that
occur,'' Krupp said. ``If people feel like noting that, that's just
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Marsden, associate director for planetary sciences at the
Harvard- Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.,
said the moon will appear 14 percent larger than it did Dec. 8,
when it was at apogee, or its farthest distance from Earth.
Nonetheless, it's mostly just an annoyance for astronomers. A full,
bright moon makes it harder for them to see the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like it best when the moon isn't there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the moon will be 221,662 miles away from Earth
when it reaches perigee at 3 a.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:44 p.m. Tuesday, the Earth will be at maximum solstice,
the point when Earth's tilt shifts the Northern Hemisphere at its
farthest point from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:31 a.m. Wednesday, the moon will be at its fullest point in
the lunar cycle. Not to be forgotten, the Earth will be 12 days
away from perihelion, the point when it is closest to the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   All this will mean exceptionally high tides, said Stephen
Edberg, an astronomer at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Aside from
that, it won't mean much. At least not on a professional level, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is moderately extreme, but by no means unique and by no
means the most extreme combination of alignments,'' Edberg said,
``but it's still going to be fun to see. I'll be looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Police will not just be looking for weird crime, but more crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those lunar tide pulls seem to enhance the inclination of
people to break the law.'' said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Lisa
Phillips, adding that even average full moons rate a mention during
roll call.
</P>
<P>
   Raven Monauni, a witch who owns Raven's Flight, a shop in North
Hollywood, said for people who worship both lunar and solar
deities, the confluence is a special event, signaling the strength
of the full moon with the re-emergence of the sun as days start
getting longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are celebrating the rebirth of the sun and this amazing
moon we're going to have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Devin finds it remarkable that the confluence should be
happening at the eve of the millennium, when there is already a lot
of energy in the collective unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have this amount of people focusing on what they're
hoping for, what they're fearing, it's likely to make it a more
charged situation because they make it in their own minds and own
spirits a special event.''
</P>
<P>
   Devin had no specific predictions for what kinds of events might
take place Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, beyond predicting
the energy will be positive. In other words, no ambushes like that
which befell Capt. William Fetterman and his troops in 1866.
</P>
<P>
   ``One wonders why you'd want to do an ambush when the moon is
especially bright,'' said Alan MacRobert, another associate editor
at Sky and Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   But almanacs say nothing about other peculiarities that took
place on especially bright full moon nights throughout history.
Jan. 4, 1912, is the record holder for the moon's proximity to
Earth. On that date, Earth's satellite came within 221,489 miles of
us. In an irony to make astronomers vexed by the hype smile, Jan. 4
has also been declared Trivia Day.

IRAQ REJECTS U.N. WEAPONS INSPECTION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iraq on Saturday formally rejected the new arms inspection plan
adopted by the U.N. Security Council and sent demonstrators into
the streets of Baghdad to protest what the government called
``another trick'' perpetrated by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, who is President
Saddam Hussein's point man in relations with the United Nations,
said that the Security Council had ``failed to meet Iraq's
legitimate demand for a lifting of sanctions.'' Aziz's remarks were
distributed by the official Iraqi national news agency.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, after a year of intermittent debate, the council
offered the Iraqis a plan that would lead to a suspension of
sanctions next year if arms inspectors working with a new
disarmament commission were allowed to begin monitoring in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   If Iraq provides satisfactory answers to outstanding questions
about its prohibited biological, chemical, nuclear and missile
systems, the renewable 120-day suspensions could become a full
lifting of the embargo Iraq has lived under since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council was divided over the plan, with China,
France, Russia and Malaysia abstaining rather than voting for it.
Some diplomats speculated that the public division would isolate
the United States and Britain and strengthen Iraq's resolve to defy
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though the public rift in the Security Council
seemed to be in Iraq's favor, the vote contained several setbacks
for Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   No nation friendly to Iraq was prepared to veto the measure,
although Aziz recently spent a week in Moscow apparently trying to
persuade Russia to sink the plan. In his rejection statement, Aziz
mentioned his disappointment. The council has also now reaffirmed
the principle that Iraq must meet international obligations before
sanctions can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Iraqis had made other demands, including the
elimination of the ``no flight'' zones set up by the United States
and Britain over northern and southern Iraq, where American air
raids take place nearly daily. Iraq also insisted that if any
inspectors from the new U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission were to be admitted to Iraq, sanctions would
have to end first or there would be no Iraqi cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Few if any diplomats on the Security Council take Iraq's first
rejection of the arms inspection plan at face value, as their
speeches on Friday before and after the vote demonstrated. In
particular, the Russians and French, Iraq's closest friends and
business partners, say that the United Nations should be prepared
for a long period of haggling with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   France's ambassador to the United Nations, Alain Dejammet, said
in an interview that it was important to recall the history of the
oil-for-food program under which Iraq has been permitted to sell
petroleum products to pay for food, medicine and other necessary
civilian goods.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis were initially offered that option in 1991, when the
first arms inspection system was getting under way and it became
apparent that disarming Iraq would take longer than planned. Iraq
flatly rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   Another version was offered in 1995, and it took almost a year
of negotiating before Iraq accepted it, and another year before
goods began to arrive in Iraq in any significant quantities. That
program has now been folded into the new resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Tough negotiations with Iraq are not likely to begin this time
until Secretary-General Kofi Annan names an executive chairman for
the new commission and a body of experts assembles to begin work in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Iraq has quickly seized on another provision of
the resolution: the lifting of the ceiling on how much oil Iraq can
export to pay for civilian goods and the reconstruction of Iraqi
public services.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq will also be able to import spare parts to upgrade its oil
industry and may be permitted to open new export routes, possibly
starting with an existing but unused pipeline to Syria. Legal Iraqi
exports are now limited to a loading station at the Persian Gulf
port of Mina al-Bakr and through a pipeline to the Turkish port of
Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials confirmed Saturday that oil exports, stopped to
protest short-term extensions of the oil-for-food plan, had now
resumed at the Iraqi port of Mina al-Bakr.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq will also benefit from another provision in the new
resolution. Although the money earned from oil will still go into
an escrow account managed by the United Nations, Iraq will no
longer have to submit every contract purchase to the Security
Council sanctions committee. Purchases by Iraq should now be
approved more quickly.

THE AD CAMPAIGN

  (With RUSSIA-ELECT)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russia's rough-and-tumble parliamentary election campaign has
been shaped by the major parties' aggressive television
advertising. Here are samples of ads broadcast in the campaign's
final days by three parties: the Union of Right Forces, a
Western-oriented free-market faction; the Communist Party; and
Fatherland-All Russia, a centrist anti-Kremlin party headed by
former Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and the mayor of Moscow,
Yuri Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party: Holding Fast to a Well-Worn Theme
</P>
<P>
   THE SCENE: A muscular worker's arm in a plaid shirt slams a hard
hat on a table atop a copy of a Communist newspaper. An arm attired
in a white shirt with gold cuff links and a Rolex watch follows,
depositing a mobile phone on the table. Sleeves rolled up, the two
begin to arm wrestle. As years flash on the screen _ 1991, 1993,
1995 _ the white-shirted arm slowly presses the worker's arm
downward. By 1997, the worker begins to come back, and the
white-shirted figure tries to overcome him with both hands. But as
1999 flashes by, the worker wins.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: A Soviet war medal appears on the screen, and to the
sound of a war anthem, an announcer intones: ``For victory! The
Communist Party of the Russian Federation!''
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: The class-warfare message has not changed in a
century.
</P>
<P>
   Union of Right Forces: A Call to Shake Up the Privileged Class
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: In a cartoon, two men working at a computer hear a
siren. They wheel about, saying ``What?'' ``Where?'' ``Look,
here!'' and see a huge cockroach crawling toward them, a flashing
blue light on its back.
</P>
<P>
   One man rolls a newspaper to swat the roach. The other whispers
nervously into his ear, ``You know what he is?'' The first man
hesitates, then shouts ``WHAM!'' and smashes the roach.
</P>
<P>
   The Union of the Right Forces emblem appears on the screen with
the slogan ``FOR ABROGATION OF DEPUTIES' IMMUNITY''
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: To Muscovites' enduring irritation, legislators and
other privileged types tool about in black sedans with sirens and
blue lights, weaving through traffic and even driving the wrong way
down busy streets. The spot uses that image to stress the party's
message that it wants to shake up the privileged class, starting by
ending legislators' immunity from criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Fatherland-All Russia: In Unsettled Time, a Pledge of Stability &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE SCENE: A man reads a newspaper, then turns to his computer.
</P>
<P>
   Images appear on the screen: a demonstration; a stock exchange;
new 100 ruble notes; angry crowds at a closed bank; protesting coal
miners; riot police officers. Finally, the party leader, Yevgeny
Primakov, is seen speaking to the parliament. The camera returns to
the man; the words I TRUST DEEDS and the party emblem appear on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: An announcer: ``They promised a land of milk and
honey, but they brought the country to the brink of economic
disaster. Now we need someone who has already hit his stride, who
can accomplish the most important thing: to maintain stability in
the state, preserve concord in the society.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper reader: ``I trust only deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: Primakov's image as a trustworthy, stable leader is
the party's strongest suit. The ad tries to contrast his reputation
with the tumult of the Yeltsin years.

REPORT DETAILS MEDICAL ERRORS IN VA HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 4 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 7 p.m. ET EMBARGO

 By ROBERT PEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal investigators have documented almost 3,000
medical mistakes and mishaps in less than two years at veterans
hospitals around the country, and more than 700 patients have died
in those cases, the Department of Veterans Affairs says in a new
report.
</P>
<P>
   The accidents and deaths occurred from June 1997 to December
1998, in the first 19 months of a new policy that requires
employees to report medical errors and ``adverse events.'' Since
then, the department has been getting such reports at a rate of
more than 200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The problems include medication errors, like prescribing or
dispensing the wrong drugs, the failure of medical devices, abuse
of patients, errors in blood transfusions, surgery on the wrong
body part or the wrong patient, improper insertion of catheters or
feeding tubes, and a variety of ``therapeutic misadventures'' that
caused serious injuries or deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The comprehensive self-examination by the Department of Veterans
Affairs, believed to be the first of its kind by any health care
system in the nation, shows what could be expected if all hospitals
had to report their errors, as recommended recently by the National
Academy of Sciences. The number of reported errors would be high,
but health care executives would get useful information about
problems that need to be fixed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in June 1997, the Department of Veterans Affairs
ordered its hospitals to report their mistakes to the agency's
regional offices, which in turn send the information to Washington,
where it is logged into an official file known as the patient
safety register. Hospitals must try to identify the causes of each
incident, to reduce the likelihood of a repetition.
</P>
<P>
   The new emphasis on patient safety was prompted by several
factors: sporadic complaints of substandard care at veterans
hospitals, pressure from Congress and the zeal of a senior
official, Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, who was under secretary of veterans
affairs from October 1994 to June of this year.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the veterans health care system had a reputation as
hidebound and bureaucratic. But under Kizer, it emerged as a
national leader in efforts to improve patient safety.
</P>
<P>
   The report's author, Dr. James E. McManus, a surgeon from New
York City who is the veterans department's medical inspector, said
in an interview that ``the adverse events reported by the VA were
so serious that 24 percent of the patients died. One in four
died.'' The study found 2,927 errors in the first 19 months of
mandatory reporting, and 710 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The number of deaths in 1999 has not been determined. While each
hospital analyzes its own cases, the department has not yet
analyzed this year's figures for the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   As medical inspector for the Department of Veterans Affairs,
McManus is a sort of watchdog and ombudsman, continually evaluating
the quality of care provided to veterans. The department runs the
nation's largest health care delivery system, with 172 hospitals,
132 nursing homes and more than 650 outpatient clinics.
</P>
<P>
   McManus and other health care experts said they believed that
the prevalence of errors at veterans hospitals was similar to that
at other hospitals. ``I don't think it's any different from the
private sector,'' McManus said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis S. O'Leary, president of the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, which inspects 80
percent of hospitals in the United States, said he knew of no other
health care system that collected such data.
</P>
<P>
   ``The VA is doing the right thing,'' O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald M. Berwick, a member of the study panel convened by
the National Academy of Sciences, said, ``The first sign of a
serious endeavor to deal with errors is that the number of reported
errors should go way, way up.''
</P>
<P>
   The joint commission encourages private hospitals to report
``unexpected occurrences'' involving death or serious injury to
patients, but it does not require such reports. Since January 1995,
the commission says, 714 such events have been voluntarily
reported. The Department of Veterans Affairs has tallied a much
larger number of mishaps in just 19 months of mandatory reporting.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine, an arm of the National Academy of
Sciences, said last month that medical errors killed 44,000 to
98,000 people a year in hospitals alone. More people die from
medical mistakes each year than from highway accidents, breast
cancer or AIDS, it said. The institute said Congress should require
hospitals to file reports with state governments, disclosing any
medical errors that cause death or serious harm.
</P>
<P>
   The population served by veterans hospitals is, on the average,
somewhat older than the population served by community hospitals,
and men account for a larger share of the patients. Experts who
served on the academy's study panel said the reporting requirements
of the veterans health care system were an example of what they had
in mind for hospitals in general.
</P>
<P>
   The academy said the nation could and should reduce medical
mistakes by 50 percent over the next five years. But no one knows
how many mistakes are now made, so it will be difficult to measure
progress toward that goal. The veterans department study suggests
that the numbers may be higher than many people have assumed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``When you seek out problems and errors, you find them much more
frequently,'' Kizer said. ``But no one really believes that errors
happen more frequently at VA hospitals. We must uncover and define
the full extent of the problem before we see progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,927 ``adverse events'' analyzed by the Department of
Veterans Affairs, 171 were medication errors, in which patients
received the wrong dose of a drug or the wrong medication. Patients
died in 22 of these cases.
</P>
<P>
   McManus, the medical inspector, said he believed such drug
errors were ``greatly underreported.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The veterans agency defines ``adverse events'' as untoward
incidents, illnesses or injuries caused by medical treatments or
directly associated with care provided by the department.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals varied greatly in the number of errors they reported.
McManus' report did not analyze the reasons for the wide variation.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans hospitals in the New York City area reported the
smallest number of errors (37), even though this is the second
largest district of the veterans health care system, after Southern
California. The New York City hospitals reported 2.3 ``adverse
events'' for every 10,000 veterans treated, while the veterans
medical centers in upstate New York reported 18.9 adverse events
for every 10,000 patients.
</P>
<P>
   Health care experts said this disparity suggested that the
upstate hospitals were more diligent in reporting errors, not that
they were less safe.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the Department of Veterans Affairs described many
kinds of ``adverse events.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   About 540 patients were injured in falls at veterans hospitals
and nursing homes, 250 of them suffered hip fractures and 44 of
them died.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the department said, 277 patients committed suicide
at veterans hospitals or soon after being discharged, and 476
patients tried to kill themselves but survived. Doctors said some
of the suicides might have been prevented if the patients had
received appropriate treatment for depression.
</P>
<P>
   The government lost track of 113 patients, who were listed as
missing from veterans hospitals and nursing homes where they were
expected to be. Eighty-seven of them were later found, but 20 were
not found, and the whereabouts of the other 6 was not specified.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Veterans Affairs offers cash awards to
employees who make improvements in patient safety, paying a maximum
of $5,000 to an individual and $25,000 to a hospital, clinic or
nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   The department also created a National Center for Patient
Safety, headed by Dr. James P. Bagian, a former astronaut. The
center analyzes reports of medical mistakes, looking for patterns
and trends, and suggests corrective actions.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons learned from the experiences of individual hospitals are
disseminated throughout the veterans health care system. For
example, Bagian said, doctors and nurses have concluded that they
must pay more attention to suicide attempts, and they are alert to
the need to provide mental health care to older patients with
terminal illnesses and no close relatives.

   The veterans hospitals, unlike some private hospitals, are
required to inform patients of any injuries that result from
medical errors. The veterans hospitals are also supposed to advise
injured patients of their options, including the right to seek
disability benefits and, in some cases, the right to sue the
government for damages.
</P>
<P>
   Most other studies of medical errors were based on reviews of
medical records months or years after patients received care. By
contrast, Kizer said, the study of veterans hospitals was based on
information from clinical employees, who were supposed to report
``adverse events'' within 24 hours after they occurred.

BUSH'S NEW HAMPSHIRE ALLIES SAY HE'S VULNERABLE THERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 4 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 7 p.m. ET EMBARGO
for electronic media.)

 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Many of Gov. George W. Bush's allies in New
Hampshire are blaming his Texas-based campaign for early lapses
that they say have left him unnecessarily vulnerable against Sen.
John McCain in the state that holds the first presidential primary
in only six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of aloofness and overconfidence, they say, led
advisers unfamiliar with the peculiarities of New Hampshire's
politics to let Bush adopt a sound-bite style that voters here
disdain, and to forgo the time-honored approach of personal
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   After months of appearing unstoppable elsewhere, Bush has seen
his lead in the New Hampshire polls evaporate, and some surveys
show McCain is continuing to surge. Several of Bush's top advisers
now concede that he could lose the primary on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Bush would still be the clear favorite for the
Republican nomination. He holds a commanding lead in polls in every
other battleground state and sits atop a daunting treasury.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire may no longer be the make-or-break state it once
was for presidential aspirants. Still, no matter what happens, many
Bush supporters in New Hampshire said the campaign should never
have put itself in jeopardy. Their recrimination underscores a
tension _ one that many strategists say was inevitable _ between
the campaign's tightly run high command in Austin, Texas, and its
supporters on the ground in this tiny state.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Stephen E. Merrill of New Hampshire, who ran Bob
Dole's campaign here in 1996 and backs Bush, spoke out for the
first time in an interview about his qualms about the governor's
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign believed it was the front-runner in New
Hampshire,'' said Merrill, who did not seek re-election in 1996.
``There's no such thing as the front-runner in New Hampshire. You
simply become the biggest target. This state demands personal
attention _ and is not easily impressed by either money or poll
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing his belief in Bush himself, Merrill added: ``I love
this guy. He'd make a great president. That's what's so
frustrating. There is no inevitability in any presidential primary.
The great irony is that the candidate understands that. I'm not
sure everybody else does.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of Bush's backers in New Hampshire argued that the
governor's top national advisers did not grasp the idiosyncratic,
even quaint, requirements for stumping in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, they complained that Bush, seeming to take his
lead for granted, did not spend nearly enough time in the state and
passed up early debates with his rivals. When he did venture here,
they said, Bush staged mostly large events where the voters had
little chance to quiz him, a cherished state tradition.
</P>
<P>
   He also took pains not to engage McCain directly, and Bush's
supporters said he did not develop a crisp message early on to
answer the Arizona senator's call for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   And they said he has been slower than Vice President Al Gore in
trying to shed his entourage, as the vice president did when former
Sen. Bill Bradley mounted an unexpectedly vigorous challenge here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they understand New Hampshire; they don't get
it,'' said Jane E. O'Hearn, a state representative from Nashua, in
the south of the state, who endorsed Bush in May. ``I don't think
they are complying with the way New Hampshire has done things. They
are treating every state probably the same way _ it's sound bites
in every state.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Hearn, who is so exasperated she is toying with the idea
of defecting to McCain, added: ``George Bush's sound bites are all
the same. I don't think he's coming across with the depth he needs
to reach the people of New Hampshire. The man is good, he is
sincere, and just needs an opportunity to show that. And I hope the
Bush campaign allows that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Dupont, a former state Senate president from Concord who is a
member of Bush's state steering committee, said it had been a
nightmare trying to set up an appearance in September at the
international speedway here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent two days with Texas Rangers and advance staff for a
two-hour event,'' he said. ``He couldn't ride in a golf cart, had
to have a closed vehicle.'' In the end, Bush had to scrap the event
because of a shooting in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain swooped in with almost no advance planning. ``They
stuck him in a golf cart and drove him down to the infield and he
shook 400 hands,'' Dupont recalled. ``That is part of what the
McCain message has been: throw your jacket over your shoulder and
go ahead and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dupont echoed many Bush backers who had nothing but praise for
how McCain has mounted his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this race started, it was Bush's to lose and McCain was
clearly the underdog,'' he said. ``But when McCain wraps the United
States flag around himself, people want to salute. And he's
deserving of that. He's definitely caught on in New Hampshire. The
Bush campaign certainly has the ability to even this thing up in
New Hampshire and win. But time is running short.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Corrigan, a commissioner in Coos County in northern New
Hampshire who is a town chairman for Bush and has been active in
politics for three decades, said: ``The people from the Concord
office were getting their orders from Texas. They had their methods
set even before they came to New Hampshire. We had strangers coming
in trying to run a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, said many of the
decisions were made jointly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do the mechanical stuff here,'' he said. ``The TV ads are
produced here, but they are carefully vetted there. For all the
volunteer activity on the ground, and decisions about where does
Bush go, they come up with a plan that they discuss with us. What
does Bush say? It's a mutual discussion between them and us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers insist that they are not rattled now that they
are threatened by a potent rival in the Granite State. But their
calm exteriors belie several steps they have taken in recent weeks
to be more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   After saying he would not take part in any debates until
January, Bush participated in three this year, and the first was in
New Hampshire. He has significantly stepped up his travel schedule
to the state. And at events here he now allows far more time for
questions and answers from residents than in most other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the front-runner always has a rough patch in the road
somewhere,'' said Rove. ``And the way to plow your way though is to
stay disciplined and to stay focused _ make alternatives and keep
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove said he was doing other things to become more competitive,
but would not describe them ``because it would be showing our
cards.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory by McCain in New Hampshire could fortify the Arizona
senator's entire operation as the campaign moves into a fast-paced
schedule of contests. And there is always the possibility _ remote
as it may seem _ that a humiliating defeat could unhinge the entire
Bush operation.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush supporters said McCain's rise was inevitable, because
it is political custom for there to be an intense skirmish here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not shocked or stunned or anything like that,'' said Rep.
Charles Bass, R-N.H., one of the Bush campaign's top lieutenants
here. ``Frankly, I don't think Bush is either. I've been pounding
this every time I've been with him: `We're going to be behind and
don't worry about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Todd Harris, the McCain campaign's spokesman in New
Hampshire, said the Bush campaign ought to be worried. ``Their
definitive victory line in the sand keeps getting pulled back
further and further every day,'' he said. ``It used to be, we'll
defeat them here in New Hampshire. Now, they're talking about a
firewall in Michigan.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Joel Maiola, the Bush campaign director in New Hampshire, argued
that McCain's rise had come about because the Arizona senator drew
new support each time one of the other alternatives to Bush dropped
out of the race earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he thought many Bush supporters had publicly
criticized the candidate's operation, Maiola said: ``In New
Hampshire, there's a lot of agendas and a lot of reasons for saying
different things. In New Hampshire, you can never get enough of a
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides also defended their operation by arguing that
McCain is concentrating his effort in New Hampshire, completely
bypassing the Iowa caucuses a week before and skimping in other
states as well. By contrast, Bush is running a full-fledged
national campaign. As of Saturday, Bush had spent 19 days in New
Hampshire this year; McCain had been here 42 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our object is to compete everywhere and to win everywhere,''
Rove said. ``You can't claim to be a national candidate worthy of
the nomination of the Republican Party if you say you're going to
pick and choose every contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhona Charbonneau, who is chairman of the Bush campaign in
Hillsborough County, said she had been worried that the candidate
did not spend enough time here. ``I don't think they understood New
Hampshire politics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said she had become more confident because the candidate
was coming here more _ and because she was being overwhelmed by
people who wanted to attend a reception for Bush at her house on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be hanging from the ceilings,'' she said.
``I've got 180 people coming to my home, and I've had to turn
people away.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: COZY FORMATS PUT CANDIDATES' BEST FACES
FORWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the Republican debate in New Hampshire early this month,
Gov. George W. Bush looked so squinty-eyed and ill at ease on
camera that it was easy to visualize him as a cartoon figure with
wheels slowly cranking inside his head.
</P>
<P>
   But last Thursday on ``Larry King Live'' he was a political
consultant's dream: He was at ease joking about baseball and
flattering the host; his eyes widened with sincerity when he talked
about the ``heavy heart'' he had when Karla Faye Tucker, who had a
religious conversion while on death row in Texas, was executed. It
was suddenly possible for a viewer to comprehend the charm that
people who have seen him in person have noted, but that had been
conspicuously missing from his television appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, pop quizzes about foreign leaders and reading lists
had caused him to send a panicky look into the camera; during an
hour-long interview with Tim Russert on ``Meet the Press'' he had
seemed prepared and cogent, though mostly in comparison to the low
expectations he had carried along.
</P>
<P>
   This improvement is not only about Bush's evolution as a
television performer, and it is certainly not about policies. In
each event, from the formal debate to the rigorous ``Meet the
Press'' appearance to the puffball interview on ``Larry King,'' the
camera became less formal, the format cozier, the candidate's image
more positive.
</P>
<P>
   The same pattern exists on the Democratic side. Former Sen. Bill
Bradley, who early in his campaign sounded lofty in sound bites,
has seemed far wittier and more engaging up close. He has had his
own dream interviews. He shot baskets at Madison Square Garden with
Ed Bradley for a ``60 Minutes'' profile that resonated with the
glory of his basketball fame. Sitting on the court for an interview
with Wolf Blitzer on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' he said pleasantly
that he would not discuss his religious beliefs, as if that were
the most ordinary position in the world rather than an anomaly
among candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the last weeks, even days, the campaign has gone through a
range of televised events, from archaic debates to the fake
intimacy of town hall meetings with questions from an audience to
the genuine scrutiny of one-on-one interviews. And it has become
clear that the camera and the format can make a single candidate
seem like several different people.
</P>
<P>
   The three Republican debates have shown that form to be a
throwback to a time when stump speeches and oratorical skill
mattered more than sound bites. Though the candidates stood on
stage and made mini-speeches, during the Arizona debate on CNN it
was plain that the format had been outstripped by technology. When
Sen. John McCain answered a question, it was impossible to tell
that he was actually in New Hampshire, his image carried by
satellite. Against a blue background that matched that on stage, in
close-up he was visually on an equal platform with his five rivals
standing in a row in Arizona. (Lined up that way, Steve Forbes,
Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin Hatch looked like uneasy
backup singers just waiting for Bush to step out and sing the
lead.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush had been heard of but not widely seen on television until
last month, and he had the most to gain or lose from his suddenly
increased exposure. The formal debates made him defensive, working
overtime to counter the charge that he was a smirking intellectual
lightweight. But on ``Larry King,'' with flowers in the background
and the host cheerfully reminding viewers they were at the
Wildhorse saloon in Tennessee, the smirk factor disappeared (except
briefly, when Bush refused once more to talk about possible drug
use in his past). There was no sense that the wheels in his brain
were cranking, but then the questions didn't require much mental
machinery. ``It takes a lot of ego to say I want to be president
and I'm the best person to run the country. That's what you're
saying, right? Is that hard to say?''
</P>
<P>
   A close-up camera and a friendly question are worth only what a
candidate makes of them, of course. McCain, appearing on ``Good
Morning America'' on Thursday, lost a perfect opportunity when
Diane Sawyer asked him why campaign finance reform mattered to
viewers ``brushing our teeth and getting the kids ready for
school.'' Though she handed him a chance to make his central
campaign issue relevant to voters' everyday lives, he resorted to
familiar abstractions about the evil influence of big-corporation
money on legislation.
</P>
<P>
   With his straightforward manner, McCain usually makes more of a
close-up situation. His relaxed, post-debate interviews offset the
frozen smile and prepackaged laugh lines that at times undermined
him on the debate stage. But compare his campaign-finance remarks
on ``Good Morning America'' to Bush's on ``Larry King'' about the
need for free trade with other countries. Bush said he understood
``a mom or a dad'' from Mexico crossing the border for the higher
wages that would allow them to feed their children, demonstrating
which candidate has mastered the art of the soft sell.
</P>
<P>
   And softly selling the candidate's image is what the campaign is
about for most people at this point. With campaign commercials
running in just a handful of primary states, images are very slowly
seeping into the national consciousness. Catching a glimpse of a
candidate while brushing your teeth is the reality behind the
image-making right now. Political junkies may watch the debates,
but many more voters see profiles on ``60 Minutes'' and ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   Those fluffier forms may not give the most cogent information,
but they reach the most people. ``Good Morning America,'' for
example, reaches about 3 million people, roughly twice the number
watching each of the Republican debates.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Bradley did his own ``town hall'' on ``Good Morning America''
last week, focusing on health care. He talked about specifics, but
easily exuded a concern that offset the dry details. It helped that
he could get up and walk around the small studio space, with a
Christmas tree in the background to warm the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called town hall meetings have become staples of
``Nightline'' as well as ``Good Morning America.'' Combining
elements of the debate and the one-on-one interview, the town hall
is the most flexible form, and also television's loose cannon.
During Friday's flabby, unilluminating ``Nightline'' meeting,
Bradley and Vice President Al Gore talked at, rather than to, each
other. Ted Koppel nearly begged them to keep their answers short.
During an earlier town hall on CNN two months ago, answers were
limited to 90 seconds, and the result was less windy and more
productive. But time was only part of the problem on Friday. A
bigger element was the strangely cautious way the candidates sniped
at each other without really engaging in a discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the candidates, Gore has the least to gain or lose from
such television appearances because he is already the most
familiar. But he suffers because he displays so little difference
between speeches, town hall meetings and sit-down interviews. There
is the same forced naturalness whether challenging Bradley about
financing health care or chopping wood on his farm in Tennessee for
the benefit of Lesley Stahl and ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley are set to appear together again Sunday morning
on ``Meet the Press.'' Russert has been promoting the meeting as
one that evokes the Lincoln-Douglas debates, though there doesn't
seem to be any good reason. In the seven Lincoln-Douglas meetings,
one candidate spoke for an hour, the next for an hour and a half,
and then the first gave a 30-minute rebuttal. Those two would never
have survived a television campaign, especially at a time when
``the character issue'' has become a buzzword for an appealing
personality, and playing to the camera counts for more than any
policy proposal.

RUSSIA VOTING AFTER RANCOROUS CAMPAIGN, BUT IT'S JUST A   PRELUDE
TO NEXT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-ELECT-ADS) 
(js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The race for Russia's third parliament since the end of
the Soviet Union and more than 70 years of Communism was less a
campaign than a barroom brawl, a chairs-over-the-head affair
suffused with slander, manipulation and unvarnished peculiarity on
all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was also a race that the public took seriously, despite
its disgust at the tactics. Between the opening of the first
polling booths at 8 a.m. Sunday in Russia's Far East and the
closing of the last, 11 time zones away, in Kaliningrad on the
Baltic Sea 23 hours later, as many as 80 percent of the 107 million
eligible voters are expected to cast ballots for the Duma, the
lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the
Communists are once again expected to emerge with a plurality of
the 450 seats at stake. But it is a measure both of the surreal
nature of the campaign, and of the Duma's weight compared with the
far more powerful presidency, that almost no one perceives the
Communists as the potential victors in this contest.
</P>
<P>
   The focus is on two parties that are effectively straw men for
the Kremlin clique around President Boris Yeltsin and for its most
powerful opponents, who are led by former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and the mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the parties that represent these two camps existed a
year ago. But the outcome of their struggle, for second and third
place in the parliamentary vote, will determine who has a
psychological leg up in the next round of even more bare-knuckled
campaigning, the run-up to the election of a successor to Yeltsin
next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently in an attempt to cast this weekend's vote as a true
forerunner of that real tussle for power, Primakov announced on
Friday that he would run for president. His probable opponent in
Yeltsin's Kremlin camp is Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, the former
KGB agent who so far has captivated the electorate by running a
seemingly brisk if brutal war in Chechnya and thus projecting the
image of a strong and decisive leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parliamentary election is just a sideshow to this whole
thing,'' said Michael McFaul, a Russia scholar at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, referring to the battle between
the Kremlin and the Primakov-Luzhkov alliance.
</P>
<P>
   As for the score or so other parties competing in the
parliamentary elections, he said, ``they're just sort of white
noise in the background.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, for all the noise and fury in this election, it is
hard to tell yet what it signifies beyond a rearrangement of
Russia's political furniture before the presidential vote. The
results of the voting will not be fully known until at least Monday
evening in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great powers of the current parliament, a
Kremlin-backed party called Our Home Is Russia, is expected to fade
from the scene almost without a whimper. Its leader, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, was prime minister and a Yeltsin favorite when the
last parliament was elected in 1995. Now he is out of the political
game.
</P>
<P>
   The new pro-Kremlin faction, variously called Unity and Medved _
the Russian word for bear _ did not exist six months ago and, like
Chernomyrdin's party four years ago, has little visible ideology
beyond a desire to retain power.
</P>
<P>
   The Primakov-Luzhkov alliance, called Fatherland-All Russia,
also sprang to life this year without much of a philosophy beyond
claiming the Kremlin for itself.
</P>
<P>
   The only constants are the Communists and the West-leaning
Yabloko party, two iconoclastic and ideological factions whose
refusals to compromise have left them proud but on the edges of
power.
</P>
<P>
   If this does not sound like the liberal democracy many
envisioned when the Soviet Union broke up and Russia gained
independence in 1991, it is not. Some experts say Sunday's vote
signals Russia's drift away from a checks-and-balances political
system toward the strongman form of government that has held sway
for most of the last 1,000 years, and for which many
crisis-fatigued Russians now openly long.
</P>
<P>
   But it still is a democracy, and in some ways a robust one.
Predictions of the turnout for Sunday's vote range from 60 percent
to 80 percent of eligible voters, figures that would put Americans
to shame. And the political debate here _ ragged, raw, state- and
tycoon-controlled, libelous and frequently funny _ is far more
heartfelt and ubiquitous than in jaded American or West European
electoral districts.

</P>
<P>
   As evidence, consider this exchange on national television last
week: Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the Yabloko party, called
Anatoly Chubais of the Union of Right Forces ``a former keeper of
the president's chamber pot.''
</P>
<P>
   Chubais, who ran Yeltsin's 1996 presidential campaign and is
widely despised in Russia for the way he introduced capitalism in
the early 1990s, likened Yavlinsky to ``a pure, honest, immaculate
and incorruptible bride, with only one flaw: the bride is already
going on 60.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men are actually, in a sense, ideological allies,
leaders of the only two pro-Western liberal parties. Between
enemies, such exchanges actually get personal.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters have long been laying out the general outlines of the
outcome: the Communist Party, which dominated Russia for more than
70 years of Soviet rule and benefits from a disproportionately
higher turnout of older voters, could collect as much as 25 percent
of the national vote, compared with 22.3 percent in the last
election in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Its ideological opposites, the parties led by Chubais and
Yavlinsky, will probably split about 15 percent _ illustrating the
rough extent of the ardent supporters here of a Western style of
politics and economic order.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle will be for the middle, where the Kremlin's Unity
party and the Primakov-Luzhkov Fatherland faction will be dividing
as much as 30 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   While many reports suggest that the Unity party has surged
lately, experts still disagree over which of the two will claim the
larger share.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it doesn't matter. Almost everyone agrees that the two
parties' leaders differ philosophically only by shades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just fighting over splitting the pie,'' said Leonid
Radzikhvsky, the political correspondent for the Moscow daily
newspaper Segodnya. ``That's why people go blithely from one party
to another; that's why these parties fall apart and rise with each
new election, and that's why it's possible to put on ideological
masks like liberal, socialist, Communist. They're just completely
average people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the real fight _ over the presidential race, not ideology _
Unity, Fatherland and almost everyone else have been going at it
fang and nail.
</P>
<P>
   As in the West, much of the war has been fought on television,
where the airwaves have been stuffed with commercials pitching
various parties' strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the West, the real battle has been waged on news programs
and talk shows, where broadcasters under politicians' control have
sought nothing less than to destroy their candidates' rivals by
freely airing the most outlandish accusations, often on the
flimsiest of what passes for evidence.
</P>
<P>
   After Primakov went abroad for back surgery this fall, programs
on Kremlin-controlled state television reported breathlessly that
he was terminally ill. Luzhkov, who controls an empire of
city-owned businesses and joint ventures in near dictatorial _ and
highly secretive _ fashion, has been repeatedly tied in television
news reports to the notorious killing of an American businessman
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Sunday evening expose included film from a helicopter
flight over Luzhkov's sprawling country estate outside Moscow,
showing rows of mansions and tennis courts that the program implied
were built for his top aides.
</P>
<P>
   An especially notorious program, broadcast on a network
controlled by the tycoon Boris Berezovsky, a Kremlin ally, tied
Primakov to an assassination attempt on the president of Georgia,
Eduard Shevardnadze.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, who is running for re-election as mayor, has not pulled
any punches. A network allied with his municipal empire has aimed a
stream of invective at the Kremlin and Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   City police and inspectors have taken an unusual interest in
Luzhkov's Kremlin-backed opponent in the mayoral race, the former
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko's campaign posters have been banned from public
transit as a potential source of confusion and disturbance; police
officers carrying assault rifles raided the Kiriyenko campaign
headquarters this month, demanding campaign-related documents and a
copy of the campaign's office lease.
</P>
<P>
   Dirty tricks are hardly limited to attacks on the presidential
contenders. The government has been unusually selective in
enforcing campaign laws, at one point disqualifying completely the
Liberal Democratic Party because one of its leaders did not report
owning a home. Most observers surmised that the Kremlin hoped that
the party's followers would move to its Unity faction.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Liberal Democrats, the outrageous
politician-singer-sex-book author-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
eventually won the right to run under another banner. But even
though his billboards proclaim bluntly that his new bloc is just
another name for Liberal Democrat, he seems unlikely to retain the
significant presence he holds in the current parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Yabloko's Yavlinsky escaped any sanction from
the commission although he failed to report $3,000 in income on a
financial-disclosure form.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the entire question of money and politics seems to have
been given a pass by regulators this year, perhaps because
virtually everyone is guilty of violating whatever laws are on the
books.
</P>
<P>
   The richest party, Unity, reports receiving only about 40
million rubles in donations _ some $1.5 million _ and spending
barely half that on a national campaign with heavy television
advertising. Zhirinovsky and the Communists are only a few rubles
behind.

   HOUSTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas likes to remind voters
and his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination that he
runs one of the largest states in the country, a state so vast that
if it were a country _ it once was one _ it would rank as the
11th-largest economy in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bragging, of course, is a favorite sport in Texas, especially if
the bragging is about Texas, but Bush's oft-repeated boast has a
serious purpose.
</P>
<P>
   In a race in which both his intellect and his experience have
come under attack, Bush is reminding voters of two things: that he
alone among the Republican contenders holds executive office, and
that governing Texas is a big job, not unlike governing the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all its mystique and undisputed national stature, Texas
actually has one of the weakest gubernatorial offices in the
country, a legacy of a Reconstruction-era constitution that was
written to curb executive power.
</P>
<P>
   According to political scientists, Texas stands anywhere from
the bottom third to dead last among the 50 states, when ranked by
the constitutional powers granted its governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The imagined office is much greater than the real office,''
said Richard Murray, a political science professor at the
University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a quirky paradox: The job offers a bully pulpit
with national reach, yet it has fewer institutional powers than,
say, the governor of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has no formal cabinet, because those
positions are held by elected officials with their own political
bases. The governor controls appointments to powerful state
regulatory boards, but often the appointments are staggered from
previous administrations.
</P>
<P>
   And the governor is far less influential in the writing and
administering of the budget, which is dominated by the Legislature
and the lieutenant governor, compared with governors like Christie
Whitman in New Jersey and George Pataki in New York. (The New York
governor's office is considered the most powerful in the nation.)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike New York, where governors have risen to the presidency
(Franklin D. Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt), tried and failed (Al
Smith and Nelson Rockefeller), or thought about it a good bit
(Mario Cuomo), the Texas job has not served as springboard, at
least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   John Connally, regarded as the state's most successful modern
governor, sought the Republican presidential nomination but lost
badly. The state's two presidents, Lyndon Johnson and George Bush,
did their apprentice work in Washington, not Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The job's inherent restrictions have always made it hard for
even an ambitious Texas governor to accomplish the sort of big
things that can launch a presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   Connally managed to pass sweeping reforms and improvements to
the state's higher education system in 1965. But he benefited from
flush times and widespread public sympathy (his arm was in a sling
from injuries he suffered while riding with John F. Kennedy on the
day Kennedy was assassinated).
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mark White later passed reforms to public schools, but with
significant help from Ross Perot, who spent untold amounts of money
lobbying for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, of George W. Bush?
</P>
<P>
   Does a weak office mean that Bush has been a weak governor?
</P>
<P>
   Few academics or lawmakers in Texas would argue that.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the nature of the office has in many ways helped shape
what some observers regard as the split personality of Bush's style
of governing.
</P>
<P>
   Upon taking office in 1995, Bush seemed to understand that he
could succeed only with the good will of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   He established a chummy, back-slapping tone, paying unexpected
courtesy calls to flattered legislators in both parties and
ingratiating himself with the two leading Democrats _ Lt. Gov. Bob
Bullock and House Speaker Pete Laney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be more of a love fest with Bush,'' said state
Rep. Steven Wolens of Dallas, one of many Democratic legislators
who speak warmly of the governor. ``He is very, very accessible.
And he is pal-sy.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was that the 1995 Legislative session was regarded as
a ringing success for the new governor.
</P>
<P>
   He had set out four broad issues during the campaign _ juvenile
justice, welfare reform, tort reform and education _ and
legislation was enacted on all four.
</P>
<P>
   None of it represented seismic change, and some observers
complained that Bush hadn't led so much as jumped, in Clinton-esque
fashion, in front of a parade that was already under way.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all four issues were popular with voters and in the
legislative pipeline before his election. But Bush was seen as
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to coerce, cajole and convince these people to do
what you want to do,'' said Bush's close friend, state Sen. David
Sibley, a Republican from Waco, in explaining the influence exerted
by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, emboldened by his popularity and eager to
burnish his legacy and his presidential ambitions, Bush proposed a
sweeping overhaul of the state's unwieldy tax structure. Doing so
might have ranked Bush with John Connally, who is credited with
significantly improving the state's system of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush failed.
</P>
<P>
   His plan promised to lower property taxes and stabilize school
funding while raising sales taxes, but an alternative bill was
passed with the governor's blessing, only to die in the Senate at
the hands of his fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did win a $1 billion tax cut that many regarded as a
consolation prize.

   More important, in the eyes of some observers he failed to
effectively use his bully pulpit _ perhaps the greatest tool of his

<P>
   There was no clear answer; Bush was widely regarded as playing
defense as friendly lawmakers killed any bills that might present
embarrassments during the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons that Bush has taken from his office seem mixed.
Legislators describe him as flexible and hardly an ideologue.
Several lawmakers, including Democrats, credited the governor with
projecting a genuine sense of non-partisanship in his dealings with
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this talent is transferable to the presidency is
uncertain. President Jimmy Carter's problems with the Georgia
Legislature during his years as governor there seem now to have
foreshadowed his later struggles with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, however, had apparently learned the art of
massaging legislative egos as governor of Arkansas, yet his
relationship with Congress has often been poisonous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the ability to reach across party lines and work with
people translate to Washington?'' asked state Rep. Paul Sadler, an
influential East Texas Democrat. ``The answer is `I don't know.'''
</P>
<P>
   But others said Bush's collegial approach does not always work
for a leader, even a popular leader, as seen in his tax failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``His approach has kept him from being bold, because it's an
approach that depends on the goodwill and friendship of others,''
Buchanan said. ``It means not stepping on toes.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The string of denunciations of the military's
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, triggered by Hillary Rodham
Clinton and quickly followed by President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, don't tell Americans that the policy will be
tough to change and don't ask why it hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   The policy is law, and not just a mere regulation to wipe away
with a new president's signature on an executive order. And there
are no signs that Congress, even if Democrats regain control of one
or both chambers in next year's election, will change the
compromise lawmakers hammered out with President Clinton in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the debate is a more fundamental question: Why hasn't
the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy worked? The military has been
far more effective in integrating blacks and women into the armed
forces than it has with gays. The recent court-martial of an Army
private convicted of brutally murdering a gay soldier has also
turned up the political heat on the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials insist that the policy is fine, but that its
enforcement needs improvement. ``What we haven't done is adequately
police the harassment,'' said one senior military official who
follows the policy closely.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered the Pentagon's
inspector general to investigate major military bases to determine
whether gay members are harassed. Each of the armed services is
also preparing new training programs to educate troops on the
five-year-old policy.
</P>
<P>
   The military's experience with integrating blacks and women
offers some lessons in effective approaches for changing a culture
that strives for an esprit de corps. The two examples, however
imperfect, show how the military had to overcome deep prejudices
largely for practical reasons. Blacks were needed to fill the ranks
during the Korean War. Women were needed for the new all-volunteer
force in the early 1970s after the Vietnam War. Senior commanders
publicly supported both changes.
</P>
<P>
   These changes took years to carry out, and there have been
plenty of bumps along the way. President Harry Truman's 1948
executive order speeded desegregation of the ranks, but it wasn't
until the 1960s that the number of black sergeants and officers
grew significantly. There are still relatively few black generals
and admirals.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter century after large numbers of women were brought into
the military, sexual harassment persists, and women are still
restricted from several combat positions. The Navy continues to bar
women from nuclear-powered submarines on the grounds that putting
men and women side by side in such tight confines would wreak havoc
with the crew's war-fighting ability.
</P>
<P>
   The military draws a sharp distinction between racial and sexual
intolerance: race carries no behavioral implications; sex does.
That is why the military can condemn racial bigotry and sexual
harassment but separate men and women in living quarters: sex
between service members could seriously disrupt morale.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials argue that most Americans _ and, therefore,
most soldiers _ don't actually approve of or tolerate
homosexuality. And while gay service members make up only a tiny
fraction of the 1.4 million-member military (compared with 20
percent blacks and 14 percent women), commanders fear that forcing
heterosexual members to live, or fight, side by side with
homosexuals _ and possibly be exposed to gay sex _ would be
disruptive, and undermine the military's mission to fight and win
the nation's wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open homosexuals would paralyze a unit, and degrade unit
cohesion and erode combat readiness,'' Gen. Merrill McPeak, the Air
Force chief of staff, told a Senate hearing in 1993, summing up a
sentiment prevalent among top uniformed officers today.

<P>
   Gay rights advocates say the same argument was used to exclude
blacks and women. More than 60 percent of Americans opposed racial
integration when President Truman issued his executive order. The
prejudices were overcome not with sensitivity training but with the
enforcement of strict codes of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But when President Clinton tried to lift the ban on gay service
members in 1993, he faced a near-rebellion from the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and resounding defeat in a Congress controlled by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask, don't tell'' was the weak compromise that was
designed to permit gay men and lesbians to serve without fear of
harassment or expulsion as long as they kept their orientation to
themselves. The policy has been carried out unevenly and has,
arguably, caused more harm than good. Gay rights groups say it has
encouraged harassment in some units.
</P>
<P>
   The number of service members discharged for homosexuality
soared to 1,145 in the 1998 fiscal year, which is nearly double the
number in 1993, when the policy was hotly debated. The Pentagon
says most of those discharges involve young soldiers who
volunteered information as a way to get out of the military. But
gay rights advocates say gays are seeking escape from harassment or
improper investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Most military officials insist that, in general, ``don't ask,
don't tell'' is working. But critics, including those who disagree
on whether to allow gays to serve openly, say the policy has
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ```Don't ask, don't tell' was a compromise that never could have
worked without sustained leadership at the highest levels,'' said
Rep. Martin Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat on the House Armed
Services Committee who has long supported allowing gays to serve
openly.

<P>
   Rep. Stephen Buyer, an Indiana Republican on the same committee

should ask recruits about their orientation. ``With `don't ask,

   WASHINGTON _ The string of denunciations of the military's
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, triggered by Hillary Rodham
Clinton and quickly followed by President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, don't tell Americans that the policy will be
tough to change and don't ask why it hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   The policy is law, and not just a mere regulation to wipe away
with a new president's signature on an executive order. And there
are no signs that Congress, even if Democrats regain control of one
or both chambers in next year's election, will change the
compromise lawmakers hammered out with President Clinton in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the debate is a more fundamental question: Why hasn't
the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy worked? The military has been
far more effective in integrating blacks and women into the armed
forces than it has with gays. The recent court-martial of an Army
private convicted of brutally murdering a gay soldier has also
turned up the political heat on the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials insist that the policy is fine, but that its
enforcement needs improvement. ``What we haven't done is adequately
police the harassment,'' said one senior military official who
follows the policy closely.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered the Pentagon's
inspector general to investigate major military bases to determine
whether gay members are harassed. Each of the armed services is
also preparing new training programs to educate troops on the
five-year-old policy.
</P>
<P>
   The military's experience with integrating blacks and women
offers some lessons in effective approaches for changing a culture
that strives for an esprit de corps. The two examples, however
imperfect, show how the military had to overcome deep prejudices
largely for practical reasons. Blacks were needed to fill the ranks
during the Korean War. Women were needed for the new all-volunteer
force in the early 1970s after the Vietnam War. Senior commanders
publicly supported both changes.
</P>
<P>
   These changes took years to carry out, and there have been
plenty of bumps along the way. President Harry Truman's 1948
executive order speeded desegregation of the ranks, but it wasn't
until the 1960s that the number of black sergeants and officers
grew significantly. There are still relatively few black generals
and admirals.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter century after large numbers of women were brought into
the military, sexual harassment persists, and women are still
restricted from several combat positions. The Navy continues to bar
women from nuclear-powered submarines on the grounds that putting
men and women side by side in such tight confines would wreak havoc
with the crew's war-fighting ability.
</P>
<P>
   The military draws a sharp distinction between racial and sexual
intolerance: race carries no behavioral implications; sex does.
That is why the military can condemn racial bigotry and sexual
harassment but separate men and women in living quarters: sex
between service members could seriously disrupt morale.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials argue that most Americans _ and, therefore,
most soldiers _ don't actually approve of or tolerate
homosexuality. And while gay service members make up only a tiny
fraction of the 1.4 million-member military (compared with 20
percent blacks and 14 percent women), commanders fear that forcing
heterosexual members to live, or fight, side by side with
homosexuals _ and possibly be exposed to gay sex _ would be
disruptive, and undermine the military's mission to fight and win
the nation's wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open homosexuals would paralyze a unit, and degrade unit
cohesion and erode combat readiness,'' Gen. Merrill McPeak, the Air
Force chief of staff, told a Senate hearing in 1993, summing up a
sentiment prevalent among top uniformed officers today.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   But with public opinion polls showing Americans more accepting
of gays in the workplace, the American military may be one of the
last major battlegrounds of gay intolerance left in society. Just
last week, Britain became the latest NATO ally to end its ban on
gays in the military, acting under pressure from the European Court
of Human Rights. Under its new policy, which American gay rights
groups advocate, sexual behavior involving on-duty personnel will
be a punishable offense but a member's sexual orientation will not.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that hostility in the military toward gays may
be easing. Gay rights groups say there are fewer mass
investigations and criminal prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   An anecdotal survey of troops in Bosnia last year conducted by
the sociologists Charles Moskos of Northwestern University and
Laura L. Miller of the University of California at Los Angeles
found that 26 percent of the servicemen said gay men and lesbians
should be allowed to serve openly, compared with 15 percent in
1993, when the policy was under debate. Women seem more accepting,
with 52 percent saying gay men and lesbians should be allowed to
serve, compared with 33 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Still, any policy shift seems a long way off. ``Public attitudes
and military attitude change slowly on these issues,'' said Edwin
Dorn, a former top Pentagon personnel official. ``Whether we like
it or not, the political reality is there are a lot of folks who
believe that homosexuality is wrong.''

   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-GAYS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The denunciations of the
military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, triggered by Hillary
Rodham Clinton and quickly followed by President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, don't tell Americans that the policy will be
tough to change and don't ask why it hasn't worked. By Eric
Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-BUSH-REVIEW (Houston) _ In a campaign in which both his
intellect and his experience have come under attack, Gov. George W.
Bush is reminding voters of two things: that he alone among the
Republican contenders for president holds executive office, and
that governing Texas is a big job, not unlike governing the nation.
Yet Texas actually has one of the weakest gubernatorial offices in
the country, a legacy of a Reconstruction-era constitution that was
written to curb executive power. By Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   PEANUTS-BASEBALL-REVIEW (Undated) _ For 50 years, Charles Schulz
tortured Charlie Brown through a number of devices _ never letting
him kick the football, entangling him in the kite-eating tree,
paralyzing him with fear before the little red-haired girl. Yet
none captured Schulz's fondness for futility more deliciously than
those involving baseball. Schulz, 77, who will end his ``Peanuts''
strip Jan. 4 to focus on treatment for colon cancer, has called
baseball his favorite motif of all. By Alan Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   TWINN-DOLLS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The My Twinn doll, personalized
from a menu of skin tones, eye shades and matching moles, has been
around for about six years. News articles have raised concerns that
the dolls may be inspiring narcissism, creating a plastic race of
Stepford dolls and, worst of all, stifling the imagination of
children by giving them clones for imaginary friends. By Doreen
Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   GOVERNMENT-WAGES-REVIEW (Undated) _ That deafening silence you
hear is the sound of presidential hopefuls debating whether
government should intervene in the wage-setting process to help
people afford a better life. Today, it seems, everyone agrees that
the market does this best. By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-POLIITCS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Religious language has
always played a role in American political life, on rare occasion
achieving a profound resonance, as it did in Lincoln's Second
Inaugural Address. But politicians who speak publicly about
religious belief, lacking Lincoln's eloquence, usually talk in
general terms. The political statements made in recent days fly in
the face of that tradition. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-TRIALS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In recent weeks a wide array of
insurance companies have agreed to pay for experimental cancer
treatments administered to policyholders who participate in
clinical trials sanctioned by federal health agencies. It is a
development that experts described as momentous. By Gina Kolata and
Kurt Eichenwald.
</P>
<P>
   MENTAL-ILLNESS-REVIEW (Undated) The nation is suffering from a
veritable epidemic of mental illness, according to a report last
week by the surgeon general of the United States, which asserted
that ``22 percent of the population has a diagnosable mental
disorder.'' But how is mental illness defined? There seem to be
some large gray areas in which ordinary life-adjustment problems
and vexing behaviors are classified as mental illnesses requiring
clinical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-POLITICS-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Just six months ago, veteran
Russia watchers were predicting the disintegration of Russia's
central authority, pulled apart by centrifugal forces that were
moving power away from the Kremlin. Now, they are not quite so
sure. At the close of Sunday's parliamentary elections, which are
widely seen as a test run for the presidential race next June, the
political picture looks quite different. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   PANAMA-CANAL-REVIEW (Panama City) _ Ever since Balboa sighted
the Pacific Ocean from a hill here in 1513, this has been one of
the world's great geopolitical battlegrounds. The competitors may
have changed, but the link between control of the isthmus and
dominance in world trade has remained constant. Now, with the
United States having formally handed the canal over to Panama last
week, a new phase of that Great Game is beginning. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   SCANDANAVIANS-CHILDREN-REVIEW (Oslo, Norway) _ Anette Sorensen,
the Danish mother arrested for leaving her baby unattended on a
sidewalk outside an East Village restaurant in 1997, wept openly
last week when a federal jury rejected her multimillion-dollar
false-arrest claim against New York City. But sympathy for the
young actress in her homeland has all but evaporated. By Walter
Gibbs.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, December 19, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-GAYS-REVIEW (Washington) _ The denunciations of the
military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy, triggered by Hillary
Rodham Clinton and quickly followed by President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, don't tell Americans that the policy will be
tough to change and don't ask why it hasn't worked. By Eric
Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-BUSH-REVIEW (Houston) _ In a campaign in which both his
intellect and his experience have come under attack, Gov. George W.
Bush is reminding voters of two things: that he alone among the
Republican contenders for president holds executive office, and
that governing Texas is a big job, not unlike governing the nation.
Yet Texas actually has one of the weakest gubernatorial offices in
the country, a legacy of a Reconstruction-era constitution that was
written to curb executive power. By Jim Yardley.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   PEANUTS-BASEBALL-REVIEW (Undated) _ For 50 years, Charles Schulz
tortured Charlie Brown through a number of devices _ never letting
him kick the football, entangling him in the kite-eating tree,
paralyzing him with fear before the little red-haired girl. Yet
none captured Schulz's fondness for futility more deliciously than
those involving baseball. Schulz, 77, who will end his ``Peanuts''
strip Jan. 4 to focus on treatment for colon cancer, has called
baseball his favorite motif of all. By Alan Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   TWINN-DOLLS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The My Twinn doll, personalized
from a menu of skin tones, eye shades and matching moles, has been
around for about six years. News articles have raised concerns that
the dolls may be inspiring narcissism, creating a plastic race of
Stepford dolls and, worst of all, stifling the imagination of
children by giving them clones for imaginary friends. By Doreen
Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   GOVERNMENT-WAGES-REVIEW (Undated) _ That deafening silence you
hear is the sound of presidential hopefuls debating whether
government should intervene in the wage-setting process to help
people afford a better life. Today, it seems, everyone agrees that
the market does this best. By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-POLIITCS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Religious language has
always played a role in American political life, on rare occasion
achieving a profound resonance, as it did in Lincoln's Second
Inaugural Address. But politicians who speak publicly about
religious belief, lacking Lincoln's eloquence, usually talk in
general terms. The political statements made in recent days fly in
the face of that tradition. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-TRIALS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In recent weeks a wide array of
insurance companies have agreed to pay for experimental cancer
treatments administered to policyholders who participate in
clinical trials sanctioned by federal health agencies. It is a
development that experts described as momentous. By Gina Kolata and
Kurt Eichenwald.
</P>
<P>
   MENTAL-ILLNESS-REVIEW (Undated) The nation is suffering from a
veritable epidemic of mental illness, according to a report last
week by the surgeon general of the United States, which asserted
that ``22 percent of the population has a diagnosable mental
disorder.'' But how is mental illness defined? There seem to be
some large gray areas in which ordinary life-adjustment problems
and vexing behaviors are classified as mental illnesses requiring
clinical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-POLITICS-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Just six months ago, veteran
Russia watchers were predicting the disintegration of Russia's
central authority, pulled apart by centrifugal forces that were
moving power away from the Kremlin. Now, they are not quite so
sure. At the close of Sunday's parliamentary elections, which are
widely seen as a test run for the presidential race next June, the
political picture looks quite different. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   PANAMA-CANAL-REVIEW (Panama City) _ Ever since Balboa sighted
the Pacific Ocean from a hill here in 1513, this has been one of
the world's great geopolitical battlegrounds. The competitors may
have changed, but the link between control of the isthmus and
dominance in world trade has remained constant. Now, with the
United States having formally handed the canal over to Panama last
week, a new phase of that Great Game is beginning. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   SCANDANAVIANS-CHILDREN-REVIEW (Oslo, Norway) _ Anette Sorensen,
the Danish mother arrested for leaving her baby unattended on a
sidewalk outside an East Village restaurant in 1997, wept openly
last week when a federal jury rejected her multimillion-dollar
false-arrest claim against New York City. But sympathy for the
young actress in her homeland has all but evaporated. By Walter
Gibbs.

COMMENTARY: SADDAM DOES VEGAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because of rising oil demand from Asia, and the OPEC cartel's
limiting of its production, the oil market has been very tight for
the past six months. In this tight market, Saddam Hussein's Iraq
became the enormously powerful swing producer _ the only country
willing and able to suddenly turn on or off its oil tap. When
Saddam was pumping his 2 million barrels a day, prices stayed
steady or fell. But if he suddenly stopped, oil prices could
skyrocket. On Nov. 23 Saddam suddenly stopped, sending prices
soaring. He said he was doing this in protest of continuing U.N.
sanctions. Don't believe it. Here's my guess at what Saddam and his
oil minister were really saying to each other:
</P>
<P>
   SADDAM: So, how did our strategy work out?
</P>
<P>
   OIL MINISTER: Great Leader, it worked like a charm. Last March
OPEC agreed on production cuts in order to soak up world oil
inventories and tighten up the market. After all those years of
OPEC countries' cheating on their production, they actually did cut
back. Just as we expected, that pushed prices up, from about $10 to
$20 a barrel, and made our swing production that much more
important. In July and August we started buying oil futures through
our front companies in Europe. We went long on oil futures at an
average of $20 a barrel. Over the months we bought 100 million
barrels of futures. Then when you suddenly stopped our production
in November, and the price went to $27, we picked up $7 a barrel.
That's $700 million, Great Leader, in just a few weeks. That's
almost as good as buying Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   SADDAM: And you were ready when I moved last week?
</P>
<P>
   OIL MINISTER: Of course, Great Leader! As soon as you told me
your plan to tell the United Nations by mid-December that you would
resume pumping oil for food, I liquidated our oil futures at the
top of the market and locked in our profits before the price fell.
All the money's been sent to your Beirut bank account _ which is
now The Mother of All Accounts. When will the Americans ever figure
out how you've been funding yourself?
</P>
<P>
   SADDAM: And did you take care of our Chinese friends?
</P>
<P>
   OIL MINISTER: Just as you instructed, Great Leader. We tipped
them off early to our plan. It is hysterically funny for me to read
the oil newsletters. They've all been asking why it was that the
Chinese oil companies suddenly started buying up all the North Sea
oil they could get their hands on in early November. The oil
experts don't have a clue it was because the Chinese were in on our
plan.
</P>
<P>
   SADDAM: You know the Americans keep thinking that Alan Greenspan
is the Master of the Universe. But he's not. I am. I have the power
to shoot oil prices up or down any time I want. I can create a lot
of inflation and maybe even force Greenspan to raise interest
rates. That wouldn't be good for the U.S. stock markets. The
Pentagon can bomb me, but I can bomb the Nasdaq. They may discover
I've got them over a barrel _ hah! Get it? Over a barrel!
</P>
<P>
   OIL MINISTER: Great Leader, you are so funny. Speaking of jokes,
how will you handle the Syrians cozying up to the Israelis and
Americans?
</P>
<P>
   SADDAM: The Americans think they can isolate me by pulling the
Syrians to their side and then by having the U.N. Security Council
vote for their imperialist resolution that suspends the economic
sanctions on Iraq _ provided I allow U.N. arms inspectors back
here. But I don't want U.N. snoops here again, if I can help it.
That may mean my people will have to go hungry some more, but
hunger is good. It means they have less energy to focus on me.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans should note that the French, Russians and Chinese
all abstained from their U.N. resolution. That's because they look
at the Syrian capitulation as another sign that the Americans want
to run the whole Middle East. France, Russia and China believe that
by supporting Iraq they can prevent U.S. hegemony.
</P>
<P>
   There's a bet going on out here. Assad, Arafat, Mubarak, King
Abdullah, they're all betting on the old order and the new emperor
_ Emperor Uncle Sam. Me, I'm betting that after all these leaders
go, a new Arab generation will come of age that will want a new
order and will turn to me, Saddam Hussein, King of Kings, to kick
out the Americans and regain their independence. I'm flush with
cash right now, so, you wanna bet?

COMMENTARY: NO FANCY SPOKEN HERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to plan for the future without a sense of
history, the historian Daniel Boorstin said, is like trying to
plant cut flowers.
</P>
<P>
   So how do we judge whether those who would tend our national
garden are planting cut flowers? We should give them more quizzes!
And make them give longer answers!
</P>
<P>
   That's the opinion of the noted historian David McCullough.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign where John McCain and Bill Bradley seem to have
cornered all the combustion with their allegedly plain-spoken,
putatively maverick and vauntedly Trumanesque politics, I asked the
author of ``Truman'' how we can tell who's faking authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the way candidates for the Foreign Service have to pass a
foreign language test,'' he says, ``we should make presidential
candidates pass a test'' on history, both personal and global.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough, who is writing a book on John and Abigail Adams and
so spends his days with the extraordinary individuals who created
the Republic, is chagrined that we have devolved to the point where
the burning issue of the day is whether George W. Bush read a book
about Dean Acheson, or any book at all.
</P>
<P>
   The historian observes that we need to know much more about
people before we put them in the Oval Office. He would test for
``groundedness,'' and include these questions:
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is your favorite president, and why?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Which figures in world history interest you most?'' (Aside
from Jesus.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could drive from here to St. Louis with any one of
these people, whom would you pick: Andrew Jackson, Abigail Adams,
Thomas Edison or Eugene O'Neill?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could spend half an hour with someone who occupied the
presidency in the past, whom would you pick?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever see a movie or read a book that genuinely changed
your life?'' (Aside from the Bible.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your favorite poem?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the best speech you ever heard?''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough sees the appeal of the designedly scrappy campaigns
of Bradley and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are craving something that isn't a contrivance,'' he
says. ``It's terribly disconcerting to think that every single
thing we're sold by commerce or politics is somehow a con. It's not
just authenticity we want. It's backbone and common sense. We have
been exposed to so much political behavior that's lewd and sordid
and contrary to common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think McCain and Bradley are grandstanding or
posturing,'' he says dryly. ``But if this is posturing, let's have
more of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so marinated in hypocrisy and untrustworthiness. When I
read that the president took a poll to figure out whether to tell
the truth about Monica Lewinsky, that's more unsettling than the
fact of his not telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he found the joint effort by Bradley and McCain to fix
campaign finance reform ``emblematic of a larger desire to reform
and improve the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``William Clinton's presidency was all about him. Real leaders
look outward. Clinton wanted to build a bridge to the future. That
doesn't mean anything. That's a bridge that runs off into the air.
He was never willing to risk his political life for something he
believed in.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not McCain is Truman, the historian thinks that Bush
is Dewey. ``Their campaign strategy is similar,'' he says. ``Don't
rock the boat. We've got it wrapped up. Don't do anything dumb or
controversial. Stick with platitudes and you'll come in with the
tide.''
</P>
<P>
   He has no patience for Donald Trump and Steve Forbes and the
rest of the rich and famous and vain who would be president.
``They're all clowns and bozos and show-offs with awful,
embarrassing egos,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The more he studies American history, the more convinced he is
that human nature matters for history. ``What's so fascinating is
to see how often the ups and downs of history derive from that
mysterious ingredient called personality,'' he says. ``It's not a
coincidence that the best presidents had a genuine sense of
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't see themselves as the be-all and end-all of
creation, but simply as part of a long-running chain going all the
way back to George Washington.''
</P>

RUSSIA TRIES TO BLOCK ROUTE FROM CHECHNYA INTO GEORGIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-ELECT) 
(mk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In an effort to block the southern escape routes for
Islamic rebels in Chechnya, Russian paratroopers have cut the road
between the breakaway region and Georgia, its neighbor to the
south.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian officials reported that Russian helicopters had dropped
bombs on the Georgian side of the border in an apparent effort to
seal the border, and President Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia vowed
a response. The paratroopers were flown in by helicopter and have
taken up positions inside Chechnya, but near the Georgia border.
</P>
<P>
   ``This operation could change the whole picture of the
counterterrorist operation in the North Caucasus,'' Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin said, providing an encouraging account of the war as
Russians prepared to vote in weekend elections for the lower house
of parliament, the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-month war, Russian troops have attacked from
the north, the west and the east, but there had been no Russian
forces blocking the Georgian border.
</P>
<P>
   The operation to seal that frontier has a long history. The
Russians initially sought to persuade Georgia to let Russian troops
on to the Georgian side of the border. Georgia refused, afraid that
it would be drawn into the war.
</P>
<P>
   The move underscores that Russia is determined to win a
decisive, if bloody, victory over its foes. Islamic rebels in
Grozny, Chechnya's capital, are already surrounded. Now, Russia
appears to be trying to encircle a separate group of rebels in the
south.
</P>
<P>
   Grozny was the scene of more bombing Friday night, and fighting
between Russian troops and rebel forces on the city's outskirts.
All told, about 50 strikes were carried out through Chechnya by
planes and helicopters during the past 24 hours, Russian officials
at the Mozdok air base near Chechnya said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks have produced an outcry in Western capitals. On
Saturday, the European Union signaled that it was drawing up a list
of sanctions as a result of Russia's military campaign. Chris
Patten, the external affairs commissioner for the European Union,
said the organization could not carry out ``business as usual''
with Russia while it wages war.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians began bombarding and encircling Chechnya after
Islamic rebels based there made incursions in August into the
Russian-ruled republic of Dagestan to its east. After the rebels
were driven back, explosions in apartment buildings in Russia and
in Dagestan killed almost 300 people. Russian authorities blamed
Chechen rebels. The status of Chechnya _ officially a Russian
republic _ was left in limbo after a 1994-96 war in which thousands
of Russian soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, there has been virtually no criticism of the war, and
Putin's running of the conflict is very popular. In Sunday's
parliamentary elections, he has endorsed the pro-Kremlin Unity
party, led by Sergei Shoigu, the minister for emergency situations,
increasing its ratings substantially from virtually nil.
</P>
<P>
   Shoigu has sought to exploit the war politically by highlighting
his efforts to rescue civilians from Grozny, although they have not
so far led to any large outpouring of civilians from the city,
which is thought to contain as many as 45,000 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Russian public has been presented with a
reassuring version of the campaign. Putin said Saturday that
civilian casualties ``could be counted on one's fingers'' and
denounced reports of heavy civilian casualties as a ``propaganda
and a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian account of civilian casualties, however, is
grievously understated. The civilians remaining in Grozny, many of
them ethnic Russians, have endured hunger, cold, marauders and
indiscriminate bombing. And tens of thousands of others have been
caught in the fighting in other towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Chechen rebels assert that several thousand
civilians have been killed, although these figures, too, cannot be
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian spokesmen, Russian military casualties have
been held to a minimum. Official figures state that 404 Russian
soldiers and 129 Interior Ministry troops have been killed, high by
the standards of the American military but low compared with the
earlier war.
</P>
<P>
   The figures given for Russian military casualties do not include
soldiers who are ``missing in action,'' but are almost certainly
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters working for foreign news media who have disclosed
failed military operations _ like the destruction last week of what
was apparently a Russian reconnaissance force of more than 100
soldiers in Grozny _ have been denounced as agents for foreign
powers who dispense Chechen disinformation.

VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT AND CHURCH IN WAR OF WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Since voters swept him to power 12 months
ago, President Hugo Chavez has quarreled with and berated nearly
every part of the establishment here: political parties, business
leaders and intellectuals. So it was probably inevitable that he
would also end up feuding with the Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   After months of behind-the-scenes jousting, Chavez, a former
paratroop colonel who led an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1992, and
the church hierarchy are openly engaged in a war of words that
threatens to create a split between church and state in this
overwhelmingly Catholic country.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of weeks, Chavez has branded the head of the
national conference of bishops ``a pathetic ignoramus,'' accused a
former papal nuncio of condoning ``immorality,'' and threatened to
``exorcise'' what he called ``devils in vestments.'' Though the
church says publicly that its policy is one of turning the other
cheek, in private there are ample indications that its posture
toward the president has already hardened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the right to respond,'' Chavez said at a news
conference Tuesday, explaining his attacks on members of the church
hierarchy, including an elderly retired cardinal who said recently
that Chavez reminded him of Mussolini and another prelate who
compared him to Zorro. ``I have to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate cause of the tension is the new constitution that
voters resoundingly approved last week. Though the charter contains
an article declaring the right to life ``from conception,'' instead
of ``from birth'' as some of Chavez's supporters wished, church
leaders have made it clear they are not satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language is very confusing, and the studies our judicial
experts have conducted indicate that it is incomplete,'' Baltazar
Porras, president of the Venezuelan Conference of Bishops, said in
an interview here. ``It opens the door not only to abortion but to
all kinds of anti-natal policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The church hierarchy has also expressed concerns about
provisions that describe education as primarily a responsibility of
the state. With the example of the Mexican Revolution in mind, the
church sees that provision as potentially limiting or even
abolishing the right to private education or its own network of
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Bishop Roberto Luckert of Coro spoke against the new
constitution on his diocese's radio station. A day later, in an
action criticized by human rights groups, two military intelligence
agents entered the station, accused the manager of sabotaging the
political process and warned her that they would be monitoring
future broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's dispute with the church is occurring against a backdrop
that, in terms of his personal life, can only be called delicate.
His wife, Marisabel, is seeking the annulment of her first marriage
so that she and the president, married in a civil ceremony in 1997,
can have a formal Catholic church wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Porras said that Mrs. Chavez's long-stalled annulment petition
``bears no relation whatsoever'' to the current state of tension
between church and state. But he acknowledged that the Vatican
would scrutinize her request, made about four years before she
married the president, ``with special care and thoroughness'' and
``could be more strict'' than normal in order to ``avoid the
appearance that special privileges have been granted.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the church hierarchy has taken steps to
separate from Chavez the Rev. Jesus Gazo, a Spanish-born Jesuit
priest and liberation theology advocate who has been described as
the president's ``spiritual guide.''
</P>
<P>
   After 33 years in Caracas as a chaplain at the Central
University of Venezuela, Gazo was recently transferred to a post
near the Colombian border, as was a bishop who has also been an
enthusiastic supporter of the president. Church officials
maintained that both reassignments were ``routine.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he dabbles in Chinese and Indian philosophy, Chavez
describes himself as a Catholic and often mixes religious
terminology with military and baseball jargon. ``We're in
apocalyptic times, there is no middle ground,'' he said this month
in a typical speech urging voters to approve the new charter.
``Either you are with God or you are with the devil, and we are
with God.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has also not hesitated to employ Christian imagery
against the church itself. ``Forgive them Lord, for they know not
what they do,'' he said, referring to bishops and priests who had
criticized the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Such remarks clearly distress church leaders. ``His language is
Manichaean and somewhat apocalyptic and does not help to create a
climate of tolerance and mutual respect,'' Porras said.

U.S. AGENTS MONITOR MILLENNIUM TROUBLE SPOTS AROUND WORLD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif., Mo., Mass.)   (jw) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Without knowing where, when or whether something
terrible might happen, U.S. government officials are trying to
prepare for the threat of violence at the millennium, whether at
home or abroad.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. customs agents are watching the borders for signs of
trouble. They arrested an Algerian man in Port Angeles, Wash.,
fresh off a ferry from Victoria, British Columbia, on Tuesday
night. His rented car contained the makings of ``a large explosive
device,'' a senior customs official said, and he had airline
reservations for Wednesday night flights to New York and London.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA, working with friendly foreign intelligence and law
enforcement services to track terrorist organizations overseas,
suspects the man, identified as Ahmed Ressam, has terrorist
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the State Department issued its fifth worldwide
warning in the past four months to Americans abroad, saying
``attacks could be planned for locations throughout the world where
large gatherings and celebrations will be taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement and intelligence officials say there was
good reason for that alert. Though none will go on the record, or
cite their evidence, the latest warning followed the arrests of at
least 14 suspects in Jordan and Pakistan last week.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department and the CIA have tied the Algerian arrested
in Port Angeles and the group arrested in Jordan and Pakistan to
what they describe as a global network commanded by Osama bin
Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire who lives in Afghanistan and is
accused of being behind the bombings of two American embassies in
Africa last year.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Jordan say the group _ 12 Jordanians, one Iraqi
and an Algerian _ came from Afghanistan and may have been aiming at
American targets in the Middle East. One of the Jordanians,
identified as Khalil Deek, an exiled Palestinian who holds a U.S.
passport, was arrested in Peshawar, Pakistan, near the border with
Afghanistan, and is suspected to have personal ties to bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is also on alert for threats from within. It says it
foresees ``an uprising in violent activities among certain domestic
groups related to the millennium.'' The bureau anticipates ``a
moderate possibility of small factions of right-wing groups''
banding together ``in an overtly violent manner in order to
initiate the apocalypse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past weeks, FBI agents have arrested a militia leader in
Florida on charges that he planned to blow up a nuclear power plant
and black out Atlanta, and two militia members in California on
charges that they plotted to bomb a power station and propane tanks
holding 24 million gallons of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is really with fringe and apocalyptic groups,''
said Jeff Lanza, an FBI special agent in Kansas City, Mo. ``The
turnover of the millennium is a big date for terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   From now until after the New Year's holiday, hundreds of FBI
agents will be monitoring cyberspace for warnings, like ancients
searching the skies for a sign, looking out for electronic assaults
by hackers and tracking political extremists by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian and military officials across the country, worried
about an organized attempt to take down government computers, are
watching everything from reservoirs to the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The government's counterterrorism coordinator, Richard Clarke of
the National Security Council, repeatedly warns them that
``cyberterrorists'' could launch computer attacks ``shutting down a
city's electricity, shutting down 911 systems, shutting down
telephone networks and transportation systems,'' as he said in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   And American intelligence and law enforcement officers in Israel
and Italy are on the lookout for outbreaks of millennial fervor
among the crowds gathering to mark the new year in Jerusalem and
Vatican City.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, in a recent report on millennial threats, said that
pilgrims making their way to Jerusalem would include ``apocalyptic
cults on a mission to hasten the arrival of the Messiah.'' Israeli
authorities have deported at least 34 Americans fitting that
description this year.
</P>
<P>
   American officials do not know with certainty that any violence
will materialize. Beyond the arrest in Port Angeles, they have few
hard facts to support the fear of a major attack on emblems of
American power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no specific information concerning specific attacks,''
Attorney General Janet Reno said on Thursday. No one else in the
government knows much more than that, said Sen. Robert Bennett,
R-Utah, the chairman of a Senate committee that has been
investigating potential threats linked to the coming of the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows, because we've never lived through anything like
this,'' he said in an interview. ``There is no historic benchmark
like a war or a hurricane or an earthquake. Everybody is
guessing.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Authorities say religious and sectarian celebrations of the
millennium could be a target for extremists, including radical
Islamic groups trying to subvert Middle East peace talks and a
small number of American fundamentalists who believe that the
Bible's prophecy of the apocalypse is about to come true.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, in a study published last month, says extreme
right-wing American groups, like the racist Christian Identity
movement, see the Year 2000 computer fears as ``the perfect event
upon which to instigate a race war.'' Michael Vatis, an FBI
official, told Bennett's committee that ``the coming of the
millennium requires Christian Identity adherents to prepare for the
Second Coming of Christ by taking violent action against their
enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies suggest that tens of millions of Americans believe that
the Book of Revelations' prophecies of apocalypse will come true
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This belief is shared by probably 60 million Americans,'' said
Richard Landes, director of the Center for Millennial Studies at
Boston University and its online journal (www.mille.org). Many of
them think the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 was
``the final major historical event'' before that final battle, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A small band of American fundamentalists plans to be in Israel
to witness this anticipated event in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli authorities already have deported members of an
American millennial group called the Concerned Christians, citing
evidence that the group planned suicidal violence on the streets of
Jerusalem to hasten the Messiah's return.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have spent more than $10 million on new security
measures in and around the Temple Mount, the site of the
third-holiest of all Islamic shrines; the Dome of the Rock and the
Western Wall, the last remnant of the Second Temple, which was
destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jewish and Christian zealots believe that the Messiah's
return will be hastened by the destruction of the Dome of the Rock
and the creation of a Third Temple at the site. This flash point of
potential violence at the millennium is under close scrutiny by the
Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, whose recent report warned that ``millennial violence
in Jerusalem could conceivably lead to violence in the United
States,'' is helping the Israelis track American religious
extremists arriving in Jerusalem, government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At FBI headquarters and at the bureau's 56 field offices in the
United States, hundreds of agents will mark the new year by staring
into computers and looking for signs of political violence,
cyberspace attacks and Year 2000 computer problems at home and
abroad, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem could afflict computer systems at the dawn of the
year 2000, despite billions spent by businesses and governments
spending to fix it. The FBI says that malevolent hackers may try to
exploit the problem with viruses timed to multiply on Jan 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing evidence that some of them will release viruses
that look like Y2K failures but are not,'' Bennett said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A burgeoning high-pressure system over the Northeast will supply
the region with seasonably cold, dry weather Sunday. Morning
readings will be near zero in the valleys of central and northern
New England, but ample sunshine, lasting only nine hours, will
raise temperatures to near normal by afternoon. Meanwhile, a
disturbance east of the Carolinas will circulate cool, moist air
inland across the Middle Atlantic states and the Southeast. A
weakening jet stream disturbance over the southern Piedmont will
produce a few showers in Alabama and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and damp conditions will persist over northern Florida,
but southern sections will notice some sunshine along with more
humid air. A milder, moist airflow from the south will become
established from the Mississippi Valley to the west slopes of the
Appalachians with thickening clouds and a few showers.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of very chilly air will cross the Plains. Gusty
winds and patches of snow showers will accompany the change to cold
weather from Colorado and Nebraska northward into Wyoming and the
Dakotas. As winds begin to blow from the east, snow will develop
along the Front Range and spread southward into the mountains of
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Another very large high-pressure system, centered near Idaho,
will promote dry and cold weather in the central Rockies. Its broad
circulation will bring warm air into southern California. The
Northwest will stay cloudy despite the presence of high pressure
because of a thick stream of moisture from the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Repeat Performance
</P>
<P>
   Most communities in southwest California notched record high
temperatures on Friday. The hottest spot was Riverside with a
reading of 88 degrees. Several places between Los Angeles and San
Diego broke records set in 1998. It was about this time last year
that wintry weather finally made an appearance east of the
Mississippi as the West Coast turned warm and dry. Strangely, there
are clear indications of a repeat performance this year. The warmth
in the Southwest should spread northward along the coast this week
with many record highs expected before the holiday weekend arrives.

CANADA'S LEADER PUSHES BILL TO HINDER SECESSION

 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ With popular support for Quebec's independence in
remission, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada made a bold
gamble with his country's future last week, introducing legislation
that lays out Canada's first road map for national division, but
one so littered with obstacles that he bets the separatists will
never follow it.
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation, which requires a ``clear majority'' voting
on a ``clear question'' on secession, is the direct outgrowth of
what many Canadians now call their nation's ``near death
experience,'' the 1995 Quebec referendum that unity forces won by a
margin of just 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since that high point for separation, polls in Quebec indicated
this fall that support for independence receded to a 10-year low,
around 40 percent. At the same time, popular support for the
separatists' provincial government, headed by Premier Lucien
Bouchard, fell to the lowest point in its five-year history, around
37 percent. In a new poll commissioned by Actualite magazine, 74
percent of Quebec residents interviewed predicted that their
province would remain in Canada ``forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving unity a nudge, Bill Clinton and Jacques Chirac, leaders
of the two foreign countries that the people of Quebec most care
about, the United States and France, came to Quebec this fall and
pointedly praised Canada's federal system of government.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion in Quebec is known to be volatile, as allies
reminded Chretien when he prepared his ``clarity'' legislation in
recent weeks. The veteran prime minister, who entered politics when
John F. Kennedy was in the White House, said he knew best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada is my business, sir,'' Chretien, a Quebec native,
snapped at a reporter who asked him about stirring up the
separatists. ``And it is the future of Canada that is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   While the bill introduced by the 65-year-old prime minister
might seem innocuous to many Americans, it provoked what one
columnist described as ``World War II headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, intended to carry out a Supreme Court decision from
last year, authorizes the House of Commons in Ottawa to rule on the
clarity of any secessionist question adopted by a provincial
legislature. It also allows Canada's lower house to decide whether
the referendum results constituted a ``clear majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Such seemingly inoffensive language immediately provoked a
string of retorts from Parti Quebecois leaders, including
``brutal,'' ``Soviet-style,'' and an old standby: ``straitjacket.''
</P>
<P>
   On one level, Quebecers of many political stripes believe that
it is entirely up to their provincial legislature to set the rules
for a referendum that would decide the political future of Quebec,
Canada's largest province. Across political lines, the people of
Quebec are galled by the idea that legislators from as far away as
the Yukon would have veto power over the future of Canada's oldest
European society.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of broad Quebec opposition to ``outside
interference,'' criticism has come from the local leader of
Chretien's Liberal Party, Jean Charest, a provincial legislator who
leads in public opinion polls in the race to become Quebec's next
premier. Quebec Liberals and Parti Quebecois legislators may adopt
a common front against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But, below the surface, separatists deeply fear being locked
into a clear referendum question.
</P>
<P>
   In the two secession referendums, the proposal was deliberately
phrased in ambiguous terms. Vague phrases like ``sovereignty,''
``partnership'' and ``association'' were used to draw under one
tent people known as ``soft secessionists'' interested in the kind
of autonomy now enjoyed by Scotland and hard-liners who want to
create an independent French-speaking republic on the northern
border of New England. In focus groups, support for breaking away
from Canada plummeted when questioners used words like
``secession'' and ``independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, polls of Quebecers who voted yes to ``sovereignty'' in
1995 indicated that about one-third believed that they would still
be able to keep their Canadian passports and to send members of
Parliament to Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, Jacques Parizeau, who was Quebec's premier in
1995, revealed that he had harbored other plans. He wrote in his
memoirs that he had typed up a unilateral declaration of
independence and that he had won from the French government a
commitment to recognize an independent Quebec and to exert
diplomatic pressure on other French-speaking nations to follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Such revelations stiffened Chretien's resolve to establish clear
rules of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask a crooked question,'' the prime minister told
reporters. ``Fine. So what? There will be no negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Clarity Act'' also underlines the need for negotiations
over a series of issues that secessionists generally prefer to
leave fuzzy, particularly the problem of English-speaking areas'
seceding from any newly independent Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Before a province could say goodbye to Canada, it would have to
negotiate with Ottawa and the other nine provinces its share of
Canada's $400 billion debt, its borders and its plans to guarantee
the rights of Indians and linguistic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   If the results of the 1995 vote were used as a map, an
independent Quebec would lose most of its border areas with the
United States and Ontario, heavily English-speaking areas that
voted no. In addition, it would lose the top half of the province
as Quebec's Indian and Inuit inhabitants overwhelmingly oppose
breaking ties with Ottawa.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The stage may now be set for a major flare-up of secessionist
sentiment. Last weekend, leaders of Quebec's powerful labor and
student movements appealed on provincial television for a
``mobilization'' of the old sovereignty coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien's new bill ``is hateful, a spitting in the face of
democracy,'' Marc Laviolette, president of the Confederation of
National Trade Unions, said in remarks repeated over and over again
on television. ``The best way to defend the interest of the
province's workers would be to have our own country.''
</P>
<P>
   But the labor leaders were the same ones who, two months ago,
nearly called a provincewide strike against the austerity program
of the secessionist Bouchard government. Contributing to general
dissatisfaction with Quebec's government, in the last six months
there have been a strike by nurses and official audits showing that
the government wasted millions of dollars trying to run a day care
program, a manpower training program and a buyout of provincial
employees.
</P>
<P>
   And Chretien introduced his bill at a time that was hardly
propitious for street demonstrations: students are dispersing for
Christmas vacations and workers are visibly obsessed with the
shopping countdown to the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just don't care,'' lamented Michel Venne, a columnist
for a separatist newspaper here, Le Devoir. Noting that polls this
fall indicated that 70 percent of Quebecers did not want another
referendum, he said: ``It is going to be difficult to mobilize
people.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Kathleen Gray bought the van brand new in 1978.
It took half a year of waiting tables to make the $1,300 down
payment. But it was well worth it. A Volkswagen pop-top camper!
</P>
<P>
   The day she drove it home, she spread her sleeping bag in the
cab, popped open the roof and lay under the built-in tent,
daydreaming of a life on the road.
</P>
<P>
   That life on the road did not work out as planned. Yet now, with
its engine as loud as a helicopter when it agrees to work, the
musty green van is more precious than ever. Every morning when Ms.
Gray leaves for work, she worries that the van will be gone when
she gets back. And then where would she be? The van is her home.
</P>
<P>
   She and her boyfriend, David Aquino, began living in the van
almost two years ago. Before the van became home, the couple lived
for three months in a tent in an encampment at Golden Gate Park.
Before that, both unemployed, they had been evicted from the house
where Aquino grew up. Before that seems like a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   How Ms. Gray became homeless is a complicated story. But in one
crucial respect, Ms. Gray's case is like those of many homeless
people she meets: She got in a bind and had no way to get out of
it. No money. No help.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, six months into working two part-time jobs that
together pay her nearly $1,200 a month, she cannot say when she
will be able to stop using a ratty blanket for a bed or a pickle
jar for a toilet. Not with landlords asking for three months' rent
up front, her boyfriend still not working and past-due bills
waiting to attach themselves to her paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially hard to be homeless in these days of giddy
prosperity. For Ms. Gray, it is like having her nose pressed
against the glass of a big party where money flutters in the air
like confetti. San Francisco, flush with Silicon Valley
professionals, has become so expensive that a six-figure income is
considered middle-class, and basic items like a gallon of regular
gas ($1.60) cost more than anywhere else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray has never been rich. Her parents divorced when she was
12. In her senior year of high school, she abandoned plans for
college to support herself and her mother, who had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But she never thought she would have to count pennies at 44, in
the prime of life. People she meets who are not homeless are always
surprised to learn that she is; she defies the stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau survey of homeless people, released this
month, showed that most were ill, physically or mentally. Ms. Gray
is healthy. She does not drink or use illegal drugs. She does not
come from welfare poverty. She is not a single mother.
</P>
<P>
   Until three years ago, when she quit a job as a concessions
manager at a Renaissance fair in Marin County to attend a school
for prospective travel industry employees, she had worked nonstop
since graduating from high school in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Until she had to do it herself, she says, she always looked at
the people living on the streets with something like revulsion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know it's a lot harder to get out of the fix than to get
in it,'' she said with a laugh, her usual punctuation, as she
stopped at an Anderson's supermarket the other day on her way to
work. By 7 every morning, after a round of catch with Kaya, a
pit-bull mix she and Aquino adopted last year, they arrive at the
supermarket to wash up. Then they buy the breakfast they can
afford: large coffees, light and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Ms. Gray has no good answer when people ask why she
does not go somewhere easier to live.
</P>
<P>
   Living in a vehicle is illegal in San Francisco. Even in a
desolate, wind-whipped neighborhood hard by the ocean, the police
regularly shine lights into the van in the middle of the night.
Once, when the van was towed for a parking violation, it took
several days and $700 of scrounged and borrowed money to get it
back.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the van is as dark and crowded as a storage closet. Good
clothes, like his pin-striped interview suit and her pink down
jacket, hang on a rod. Clean clothes are piled in his and her's
stacks. Laundry sits in plastic grocery bags. Kaya's water and food
dishes are by the driver's seat. Jars used as portable urinals are
discretely lined up on the floor by a stack of boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray, who is tall and broad-shouldered, with a long red
braid, a curtain of bangs and wire-rimmed glasses, often laughs,
loudly, at her daily tribulations. ``We have to use a bathroom
where we can find one,'' she said, laughing, making a beeline for a
veterans' hospital near a park where they exercise Kaya.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Ramen noodles for a week,'' she will say, laughing if she
splurges on a $5 lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police call me a habitual, known offender for sleeping in
the van,'' she says, laughing. ``And it's true: I sleep every
night.''
</P>
<P>
   On weekdays, she works at the Coalition on Homelessness, a
nonprofit advocacy organization. On weekends, she helps run showers
for homeless people at the Mission High School. Her job perks
include invitations to church potlucks and one long hot shower a
week.
</P>
<P>
   No one notices if her hair needs washing or she wears the same
turquoise T-shirt two days in a row.
</P>
<P>
   She and the short, bushy-haired Aquino often borrow the
coalition's van, which they use to push Ms. Gray's van from one
street to the next when it refuses to run.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They met playing darts at a pub. At the time Aquino, who will be
46 this month, had recently left an 11-year job as a sorter for the
Postal Service. He says he quit in anger over a $20,000 bill he
received for interest and penalties on child support (for a
daughter, now in her 20s), which he thought he had paid.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after they met, after a falling out with her
roommate, Ms. Gray moved in with Aquino, who was living with his
grandfather. Divorced from his daughter's mother, he had vowed he
would never marry again, but Ms. Gray said, ``We were going to.''
</P>
<P>
   But her wanderlust, whetted by six years as a waitress and
bartender in Maui (where she bought her van), was not satisfied.
She enrolled in the travel school, hoping for a job on a cruise
ship. ``It had this highfalutin title for what I wanted,'' she
said. ``Destination management.''
</P>
<P>
   Within months, Aquino's grandfather died. The house became the
property of Aquino's estranged father and uncle, who evicted the
couple so they could sell it. Neither Ms. Gray, with her savings
gone and credit cards at their limits, nor Aquino, with his debts,
was in a position to land on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, of course, I wouldn't have quit my job if I knew all
this was going to happen,'' Aquino said, as he sipped an Anchor
Steam ale outdoors on a recent afternoon. ``People just have no
idea how hard it is to get out of the hole of homelessness. You
spend your days surviving. You don't have room for much else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray is convinced that if she and Aquino had been getting
along at the time his grandfather died, they could have fought the
eviction. Instead, they were busy fighting each other. It was so
consuming, she said, that she dropped out of travel school, twice.
She had Aquino arrested for assault after he broke a telephone on
her head. A judge ordered him to attend an anger-management class.
</P>
<P>
   Aquino prefers not to discuss that period. One day, when they
were retracing their descent to the streets, Ms. Gray, laughing,
said, ``Well, things got really hairy when I had David arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Aquino took his baseball cap off, tapped her on the head with it
and said, ``Hey, you stop that.''
</P>
<P>
   The day they were evicted, Ms. Gray invited Aquino to stay with
her in her van until he found somewhere else. Throughout their
ordeals, they have never separated.
</P>
<P>
   She says she tried to leave, alone, before they were evicted.
With both parents gone and her two brothers (one a minister in
Oregon, the other a computer programmer in Southern California),
out of touch, she called an old friend of her mother's and asked to
borrow $5,000. The friend said she could not spare it.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Ms. Gray and Aquino get along fairly well. Their
dog, who is obsessed with chasing tennis balls, is their therapy,
Aquino says.
</P>
<P>
   But they disagree over how to improve their situation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray says it is best to take any job to begin repairing
their broken credit. Aquino says it is not worth getting a job that
pays less than $10 an hour, because it would be impossible to save
money making less. He still receives $345 a month as part of a city
program that tries to steer assistance recipients into solid jobs.
(He once cleaned buses for his stipend.) He says he hopes to become
a truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Gray is still not used to being homeless, she says her
worst moment occurred at the beginning, when she and Aquino were
living in Golden Gate Park. (Ms. Gray's van was in a friend's
driveway in Marin County, refusing to run). Ms. Gray had just
started workfare two days a week for the Parks and Recreation
Department for $345 a month. One day, the parks department was
ordered to sweep all the homeless camps from the park. Ms. Gray, as
part of the crew, was forced to dump her own meager possessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember at the time, thinking well, I was guilty,'' she
said. ``I was living in the park, Now, I see things so differently.
With these sweeps, the city was _ and is _ systematically
destroying people's personal property. Blankets, prescription
medicine, glasses, documents. And I watched as bosses looked the
other way while workfare workers were allowed to keep _ to steal _
things.''
</P>
<P>
   She and 10 other homeless people sued the city in small claims
court for the illegal destruction of their property and won. She
received $500 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working at the coalition has really taught me how to stand up
for myself,'' she said. ``And now, I think I'll always have a
social conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately she has been worried about how to help a quadriplegic
homeless woman in her 30s. The woman spends nights on the ground,
crawling to her chair in the mornings. By the end of the week, when
Ms. Gray helps the woman take a shower, her body and clothes are
soaked in feces and urine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think two things when I see her,'' Ms. Gray said one morning
in the van. ``First, I think, How can we allow this to happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' she said, letting her head fall back against a
tattered window curtain, ``I think, boy, am I lucky. I am just so
lucky.''

   OSLO, Norway _ Anette Sorensen, the Danish mother arrested for
leaving her baby unattended on a sidewalk outside an East Village
restaurant in 1997, wept openly last week when a federal jury
rejected her multimillion-dollar false-arrest claim against New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   But sympathy for the young actress in her homeland has all but
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sorensen's cultural defense _ that Danish mothers leave
their babies outside in strollers all the time _ initially struck a
chord in Denmark and neighboring Norway. Scandinavians are proud of
their relatively safe cities and they relish comparison with New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   But a half dozen young parents who were interviewed admitted
that they would never leave a baby on a Copenhagen sidewalk for an
hour while drinking inside, as Ms. Sorensen was alleged to have
done in Manhattan. Even the Scandinavian habit of parking a
stroller outside for a few moments while posting a letter or buying
a pastry is rapidly fading into nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the countryside and even in minor towns you could maybe
still do that, but Denmark has changed,'' said Per Schultz
Jorgensen, chairman of the Denmark's Council for Children.
``Copenhagen is a city of 1 million people, with many strangers and
lots of people passing on the streets. No, no, parents have to take
much more care.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Copenhagen was roiled by a child kidnapping inside
a shopping mall. While the mother shopped, a two-year-old girl was
snatched by an unknown woman. Twenty-four hours later the toddler
was released in a park by a man in a black car.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sorensen, 32, lost support among her countrymen not only by
overplaying the culture card but by filing her false-arrest
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks she is greedy,'' said Arno Viktor Nielsen, a
professor who also writes widely read newspaper columns on Danish
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Scandinavians have had difficulty understanding Ms. Sorensen's
disappointment over Tuesday's verdict, which still awarded her
$66,400 in damages on a technicality stemming from the failure of
police to inform her of her right to call the Danish Embassy. The
amount converts to nearly half a million Danish kroner, an
astronomical sum by Scandinavian legal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sorensen, eyes puffy, landed on the cover of Copenhagen
tabloids Wednesday under mocking headlines such as, ``Crying over
half a million.'' The respected national newspaper Jyllands-Posten
editorialized: ``Seen through Danish eyes, the damage amount is out
of all proportion, and we hope that we (in Denmark) will never come
to the point where people can demand compensation for making a fool
of themselves.''

   PANAMA CITY _ Ever since Balboa sighted the Pacific Ocean from a
hill here in 1513, this has been one of the world's great
geopolitical battlegrounds. The competitors may have changed, as
the colonial rivalry of Spain and England gave way in the 1800s to
a struggle to build the Panama Canal that pitted France against the
United States, but the link between control of the isthmus and
dominance in world trade has remained constant.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the United States having formally handed the canal
over to Panama last week, a new phase of that Great Game is
beginning. This time it is the trading powers of East Asia that are
emerging as players _ reflecting the waterway's diminishing
importance to U.S. commerce and its growing strategic value to
export-dependent economies on the far side of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Before the canal was built, the United States, emerging as a
world power, envisioned it as the best way to get people and goods
between its Atlantic and Pacific coasts and to unify a new
two-ocean Navy. But today, not only are aircraft carriers too big
to fit through the canal (and missile submarines normally too
secretive to use it), but U.S. companies increasingly prefer
overland routes or air freight for shipping goods between their two
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   For Asians shipping exports across two oceans, however, the
canal is now indispensable. The United States remains its largest
user, but the big trading nations of Asia are catching up fast.
China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan are all in the top 10, and a typical
cargo nowadays is likely to be soybeans from Brazil or oil from
Venezuela on their way to East Asia in exchange for automobiles or
electronic goods destined for the Colon Free Trade Zone here.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a conspicuous burst of Asian investment
here. Taiwanese and Korean consortiums are building separate
industrial parks, and a pair of Chinese shipping tycoons with
competing political loyalties are now solidly installed in the
ports that command both approaches to the canal: Chang Yung-Fa, a
Taiwan loyalist, and his Evergreen Maritime Corp. in Colon at the
Caribbean entrance; and Li Ka-shing, of Hong Kong's Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd., who is cozy with Beijing, in Balboa at the Pacific
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panamanians have an easier time relating to U.S. businessmen
than Chinese or Japanese because culturally they feel more at ease
with Americans,'' said Roberto Eisenmann, a prominent business
leader here who advises President Mireya Moscoso. ``But the
governments of Asia have been much more aggressive than the United
States'' in seeking opportunities here.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, only the conservative Republicans who opposed the
Panama Canal Treaties in 1977, and who now fear that the People's
Liberation Army is sneaking in as the Southern Command moves out,
seem interested in Panama these days. Former Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger warned this month that China is seeking ``a
foothold in one of the world's three major chokepoints,'' while the
Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, fears that ``U.S. naval ships
will be at the mercy of Chinese-controlled pilots and could even be
denied passage through the canal.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the turnover counter that such a focus on the
military ignores the fact that the United States is the only
country with a treaty right to intervene should such an unlikely
scenario occur.
</P>
<P>
   More interestingly, perhaps, a narrow emphasis on the military
plays down the underlying mercantile factor; it is, after all, by
expanding its economy that China has the best chance of becoming a
global power in the next few decades rather than by challenging the
United States militarily in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant contest developing here, according
to Ricardo Arias Calderon, a former vice president of Panama, is
``an intense competition between Taiwan and the People's Republic
of China to advance a broad array of interests'' that are
fundamentally political and economic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Chinese have learned the lesson of 19th-century
England, which understood that it had influence in the
Mediterranean to the extent that it commanded the entrance and
exit'' at Gibraltar and Suez, he added. ``China and Taiwan are
already competing in the South China Sea, and now both are seeking
a presence at the exit on the other side of the Pacific.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, power and influence today can be exercised in a more
subtle manner than by establishing colonies or sending in the
fleet, as the British so often did. Neither Chinese state is in a
position _ or even appears to want _ to supplant America's role as
protector of the canal. So their rivalry has centered on the
commercial facilities in and around the canal and on penetrating
Latin American markets.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, too, is bidding for influence and profit here. It has
underwritten a feasibility study for construction of new canal
locks and is offering to finance a new bridge on extraordinarily
generous terms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet neither Panama, which abolished its armed forces following
the U.S. invasion to overthrow Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega 10 years
ago, nor the Asians can guarantee the security of the canal. That
has historically been a U.S. responsibility _ just as it is America
that guarantees that the sea lanes remain open in Asia. But
defending the canal is a role that has changed enormously in the
last century, if only because the nature of war has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanians say there is virtually no possibility of building a
foolproof military shield these days, a point U.S. military
planners concede privately.
</P>
<P>
   Flying over the canal in a helicopter with Nicolas Ardito
Barletta, the director of the Inter-Oceanic Regional Authority, the
Panamanian government agency that oversees the former Panama Canal
Zone, and looking down on the network of dams and locks that hold
back the man-made Gatun and Madden Lakes, the waterway's
vulnerability in the missile age is evident. If they were to be
blown up, ``the canal would be shut down for two years,'' Barletta
acknowledged. That is why, he added, ``the best guarantee for the
canal is its neutrality.''

   OSLO, Norway _ Anette Sorensen, the Danish mother arrested for
leaving her baby unattended on a sidewalk outside an East Village
restaurant in 1997, wept openly last week when a federal jury
rejected her multimillion-dollar false-arrest claim against New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   But sympathy for the young actress in her homeland has all but
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sorensen's cultural defense _ that Danish mothers leave
their babies outside in strollers all the time _ initially struck a
chord in Denmark and neighboring Norway. Scandinavians are proud of
their relatively safe cities and they relish comparison with New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   But a half dozen young parents who were interviewed admitted
that they would never leave a baby on a Copenhagen sidewalk for an
hour while drinking inside, as Ms. Sorensen was alleged to have
done in Manhattan. Even the Scandinavian habit of parking a
stroller outside for a few moments while posting a letter or buying
a pastry is rapidly fading into nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the countryside and even in minor towns you could maybe
still do that, but Denmark has changed,'' said Per Schultz
Jorgensen, chairman of the Denmark's Council for Children.
``Copenhagen is a city of 1 million people, with many strangers and
lots of people passing on the streets. No, no, parents have to take
much more care.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Copenhagen was roiled by a child kidnapping inside
a shopping mall. While the mother shopped, a two-year-old girl was
snatched by an unknown woman. Twenty-four hours later the toddler
was released in a park by a man in a black car.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sorensen, 32, lost support among her countrymen not only by
overplaying the culture card but by filing her false-arrest
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks she is greedy,'' said Arno Viktor Nielsen, a
professor who also writes widely read newspaper columns on Danish
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Scandinavians have had difficulty understanding Ms. Sorensen's
disappointment over Tuesday's verdict, which still awarded her
$66,400 in damages on a technicality stemming from the failure of
police to inform her of her right to call the Danish Embassy. The
amount converts to nearly half a million Danish kroner, an
astronomical sum by Scandinavian legal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sorensen, eyes puffy, landed on the cover of Copenhagen
tabloids Wednesday under mocking headlines such as, ``Crying over
half a million.'' The respected national newspaper Jyllands-Posten
editorialized: ``Seen through Danish eyes, the damage amount is out
of all proportion, and we hope that we (in Denmark) will never come
to the point where people can demand compensation for making a fool
of themselves.''

   PANAMA CITY _ Ever since Balboa sighted the Pacific Ocean from a
hill here in 1513, this has been one of the world's great
geopolitical battlegrounds. The competitors may have changed, as
the colonial rivalry of Spain and England gave way in the 1800s to
a struggle to build the Panama Canal that pitted France against the
United States, but the link between control of the isthmus and
dominance in world trade has remained constant.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the United States having formally handed the canal
over to Panama last week, a new phase of that Great Game is
beginning. This time it is the trading powers of East Asia that are
emerging as players _ reflecting the waterway's diminishing
importance to U.S. commerce and its growing strategic value to
export-dependent economies on the far side of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Before the canal was built, the United States, emerging as a
world power, envisioned it as the best way to get people and goods
between its Atlantic and Pacific coasts and to unify a new
two-ocean Navy. But today, not only are aircraft carriers too big
to fit through the canal (and missile submarines normally too
secretive to use it), but U.S. companies increasingly prefer
overland routes or air freight for shipping goods between their two
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   For Asians shipping exports across two oceans, however, the
canal is now indispensable. The United States remains its largest
user, but the big trading nations of Asia are catching up fast.
China, Japan, Korea and Taiwan are all in the top 10, and a typical
cargo nowadays is likely to be soybeans from Brazil or oil from
Venezuela on their way to East Asia in exchange for automobiles or
electronic goods destined for the Colon Free Trade Zone here.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a conspicuous burst of Asian investment
here. Taiwanese and Korean consortiums are building separate
industrial parks, and a pair of Chinese shipping tycoons with
competing political loyalties are now solidly installed in the
ports that command both approaches to the canal: Chang Yung-Fa, a
Taiwan loyalist, and his Evergreen Maritime Corp. in Colon at the
Caribbean entrance; and Li Ka-shing, of Hong Kong's Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd., who is cozy with Beijing, in Balboa at the Pacific
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panamanians have an easier time relating to U.S. businessmen
than Chinese or Japanese because culturally they feel more at ease
with Americans,'' said Roberto Eisenmann, a prominent business
leader here who advises President Mireya Moscoso. ``But the
governments of Asia have been much more aggressive than the United
States'' in seeking opportunities here.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, only the conservative Republicans who opposed the
Panama Canal Treaties in 1977, and who now fear that the People's
Liberation Army is sneaking in as the Southern Command moves out,
seem interested in Panama these days. Former Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger warned this month that China is seeking ``a
foothold in one of the world's three major chokepoints,'' while the
Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, fears that ``U.S. naval ships
will be at the mercy of Chinese-controlled pilots and could even be
denied passage through the canal.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the turnover counter that such a focus on the
military ignores the fact that the United States is the only
country with a treaty right to intervene should such an unlikely
scenario occur.
</P>
<P>
   More interestingly, perhaps, a narrow emphasis on the military
plays down the underlying mercantile factor; it is, after all, by
expanding its economy that China has the best chance of becoming a
global power in the next few decades rather than by challenging the
United States militarily in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant contest developing here, according
to Ricardo Arias Calderon, a former vice president of Panama, is
``an intense competition between Taiwan and the People's Republic
of China to advance a broad array of interests'' that are
fundamentally political and economic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Chinese have learned the lesson of 19th-century
England, which understood that it had influence in the
Mediterranean to the extent that it commanded the entrance and
exit'' at Gibraltar and Suez, he added. ``China and Taiwan are
already competing in the South China Sea, and now both are seeking
a presence at the exit on the other side of the Pacific.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, power and influence today can be exercised in a more
subtle manner than by establishing colonies or sending in the
fleet, as the British so often did. Neither Chinese state is in a
position _ or even appears to want _ to supplant America's role as
protector of the canal. So their rivalry has centered on the
commercial facilities in and around the canal and on penetrating
Latin American markets.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, too, is bidding for influence and profit here. It has
underwritten a feasibility study for construction of new canal
locks and is offering to finance a new bridge on extraordinarily
generous terms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet neither Panama, which abolished its armed forces following
the U.S. invasion to overthrow Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega 10 years
ago, nor the Asians can guarantee the security of the canal. That
has historically been a U.S. responsibility _ just as it is America
that guarantees that the sea lanes remain open in Asia. But
defending the canal is a role that has changed enormously in the
last century, if only because the nature of war has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanians say there is virtually no possibility of building a
foolproof military shield these days, a point U.S. military
planners concede privately.
</P>
<P>
   Flying over the canal in a helicopter with Nicolas Ardito
Barletta, the director of the Inter-Oceanic Regional Authority, the
Panamanian government agency that oversees the former Panama Canal
Zone, and looking down on the network of dams and locks that hold
back the man-made Gatun and Madden Lakes, the waterway's
vulnerability in the missile age is evident. If they were to be
blown up, ``the canal would be shut down for two years,'' Barletta
acknowledged. That is why, he added, ``the best guarantee for the
canal is its neutrality.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It was just six months ago that veteran Russia watchers
were predicting the disintegration of Russia's central authority,
pulled apart by centrifugal forces that were moving power away from
the Kremlin _ to the country's wayward regions and to an
increasingly emboldened parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are not quite so sure. At the close of Sunday's
parliamentary elections, which are widely seen as a test run for
the presidential race next June, the political picture looks quite
different.
</P>
<P>
   To loud applause at home, Russia has gone to war in Chechnya to
regain control of its unruly southern border. The Kremlin has
fractured and humiliated its once cocky opposition, all the while
promoting the presidential chances of its preferred heir, Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   And the considerable powers of Russia's superpresidency are
intact and waiting for the Kremlin's next occupant. Which, it turns
out, is what a majority of the Russian people have wanted all
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition overestimated the public consensus in favor of
redistributing the powers of the presidency,'' said Sergei Markov,
director of the Moscow-based Institute of Politics. ``Most people
don't want to shift more power to the parliament. They want a
stable government, and that means one subordinate to the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the Regional and Political Research Agency
found that 44 percent of the respondents said Russia would always
need a ``strong hand.'' Another 22 percent thought it needed a
strong hand in these troubled times. Only 17 percent thought that
putting power into one set of hands was a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   In this atmosphere, few observers now expect to see the
anti-Yeltsin opposition try to limit the power of the presidency,
by pressing ahead soon with changes to the 1993 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, some experts now predict that Russia's regional
governors, who have been enjoying the role of kingmakers in this
election year, may find that their days of near-autonomy are now
numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Markov, for one, predicts a move to curtail their regional
powers and to end the special treatment that some ``national''
regions have enjoyed. ``I think this time will come, but not until
after the presidential elections,'' he said. ``Before the
elections, no candidate will be brave enough to challenge the
regional authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The almost-feudal power of some governors over their regions has
been evident in these elections, as national politicians have
shamelessly vied for their support in hopes of receiving large
chunks of their local electorate.
</P>
<P>
   But Nikolai Petrov, a political expert at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, said: ``It seems to me that what we see
now is the last blossoming of the regional leaders' separatism. It
is their last role in this play.''
</P>
<P>
   Power in Russia is still a winner-take-all proposition. Nine
years of democracy have changed the rules of the game, but not its
essence, and Sunday's elections are a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   The contest is not, as it was four years ago, between Yeltsin
and his Communist opposition. It is between two different clans
from the same ruling elite _ much like the old struggles between
feuding members of the Communist Party Central Committee. Except
that this fight is fought openly through the ballot box, and not,
as Kremlinologists used to say, under a rug.
</P>
<P>
   A turning point in the fight came last summer, when a
center-left coalition headed by former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov joined the Communists in challenging the Yeltsin
administration. At the time, Yeltsin's authority was weakening,
undermined by his poor health, by scandals and by his unpredictable
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his presidency, Yeltsin's use of his considerable
authority has been erratic. ``There hasn't been decentralization
and federalism, there has been a weakening of authoritarian
institutions,'' said Petrov. ``But the authoritarian institutions
remained in place; they just haven't been utilized.'' Until, he
added, this latest election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Challenged by Primakov's coalition, the Kremlin and its
political operatives have waged a bitter and ugly political war,
replete with media tactics that smacked of old-style Soviet
propaganda, electoral technicalities and a mustering of loyalists
for a crash counteroffensive.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics even charge that the Kremlin team, in its greed to
hold onto power after Yeltsin leaves office, launched the real war
in Chechnya, which is largely responsible for propelling Putin to
the top of the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is not a candidate in the parliamentary elections, but his
spectacular rise in the polls has boosted the chances of a
brand-new pro-Kremlin alliance, known as Unity and nicknamed Bear,
which was created specially to take votes away from its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Kremlin's strategy was its understanding of the
mentality of a Russian political elite that is always on the
outlook for the next winning bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   When Primakov was riding high last summer, local officials and
powerful businessmen eagerly jumped on his team, hoping to pick up
jobs, favors, contracts and other perks. Now that it looks as
though Putin, not Primakov, will be the next president, some of
those hangers-on are having second thoughts. ``They joined not to
be in the opposition but to be in the party of power,'' Markov
said.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ It was just six months ago that veteran Russia watchers
were predicting the disintegration of Russia's central authority,
pulled apart by centrifugal forces that were moving power away from
the Kremlin _ to the country's wayward regions and to an
increasingly emboldened parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are not quite so sure. At the close of Sunday's
parliamentary elections, which are widely seen as a test run for
the presidential race next June, the political picture looks quite
different.
</P>
<P>
   To loud applause at home, Russia has gone to war in Chechnya to
regain control of its unruly southern border. The Kremlin has
fractured and humiliated its once cocky opposition, all the while
promoting the presidential chances of its preferred heir, Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   And the considerable powers of Russia's superpresidency are
intact and waiting for the Kremlin's next occupant. Which, it turns
out, is what a majority of the Russian people have wanted all
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposition overestimated the public consensus in favor of
redistributing the powers of the presidency,'' said Sergei Markov,
director of the Moscow-based Institute of Politics. ``Most people
don't want to shift more power to the parliament. They want a
stable government, and that means one subordinate to the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the Regional and Political Research Agency
found that 44 percent of the respondents said Russia would always
need a ``strong hand.'' Another 22 percent thought it needed a
strong hand in these troubled times. Only 17 percent thought that
putting power into one set of hands was a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   In this atmosphere, few observers now expect to see the
anti-Yeltsin opposition try to limit the power of the presidency,
by pressing ahead soon with changes to the 1993 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, some experts now predict that Russia's regional
governors, who have been enjoying the role of kingmakers in this
election year, may find that their days of near-autonomy are now
numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Markov, for one, predicts a move to curtail their regional
powers and to end the special treatment that some ``national''
regions have enjoyed. ``I think this time will come, but not until
after the presidential elections,'' he said. ``Before the
elections, no candidate will be brave enough to challenge the
regional authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The almost-feudal power of some governors over their regions has
been evident in these elections, as national politicians have
shamelessly vied for their support in hopes of receiving large
chunks of their local electorate.
</P>
<P>
   But Nikolai Petrov, a political expert at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, said: ``It seems to me that what we see
now is the last blossoming of the regional leaders' separatism. It
is their last role in this play.''
</P>
<P>
   Power in Russia is still a winner-take-all proposition. Nine
years of democracy have changed the rules of the game, but not its
essence, and Sunday's elections are a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   The contest is not, as it was four years ago, between Yeltsin
and his Communist opposition. It is between two different clans
from the same ruling elite _ much like the old struggles between
feuding members of the Communist Party Central Committee. Except
that this fight is fought openly through the ballot box, and not,
as Kremlinologists used to say, under a rug.
</P>
<P>
   A turning point in the fight came last summer, when a
center-left coalition headed by former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov joined the Communists in challenging the Yeltsin
administration. At the time, Yeltsin's authority was weakening,
undermined by his poor health, by scandals and by his unpredictable
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his presidency, Yeltsin's use of his considerable
authority has been erratic. ``There hasn't been decentralization
and federalism, there has been a weakening of authoritarian
institutions,'' said Petrov. ``But the authoritarian institutions
remained in place; they just haven't been utilized.'' Until, he
added, this latest election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Challenged by Primakov's coalition, the Kremlin and its
political operatives have waged a bitter and ugly political war,
replete with media tactics that smacked of old-style Soviet
propaganda, electoral technicalities and a mustering of loyalists
for a crash counteroffensive.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics even charge that the Kremlin team, in its greed to
hold onto power after Yeltsin leaves office, launched the real war
in Chechnya, which is largely responsible for propelling Putin to
the top of the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is not a candidate in the parliamentary elections, but his
spectacular rise in the polls has boosted the chances of a
brand-new pro-Kremlin alliance, known as Unity and nicknamed Bear,
which was created specially to take votes away from its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Kremlin's strategy was its understanding of the
mentality of a Russian political elite that is always on the
outlook for the next winning bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   When Primakov was riding high last summer, local officials and
powerful businessmen eagerly jumped on his team, hoping to pick up
jobs, favors, contracts and other perks. Now that it looks as
though Putin, not Primakov, will be the next president, some of
those hangers-on are having second thoughts. ``They joined not to
be in the opposition but to be in the party of power,'' Markov
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to some experts, the rise of Putin, and the Kremlin's
success in weakening Primakov's team, will once again leave the
Duma toothless and divided _ a parliament slavishly attuned to
Putin's popularity ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McFaul, a Russia scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, evoked the retreat from the French Revolution
recently at a seminar held in Moscow: ``Thermidor is ending,
Napoleon has arrived.''

   ``Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each
invoked His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men
should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread
from the sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we
be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of
neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own
purposes.'' _ Abraham Lincoln
</P>
<P>
   Religious language has always played a role in American
political life, on rare occasion achieving a profound resonance, as
it did in Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address, in which he expressed
his awe at an ultimately mysterious God in the passage above, and
called on the nation to bind up its wounds after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians who speak publicly about religious belief,
lacking Lincoln's eloquence, usually talk in general terms,
referring to the value of faith and asking God to bless America,
yet leaving ample space for their audiences to fill in the
specifics according to their individual beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The political statements made in recent days fly in the face of
that tradition. They are all the more remarkable because of their
venue: Four presidential candidates chose national television to
declare their belief in Jesus Christ. For many viewers, the
declarations were unexpectedly personal, and for some they were
disturbing because they seemed to cross a boundary that
distinguishes a general affirmation of faith from specific and
intimate belief. The risk is that for every voter gained, another
is lost. Although the candidates all come from within the broad
tent of Christianity, America is more pluralistic than ever, with
growing religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
   First, it was Vice President Al Gore, the leading Democratic
contender, who described himself as a born-again Christian in a
``60 Minutes'' interview on Dec. 5. He spoke openly about his
beliefs, Gore said, because he wanted ``to be forthright and
candid'' about who he is.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Monday at the Republican debate in Iowa, Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, the Republican front-runner, said he, too, shared an
evangelical Protestant experience of personal conversion. Asked
whom he regarded as his favorite philosopher, Bush said, ``Christ,
because he changed my heart.'' Fellow Republicans Gary L. Bauer and
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah followed with statements about their
devotion to Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter, a devout Southern Baptist who taught Sunday school
during his White House years, delivered an inaugural address that
the religious historian Martin E. Marty said was probably ``the
least religious'' by a recent president. ``In the public realm, he
was very careful,'' Marty said of Carter. So, too, was Ronald
Reagan, Marty added, despite his political courtship of religious
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In their caution, those presidents had plenty of precedents.
Dwight D. Eisenhower, for example, once described himself as ``the
most intensely religious man'' he knew, but he reached toward the
universal when speaking about God and faith.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War may be partly to blame. The fall of the
Soviet state removed the external threat of Communism and its
atheistic doctrine. Randall Balmer, a professor of religion at
Barnard College, said that during the darkest days of the Cold War,
declarations like Gore's and Bush's would have been unheard of
because the spirit of the era emphasized ``a united front against
the perils of Communism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we're seeing is a return toward particularity,''
Balmer said. ``Then that begs the question as to how that works in
the political arena.'' The candidates, he said, may be taking ``a
calculated risk that Americans are looking for people with
definition and conviction, even if that conviction differs from a
particular voter, or blocs of voters.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the trend, it follows the rise in political and
cultural influence of evangelical Protestants, which began with
Carter's election in 1976 and has been marked by groups like the
Christian Coalition, the success of Christian pop musicians and the
emergence of ``mega-churches'' with huge congregations. ``There's a
whole lot more self-confidence now,'' said Balmer, whose new book,
``Blessed Assurance'' (Beacon), is about evangelicals.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Cherry, director of the Center for the Study of American
Religion and Culture at Indiana University-Purdue University,
agreed. ``My guess is that this is an illustration of the impact of
evangelical Christianity on the culture as a whole,'' he said. ``I
can only assume that these politicians are tuned into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherry said he doubted that the candidates' statements would be
universally well received in his state. Central Indiana, like other
regions in the country, has a growing Muslim population and its
Jewish presence is well established. He wondered ``how attuned''
the candidates were to that kind of religious pluralism.
</P>
<P>
   That question also concerns Abraham Foxman, national director of
the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, who said he felt a
sense of ``alienation'' after hearing some of the candidates in the
Iowa debate, even though, he said, as a ``believing, traditional
Jew,'' religion is important to him. The statements crossed a
``certain line'' in civic life, he said, but probably reflected the
candidates' attempts to connect with a public looking for answers
amid a sense that a ``crisis of values'' exists in the country,
especially after the school shooting last April in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess somebody's telling them that it's OK,'' Foxman said.
``It's as if somebody's made a decision to ignore the Jews, the
Muslims, the Hindus, the Buddhists, and here we are a country
that's moving more and more into'' a religiously diverse direction.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if two conflicting trends are occurring at once, Marty
said. ``We're more pluralistic and more particular at the same
time,'' he said. ``Figure out that paradox.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this month my 3-year-old daughter's body double arrived
in a UPS box, resplendent in a midnight-blue velour dress,
patent-leather shoes and dark coffee-bean eyes selected from a
range of 26 colors.
</P>
<P>
   At $150, it was the most money I had ever spent on a doll, so I
opened the cardboard box labeled ``My Twinn'' with some
apprehension. Inside rested my daughter's toy mate _ a 23-inch
figure swathed like a mummy in pink tissue, secured at the neck
with a rose ribbon tied in a bow.
</P>
<P>
   This was the ``one-of-a-kind personalized to look like your
child'' doll that I ordered for Christmas, but the customized
replica, with her unblinking eyes, gave me an eerie jolt.
Instinctively, I loosened the bow to let her breathe and hid her in
a closet.
</P>
<P>
   The My Twinn doll, personalized from a menu of skin tones, eye
shades and matching moles, has been around for about six years. It
was created by John Kudirka, a California emergency physician who
believed that replica dolls could build a child's confidence and
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he sold his business to the Flagship Group, a privately
held Colorado mail-order company that also runs a doll hospital
where exacting owners can return My Twinns for plastic surgery to
fix misplaced freckles or restyle bad haircuts.
</P>
<P>
   News articles have raised concerns that the dolls may be
inspiring narcissism, creating a plastic race of Stepford dolls
and, worst of all, stifling the imagination of children by giving
them clones for imaginary friends.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cringe factor _ or perhaps because of it _ the dolls
continue to flourish as media creatures. In November, the dolls
appeared on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' in a segment called
``Oprah's favorite things'' that is scheduled to be rebroadcast on
Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   My Twinn dolls have actually appeared at least 200 times on
television and hundreds of times in newspaper articles, said David
Liggett, a company spokesman. ``Every year our business
increases,'' he said. ``One reason is the publicity, obviously.
Another reason is because a lot more people have our dolls, and
their friends and neighbors are finding out about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Liggett said he was unfazed by the cringe factor. ``It's obvious
in a market like this that if you think the doll is narcissistic,
you're not going to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   People are clearly buying _ and sending in unsolicited letters
with photographs and effusive tributes. The testimonials come from
customers ranging from a 76-year-old Indiana grandmother, Opal
Patterson, who has created a tea party tableau of three dolls
matched to resemble her daughter and grandchildren at the age of 4,
to Jenny Vekich, a 31-year-old homemaker in Middleport, N.Y., who
bought a doll to mirror the look and periwinkle cotton dress of her
5-year-old daughter, Ryanne, on her first day of kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks so real that sometimes there are split seconds that I
walk into the living room and feel a slash of terror because I
think someone is in the house,'' said Mrs. Vekich. ``I've done it
four or five times and then I think _ `It's the doll.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way I look at the doll as a gift to myself,'' she added.
``Ryanne is my oldest. I had my children close together and life
was such a whirlwind. And by the time I started slowing down, she's
going to school. So losing her was more traumatic for me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If dolls and toys reflect contemporary society, what do
personalized mates say about their times?
</P>
<P>
   In the history of play, toys are used as a ``socializing process
and a way to recreate the world and have control,'' said Eugene
Provenzo Jr., an education professor at the University of Miami who
studies toys and culture. ``Toys are also a way to practice life.
For example, in the colonial period dolls were used in mock
funerals with doll caskets'' because the mortality rate of children
was so high. ``In a certain sense,'' he said, ``children were
rehearsing to attend the funerals of their own friends.''
</P>
<P>
   My Twinn dolls are a reflection of today's sophisticated
technology, said Provenzo, but at the same time they may say more
about cultural values that emphasize the self, including an
``excessive interest in sculpting the body or working out or being
fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Provenzo said, it is better for a child to play with a
My Twinn doll than with one designed to talk or walk. He cited a
new doll that is programmed to repeat hundreds of expressions.
``What toy makers are doing there is controlling the play space,
and it's probably better for children to play with a simple doll.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are certain questions when children play with
their replicas. To start with, what do you call your new friend?
(In the Vekich home, the parents used their daughter's middle name,
Naomi.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there is a broader question: Who gets to keep the doll when
the children grow up and leave home? When asked about this, Mrs.
Vekich responded with a long pause and an unfinished sentence
indicating that she didn't know: ``I think when she leaves home
...''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this month my 3-year-old daughter's body double arrived
in a UPS box, resplendent in a midnight-blue velour dress,
patent-leather shoes and dark coffee-bean eyes selected from a
range of 26 colors.
</P>
<P>
   At $150, it was the most money I had ever spent on a doll, so I
opened the cardboard box labeled ``My Twinn'' with some
apprehension. Inside rested my daughter's toy mate _ a 23-inch
figure swathed like a mummy in pink tissue, secured at the neck
with a rose ribbon tied in a bow.
</P>
<P>
   This was the ``one-of-a-kind personalized to look like your
child'' doll that I ordered for Christmas, but the customized
replica, with her unblinking eyes, gave me an eerie jolt.
Instinctively, I loosened the bow to let her breathe and hid her in
a closet.
</P>
<P>
   The My Twinn doll, personalized from a menu of skin tones, eye
shades and matching moles, has been around for about six years. It
was created by John Kudirka, a California emergency physician who
believed that replica dolls could build a child's confidence and
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he sold his business to the Flagship Group, a privately
held Colorado mail-order company that also runs a doll hospital
where exacting owners can return My Twinns for plastic surgery to
fix misplaced freckles or restyle bad haircuts.
</P>
<P>
   News articles have raised concerns that the dolls may be
inspiring narcissism, creating a plastic race of Stepford dolls
and, worst of all, stifling the imagination of children by giving
them clones for imaginary friends.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cringe factor _ or perhaps because of it _ the dolls
continue to flourish as media creatures. In November, the dolls
appeared on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' in a segment called
``Oprah's favorite things'' that is scheduled to be rebroadcast on
Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   My Twinn dolls have actually appeared at least 200 times on
television and hundreds of times in newspaper articles, said David
Liggett, a company spokesman. ``Every year our business
increases,'' he said. ``One reason is the publicity, obviously.
Another reason is because a lot more people have our dolls, and
their friends and neighbors are finding out about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Liggett said he was unfazed by the cringe factor. ``It's obvious
in a market like this that if you think the doll is narcissistic,
you're not going to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   People are clearly buying _ and sending in unsolicited letters
with photographs and effusive tributes. The testimonials come from
customers ranging from a 76-year-old Indiana grandmother, Opal
Patterson, who has created a tea party tableau of three dolls
matched to resemble her daughter and grandchildren at the age of 4,
to Jenny Vekich, a 31-year-old homemaker in Middleport, N.Y., who
bought a doll to mirror the look and periwinkle cotton dress of her
5-year-old daughter, Ryanne, on her first day of kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks so real that sometimes there are split seconds that I
walk into the living room and feel a slash of terror because I
think someone is in the house,'' said Mrs. Vekich. ``I've done it
four or five times and then I think _ `It's the doll.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way I look at the doll as a gift to myself,'' she added.
``Ryanne is my oldest. I had my children close together and life
was such a whirlwind. And by the time I started slowing down, she's
going to school. So losing her was more traumatic for me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If dolls and toys reflect contemporary society, what do
personalized mates say about their times?
</P>
<P>
   In the history of play, toys are used as a ``socializing process
and a way to recreate the world and have control,'' said Eugene
Provenzo Jr., an education professor at the University of Miami who
studies toys and culture. ``Toys are also a way to practice life.
For example, in the colonial period dolls were used in mock
funerals with doll caskets'' because the mortality rate of children
was so high. ``In a certain sense,'' he said, ``children were
rehearsing to attend the funerals of their own friends.''
</P>
<P>
   My Twinn dolls are a reflection of today's sophisticated
technology, said Provenzo, but at the same time they may say more
about cultural values that emphasize the self, including an
``excessive interest in sculpting the body or working out or being
fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Provenzo said, it is better for a child to play with a
My Twinn doll than with one designed to talk or walk. He cited a
new doll that is programmed to repeat hundreds of expressions.
``What toy makers are doing there is controlling the play space,
and it's probably better for children to play with a simple doll.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are certain questions when children play with
their replicas. To start with, what do you call your new friend?
(In the Vekich home, the parents used their daughter's middle name,
Naomi.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there is a broader question: Who gets to keep the doll when
the children grow up and leave home? When asked about this, Mrs.
Vekich responded with a long pause and an unfinished sentence
indicating that she didn't know: ``I think when she leaves home
...''

   Charlie Brown had just given up yet another home run when his
fussbudget right fielder, Lucy Van Pelt, walked in to the pitcher's
mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder why I do this,'' Charlie Brown grumbled. ``I wonder
why I stand out here day after day losing all these ball games. Why
do I do it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably because it makes you happy,'' Lucy said. To which a
perturbed Charlie Brown yelped, ``You always have to be right,
don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years, Charles Schulz tortured Charlie Brown through a
number of devices _ never letting him kick the football, entangling
him in the kite-eating tree, paralyzing him with fear before the
little red-haired girl. Yet none captured Schulz's fondness for
futility more deliciously than those involving baseball. Schulz,
77, who will end his ``Peanuts'' strip Jan. 4 to focus on treatment
for colon cancer, has called baseball his favorite motif of all.
</P>
<P>
   No pitcher yielded more homers and no manager squandered more
games than Charlie Brown, the game's most lovable loser. Line
drives disrobed him. Fastballs baffled him. He didn't need a tape
measure for his team's home runs because ``Our hits can be measured
quite adequately with an 18-inch ruler.''
</P>
<P>
   While New York Yankee fans complain about the error-prone Chuck
Knoblauch, imagine Charlie Brown's double-play combo: a beagle
catching balls in his mouth and spitting them _ ptui! _ to his
security-blanketed second baseman. His catcher knew more about
Beethoven than baseball. The team routinely got pounded 40-0,
123-0, even 200-0. But Charlie Brown always came back for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could draw baseball strips every day,'' Schulz said in a
1995 interview. ``It really is funny. Baseball is ideal because
little kids do play it at that age, and they aren't very good. But
they do suffer at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Brown got so tired of his team's losing that one day he
ran a classified ad, searching for a new managerial job. He
received one reply _ from his own team.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Brown's favorite player, Joe Shlabotnik, once got
demoted to Stumptown of the Green Grass League after hitting .004.
(Shlabotnik was later fired as a manager because he called for a
steal of home with the bases empty.)
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Brown got so consumed with his baseball failures that
the sun, and soon his own head, turned into a baseball. He asked
his psychiatrist, ``Is this the last of the ninth?''
</P>
<P>
   In one of Schulz's more sadistic moments 30 years ago, he had
Charlie Brown's love for baseball betray him at what could have
been his finest moment. In his class spelling bee, he was asked to
spell ``maze.''
</P>
<P>
   ``M-A-Y-S.''
</P>
<P>
   AAAAUUUGGHHH!
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny because it isn't happening to us,'' Schulz
explained.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that this is a nation of failed baseball
players, and Schulz is no exception. His own persona as the hapless
underdog was cast when he was growing up in St. Paul, Minn., as a
good-field, no-hit catcher and third baseman. His team actually did
lose a game 40-0. Later, as a sergeant stationed in Germany during
World War II, Schulz got one of the thrills of his life simply by
playing a pickup game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so flattered that these guys should like some unknown
guy from Minnesota to be on their team,'' Schulz recalled. ``Isn't
that funny? Something as totally meaningless as that, really, in
the history of mankind and baseball, a game played in an unknown
area that didn't mean a thing, and yet it meant so much to me.
That's what sport does for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The first cartoon Schulz sold after the war displayed a little
boy and girl with the caption, ``Judy, if your batting average was
just a little higher I could really fall in love with you.''
</P>
<P>
   He began ``Peanuts'' in October 1950 and infused Charlie Brown
with his own struggles. Even as his strip became the world's most
popular, there was never a shortage of new material. This is a man
who, after being told by a fan how much she loved the strip, was
asked to draw Popeye. And even last Tuesday, after he announced his
retirement, the headline in The Portland (Maine) Press Herald read,
``George Schulz ....'' Good grief!
</P>
<P>
   Schulz made Charlie Brown fail at every turn because most
readers could relate better to losing than to winning. ``Victories
are fleeting,'' he said, ``but losses we always live with.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schulz did get a little sentimental over the years, though _ in
part because of age, which he claimed he first felt when he
couldn't bend over to field a ground ball. In 1993, he finally let
Charlie Brown hit a game-winning home run. It turned out that the
pitcher threw one down the middle only because she felt sorry for
him.
</P>
<P>
   As America's ``We're No. 1!'' culture evolved around him, Schulz
provided a clubhouse, a 5-cent psychiatry booth, for all the No.
2s. Baseball, say the pros who actually can hit the ball three
times out of 10, is a game of failure. But Charlie Brown knew
failure more than anyone _ pure,
slink-back-home-with-your-bat-dragging failure _ and exuded it to
his fans' delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how many Charlie Browns there were in the
world,'' Schulz said. ``I thought I was the only one.''

   IOWA: INVISIBLE MAN CASTS A LONG SHADOW
</P>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ For months, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has
been insisting that he will not participate in Iowa's
first-in-the-nation caucuses next month. He says he has only
limited resources for his presidential quest and that in the early
going he will concentrate on New Hampshire, South Carolina and
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   He has no organization in Iowa, has run no ads and has been in
the state only twice this year, once in April to hold a
congressional hearing on air fares (hardly a campaign appearance)
and again last Monday to participate in a debate with the other
Republican contenders (it was televised nationally, not just in
Iowa).
</P>
<P>
   So, as he says, he is not running in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   And yet he is here.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his physical absence from the state, he was running a
strong third in one recent Iowa poll, closing fast on Steve Forbes,
who is spending a fortune, literally, to hang on to the No. 2 spot
as he chases the front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Further, reports of McCain's campaigning in other states show up
daily in Iowa newspapers and on Iowa television, and McCain bumper
stickers and placards can be spotted here and there. Periodically,
too, there have been reports that calls have been made around the
state on his behalf, though there is no evidence that he sanctioned
them.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was that closing remark in Monday's debate after
McCain had pinned a boondoggle label on the federal energy program
that subsidizes production of ethanol, a fuel additive made from
corn, a lot of it Iowa corn.
</P>
<P>
   In what was almost an aside, but not quite, he called for a
``hardy band of brave souls'' to turn out and vote for him on
caucus night, Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here?
</P>
<P>
   A delicate political dance, as many Iowa political pros see it.
</P>
<P>
   The way they analyze the senator's acts and words, he is trying
to set up a win-win situation in which he keeps his profile as high
as possible in Iowa, but at the same time does not become so
involved in the state that he raises undue expectations about how
he will fare on caucus night.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Dennis Goldford, a political scientist at Drake
University, put it the other day, if McCain should finish in the
top three in the caucuses without genuinely competing, he would be
entitled to ``some bragging rights'' on the eve of the next crucial
nominating test, the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   But why the head-on McCain attack on ethanol in the nation's
leading corn-producing state?
</P>
<P>
   ``Two plausible reasons,'' says David Yepsen of The Des Moines
Register, the dean of the state's political reporters. ``One,
agriculture accounts for just 20 percent of the new,
much-diversified Iowa economy. Two, the Iowa vote is now more
diverse too, and a maverick reformer like McCain could have a
certain appeal here, as elsewhere around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing more:
</P>
<P>
   He'll be back shortly for another debate.
</P>
<P>
   IOWA, LOUISIANA: THE BATTLE OF THE FIRST CAUCUS ENDS
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Iowa caucuses ...
</P>
<P>
   Election officials here need no longer worry that Louisiana
Republicans will try to slip in and hold their caucuses first, on
Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The governing central committee of the Louisiana Republican
Party has decided to scrap that plan and instead hold a primary on
March 14. But the change didn't come without a bitter fight.
</P>
<P>
   The push for caucuses was led by leaders of the state's
Christian right, along with the party chairman, Mike Francis. They
figured that while the party's moderate wing, led by Gov. Mike
Foster, was probably more powerful, the Christian right wing was
better organized and more committed and thus could dominate the
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end the Foster forces out-organized the Christian
right forces and last weekend the party's central committee voted
down the caucus proposal, 92-77.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, a Bush ally, declared after the vote that
``reasonable people made a reasonable decision, and I'm proud of
the Republican Party.'' He had been warning for weeks that the
caucuses would turn into an embarrassing political disaster because
most candidates would shy away from campaigning in Louisiana lest
they anger Iowa voters. And, in fact, only Gary Bauer, the family
values advocate, Alan Keyes, the conservative radio commentator,
and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah agreed to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Francis charged after the proposal was defeated that caucus
supporters, many of them strong backers of outspoken anti-abortion
candidates, such as Forbes and Bauer, had been ``intimidated and
threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when Louisiana first tried to steal Iowa's
first-in-the-nation thunder, the caucuses were a political bust.
Most of the top candidates stayed away.

   MICHIGAN: SANTA TAKES SIDE IN SENATE RACE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michigan is one of those states in which neither Democrats nor
Republicans consistently stay on the top of the political heap. So
it should come as no great surprise that next year's race for U.S.
Senate is tight.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the race, in which Rep. Debbie Stabenow, a
moderate-to-liberal Democrat from Lansing, is trying to unseat the
conservative Republican incumbent, Spencer Abraham, is shaping up
as one of the most competitive congressional contests. And also one
of the most expensive.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll indicates that the race is a statistical tie.
</P>
<P>
   As for campaign spending, Abraham, who is seeking a second term,
is talking about spending upwards of $9 million and Ms. Stabenow,
first elected to the House in 1996, says she is confident she can
raise close to that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham is considered a vulnerable target by Democrats as they
seek to reclaim control of the Senate not only because he is a
freshman legislator in a state that tends to be a swing state but
also because, according to pollsters, voters view him as a rather
subdued politician who in five years in office has failed to
establish a strong bond with them. He has pushed a conservative
agenda, including popular tax cuts, but many voters say they know
little about him.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stabenow is a much more outgoing politician. But Abraham
says that however outgoing she may be, she nevertheless is too
liberal for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Recently he began running ads that accuse her of ducking tough
law-and-order issues, specifically for failing to condemn President
Clinton for granting clemency to Puerto Rican nationalists serving
time for terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   But last week the tables were turned and Abraham is now the
target of some ads as the race builds an ever bigger head of steam.
</P>
<P>
   In one that began running on Monday, sponsored by the Michigan
Democratic Party, a Christmas elf and Santa Claus decide that the
senator has been ``very, very naughty'' this year because of some
of his votes on health care.
</P>
<P>
   As Santa and the elf tell it, Abraham voted to protect health
maintenance organizations that make serious medical mistakes,
failed to push for cuts in drug prices and got ``lots of presents''
from insurance companies in return for helping them ``put profits
ahead of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa: Meanwhile, he's been giving Michigan families a big lump
of coal.
</P>
<P>
   Elf: So no toys for Senator Abraham?
</P>
<P>
   Santa: Not unless he starts voting better. His votes on health
care are making everyone have a blue Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Elf: Paid for by the Michigan Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS: HATCH DOES BETTER WITH DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch was the last candidate to jump into the
Republican presidential contest. And in many polls he continues to
run exactly where he started _ last, sometimes pulling so little
support that pollsters put a zero next to his name.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case when the Boston Globe last sampled Republicans
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But take heart, senator.
</P>
<P>
   When the Globe asked Democrats whom they would go for should
they decide to vote Republican, 1 percent chose Hatch.

   During the six months when her 66-year-old father was dying from
cancer, Carolyn Aldige relied completely on doctors at Eastern
Virginia Medical Center for information. But, she says, none of
them ever mentioned the possibility that he might take part in a
clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know what the words clinical trial meant,'' said
Ms. Aldige, who after that experience in the 1980s went on to found
the Cancer Research Foundation of America. ``I was just clueless.''
</P>
<P>
   Few doctors ever tell cancer patients about the option of
clinical trials _ research involving human subjects that remains
the only scientifically valid method of finding safe and effective
new treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, participation in such trials seems impossible,
especially since the costs for tests and hospital stays can be
prohibitive. And historically, insurance companies have refused to
pay, saying that experimental treatments are not covered by their
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Now that is changing.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks a wide array of insurance companies have agreed
to pay for experimental cancer treatments administered to
policy-holders who participate in clinical trials sanctioned by
federal health agencies. It is a development that experts described
as momentous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important step,'' said Dr. Henry Simmons,
president of the National Coalition on Health Care. ``Finally we've
recognized that you need a source of sufficient funding for
experimental therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost two decades, cancer researchers in this country have
been fighting over inadequate federal payments for clinical trials.
As a result, they have often relied on money from drug companies,
which would only pay for experimental medications while often
leaving patients stuck with the related hospital and lab costs. But
the recent moves by the insurers now bring to the table a
potentially large source of cash and test subjects _ coming from a
third party with no vested interest in which treatment is best.
</P>
<P>
   This should improve what had been a situation in which just 3
percent to 5 percent of adult cancer patients enrolled in clinical
trials _ a dire circumstance that has actually impeded the search
for cures. Worse, doctors often independently sell experimental
procedures, siphoning off potential trial subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Programs intended to solve these problems are now catching on
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gov. Christie Whitman announced on Thursday that
a coalition of insurers had agreed to pay for cancer patients to
receive experimental treatments in federally sanctioned clinical
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Even as that program was being developed, Coventry Health Care,
a managed care company with 1.4 million members in the Midwest,
South and mid-Atlantic regions, began a pilot program that also
pays for patients who enroll in valid studies testing new cancer
treatments. Earlier in the year, a similar program was begun by
United Healthcare, which covers 13 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the New Jersey initiative is the most significant.
There, for the first time, the insurers will work hand in hand with
state government, doctors and patient groups to spread the word
that patients can now participate in medical research at little to
no personal cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most important program in the nation
right now,'' said Dr. Robert Comis, the president of the National
Coalition of Cancer Cooperative Groups, the association of research
centers that conducts federally sanctioned trials. ``It's really
the first time that all the needed and required forces have come
together to address the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, relations between groups involved in experimental
procedures have been nothing short of adversarial.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors would offer the treatments outside of clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies would refuse to pay, citing decades-old
precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Patients were caught in the middle, angry at their insurance
companies and unable to pay their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with desperate patients, courts and state legislatures
began to require the insurers to pay for experimental therapies,
regardless of whether they were being offered as part of a
sanctioned research study with the potential to advance medical
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Only in pediatric cancer research did doctors, insurers and
patient advocacy groups work together to make sure that children
could enroll in clinical trials. As a result, most of these
children do participate in research studies so that doctors can
quickly determine whether treatments work or not. That has
contributed to a significant decline in death rates for children
with cancer in the last few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the New Jersey initiative, medical experts believe
that a system is being put in place that could potentially bring
the successes seen in pediatric cancer to the adult world.
</P>
<P>
   The program could face some challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Not every patient will qualify to participate in research
programs, which could spur renewed trips to the courthouse. Only
this time, the insurance companies _ with support from doctors and
patient groups _ will be able to argue that their new policies
serve a broad societal interest, one that could allow promising
therapies to be tested quickly and made widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, insurance industry executives said, the financial
consequences to the companies are negligible. Since the industry
has been forced to pay for experimental procedures offered outside
of trials, the costs of that coverage has already been incorporated
in their rate structure. That is one reason insurers expect to
offer this new benefit at no additional premium.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey initiative is already attracting national
attention. Insurers believe that if the effort there proves
successful it will only be a matter of time before similar programs
become a common feature of the American health care landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other states are starting to call already,'' said Comis, who
is working with the New Jersey group. ``New Jersey will lead the
country.''

 &HT;    Army brass blames leadership for air crashes
 &HT;    By Russell Carollo
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The U.S. Army's latest annual aviation accident
rate is the highest, excluding Desert Storm, in 17 years, and the
Army's top safety official says mistakes are being made at almost
every level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldiers are dying and we are destroying costly equipment at a
rate that is unacceptable,'' Brig. Gen. Gene M. LaCoste wrote in a
cover story in the Army's December 1999 issue of its aviation
safety magazine, Flightfax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the accidents didn't happen at the time of impact or
during the crash sequence; they really occurred much earlier with a
breakdown in leadership, standards, or discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   LaCoste, director of the Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker,
Ala., said that fiscal year 1999, which ended Sept. 30, ``produced
Army aviation's worst safety performance since Desert Shield/Desert
Storm.'' Excluding Desert Storm, it was the worst since 1982, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army reported a major aviation accident an average of once
every 20 days during fiscal year 1999, which ended Sept. 30. Twenty
people were killed, 10 aircraft were destroyed and damages exceeded
$139 million.
</P>
<P>
   The fatalities, the accident rate and the amount of damages all
showed increases. The Army reported 103 aviation accidents of Class
C and above in fiscal 1999, and its overall accident rate for Class
A, B and C accidents was 11.28 per 100,000 flight hours. A Class C
accident involves at least $10,000 in damage or an injury causing a
specified amount of lost work time.
</P>
<P>
   Army records show that from Oct. 1 to Dec. 16 of fiscal year
2000, the rate for A, B, and C accidents was 11.19 _ more than 66
percent higher than the rate during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   So far this fiscal year, the Army has had three Class A
accidents, involving a death, permanent total disability, $1
million in damage or loss of an aircraft. That's one more major
accident than during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Army reported 18 Class A accidents in fiscal 1999, giving
the service a serious accident rate of 1.97 per 100,000 flight
hours, up from 1.35 in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force Class A accident rate also increased, from 1.14
accidents per 100,000 flight hours in fiscal year 1998 to 1.40 in
1999 _ the highest rate since 1995. The Navy/Marine Corps rate
dropped to 1.44 from a five-year high of 2.37 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   LaCoste's comments follow a Dayton Daily News six-part series on
military aviation safety, published Oct. 24-29.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper series, the result of an 18-month examination,
found that the military routinely allows helicopters and airplanes
into the air that it knows are plagued with potentially deadly
safety problems _ conditions, in some cases, allowed to persist for
months, years or even decades.
</P>
<P>
   The series reported that the military's already flawed aviation
safety system recently has become further strained by massive
downsizing and budget cuts, the loss of thousands of experienced
pilots and mechanics, global conflicts and an aging fleet of
aircraft. Thousands of the military's most skilled mechanics have
left the services since the end of the Cold War, the series
reported.
</P>
<P>
   LaCoste attributed the Army's rising accident rate to some of
these same problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an Army, we are involved in missions around the world and
doing a lot of things without the experience base we once
enjoyed,'' LaCoste begins his article. ``The lack of experience,
continuous deployments and not having the discipline to maintain
and enforce standards are basic causes of accidental losses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army blamed leadership, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, leaders failed to take corrective action either
before or during the accident,'' Lt. Col. William R. McInnis wrote
in a separate article for the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But LaCoste cautioned to: ``Not allow yourself to say, `We can't
do this mission; It's too dangerous.' Your job is to step up to
that commander and say, `Sir, we can do this mission, but we can do
it more safely by applying these controls.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Army flies high-risk training missions, LaCoste
wrote, most of the 18 major accidents during fiscal year 1999
involved low-risk missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the so-called routine or low-risk missions end up
being the subject of an accident report,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This month, after two major military aviation accidents in less
than 24 hours, U.S. Rep. David Hobson, R-Springfield, and two other
congressmen called for a ``complete review'' of military aviation
safety, including issues raised in the Daily News series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain concerned about the general state of military
aviation,'' said a joint statement from Hobson, U.S. Rep. Frank
Wolf, R-Va., and U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif. ``These most
recent accidents reinforce our belief that the military should use
this time to conduct a complete review of their aviation program.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Nov. 4 letter following publication of the series, Hobson
asked Defense Secretary William S. Cohen to review the newspaper's
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``These articles raise several concerns regarding the state of
military aviation,'' Hobson wrote, adding that he ``would like to
know what the Department (of Defense) or Congress can do to address
these problems.''

Portugal had a world monopoly on trade in silk, gold, porcelain and
silver with Japan and China. Twelve years ago, China and Portugal
had no trouble agreeing that the Portuguese should end their
occupation just before the millennium. Both sides have stuck to
this pact with little friction. And so on the evening of December
19, 2,500 guests from Portugal, Macau and China are due to gather
here just before midnight to toast the end of nearly 450 years of
Portuguese occupation. When the clock in the Macau cathedral
strikes 12 times, Portugal will lower its flag on the last and

TOWN DIVIDED BY PLAN TO REPLACE RAILS WITH TRAILS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSBURG, Mass. _ A two-and-a-half-mile abandoned rail
corridor in this Connecticut Valley hill town of 2,500 residents is
at the center of a heated dispute between champions of privacy and
community.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of a bike path planned for the corridor where the New
Haven &AMP; Northampton Railroad once ran cast the debate as a property
rights issue. Supporters see narrow-minded self-interest blocking a
project that could preserve the environment, promote health and
help people connect.
</P>
<P>
   The battle mirrors others being waged nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 300,000 miles of tracks laid in the United
States starting in the 1830s and peaking around 1920, about 160,000
miles are no longer used, said Craig Della Penna, a New England
representative of the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy. His
organization, based in Washington, envisions a web of
``rail-trails'' using these rights of way to connect communities
and eventually create a coast-to-coast bicycle route.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, recognizing that lost rail corridors would be
difficult to reconstitute if needed again, passed the Rail Banking
Act in 1983, effectively giving local and state governments the
first right to abandoned beds. Since then Congress has appropriated
close to half a billion dollars for trail construction.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 11,000 miles of trails have been built nationwide, and
19,000 more miles are in development, Della Penna said.
</P>
<P>
   But property rights advocates regard this transformation of
abandoned railroads as theft, because the properties were often
originally taken by eminent domain or the railroads were granted
easements.
</P>
<P>
   Nels Ackerson, a Washington, D.C., lawyer whose firm represents
opponents of the Williamsburg project, testified before Congress
two years ago that many beds assumed to be owned by railroads in
fact belonged to individuals along the lines and should revert to
them when the trains stop running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trails proponents see opportunities for recreational uses and
often view my clients as greedy or disgruntled neighbors, rather
than as the owners of the land that is to be taken for the trail,''
Ackerson said.
</P>
<P>
   His firm represents 27 people in Williamsburg who claim title to
pieces of the proposed trail.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Electric Co. purchased the corridor, thinking it
might be useful for power lines after train service ended in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Pill, a local lawyer hired by Ackerson's firm, said
after researching the deeds that the utility purchased property the
railroad did not own. ``They bought the Brooklyn Bridge,'' Pill
said.
</P>
<P>
   Della Penna said it is unusual for opposition to such plans to
be as virulent as it is here.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents were taken aback, for example, when the
anti-trail group, Railtrail Impact Committee for the Hilltowns,
sent a letter this fall to everyone who signed a petition
supporting the project. The letter suggested that recipients might
be held liable for costs associated with the project if they did
not remove their names from the petition.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Hemenway, who was a member of the town's governing board
from 1970 to 1988, said she liked the idea of a bike path when it
was first raised 13 years ago, thinking it would be nice for
children to ride from one part of town to another without having to
use a state highway.
</P>
<P>
   A member of an early bike path committee, the author Tracy
Kidder, recalled the opposition from neighbors of the rail corridor
who feared that a paved trail would bring crime and debauchery into
their back yards. Kidder said one objection was that elderly women
would be subjected to the spectacle of spandex-clad men pedaling
past their windows.
</P>
<P>
   Planning was shelved because of difficulties securing federal
grants, Ms. Hemenway said, but it resumed four years ago after the
success of the nine-mile Norwottuck trail linking the college towns
of Amherst and Northampton, which neighbors Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, opponents of the project contacted the National
Association of Reversionary Property Owners for advice. NARPO, a
clearinghouse for rail-trail opponents around the country, is led
by Dick Welsh, a retired airline pilot who lives in La Quinta,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet domain name of one NARPO chapter
(www.railtrail.org) is similar to that of the Rails-to-Trails
Conservancy (www.railtrails.org). The NARPO chapter's Web site
refers to bike path supporters as ``eco-nuts'' and communists and
contains a link to an article co-written by Welsh that offers
instruction on fighting trail projects.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on Welsh's suggestions, opponents of the Williamsburg
project videotaped meetings of the town's governing board for more
than two years while raising legal and procedural questions about
the project.
</P>
<P>
   The question of ownership is scheduled to go to mediation
between the corridor's neighbors and Massachusetts Electric in
January, but the town voted overwhelmingly in November to go ahead
with the project. Officials have said they want to go ahead, even
if that means using eminent domain to seize the land.
</P>
<P>
   The larger issue the dispute raises, Della Penna said, is
whether Americans want to isolate themselves or rekindle the sense
of community ``we used to have when we had places with sidewalks
and houses with front porches.''
</P>
<P>
   Rail-trails are ``America's new front porch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments do not sway Linda Rowley, who gave up a nursing
job to work full time fighting the bike path, which is right
outside her kitchen window.
</P>
<P>
   ``At what point does their opinion supersede my right to own my
property in peace and quiet?'' Ms. Rowley asked.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ C. Vann Woodward, 91, the greatest living Southern
historian, died Friday at his home in Hamden, Conn., reportedly
suffering complications from a recent heart operation.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward had been retired from the Yale University faculty since
1977. He was a graduate of Atlanta's Emory University and began his
teaching career at Georgia Tech in the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward was ``the dominant force in Southern historiography,''
wrote biographer John Herbert Roper. Woodward was ``the one
historian whose works must be mastered and reckoned with by serious
students of Southern history,'' declared another biographer,
Elisabeth Muhlenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's 1938 book, ``Tom Watson: Agrarian Rebel,'' is the
definitive work about the former Georgia senator and one of this
state's most important historical volumes, according to Judson C.
Ward Jr. of Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's 1951 book, ``Origins of the New South, 1877-1913,''
won the Bancroft Prize for history-writing. It best states his
revisionist view of post-Reconstruction Southern history since the
Civil War and is universally regarded as his most important
scholarly contribution, according to Muhlenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular of Woodward's works, ``The Strange Career of
Jim Crow,'' was published in 1955 and traces the history of Jim
Crow segregation laws, including Atlanta's prior to the 1960s. With
more than 600,000 copies sold, the book has been called ``the
single most influential ever written on the history of American
race relations'' by James M. McPherson of Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King Jr. read from ``The Strange Career of Jim
Crow'' on the steps of the Alabama Capitol at the culmination of
the 1965 Selma march _ an epic protest in which Woodward himself
participated. King called Woodward's book ``the historical Bible of
the civil rights movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward edited ``Mary Chesnut's Civil War,'' which won the 1982
Pulitzer Prize for history. He and Muhlenfeld edited ``The Private
Mary Chesnut: The Unpublished Civil War Diaries'' in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward debunked a host of myths about Southern history,
including:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Redemption'' in the Compromise of 1877. According to
Woodward, the Southerners who agreed to support Rutherford B. Hayes
for president in exchange for his promise to remove federal troops
were not ``Redeemers,'' as they have been called, but ``greedy
opportunists'' anxious to make the South like the North through
industrial and commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Historical continuity'' in the South through a return to
power in 1877 of antebellum leaders, maintaining an unbroken social
and economic order. In fact,. Woodward argued, prewar Whigs gained
power and thereafter ``New South'' politics was at odds with the
region's dominant agricultural economy.
</P>
<P>
   _ A ``Solid South,'' of one mind politically. In fact, the
populism that arose in the 1890s, and which had its principal
spokesman in Watson, demonstrated a diverse political environment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jim Crow segregation laws were ancient and ingrained in
Southern life. Not so, said Woodward. Whites and blacks had
occupied train cars together and attended the same political
functions until the 1890s. Segregation laws were mainly the product
of a single generation.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of Woodward's books was so great, and his
arguments so convincing, that no rival historian challenged him for
decades. Then the challenges were minor, for example that he
neglected psychological insights in his Watson biography.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward was Sterling professor of History at Yale from 1961
until his retirement in 1977. He was a member of a triumvirate of
Southern literary greats there; the others were writer and poet
Robert Penn Warren _ who lured Woodward from Johns Hopkins _ and
literary critic Cleanth Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Living a good deal of his life outside the South gave Woodward a
platform from which to view and comment on his native region. His
iconoclastic books disturbed many, but he made no apologies.
Looking back on his career, he wrote in 1986: ``I am on the whole
undismayed by the experience, and quite unrepentant.''
</P>
<P>
   Youth
</P>
<P>
   Comer Vann Woodward was born Nov. 13, 1908, in Vanndale, Ark., a
town near Memphis, Tenn., that is named for one of his maternal
ancestors. He grew up in Morrilton, Ark., 40 miles north of Little
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Hugh A. Woodward, was Morrilton school
superintendent and a leader in the Methodist church, and his mother
was Bess Vann Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   The future author studied for two years at Henderson Brown
College in Arkadelphia, Ark., intending to become a chemist.
However, in 1929 his father became associate dean of
Emory-at-Oxford, an affiliate of Atlanta's Emory University. The
young Woodward enrolled at the latter.
</P>
<P>
   He was ``a bright student and social nonconformist,'' according
to an alumni magazine profile. An uncle, an eminent socologist,
introduced Woodward to Will Alexander, chairman of the Commission
on Interracial Cooperation, later the Southern Regional Council.
Alexander introduced Woodward to black educators at crosstown
Atlanta University. One of the latter, J. Saunders Redding, was
``the first black man with whom I ever broke bread and exchanged
views as an equal,'' Woodward wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At an AU dance, Woodward asked a black girl to dance. ``I
embarrassed her and caused myself a good deal of notoriety and
distrust,'' he wrote later. ``Had I to do it over again, I'm not
certain I would.''
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Emory with a degree in philosophy in 1930 and
got a job teaching English at Georgia Tech; an engineering school,
it also has liberal arts courses. At the same time, Woodward
studied at Columbia University in New York, and received a master's
degree in political science in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   While in New York, he knew black poet Langston Hughes and had a
role in a play in Harlem. In the summer of 1932, he traveled in
France, Russia and Germany. He was struck by Europeans' strong
feelings against the American South because of its treatment of the
``Scottsboro Boys,'' nine black Alabama youths convicted of raping
two white girls.
</P>
<P>
   At odds with Tech superiors
</P>
<P>
   Back in Atlanta in 1933, Woodward was a party to two events that
placed him at odds with his Georgia Tech superiors.
</P>
<P>
   The University System of Georgia reasoned that teachers taught,
and thus should be paid, only 10 months of the year. Woodward and
M.W. Blanton, another faculty member, filed a legal test of the
system in Superior Court and won. ``The case of Woodward and
Blanton v. Regents has become a landmark decision dealing with the
obligations of states and state agencies,'' according to lawyer
Hamilton Lokey.
</P>
<P>
   The second event of a combative year came when Woodward served
as vice-chairman of a defense committee for Angelo Herndon, a black
Communist sentenced to 18 years on a chain gang in 1933 for
distributing on the steps of the Fulton County Courthouse a
Communist Party leaflet calling for an end to segregation and
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward ``left the Herndon committee ... disillusioned by
internal bickering and by Communist manipulation of the case for
propaganda purposes,'' according to Muhlenfeld. Woodward was fired
from his teaching position at Tech. He was ``admonished'' for
supporting Herndon, Woodward wrote, and officially fired because of
budget cuts. ``I left much the wiser,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He looked around for a book subject who ``represented everything
I abhorred in the public life of the South.'' He found it in
Watson.
</P>
<P>
   After a year's research, Woodward ran out of money and sought a
fellowship. ``The logical place to go was the University of North
Carolina, which had Watson's private papers,'' he wrote. At UNC,
Woodward was taught and strongly influenced by Howard K. Beals, a
proponent of a progressive interpretation of history_that change
results from the conflict of economic interests. ``Tom Watson:
Agrarian Rebel'' was Woodward's thesis for Beals.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward received his doctorate in 1937. It is rare for a thesis
to be published in book form, but Woodward's was the following
year, when he was 29.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he was a naval officer who wrote three
classified books about battles. One of them, ``Battle of Leyte
Gulf,'' was declassified and published by Macmillan, and is
considered a definitive work on the naval battle.
</P>
<P>
   `Delusions, temptations and obsessions'
</P>
<P>
   Union Seminary's Reinhold Niebuhr, author of ``The Irony of
American History,'' was another scholar who influenced Woodward. In
the 1950s, as his native South braced to fight school integration,
the historian ``sought out the aging Niebuhr to address those
contemporary American delusions, temptations and obsessions that
absorbed and alarmed me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was one of a group of social scientists and historians who
aided the 1952-53 preparations of briefs and papers for the
historic school desegregation suit, Brown v. Board of Education of
Topeka. For the NAACP lawyers arguing the case, Woodward prepared a
paper on the Reconstruction era and how idealistic goals of the
period ``gave way to pragmatism of Northern and Southern whites,''
according to author Richard Kluger.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, ``to distance myself and get perspective on the
South,'' Woodward lectured at the University of Tokyo. In 1954-55,
he was Harmsworth professor of American History at Oxford
University in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Strange Career of Jim Crow'' is the text of a series of
lectures that Woodward delivered at the University of Virginia in
1954. He was in England when the book was published. At first,
sales were so-so. As the civil rights revolution gained momentum,
``what had originated as a modest communication to a Southern
academic audience had swelled into a mass paperback publication of
vast numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward has critical passages in the book about the city where
he spent his undergraduate days, began to teach, and was at odds
with his Tech employers. For example, Woodward describes a 1940
Atlanta ordinance segregating city parks that did not apply to ``so
much of Grant Park as is occupied by the zoo.'' Thus, Woodward
said, ``Only in the presence of the lower anthropoids could
law-abiding Atlantans of different races consort together.''
</P>
<P>
   He married Glenn MacLeod in 1937. She died of cancer at 71 in
1982. Their son, Peter, died of melanoma at 26 in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   There are no immediate survivors.

<P>
   That deafening silence you hear is the sound of presidential
hopefuls debating whether government should intervene in the
wage-setting process to help people afford a better life. Today, it
seems, everyone agrees that the market does this best.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, American politicians have split, often rancorously,
over the issue. Still more profoundly, they were divided over tax
cuts and social programs such as welfare, food stamps, child care,
education and health insurance. Now there is broad agreement that
whatever the specifics, government should limit itself to helping
families get along until the market finally raises their incomes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton came into office in 1993 in the old style:
primed to use government to raise workers' wages. With the country
still struggling to shake off the effects of a recession, he
proposed a substantial increase in the minimum wage as well as
billions in public works to raise the demand for workers. A
presidential commission was also set up to study ways to make
unions more effective.
</P>
<P>
   In time, however, the public works spending was dropped in favor
of deficit reduction. The union commission's recommendations were
shelved, and the 90-cent increase in the minimum wage that Congress
did approve in 1996 brought the minimum to only $5.15 today. That
leaves it well short of its peak in 1968, when its worth was $7.49
an hour in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Reagan years, a gradual metamorphosis has taken place.
It appears to be culminating in the current presidential campaign,
in which Republican and Democratic candidates alike bow to the
efficiencies of the markets, even while acknowledging that income
inequality remains a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Wage-setting and labor power, once deeply divisive election-year
issues, are barely mentioned. The only question is what is the
right tax incentive or social program when the markets require a
helping hand.

   ``Where conservatives and liberals might differ, and it is a
nuance difference, is in how each of us would tear down the
obstacles to getting ahead,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsay of the
American Enterprise Institute, who is George W. Bush's chief
economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay notes that Republicans emphasize tax cuts, which are
intended to increase the incentive to work and to hasten the day
that a worker takes home adequate pay for a materially decent life
. Both sides favor the earned income tax credit, a tax rebate. And
while the Democrats endorse a variety of social programs, including
food stamps and subsidies for child care, health insurance,
education and job training, they are careful to avoid any
suggestion that they are interfering in the workings of the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the beauty of the earned income tax credit is that it
raises living standards and incentives to work,'' said Gene
Sperling, director of President Clinton's National Economic Council
and a top adviser to Vice President Al Gore. These programs, he
explained, avoid ``the kind of constraints on markets that in
Europe has hurt the dynamism and job growth.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this convergence between Democrats and
Republicans is the remarkable strength of the U.S. economy, which
has boomed since the 1996 election, while the more interventionist
economies of Europe and Japan have floundered. Moreover, in 1996,
wages finally began to rise faster than inflation, across the
board, the first time that has happened since the early 1970s _
although well-to-do Americans have pulled further ahead of
low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   This inequality has hardly escaped notice, and no candidate has
been more outspoken on the subject than Bill Bradley, Gore's rival
for the Democratic nomination. But he, too, stays within the free
market framework.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill feels that open markets are a strength of the American
economy, but he has also indicated that someone who works
year-round, full-time should not end up being poor,'' said Marcia
Aronoff, who advises Bradley on economics issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's solution, like Gore's, is social programs, including
national health insurance and an expansion of the earned income tax
credit, which now provides up to $5,000 a year for 17 million
families earning between $9,000 and $30,500.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidates would raise the minimum wage again,
but modestly, along the lines proposed by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., who tried unsuccessfully to win passage this fall of an
increase in the minimum wage to $6.15 an hour over two years _
still well short of the old peak.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley propose a similar modest increase in the
minimum wage. And Sperling says that $1 over two years strikes a
balance between ``higher wages for low income people and potential
harm to job growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would go a few steps further, banning striker
replacement, for example, giving unions more power to organize
workers and denying government contracts to companies that violate
labor law. But those proposals, set forth in a mid-August speech,
lack details. ``He has not proposed specific remedies,'' Ms.
Aronoff said. ``He is open at this point to a variety of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The market-oriented approach to wage setting has the support of
most mainstream economists, who argue, among other things, that
government intervention discourages companies from hiring unskilled
workers and puts the increased wage cost disproportionately on
companies that hire the unskilled.
</P>
<P>
   Business, by and large, seconds this view, arguing that tax cuts
and social programs are preferable to higher mandated wages, which
come directly out of their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   But this view is by no means universally accepted. Some
economists believe that the market demand for workers is only part
of the reason for the rise in low-end wages in recent years. Small
as it was, the 1996 increase in the minimum wage also nudged up
hourly wages at the low end of the pay scale.
</P>
<P>
   Today the federal minimum wage is so low that several states
have increased their minimums since the mid-1990s, and more than 40
city and county governments have passed ``living wage'' ordinances.
These in effect are minimums, often $7 an hour or more, imposed on
companies that do business with local governments. Less job
turnover and more worker efficiency help to offset the cost, some
studies have found.
</P>
<P>
   All this is fodder for an old-style campaign debate over wages
and labor power in the months ahead. That is certainly the hope of
the AFL-CIO, which has endorsed Gore. David Smith, director of
public policy for the union, said, ``We continue to be disappointed
that there is not more broad public attention, in the campaign
discourse or the public discourse, about the problems of low wage
workers and slow wage growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's disappointment may last through November.

<P>
   That deafening silence you hear is the sound of presidential
hopefuls debating whether government should intervene in the
wage-setting process to help people afford a better life. Today, it
seems, everyone agrees that the market does this best.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, American politicians have split, often rancorously,
over the issue. Still more profoundly, they were divided over tax
cuts and social programs such as welfare, food stamps, child care,
education and health insurance. Now there is broad agreement that
whatever the specifics, government should limit itself to helping
families get along until the market finally raises their incomes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton came into office in 1993 in the old style:
primed to use government to raise workers' wages. With the country
still struggling to shake off the effects of a recession, he
proposed a substantial increase in the minimum wage as well as
billions in public works to raise the demand for workers. A
presidential commission was also set up to study ways to make
unions more effective.
</P>
<P>
   In time, however, the public works spending was dropped in favor
of deficit reduction. The union commission's recommendations were
shelved, and the 90-cent increase in the minimum wage that Congress
did approve in 1996 brought the minimum to only $5.15 today. That
leaves it well short of its peak in 1968, when its worth was $7.49
an hour in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Reagan years, a gradual metamorphosis has taken place.
It appears to be culminating in the current presidential campaign,
in which Republican and Democratic candidates alike bow to the
efficiencies of the markets, even while acknowledging that income
inequality remains a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Wage-setting and labor power, once deeply divisive election-year
issues, are barely mentioned. The only question is what is the
right tax incentive or social program when the markets require a
helping hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where conservatives and liberals might differ, and it is a
nuance difference, is in how each of us would tear down the
obstacles to getting ahead,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsay of the
American Enterprise Institute, who is George W. Bush's chief
economic adviser.
</P>

while the Democrats endorse a variety of social programs, including
food stamps and subsidies for child care, health insurance,
education and job training, they are careful to avoid any
suggestion that they are interfering in the workings of the
marketplace.

which is being published Monday, Dec. 20:
</P>
<P>
   (The stories and accompanying artwork will move beginning Sunday
afternoon in the ``f'' news file. This material replaces the Monday
Business section of The Times.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTERNET-ECONOMY (Undated) _ Historians say the Internet
should be viewed mainly as the latest advance in communications, a
successor to the telegraph and the telephone, more a technological
step than a leap forward. Still, whether labeled a revolution or an
evolution, the Internet's impact on the economy seems destined to
become greater and greater. By Steve Lohr. (With graphic showing
business investment in computers, peripherals and software.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-REFLECTIONS (Undated) _ When eight well-known executives
were asked to sum up the most important characteristics of the last
100 years in an epitaph for the 20th century, they invariably
talked about the powerful impact of technology in all its myriad
forms: the airplane, television, computers and the Internet. By
Reed Abelson.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-READER-VISIONS (Undated) _ Asked for proposals to
improve the human condition in the next century, people were
generous with their ideas. Many visions fell into broad categories
like health, nutrition, education and transportation. This article
offers a sampling of responses.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-DEMOGRAPHICS (Undated) _ Five years into a booming
economy, America is ``depleting its pool of available workers'' _ a
warning often heard from Alan Greenspan. But beyond the pool of
known recruits lies another mass of untapped labor that can supply
an expanding work force _ and sustain a robust economy _ into the
new decade. This labor in reserve consists mainly of women and
potential immigrants. By Louis Uchitelle. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-FED (Undated) _ A look at the past and future of the
Federal Reserve, which has risen from virtual obscurity to near
omnipotence. By Richard W. Stevenson. (With graphic showing GDP for
the last 100 years.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-CURRENCY (Undated) _ The history of money and its
future. The century began with a universal money _ gold _ and ends
with gold all but eliminated. In its place are national currencies,
some floating, some fixed to major currencies and one supernational
currency, the euro. A look at what lies ahead. By Floyd Norris.
(With graphic showing the value of the U.S. dollar since 1900.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-BIOTECH (Undated) _ For several years, the big quest in
biotechnology has been to determine the complete sequence of human
DNA, the genetic code of life. Now, however, that task is nearing
completion, and the biotechnology industry is facing an even
tougher job _ deciphering that code so that new drugs and
diagnostic tests can be developed. By Andrew Pollack. (With graphic
on biotech stocks.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-AGRICULTURE (Undated) _ Agribusiness leaders are as
confident as ever that the need to feed a growing world population
makes it both essential and inevitable that biotechnology will play
a central role in 21st century farming. But for now it looks like
the industry may be pulled over by consumers and fined by investors
for recklessly speeding toward such a future. By Barnaby J. Feder.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-HEALTH (Undated) _ Americans who have complaints about
the health care system may soon be in luck _ or maybe not. Many
health care professionals expect the medical system in the United
States to be overhauled so remarkably during the next two decades
that many patients will not be able to recognize it. By David J.
Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-AUTOS (Jackson, Mich.) _ A look at how the car-buying
experience may change in the coming decades. By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-AIRCRAFT (Washington) _ Aviation, which enters its
second century in 2003, is still far from a mature industry, and
for the next decade it seems likely to move in two directions at
once. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-OIL (Undated) _ Of all the pressures on the oil industry
as the century turns, the one most likely to transform it over the
next two decades, industry experts say, will be the fervent
campaign to improve the environment. By Kenneth N. Gilpin. (With
graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-BANKS-REED (Undated) _ As a young Citicorp executive
more than 20 years ago, John S. Reed earned a reputation as a
technology guru. Reed is now co-chief executive of Citigroup, the
country's largest financial services concern and the creation of
last year's merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group. But for all his
interest in technology, Reed admitted in an interview that the
impact and importance of the Internet escaped his attention until
recently. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-BANKS (Undated) _ In the wake of the historic changes
made by Congress this year in laws that separated commercial banks,
investment banks and insurance companies, a wave of consolidation
is expected among financial services companies, creating more
conglomerates like Citigroup, the first company in the United
States to combine an insurer with a commercial bank, an investment
bank and a securities brokerage firm, the experts say. By Patrick
McGeehan. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-SHOPPING (Undated) _ The changes remaking retailing come
not only in the medium shoppers use to make their purchases but in
what they expect their dollars to buy _ which is a lot more than
they did even five years ago. In the end, it is less the Internet
that is transforming traditional retailing as this century closes,
than one giant discounter: Wal-Mart Stores. By Leslie Kaufman.
(Graphic showing Wal-Mart vs. online retailers.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-HOTELS (Undated) _ A look at trends that will take the
hotel industry profitably into the next decade. By Edwin McDowell.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-BLOOPERS (Undated) _ A look at the century's biggest
business blunders. By Floyd Norris. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-SCAMS (Undated) _ A look back at the century's major
scandals. By Diana B. Henriques.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-COMPUTERS (Undated) _ If using the Internet rather than
spread sheets and word processors is driving the growth of the
personal computer industry, then mobile access to the Internet is
likely to dominate in short order. Who could possibly argue that
surfing the Web while trapped sitting in a chair at a desk is
natural or inevitable? The one flaw in this argument is that PC
sales are not shrinking. By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTERNET-DAD (Undated) _ The Internet has many fathers,
but few deserve the label more than Robert W. Taylor. In 1966, as a
director of the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency
Information Processing Techniques Office, Taylor came up with the
idea for the Internet's precursor, the ARPAnet. An interview. By
John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-WEB-SOFTWARE (Undated) _ If 1999 was the year everyone
started saying that Internet-based software would replace
conventional programs, 2000 will surely be the year the transition
begins in earnest. By Lawrence M. Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTERNET (Undated) _ Future developments in the Internet
regarding business should come in waves. Those who are studying the
relationship between business and the still-primitive and slow
Internet say that in five or 10 years those waves could well
reshape the way business is conducted. This transformation will
happen because, very basically but profoundly, the Internet permits
ease and breadth of communication, provides newfound mobility and
allows complex transactions to take place among numerous parties in
far-flung regions. By Matt Richtel.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-E-COMMERCE (Undated) _ Ten years ago, Internet
prognosticators sounded overzealous when they suggested that a
network of computers would recast every facet of society. Some of
the most futuristic and utopian predictions may never play out, of
course. But the Net does seem to be bringing irrevocable change to
one part of life: buying stuff. The E-commerce column. By Bob
Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-COMMUNICATIONS (Undated) _ Over the last decade,
cellular telephones have evolved from oddity to indulgence to
everyday accessory. Discuss the future of wireless technology with
leading communications executives, and the words ``phone'' and
``telephone'' may not be used at all. That is because they see the
future of wireless technology as having little to do with talking
and everything to do with putting the Internet into pockets and
purses around the world. By Seth Schiesel.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-PATENTS (Undated) _ The patents column: The debate, and
resulting litigation, over the importance of patents in the
Internet's development. By Teresa Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-NEWSPAPERS (Undated) _ Challenged to recreate themselves
both online and in print, newspapers _ and their advertisers _ have
a greater appetite for information about their appeal, their
audiences and their competition than ever, according to both those
who gather data on the Internet and those who use the data. By
Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ Shakespeare's exclamation ``O
brave new world'' is an appropriate way to begin an examination of
what advertising will be like when years no longer begin with 19.
It is even more appropriate that those words are from ``The
Tempest'' because the changes facing Madison Avenue in the next
decade will be nothing if not tumultuous. By Stuart Elliott. (With
graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-MOVIES (San Francisco) _ Throughout the entertainment
industry, from the major studios to Internet start-up companies,
people are attempting to figure out how the rapidly emerging
digital technology will affect the movies people see and the ways
they see them. By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-TELEVISION (Undated) _ Although executives in the worlds
of television and entertainment are not entirely certain about the
details of the convergence of television, computers and broadband
cable systems, all agree that the experience of watching television
will prove extraordinarily different in 26 years from today's
viewing. By Bernard Weinraub.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-WALLSTREET (Undated) _ Electronic trading is driving new
market structures, so Wall Street is approaching the new millennium
the way superstitious pilots approach the Bermuda Triangle _
fearing the worst, hoping for the best but prepared for just about
anything. By Diana B. Henriques. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-MARKETS (Undated) _ The upward march of the stock market
indexes has become so inexorable in recent years that most
strategists no longer weigh whether the market will rise next year.
Instead, they speculate on just how much higher it will go. By
Gretchen Morgenson. (with graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTERNET-INTERVIEW (Undated) _ Last month, with about
six weeks left in the century, Mary Meeker, head of the Internet
research team at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and Jeff Camp, who
follows Internet data services for the firm, sat down to talk about
the future of Internet stocks. By Kenneth N. Gilpin.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-MUTFUNDS (Undated) _ Are the mutual fund industry's best
days behind it? Sales gains are slowing. Fund company stocks are
lagging. Some fund investors have taken their big gains and cashed
in. And challenges from cheaper institutionalized money managers,
online brokerage firms and other new competitors have led some
analysts to predict that the industry is only starting to see tough
times. By Richard A. Oppel Jr. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-COMMODITIES (Undated) _ If the decade of the '90s was
the greatest ever for stock prices, it was one of the poorer for
commodity prices. But as the decade ends, there are signs of life
in commodities. By Jonathan Fuerbringer. (With graphic showing the
CRB Index since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-INTEREST-RATES (Undated) _ Inflation is calm. The
Federal Reserve is vigilant. And the Federal budget deficit has
disappeared. So conditions should be right for long-term interest
rates finally to fall decisively below 5 percent, a level they have
seen only briefly in the final third of the century about to end.
Maybe. By Jonathan Fuerbringer. (With graphic showing interest
rates since 1900.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-WORKPLACE (Undated) _ Across the country, thousands of
people who tried working from home part time during the 1990s have
returned to the office full time. It is enough to make one wonder
whether the workplace of the early 21st century will in fact
resemble a traditional office much more than was once thought. Do
not be fooled, workplace experts say, contending that in reality
this is the lull before the telecommuting storm. By David
Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-CORPORATIONS (Undated) _ For five years a klatch of
management scholars and forward-looking executives has met at the
Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology to ponder a question: What will be tomorrow's model for
business success? By Fred Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-GLOBAL (Washington) _ A decade ago it would have been
hard to imagine that at the end of the century the world economy
would mix unparalleled American ascendancy with such pervasive
global anxiety, or that free-marketeers would be celebrating the
triumph of market capitalism while so many around the globe
questioned the cost of its victory. By David E. Sanger. (With
graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-JAPAN (Tokyo) _ To almost everyone's surprise, the
Japanese economy showed remarkable _ and remarkably diverse _ signs
of life this year. But there are many contradictions in the
economy, making it difficult to be either optimistic or pessimistic
when it comes to Japan's prospects as the century turns. By
Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-CHINA (Beijing) _ When negotiators from China and the
United States clinked their champagne glasses here last month to
celebrate a trade agreement between the two countries, nobody
exulted more than China's Internet entrepreneurs. The deal, which
opens the door to China's entry into the World Trade Organization,
will also allow foreign companies to own stakes of up to 50 percent
in Chinese Internet companies by 2006. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ After weathering a year of debt
defaults, a currency crash, an absentee president and governments
that change with the seasons, Russians have one piece of good news:
The economy has not collapsed. By Neela Banerjee. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-EUROPE (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Europe enters the new year
and the new millennium on a mission of staggering scale: an
expansion of the European Union by 13 countries and some 170
million people. By Edmund L. Andrews. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-LATIN-AMERICA (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) _ On the theory
that things cannot get much worse, Latin America is looking to the
start of the new decade with anticipation. The past year has been a
difficult one, more onerous even than the crisis that followed the
Mexican meltdown in December 1994: It began with a currency
collapse in Brazil, included a bond default in Ecuador and, with
the numbers now toted up, is concluding with most of the region's
large economies struggling to emerge from recession. By Larry
Rohter. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   OUTLOOK-ASIA (Singapore) _ Southeast Asia's battered economies
have bounced back this year, and the most serious concern in the
year 2000, economists say, will not be the region's enduring
banking mess but the possibility that things could unexpectedly
turn ugly in the United States or Japan. By Wayne Arnold. (With
graphic.)

   After coexisting uneasily for 50 years in a state of war and for
the last four years in cold silence, Israel and Syria have agreed
to agree. President Clinton announced that the two countries would
begin intensive and accelerated peace talks Jan. 3 at a site near
Washington, to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past 48 hours, Israel and Syria have taken critical
steps in the journey toward peace,'' Clinton said at the White
House, flanked by Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria. ``The journey will be a
difficult one. But with courage and perseverance on both sides, the
result will be deeply rewarding to the people of Israel and to the
people of Syria.''

   New York Escapes a Strike
</P>
<P>
   For days, a contract dispute involving New York City's transit
workers had shaped up as a heavyweight bout between Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union. The mayor
threatened to hit the union with huge fines if it went on strike.
But minutes after the strike deadline passed, union and transit
officials agreed on a tentative contract that would increase the
pay of bus and subway workers by more than 18 percent over three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani boasted that his forceful leadership had averted a
strike. And Willie James, the union's president, declared that
after a decade of concessions and austerity he had won the most
generous contract received by the city's public-sector workers
since the 1980s.

   Monsanto Co., which has vowed to create sustainable agriculture
through the use of genetically engineered crops, was hit with a
class-action lawsuit by antitrust lawyers who claim that Monsanto
rushed genetically engineered corn and soybean seeds to the
marketplace without testing them for safety.

   The suit, filed on behalf of a group of small farmers and

   More than a half-century after the defeat of Hitler, German

billion fund to compensate slave laborers in Nazi Germany and other
victims of the Holocaust. The agreement followed difficult

getting the money to surviving workers, most of whom live in

   Over the last six years, Democratic donors have contributed more

POLITICIANS AT HOME REMAIN COOL TO BRADLEY CANDIDACY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Robert Menendez remembers the first time he went
to bat for Bill Bradley, defying the Hudson County political
machine in 1978 to support a retired basketball star who had never
held elective office.
</P>
<P>
   Menendez, who is now one of a number of prominent Democrats in
New Jersey who have publicly rebuffed Bradley and endorsed Vice
President Al Gore in the presidential race, even guided the
candidate through a political tour of the county that took place on
the day that Menendez's father died of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   And he remembers what happened when he asked Bradley to go to
bat for him 14 years later. Menendez, who went on to become Union
City's mayor and later a state assemblyman and state senator, was
making his own run for Congress. But when he asked Bradley to
support him in the Democratic primary, he was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very disappointing moment,'' said Menendez, who
nonetheless won election to the House, where he continues to
represent the 13th District. ``I asked him to support me in the
primary, and he would not. He said it was his policy not to get
involved in races where Democrats were fighting each other. I said,
`Two things: You don't know him, and remember what I did for you.
And, if I didn't have a primary opponent, I wouldn't need your
endorsement.'''
</P>
<P>
   The pain in Menendez's voice sounds undiminished by the
intervening years as he tells this story, though he has been
telling it often lately. And when Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
campaigned in New Hampshire with Gore on Friday it was a vivid
reminder that Bradley could not count on political support from his
home-state colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Bradley's popularity during his three terms in the
Senate, one might have expected to find Democrats throughout the
state uniting behind the first New Jerseyan to take a credible shot
at the White House since Woodrow Wilson. But while the roster of
Bradley's supporters in his home state includes dozens of officials
at the local and county levels eager to attach themselves to the
coattails of a favorite son, there are striking omissions _ and not
one member of the delegation in which he served for 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg, who endorsed Gore months ago, drew attention to his
support before Friday night's debate between Gore and Bradley. Rep.
Frank Pallone of Long Branch, who does not speak ill of Bradley,
nonetheless is backing Gore. And Rep. Donald Payne of Newark, who
has not formally endorsed Gore, has praised the vice president
while describing Bradley as somewhat distant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bradley's popularity among New Jersey's voters is widely
acknowledged, and he would be expected to beat Gore easily in the
state's Democratic primary in June, although backers of both men
believe the race will be decided well before then.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Gore suggest that Bradley's problems in New Jersey
are reminiscent of Sen. John McCain's frosty relations with his
fellow Republicans in Arizona, among them Gov. Jane Dee Hull, who
has endorsed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for president. Her
remarks about McCain's temper set off a wave of speculation about
his emotional fitness.
</P>
<P>
   In Bradley's case, however, what seems to have alienated many
New Jersey Democrats, or at least left them with mixed feelings
about him, is not so much a perceived character flaw as some of the
same choices, convictions and experiences that he has tried to turn
into selling points for a national audience.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley makes much in his campaign speeches of his three-year
hiatus from politics, for example, when he traveled the country
giving speeches, consulting and teaching. But his absence from the
political scene won him few friends at home. Victor Scudiery,
chairman of the Monmouth County Democratic Committee, recalled
asking Bradley to attend a party function after his retirement from
the Senate. ``He stated to me that he doesn't do those things
anymore,'' Scudiery said. ``Those are the exact words, and they
still ring in my ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about our favorite son,'' he added. ``My
father said, `If you leave the nest and the family, you better
start apologizing when you come back.'''
</P>
<P>
   One longtime friend and supporter in state politics who has
endorsed Bradley for president said: ``With Bill Bradley, a lot of
the time it's a one-way street. That's just Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's aides and allies in New Jersey respond to such
criticisms by calling Bradley's lack of interest in logrolling with
local politicians a virtue. ``John Kennedy wasn't the greatest
senator for Massachusetts,'' said state Sen. John Lynch. ``He
wasn't part of the club, and he didn't play inside baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Codey, the state Senate minority leader, said: ``Bill
was not the stereotypical pol at all. Among some politicians, that
could be a weakness. He's not going to stay at the bar and make
some deals on federal judgeships. That's not him. And that's a
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   And Emma Byrne, a longtime adviser to Bradley, noted that he had
invested heavily in the machinery of politics, helping to build the
first statewide voter database in New Jersey, for example. ``Bill
has always believed in investing in the institution of the party,
not about being a political boss,'' she said. ``We have state
chairmen for that. It wasn't like he neglected or walked away from
the party, or from trying to help elect Democrats.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who has not yet
taken sides in the presidential campaign, said Bradley, whom he
succeeded, was always ``a little bit different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most revealing comment I've heard about Bill Bradley was
from Bill Bradley _ when he said the people he most admired were
Jimmy Carter, Woodrow Wilson and Mikhail Gorbachev,'' he said. ``It
was a telling moment, because none of those people had good local
political skills or worked well within the institutions of their
time. But each was a visionary, each set important goals and made a
contribution. I can see that's a list where Bill Bradley would be
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Bradley delivered in his own way for New Jersey
residents; one of his final achievements in office, for instance,
was to preserve Sterling Forest, the largest remaining tract of
unprotected woodlands along the New York-New Jersey border. But the
vice president has cultivated important politicians in the state
throughout his seven years in office, Democratic officials say _
working with Menendez on dredging the shipping channel to create
jobs for longshoremen, for example, and with Mayor Sharpe James of
Newark on demolishing high-rise housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey official who has been most critical of Bradley,
in fact, is James, who questioned Bradley's political skills and
even his sincerity, the most essential element of his largely
image-driven campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was good for the Senate, because he challenged them
on issues,'' James said. ``But to be the chief executive, where you
have to make rapid decisions, you have to know the art of
compromise, you really have to have sensitivity to people, where
you really want to shake people's hands. He doesn't have that
warmth and sensitivity. He's now on a mission of charade.''
</P>
<P>
   James, who recounted several events at which, he says, Bradley
snubbed him in recent years, was one of Bradley's earliest
supporters; the two shared a campaign office in 1978, when James
was running for re-election as city councilman from Newark's North
Ward. ``I was with him from beginning to end,'' he said. ``I even
read his mail.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said his opinion of Bradley began to change when the
senator at first refused to travel to Chicago to support Harold
Washington's candidacy for mayor in 1983. ``All the Democratic
caucus was going, but Bill Bradley would not go,'' James said. ``He
said, `I'm not into local politics.' He was about theory. He didn't
want to deal in the nitty-gritty. But I screamed and shouted, and
finally he went, and felt good about it, and we felt good about him
being there.''

   But for all the high-profile defections to Gore, Bradley retains
the loyalty of many local officials, particularly in the southern
third of the state. On Dec. 8 in East Brunswick, Bradley raised
$750,000, and hundreds of admirers crushed in around him, waiting
for a chance to be photographed with him.
</P>
<P>
   And while the New Jersey State Federation of the AFL-CIO has
endorsed Gore, longtime union leaders like Charles Marciante, who
retired as president of the federation in 1997, say they harbor no
ill will toward Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an independent guy,'' Marciante said. ``He's his own man.
He wasn't like a party hack, if you know what I mean. Just as many
senators are in Washington, they're pretty independent _ the nation
comes first. He was one of those. And that did not hurt him one
bit. Who can hate him for that? As long as the people and the
nation came first.''

EXCERPTS FROM THE WORK OF BILLY COLLINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With POET-BOOK-BATTLE) 
(js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the work of poet Billy Collins:
</P>
<P>
   All we need is fourteen lines, well, thirteen now,
</P>
<P>
   and after this one just a dozen
</P>
<P>
   to launch a little ship on love's storm-tossed seas,
</P>
<P>
   then only ten more left like rows of beans.
</P>
<P>
   How easily it goes unless you get Elizabethan
</P>
<P>
   and insist the iambic bongos must be played
</P>
<P>
   and rhymes positioned at the ends of lines,
</P>
<P>
   one for every station of the cross.
</P>
<P>
   But hang on here while we make the turn
</P>
<P>
   into the final six where all will be resolved,
</P>
<P>
   where longing and heartache will find an end,
</P>
<P>
   where Laura will tell Petrarch to put down his pen,
</P>
<P>
   take off those crazy medieval tights,
</P>
<P>
   blow out the lights, and come at last to bed.

   Insomnia
</P>
<P>
   Even though the house is deeply silent
</P>
<P>
   and the room, with no moon,
</P>
<P>
   is perfectly dark,
</P>
<P>
   even though the body is a sack of exhaustion
</P>
<P>
   inert on the bed,
</P>
<P>
   someone inside me will not
</P>
<P>
   get off his tricycle,
</P>
<P>
   will not stop tracing the same tight circle
</P>
<P>
   on the same green threadbare carpet.
</P>
<P>
   It makes no difference whether I lie
</P>
<P>
   staring at the ceiling
</P>
<P>
   or pace the living-room floor,
</P>
<P>
   he keeps on making his furious rounds,
</P>
<P>
   little pedaler in his frenzy,
</P>
<P>
   my own worst, my oldest friend.
</P>
<P>
   What is there to do but close my eyes
</P>
<P>
   and watch him circling the night,
</P>
<P>
   schoolboy in an ill-fitting jacket,
</P>
<P>
   leaning forward, his cap on backwards,
</P>
<P>
   wringing the handlebars,
</P>
<P>
   maintaining a certain speed?
</P>
<P>
   Does anything exist at this hour
</P>
<P>
   in this nest of dark rooms
</P>
<P>
   but the spectacle of him
</P>
<P>
   and the hope that before dawn
</P>
<P>
   I can lift out some curious detail
</P>
<P>
   that will carry me off to sleep _
</P>
<P>
   the watch that encircles his pale wrist,
</P>
<P>
   the expandable band,
</P>
<P>
   the tiny hands that keep pointing this way and that.

   The United States is suffering from a veritable epidemic of
mental illness, according to a report last week by the surgeon
general, which asserted that ``22 percent of the population has a
diagnosable mental disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   But how is mental illness defined? The standard reference used
by therapists for diagnosis and for assigning insurance-payment
codes is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American
Psychiatric Association.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent edition, DSM-IV, which was issued in 1994, lists
more than 300 kinds of mental disorders _ a far cry from the 22
illnesses identified in 1918 in the Statistical Manual for the Use
of Institutions for the Insane, the precursor to the DSM.
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessors, DSM-IV provides standardized diagnoses
for debilitating mental illnesses like psychoses, major
depressions, anxieties, phobias and personality disorders. But
critics contend that the manual contains large gray areas in which
ordinary life-adjustment problems and vexing behaviors are
classified as mental illnesses requiring clinical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some disorders found in those gray areas.
</P>
<P>
   _ JOE SHARKEY
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Therapists and the courts have always struggled to separate
mental illness from bad behavior. For example, a good percentage of
any prison's criminal population would seem to fit the criteria for
Antisocial Personality Disorder (301.7): &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful
behaviors ...
</P>
<P>
   2. Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated lying, use of
aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   3. Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead.
</P>
<P>
   4. Irritability and aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   5. Reckless disregard for safety of self or others.
</P>
<P>
   6. Consistent irresponsibility ...
</P>
<P>
   &UR; On the other hand, some behavior classified as mental illness
seems to apply to quite functional, if annoying, people. How could
Hollywood or Sunday morning television media-punditry thrive
without personalities who exhibit the symptoms of Histrionic
Personality Disorder (301.50)? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. Is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the
center of attention.
</P>
<P>
   2. Interaction with others is often characterized by
inappropriate sexually seductive or provocative behavior.
</P>
<P>
   3. Displays rapidly shifting and shallow expression of emotions.
</P>
<P>
   4. Consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to
self.
</P>
<P>
   5. Has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and
lacking in detail.
</P>
<P>
   6. Shows self-dramatization, theatricality and exaggerated
expression of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   7. Is suggestible, i.e., easily influenced by others or
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   8. Considers relationships to be more intimate than they really
are.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Without doubt, psychiatric treatment is a life-saver for many
deeply troubled children. But given the manual's broad definitions,
many parents might question whether every adolescent is
certifiable, at least on occasion. Consider the criteria for
Oppositional Defiant Disorder (313.81): &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1. Often loses temper.
</P>
<P>
   2. Argues with adults.
</P>
<P>
   3. Actively defies or refuses to comply with adults' requests or
rules.
</P>
<P>
   4. Deliberately annoys people.
</P>
<P>
   5. Blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   6. Is touchy or easily annoyed by others.
</P>
<P>
   7. Is spiteful or vindictive.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Clinicians treating severe drug and alcohol addiction work
within a wide range of diagnostic categories. The following also
qualify as ``substance related disorders'':
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine Intoxication (305.90): Recent consumption of caffeine
in excess of 259 mg (e.g. more than 2-3 cups of brewed coffee ...)
</P>
<P>
   Nicotine Dependence Disorder (305.10): Tolerance to nicotine is
manifested by the absence of nausea, dizziness and other
characteristic symptoms ....
</P>
<P>
   Nicotine Withdrawal Disorder 292.0: Abrupt cessation of nicotine
use ((resulting in)) dysphoric or depressed mood; insomnia;
irritability, frustration or anger; anxiety; difficulty
concentrating; restlessness; decreased heart-rate; increased
appetite. &LR;

   Despite the comedy spin that Jack Nicholson put on it in the
movie ``As Good as It Gets,'' obsessive-compulsive disorder can be
debilitating. But the DSM's diagnostic criteria also suggest that
the fretful workaholic with that desktop Snoopy figurine collection
may require treatment for Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder
(301.4):
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. Preoccupied with details, rules, lists, order, organization
or schedules to the extent that the major point of the activity is
lost.
</P>
<P>
   2. Shows perfectionism that interferes with task completion ...
</P>
<P>
   3. Is excessively devoted to work and productivity to the
exclusion of leisure activities and friendships ...
</P>
<P>
   4. Is over-conscientious, scrupulous, and inflexible about
matters of morality, ethics or values (not accounted for by
cultural or religious identification).
</P>
<P>
   5. Is unable to discard worn out or worthless objects ... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Many critics argue that the DSM often reflects political and
cultural biases. For example, homosexuality was listed as a mental
illness as recently as 1968 in DSM-II, which defined it as Sexual
Deviation (302):
</P>
<P>
   &UR; This category is for individuals whose sexual interests are
directed primarily towards objects other than people of the
opposite sex, toward sexual acts not usually associated with coitus
.... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The gay-rights movement ultimately pressured the American
Psychiatric Association to eliminate homosexuality as a mental
disorder in subsequent editions of the DSM. Cross-dressing males,
however, are still categorized as mentally ill if they exhibit the
signs of Transvestic Fetishism (302.3):
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Over a period of at least 6 months in a heterosexual male,
recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or
behaviors involving cross-dressing. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The manual suggests that additional clinical research be devoted
to treatment for those who suffer from the symptoms of Identity
Problem (313.82):
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Uncertainty about multiple issues relating to identity, such as
long-term goals, career choice, friendship patterns, sexual
orientation and behavior, moral values and group loyalties. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Other diagnoses shift with the cultural climate. The latest DSM,
for example, eliminated one controversial diagnosis that was
previously applied to women suffering depression, Self-Defeating
Personality Disorder (301.90):
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. Chooses people and situations that lead to disappointment,
failure or mistreatment ...
</P>
<P>
   2. Rejects or renders ineffective the attempts of others to help
him or her.
</P>
<P>
   3. Following positive personal events (e.g., a new achievement),
responds with depression ...
</P>
<P>
   4. Incites angry or rejecting responses from others and then
feels hurt, defeated or humiliated (e.g., makes fun of spouse in
public ...).
</P>
<P>
   5. Rejects opportunities for pleasure, or is reluctant to
acknowledge enjoying himself or herself. ...
</P>
<P>
   6. Fails to accomplish tasks crucial to his or her personal
objectives. ...
</P>
<P>
   7. Is uninterested in or rejects people who consistently treat
him or her well ...
</P>
<P>
   8. Engages in excessive self-sacrifice ... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The DSM suggests that denial can be itself be a symptom of a
disorder called Non-Compliance with Treatment (V15.81):
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The reasons for noncompliance may include discomfort resulting
from treatment (e.g., medication side-effects); expense of
treatment; decisions based on personal value judgments or religious
or cultural beliefs about the advantages and disadvantages of the
proposed treatment; ((and)) maladaptive personality traits ... &LR;

RUSSIANS GO TO POLLS AMID CYNICAL BACKDROP

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Few influential Russians avoid publicity the way the
oil baron Roman Abramovich has. The 33-year-old head of Sibneft,
one of Russia's largest oil companies, avoids interviews, rarely
makes appearances, and stays out of public politics.
</P>
<P>
   Abramovich keeps such a low profile that when he was identified
last spring as a close confidant to President Boris N. Yeltsin's
family, it took the Russian media weeks to find a photo of him.
Little is known about his positions on any issue.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem strange that such a man is running for public
office. But when Russians elect a new lower house of parliament
Sunday, Abramovich will be the candidate to beat in the frozen and
impoverished far east region of Chukotka, a place he visited for
the first time just a month ago. Chukotka is across the Bering
Strait from Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Abramovich's candidacy in Chukotka is symbolic of the broader
meaning of the elections for the State Duma. For many of those
running, the race is not about issues or ideology, it is about
self-interest. Abramovich is one of a number of candidates asking
not what they can do for Russia, but what the Duma can do for them.
</P>
<P>
   The central problem for Russia's political and business elites
is how to guarantee their positions when the Yeltsin era that saw
their rise to prominence ends with next summer's presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``At stake are vast financial resources, political power, and,
ultimately, the Russian presidency after Boris Yeltsin retires next
year,'' said Don Jensen, a former US diplomat in Moscow who is
deputy director of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   That cynical backdrop leaves little room for the ideals that
democratic elections are supposed to stand for _ public debate,
freedom of choice, popular rule through political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates _ such as Abramovich and another Kremlin
insider, Boris Berezovsky, who is running for a seat in an obscure
North Caucasus district _ seem intent on gaining the immunity from
prosecution granted to members of the 450-seat Duma. They, and
dozens of lesser-known businessmen, feel they need immunity just in
case Russia's next rulers decide they profited from political ties
to gain their holdings illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The larger battle is between two coalitions of politicians,
business and regional leaders over who will succeed Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   One coalition, known both as Unity and ``The Bear,'' is centered
on the Kremlin and backed by popular Prime Minister Vladimir Putin;
the other, Fatherland-All Russia, known by its Russian initials
OVR, draws its power from former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov
and Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   Although several other parties are expected to place candidates
in the Duma, and the Communists are expected to win the most seats
with a quarter of the vote, they are seen as almost irrelevant in
the race for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate the Communist leader, Gennady Zyuganov, has no
chance to win a presidential vote. The clear favorites are Putin,
who has seen his approval rating rise to more than 70 percent as
the architect of Moscow's popular campaign against Islamic rebels
in Chechnya, and Primakov, who announced his long-expected
candidacy for Russia's top post Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Duma campaign, Kremlin-controlled state media,
including Russia's most-watched television network, have launched
daily attacks against Primakov and Luzhkov aimed at making sure OVR
does not top the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Michael McFaul of Stanford University said the
Unity-Bear bloc was created by Berezovsky and other Kremlin
strategists with the purpose of providing them with a loyal
following in the Duma. The Bear's top three candidates are
Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu, who has a leading role in
Russia's campaign in Chechnya; Olympic wrestling champion Alexander
Karelin, who lacks the charisma of his American counterpart,
Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, but has not lost a wrestling
match in nine years; and retired general Alexander Gurov, a former
top crime-fighting official.
</P>
<P>
   This image, which McFaul called ``a Russia that fights,''
appears to have appealed to the public. Against the backdrop of the
popular war in Chechnya and Russia's increasingly confrontative
stance toward the West, Unity's rating has risen dramatically.
Polls now suggest the bloc will win about 18 percent of the vote
for a strong second-place showing behind the Communists; OVR has
slipped to a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   Unity-Bear has no party program, no grass-roots membership, and
no unifying principle other than the need to place second in this
election. Shoigu has said he will not serve in the Duma, and
Karelin is most likely to take leave of his parliamentary duties to
compete in next summer's Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Abramovich is only loosely connected to the Unity-Bear bloc. He
is running in one of the 225 single-candidate districts spread
across the country's nine time zones, where half the Duma's seats
are being contested (the other 225 seats will be divided among
parties that win more than 5 percent of the vote.)
</P>
<P>
   Election and security officials said a large number of
candidates who allegedly have committed illegal acts or have ties
to organized crime are seeking election in the single-candidate
districts. Political analyst Sergei Markov said many of the laws
created to make the campaign fair, such as rules limiting campaign
financing, ``are violated by almost everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Abramovich has been accused of no crime, though critics question
the murky privatization deal that left him in control of Sibneft.
Luzhkov and Primakov have vowed to investigate such sell-offs and
prosecute wrongdoers. Abramovich may be thinking about how to
protect himself.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Chukotka, which suffers from shortages of food
and fuel in the winter, the main problem for its 43,984 voters is
how to survive. Abramovich's campaign offers to take on this
problem in exchange for a seat in the Duma. Sibneft has reportedly
supplied $5 million in fuel to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no doubts that he will get his mandate,'' said
Nikolai Petrov, political analyst for Moscow Carnegie Center.
</P>
<P>
   But will Abramovich actually serve as Chukotka's representative
in the Duma?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' he said in his first public interview, published
this month in the daily newspaper Vedomosti. Abramovich was asked
whether Chukotka's location, far from the Moscow press, had
anything to do with his decision to run there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In part, yes,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just getting to Chukotka to cover the Abramovich
campaign is difficult. Commercial flights are sporadic and
frequently canceled for lack of fuel. There are no road or rail
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Because Chukotka is a border zone, Russian authorities require
special permission for anyone who wants to visit. When the Globe
inquired in November, regional officials said a correspondent could
obtain permission to go there in ten days. Later, that was extended
to 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there's no reason to come,'' a local official said.
``Could you please move back your plans . . . until after the
elections?''

C. VANN WOODWARD, STORYTELLER AND HISTORIAN OF THE SOUTH, DIES AT
91
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ark., Tenn., N.C., S.C., Ga., Fla., Va., Md.)   (jw) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   C. Vann Woodward, whose gifts of scholarship, storytelling and
social conscience combined to produce some of the most readable and
respected histories of the South, died Friday at his home in
Hamden, Conn. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward regarded himself as an old-fashioned storyteller who
was as interested in the literature and culture of the South as he
was in its turbulent economics and politics of the 19th and early
20th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   He took to heart the lessons of literature. He conceded that his
interest in Southern writers would lead only to charges that he was
nothing more than ``a chronicler with a weakness for
history-with-a-purpose and ... the still graver charge of being a
historian, dedicated to fact, who is inspired by fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   He had little use for historians who produced tomes that lacked
the grace he found in literature. ``History as currently written is
bland, banal or philistine'' and ``often morally obtuse, ethically
archaic and intellectually insipid,'' he told the American
Historical Association in 1970, as he completed a term as its
president.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that history should not be confused with the natural
sciences and was not comfortable with its being regarded as a
social science. He thought of it as an art form rooted in
scholarship. He saw history as a field where ``the main excitement
of the adventure comes in the writing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The historian-detective,'' he said, ``does not really know how
it will all turn out until he reads what he has written.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said he found much truth in Willie Stark, the central
figure in Robert Penn Warren's novel ``All The King's Men,'' and he
found it, too, in such inventions of William Faulkner as Lucas
Beauchamp, Sam Fathers, Joe Christmas, Dilsey, Charles Bon and the
Snopeses.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's most famous work, ``The Strange Career of Jim Crow''
(1955), became a best seller and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. called it the ``historical bible of the civil rights
movement.'' Some critics regarded it as the single most influential
book ever written on relations between the races in the United
States. The book documented that segregation, as expressed by Jim
Crow laws, did not appear until well after the end of slavery, at
the beginning of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably no scholar contributed more toward the civil rights
movement than he did,'' said the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian
William McFeely, who was a student of Woodward's at Yale University
in the 1960s. ``Though he lived more of his life out of the South
than in it, he remained Southern, and he remained loyal to the
South. He always defended it; he just wanted to rid it of its worst
problem, its racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward also wrote a biography called ``Tom Watson: Agrarian
Rebel,'' which concerned itself with a man not so far removed from
Willie Stark. Tom Watson lived from 1856 to 1922, served in
Congress in the late 19th century and became the quintessential
Negrophobe, representing what Woodward called ``the most ignorant,
bigoted and reactionary forces in American life.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was first published in 1938, then republished in 1955.
Critics credited it with dispelling some myths about the Southern
populists who thrived after Reconstruction and demonstrating that
the standard image of the South, as portrayed in most books _
somewhere between ``Gone With the Wind'' and the Uncle Remus
stories _ was not to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Another noteworthy book was ``Origins of the New South'' (1951),
in which Woodward detailed the negotiations that took place been
Southern Democrats and Northern Republicans after the presidential
election of 1876, in which an electoral crisis occurred and
Rutherford B. Hayes was eventually declared the winner. Southerners
agreed to his being seated as the nation's 19th president only
after he agreed to withdraw federal troops from the South, where
they had been since the end of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Although sharply critical of segregation and of the Southerners
who believed in it, Woodward nevertheless loved the South and
gloated in the 1960s when racial problems erupted in the North,
resulting in riots and the burning of neighborhoods in certain
cities. ``It was time those bastards up North had their time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Comer Vann Woodward was born Nov. 13, 1908, in Vanndale, Ark.,
the descendant of a clan that in the years before the Civil War had
been a major slave-owning family. His mother was the former Bessie
Vann, whose family had come to Arkansas generations before from the
Carolinas via Tennessee. They created the village of Vanndale
(population 300), which contained a motley collection of
Confederate veterans, former slaves, tenants, sharecroppers, a
generous supply of creditors who preyed on farmers who were down on
their luck, and quite a number of Negrophobes. ``The Faulknerian
repertoire was all represented,'' Woodward would later recall.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Hugh Alison Woodward, was a public school
administrator in Arkansas who later ran a small college in Georgia.
The family, according to Woodward, was of ``modest status.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward spent the first 10 years of his life in Vanndale, then
moved with his family to Morrilton, about 50 miles north of Little
Rock. Among his most vivid memories there were of a Ku Klux Klan
gathering at the Methodist church, after which the Klansmen, in
full regalia, left a donation with an obliging minister. But no
less vivid was his memory of Charles Hillman Brough, a former
governor of Arkansas who denounced lynchings, and of his uncle
Comer McDonald Woodward, who also spoke out against racism.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward went to public school in Morrilton, where he was
something of an outsider. To win acceptance, he went out for the
football team. He did not like the game very much but played it
well.
</P>
<P>
   In 1924, after his graduation from high school, he enrolled in
Henderson-Brown College in Arkadelphia, Ark., a small institution
run by Methodists. It was there that he suffered one of his rare
intellectual defeats. He thought that he should concentrate in the
laboratory sciences but he failed chemistry. He did rather well,
however, in expository writing.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Within two years he tired of Arkadelphia and transferred to
Emory University in Atlanta, in part because his uncle Comer
Woodward had become dean of students. Emory bored him almost as
much as had Henderson-Brown. He took a history course and found it
so bad that he decided he would take no more history courses as an
undergraduate.
</P>
<P>
   He liked Atlanta, however, because it provided him with an
opportunity to meet black intellectuals, among them John Hope
Franklin, an educator, and J. Saunders Redding, an actor, dramatist
and essayist.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he received his bachelor of philosophy degree in
1930, Woodward had become a social activist determined to reform
the South. He wanted the South to be understood, but mostly he
wanted it to change. He began teaching freshman English at Georgia
Tech and reviewing books for The Atlanta Journal.
</P>
<P>
   He had seen New York City once as an undergraduate. But now he
decided to go there and study. In 1931 he enrolled at Columbia
University and signed up as a candidate for a master's in
sociology. After what he described as ``two full and shattering
days,'' he transferred to political science ``in desperation.'' He
still had no degree in history.
</P>
<P>
   While in New York he met Langston Hughes, whose poetry he
admired, and got to know the principals of the Harlem Renaissance.
At one point, he thought he might write his thesis on W.E.B. Du
Bois. But according to Woodward, Du Bois heard his Southern accent
and backed off.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1930s he vacationed in Europe and visited Paris,
Moscow and Berlin. A Communist took him to a section of Berlin
where he could see the plight of workers, Woodward recalled, and he
gaped and said, ``My God, man, they've got electric lights and
running water.'' They were much better off, he thought, than the
sharecroppers he knew in Arkansas and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Atlanta and teaching at Georgia Tech in 1932, he
involved himself in the case of Angelo Herndon, a young black
member of the Communist Party who was accused of inciting an
insurrection. Woodward raised money for Herndon, but soon found
himself without a teaching job. He long maintained that he lost his
job because of a budget cut, but others saw his dismissal as
punishment for his sympathy for Herndon.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward earned his Ph.D. in history from the University of
North Carolina in 1937. Before World War II started, he taught
briefly at the University of Florida and the University of
Virginia. During the war, he served as a Navy lieutenant. His war
experience led to the publication of ``The Battle of Leyte Gulf''
in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1961 Woodward taught at Johns Hopkins University,
and in 1961 he became the Sterling professor of history at Yale, a
position he kept until his retirement in 1977. Over the years, he
also lectured at the University of London and at Oxford University.
</P>
<P>
   Among his other books was ``The Burden of Southern History''
(1960). He also edited many books, including ``Mary Chestnut's
Civil War,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1982. There were also
numerous articles for the American Historical Review, Johns Hopkins
magazine, The American Scholar, The New York Times Magazine and
other publications.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's wife, the former Glenn Boyd MacLeod, and their son,
Peter, predeceased him. There are no immediate survivors.

DOCUMENTARY SHOWS PITFALLS IN PROCESS OF SEEKING ASYLUM  
 (ATTN: N.J., N.Y.) 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Chinese man follows the instructions of the smuggler who
brought him to the United States and concocts an improbable story
of fleeing his country's one-child policy, not realizing that the
actual religious persecution he experienced as a Christian in his
homeland would qualify him for asylum here.
</P>
<P>
   A Romanian woman tormented for her membership in the Anglican
Church is asked, as a test of her credibility, to name its top
prelate. The officer hearing her asylum request decides her answer
is incorrect and denies her application. She, not he, is right, it
turns out.
</P>
<P>
   A young Algerian woman describes how Islamic militants
threatened to kill her and members of her politically prominent
family. But her translator relays only the skeletal outlines of her
tale to the official who could, but ultimately does not, grant her
political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only God knows how it will end _ and them, of course,'' the
woman whispers sadly when the door closes behind her after the
unfortunate interview.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every day, behind closed doors in antiseptic government
offices around the country, people like these tell their tearful
stories of fear and torture in an attempt to win asylum. Some
accounts are found to be genuine. Others _ indeed most, in the view
of some veteran interviewers _ are contrived.
</P>
<P>
   But the official sifting of truth from lies, of the worthy from
the unworthy and the plausible from the unconvincing, is a process
that the public never sees, and so cannot evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   Now a documentary by two independent New York City filmmakers,
Shari Robertson and Michael Camerini, has opened an extraordinary
window into what happens at the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's asylum offices, where only one in five applicants is
granted sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The film, called ``Well-Founded Fear'' and scheduled for
broadcast on PBS in June, provides the first close-up picture of a
secretive and discretionary system that can capsize or renew each
applicant's life.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary has been screened so far only for immigration
and human rights lawyers and for INS employees, who have reacted
with consternation and commiseration to its searing picture of how
one of the nation's most sensitive policies is administered.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in 1998 at the immigration service's New York City and
Lyndhurst, N.J., asylum offices, the documentary reveals for the
first time a process that is based on law and on instinct and that
operates, as one asylum officer puts it, like Russian roulette.
</P>
<P>
   Some applicants, like the fragile-looking Chinese poet who weeps
as he recalls his vicious beatings in prison, sail through the
ordeal, their stories so horribly authentic that officials seem
thankful for the opportunity to offer them asylum. ``I am
humbled,'' says Gerald, the asylum officer who reviews the case of
the poet, Huang Xiang. ``What a life.''
</P>
<P>
   Other applicants, desperate for a chance to remain in the United
States, are failed by their own or government-provided translators,
who, as the filmmakers demonstrate with subtitled translations,
carelessly leave out chunks of their stories.
</P>
<P>
   Or they pay the price of poor preparation or outright
fabrication by the people who prepare their applications.
</P>
<P>
   One Salvadoran man shown in the film comes to the interview
thinking he is applying for a visa extension. A Chinese man,
relaying a story that seems badly memorized, tells an incredulous
asylum officer that he was forcibly sterilized back home and would
be sterilized again if deported back to China.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of what they come to believe is extensive fraud, the
asylum officers interviewed by the filmmakers talk frankly about
their slide from trust to exasperation to hardened cynicism about
the stories they hear, all the while worrying that they have
crossed a line between honest skepticism and burnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has got their own threshold,'' says an asylum
officer named Peter, who muses that an applicant's chance of
winning asylum depends on who hears the case. ``Everybody's got
their own interpretation of the law. Everybody's got their own
willingness to believe or to suspend disbelief.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people may associate the U.S. asylum program with such
high-profile humanitarian efforts as the airlift of Kosovo refugees
and the open-door policy for Soviet Jews. But the rescue of
refugees is separate from the asylum program, which covers people
who have been able to make it to the United States to ask for
sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, between 35,000 and 52,000 people have
asked for asylum annually. The numbers fluctuate according to world
events and wars that send people fleeing in search of a haven, but
have dropped significantly since the INS stopped handing out
automatic work permits to every asylum seeker.
</P>
<P>
   To win the prize of asylum, with its benefits and promise of
future citizenship, applicants must show that they cannot return
home because of ``persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution
on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a
particular social group, or opinion.'' And they must prove that
they cannot count on protection from persecution by their home
government.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The chief decision makers are the asylum officers, although
since 1996 immigration agents at airports and other border points
may decide that asylum seekers do not have a credible fear of
persecution and turn them away. The decisions of both the officers
and the agents are reviewed by immigration judges.
</P>
<P>
   Most people get to make their case. But few _ about one in five,
historically _ are approved.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the year ending Sept. 30, 1998 _ the latest for which the INS
has statistics _ asylum officers conducted about 42,000 interviews
and granted about 9,900 applications. The remainder were either
denied outright or referred to immigration judges for hearings. The
judges that year granted 35 percent of the referred requests. At
the borders, all but 14 percent of the 3,000 people who asked for
asylum upon arrival were admitted so they could press their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Asylum officers are supposed to depend on State Department human
rights reports, which describe the conditions in an applicant's
country, to determine if the fear of persecution is reasonable.
They are supposed to confirm the identity of the applicant. But at
that point their task shifts to a more subtle plane of intangibles
and gut feelings in determining if someone is credible.
</P>
<P>
   It is a human system, says one asylum officer to the filmmakers,
and reflects the personalities of the people who operate within it.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Meissner, the commissioner of the INS, said she agreed to
the filming to showcase a much-heralded reform of the asylum
process in 1995 that aimed to expand the training of asylum
officers and judges, reduce the backlog of old cases and attack
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film shows how murky some of these issues are and,
ultimately, how there's almost no black and white,'' said Mrs.
Meissner, who saw the documentary in October and has since shown it
to groups of asylum officers around the country as a training tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most things in life,'' she added, ``are in the gray areas.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE
</P>
<P>
   The asylum seekers shown in the documentary, however, see their
stories as clear-cut. They say they have suffered and will suffer.
Few seem to understand that that is often not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Maria, the Romanian woman who suffered religious
persecution, is frustrated by her interview with the asylum officer
whose questions were meant to establish whether she really was what
she claimed to be: a member of the Anglican Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do these asylum officers want?'' she says to her lawyer.
``They want somebody to cry? To beg them?''
</P>
<P>
   Another Romanian, a man named Cristian, says he was a
much-hounded dissident during the reign of the Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu. But while he was waiting for his case to be
heard, the dangerous regime he fled was toppled and an elected
government took its place.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after nearly a decade in the United States, he is an
articulate and successful businessman. But does he still have a
well-founded fear of persecution? The asylum officer says no.
</P>
<P>
   Farida, the Algerian woman, is tripped up by the translator's
failure to explain that her family is specifically targeted for
persecution, and leaves the asylum office totally unaware that the
point was not made.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me the whole thing hinges on whether her family has been
singled out,'' says Gerald, the asylum officer. After the
interview, he is not convinced. ``I don't see what she has to be
afraid of, above and beyond what every poor soul in Algeria has to
be afraid of,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The most provocative vignettes captured by the filmmakers focus
on the men and women like Gerald who do the interviews and make the
decisions. Many admit freely that the resentment they feel at being
lied to by some applicants may carry over to subsequent cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, another Chinese,'' mutters an officer named Jim, who later
rolls his eyes during an interview with a man who cannot seem to
get his story straight. Others joke about the similarity of
people's tales of persecution. ``You get lots of, `I helped pull
down the statue of the former dictator,''' says one officer.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin, a young asylum officer, says he tries to remember that in
some countries, many people could well have had the same experience
of torture or abuse. Over time, he adds, he has developed a keener
instinct for sniffing out lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I hope that's what it is, but it could be the fact
that you're just very jaded,'' Kevin says. ``Then if I admitted I
was jaded, wouldn't I then be saying I shouldn't be doing this job?
So I say that I have a more acute understanding of credibility
issues.''

SPORTS COLUMN: MORE NATIONALISM IN THE NEXT CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Mass., Calif., Canada, England)  (jw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a scary thought for you as the century runs out: Sports
could get even more intense in the years stretching ahead of us.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be the money and it won't be the booze and it won't
even be the 'roid rage coursing in fans and athletes alike. It will
be that ancient specter of flags and anthems and national colors
painted across distended faces, celebrating a 21st century
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The future was revealed last year in two most unlikely sports _
women's soccer and men's golf. Americans discovered they could get
to like watching their very own Michelle Akers chasing down a
wayward soccer ball or their very own Justin Leonard tapping a golf
ball into the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have had a taste of jingoism in the arena. We have
been reminded of this at the end of the century as everybody has
compiled lists, most of them gratuitous and arbitrary, but some of
them reminding us of where we have been. Many people agree that the
greatest team of the century was not some perpetual champion like
the New York Yankees or the Boston Celtics or the Montreal
Canadiens or John Wooden's basketball teams from UCLA, but rather
the improbable amateurs who won the gold medal of ice hockey at the
1980 Winter Games, the so-called Miracle on Ice.
</P>
<P>
   That epic upset inspired American men and women to persevere in
a sport that had been seen as the province of Canada and northern
Europe. Men like Mike Richter and women like Cammi Granato dreamed
of winning a gold medal for their country, which, in fact, Granato
would do 18 years later in the first women's medal play in Nagano,
Japan. The amateurs of 1980 paved the way for American men to
realize they could play in the National Hockey League, and also
paved the way for the sprawl of hockey downward into the Sun Belt,
not necessarily the best thing for the Canadian heritage, but
probably inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Dream Team of the 1992 Summer Games, with
Charles Barkley beating up on some poor Angolan, but the Yanks were
so overwhelming in basketball that there was no suspense, and no
carry-over.
</P>
<P>
   As the century ebbed, however, America learned to love its
national teams. Even baseball fans, watching the Phillies torment
the Mets on a sunny afternoon during the September pennant race,
could get the basic mathematics of Ryder Cup golf: Europe had been
ahead, 10-6, but the scoreboard in Philadelphia revealed a
match-by-match turnaround that saw the Americans prevail, 14{-13{.
</P>
<P>
   While it was happening in Brookline, Mass., American fans and
American golfers celebrated so raucously that you could have asked
the question, ``Who do you people think you are, soccer
hooligans?'' _ the ultimate American sporting epithet.
</P>
<P>
   Many golf fans were horrified at the emotions of other fans in
the gallery. Fans hurled insults at the European players, hissed
the universal word ``choke'' at them.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Yanks roared back into contention, even the most
staid American players, who normally contain themselves during
their personal triumphs, danced on the fairways and sprayed
champagne in full view, while Europeans golfers were still trying
to compose themselves for a putt.
</P>
<P>
   It was not pretty, but it was the future. Nationalism sells. The
Olympics are supposed to be about individuals, but tell it to the
fans who tossed national flags to Carl Lewis and Jackie
Joyner-Kersee after their epic events in Los Angeles or Seoul or
Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   In British soccer, people talk about ``our lads,'' as if the
national team is some village team gone off to play the next
village.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer fans in Brazil and Italy, cricket fans in the West Indies
and Pakistan, rugby fans in Australia and South Africa and hockey
fans in Russia and Canada have long known the peculiar agonies of
nationalist sports. Now, even isolated and insular Americans were
catching on.
</P>
<P>
   Women did as much for nationalism as men. The United States has
always resisted the low scores and the foreign sounds and the
intricate maneuvers of soccer. This is hardly the fault of the game
itself, not when billions of fans all over the world totally grasp
the subtleties.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point was that Americans refused to commit to soccer
because ``our lads'' did not play it very well, by American
standards. When the Yanks came back without a victory from Italy in
1990 and from France in 1998, it was a national version of the film
``The Last Picture Show,'' with the hapless high school football
players being teased by the townspeople.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, that all changed _ and maybe forever. The American
women were so captivating and so good that they caught America's
attention, at least for a few weeks. The American team finished
ahead of teams from China, Norway, Brazil, Nigeria and Germany. The
play was spirited and physical but far more offensive and positive
than the defensive, bitter tactics of the men's game.
</P>
<P>
   Those were not all soccer insiders packing into the Rose Bowl
and the other top-of-the-line stadiums across the country. They
were Americans with money being attracted by charisma and success.
Even with an African-American goalkeeper protecting the goal, the
team was generally a white and yuppified version of the country,
but that will change.
</P>
<P>
   In a shrinking world, where everywhere is only a click of the
television zapper or the Internet mouse away, nationalism thrived
on elegant fairways and lush soccer pitches. America could learn to
love cheering for ``our girls'' and ``our lads.''  &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Grover Washington Jr., the jazz saxophonist and
composer, producer and arranger of jazz fusion, died Friday night
in New York City after taping four songs for a television show. He
was 56.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center on
West 59th Street following his collapse after he performed the
songs for ``The Saturday Early Show'' on CBS. He died of an
apparent heart attack, said Patricia Mannino, the office manager of
Washington's Philadelphia record company, G W Jr. Music Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his jazz-rock fusion style, which was occasionally
criticized for sounding too commercial, Washington had just
released his most recent album, ``Prime Cuts,'' two weeks ago, Ms.
Mannino said. A classical album he recently completed will be
released shortly, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was born on December 12, 1943, in Buffalo, N.Y. His
father was a tenor saxophonist and his mother sang in a choir. He
started playing the saxophone when he was 10. He attended Temple
University's School of Music and the Wurlitzer School of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Washington began his professional career as a saxophonist with
the Four Clefs from 1959 to 1963, then completed a two-year stint
in the 19th Army Band. He played with Don Gardener's Sonotones in
1967 and 1968, and made many recordings with Randy Weston, Bob
James, Ralph MacDonald, Eric Gale and Don Sebesky.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, he began his solo career, specializing in soprano and
alto saxes. Washington's big break came in the early 1970s when a
record producer named Creed Taylor commissioned a set of pop-funk
arrangements featuring the saxophonist Hank Crawford. Crawford
failed to show up for the recording session, and Washington was
called in as a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting album, ``Inner City Blues,'' helped break down
barriers between pop music and jazz, sold hundreds of thousands of
copies, and helped launch Washington's solo career.
</P>
<P>
   He released about 30 solo albums, five of which were gold:
``Come Morning,'' ``Mr. Magic,'' ``The Best is Yet to Come,''
``Then and Now'' and ``Time out of Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   He won a Grammy Award for best fusion jazz performance, vocal or
instrumental, in 1981 for ``Winelight,'' his platinum album, which
included the hit single ``Just the Two of Us,'' with Bill Withers.
Between the album and the single, ``Winelight'' appeared on five
record charts at once: soul singles and LPs, pop singles and LPs,
and jazz LPs.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Palmer of The New York Times called Washington ``one of
the most successful exponents of popjazz.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He stretches his tunes with extended improvisations, and he
exercises an impressive degree of control over the development of
each performance in terms of drama and dynamics,'' Palmer wrote in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Washington also produced three albums for the group Pieces of a
Dream, and the first album of music from ``The Cosby Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a record player playing in here all the time,''
Washington said, pointing to his head in a 1989 interview with The
Associated Press. ``I'm listening to everything. The screech of
brakes. Three or four people walking and you can hear their heels
clicking. Railroad tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Philadelphia for more than 30 years, Washington
was a great fan of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team and
dedicated a song on ``Winelight'' to basketball great Julius
Erving. He occasionally played the national anthem before games for
the 76ers games and the Philadelphia Eagles football team.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he played at President Clinton's 50th birthday
celebration at Radio City Music Hall, and he played in a jazz and
blues jam with the president in 1993, along with jazz greats Herbie
Hancock and Winton Marsalis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grover Washington was as versatile as any jazz musician in
America, moving with ease and fluency from vintage jazz to funk,
and from gospel to blues to pop,'' Clinton said Saturday. ```I want
to be able to visit any genre,' he once said, `and converse there
with my horn.' Grover Washington did exactly that, and
beautifully,'' the president added.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is survived by his wife, Christine Washington, of
Philadelphia; a son, Grover Washington III, of Los Angeles, and a
daughter, Shana Washington of Philadelphia.

OUTDOORS COLUMN: TOPOGRAPHICAL MAPS CAN ALL BUT TELL YOU WHERE TO
PUT YOUR FEET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are still stumped on what to get a friend for the
holidays, you might consider a map. It can be a visual delight, an
essential navigational tool or a fascinating historical record.
</P>
<P>
   If your friend's digs are sufficiently commodious, consider a
wall map. The maps produced by Raven Maps and Images are not only
beautiful, they also give you the big picture of your state or
region at a glance. The company's offerings include maps of 43 of
the 50 states, one for North America and another for the entire
United States (minus Alaska and Hawaii), plus world maps.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these maps unusual is their almost three-dimensional
appearance, achieved through elevation tinting and shading that
enables the viewer to instantly see the contours of the land. The
tinting ranges from greens for the lower elevations, through
yellows, tans, browns, grays and, finally, white for the highest
points. The shading is applied as if the sun were in the northwest.
Those skilled in reading standard topographic maps can swiftly
discern mountains, hills and valleys, and river drainages, but it
is a knack that takes much time to master.
</P>
<P>
   Raven's state maps, which include major highways, cities, towns,
lakes and rivers, put landforms in perspective with minimal reading
effort. They would be an ideal gift for many, but are large in
order to accommodate their exquisite detail _ so large that you're
not going to find room for one of them in many places in the
average home. My Raven map of Maine, which measures 36 inches by 48
inches, will hang on the staircase wall of my family's lodge on
Maine's Salmon Stream Lake, alongside several topographic maps that
zero in on the specific area.
</P>
<P>
   Raven maps vary in size. The New York state map is 43 inches by
59 inches; the map of Alaska is 35 by 64; that of the lower 48
states is 37 by 58. On the other hand, Massachusetts, Connecticut
and Rhode Island are combined in one map that measures 32 by 36.
Obviously, the maps of some of the larger states and of the lower
48 are on a more condensed scale than the others.
</P>
<P>
   State maps cost $25, or $45 for a laminated version.
Information: (800) 237-0798 or http://www.ravenmaps.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Raven maps are not, of course, for those who wish to find their
way on foot across the wilderness. For that, one's minimal needs
are a decent compass and topographic maps drawn to a suitable
scale. A topo map on a scale of 1:25,000, on which one inch equals
slightly more than 2,000 feet, is ideal, although maps with a scale
of about one inch to a mile are satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Costing only a few dollars each, topos also make good gifts, but
you have to know the precise area that the person _ whether hiker,
hunter or canoeist _ plans to visit. Such maps come in so-called
quadrangles and you might, for example, need to buy four of them to
embrace the area your friend intends to explore.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you get lucky. I have before me the Errol (New
Hampshire) quadrangle of the topographic map series put out by the
U.S. Geological Survey, and it so happens that its northern half
completely covers the area where I frequently go deer hunting. It
is on a scale of 1:62,500, approximately an inch to the mile. The
map measures 17 by 12 inches, and most of my hunting is confined to
a four-mile-square area. A deer hunter poking along in the
boondocks rarely covers more than a few miles each day; if he does,
he's moving too fast. He obviously will need fewer maps than
someone who plans hiking or canoeing explorations of a region.
</P>
<P>
   Topo maps can often be had from sporting goods shops or
bookstores. In general, however, such stores only carry maps of
their own state or adjoining ones. Maps of the United States east
of the Mississippi can be obtained by writing Branch of
Distribution, U.S. Geological Survey, 1200 South Eads St.,
Arlington, Va. 22202, and requesting a map index for the state you
are interested in, or by ordering online at
http://mapping.usgs.gov/.
</P>
<P>
   If all this map searching seems too time-consuming, you could
make a gift of a Sierra Club paperback, ``Land Navigation
Handbook'' by W.S. Kals. It is a first-rate text on using map and
compass, and it lists many map sources. An equally good text is
``Be Expert with Map and Compass'' by Bjorn Kjellstrom (Scribners).
</P>
<P>
   Some maps can also lead one on a delightful journey to centuries
past. ``Mapping Boston'' (280 pages, MIT Press, illustrated, $50)
edited by Alex Krieger, David Cobb and Amy Turner, is a big,
handsome, brilliantly executed blend of old and new maps and
related essays on the social, political and physical history of
Boston as well as that of U.S. cartography. Included are old and
rare maps from Norman B. Leventhal's unmatched collection.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising historical nuggets are constantly encountered in
``Mapping Boston,'' such as the information that large areas of the
city were built on land created by dredging muck from tidal flats
or salt marshes that once teemed with shellfish, ducks and rail
birds.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the book's publication, exhibits from Leventhal's map
collection run through Jan. 14 at the Boston Public Library and the
New England Aquarium. &QL;

UNIONS PREPARE FOR TALKS, BUT NOT INJUNCTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Less than a week after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani used a
court injunction as one of the major tools in his efforts to avert
a transit strike, leaders of municipal labor unions across New York
called the order excessive and heavy-handed, but declined to
predict whether the city might brandish a similar weapon against
them.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction, issued by Justice Michael Pesce of state Supreme
Court in Brooklyn hours before the transit workers' contract
expired, was remarkable both for its breadth and the severity of
punishment it promised if the union violated the court's order and
the state Taylor Law by going on strike.
</P>
<P>
   It brought what appeared to be overwhelming force to bear
against city transit workers, who were threatening to walk off the
job, providing significant fines against the union's members.
</P>
<P>
   Several municipal labor unions, including the city's largest,
District Council 37, are scheduled to start negotiations with the
city soon. While some of their leaders criticized Pesce's
injunction as overly harsh, none of them said they were actively
preparing to face a similar order in their own negotiations with
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're preparing for an injunction, seeing as
we've never gone on strike,'' said Arthur Cheliotes, president of
Local 1180 of the Communications Workers of America, whose contract
covering middle managers expires on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Cheliotes said the injunction was typical of
Giuliani, adding: ``The law was there, but he wanted to add to it
and show people how brutal he could be. It's typical that he would
want to overwhelm people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Saunders, president of District Council 37, the largest
union of municipal employees, whose contract also expires at the
end of March, said he was preparing for talks with the city, but
added that he hoped the negotiations would not reach the point
where an injunction like the one Pesce issued would be necessary.
``I'm treating this process very seriously and honestly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of
Teachers, whose contract is up in November, said she did not expect
to have to fight a similar injunction, but added that lawyers for
the union were nonetheless trying to determine whether it was
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``You already have in place penalties for unions if they go on
strike,'' she said. ``But the mayor's injunction, well before
deadline and before anyone decided to go on strike, sought
penalties that were so overreaching and punitive that they chilled
free speech.''
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the injunction was to bar the 33,000 members of
the Transportation Workers Union from going on strike under
provisions of the Taylor Law, a state statute that forbids job
actions by public employees. But the injunction also prohibited
transit workers from advocating a strike, and made punishable a
host of preparatory steps, including holding a vote on a strike or
``causing, instigating, encouraging or condoning, or lending
support or assistance of any nature to any strike.''
</P>
<P>
   The order the judge signed was broadly drafted by the city's
lawyers, and worded so that it covered not only members of the
transit union but also anyone else acting on behalf of union
members or in concert with them. It also imposed fines of $25,000
on anyone who violated the order.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The injunction provided much tougher sanctions than a second one
issued by Pesce the same day, at the request of the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, which also barred a strike.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping provisions and penalties of the city's injunction
baffled civil libertarians and union supporters. They asserted that
the right of union members to express their thoughts about a strike
should be constitutionally protected, particularly given that the
union was poised to begin what could be a tough period of internal
debate about the new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Schwartz, a lawyer for New Directions, a dissident
faction in the union, said the injunction set up a situation in
which people could advocate the overthrow of the U.S. government _
a right protected by law _ but not advocate a strike by subway
motormen and bus drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredibly broad, sweeping prohibition on transit
workers,'' Schwartz said. ``It creates a police state with respect
to the question of supporting public employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Goodman, a spokeswoman for Michael Hess, the city's
corporation counsel, said she could not discuss whether the
Giuliani administration would consider seeking a similar injunction
as a bargaining tool in upcoming talks with its workers.
</P>
<P>
   But given the apparent success of the strategy in recent
negotiations, some labor experts said they would not be surprised
if the city unsheathed at least the threat of another injunction in
the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason why such an order would not be sought again,
said Joshua Freeman, a professor of history at Queens College. ``I
can't think of any equivalently severe restraining order in
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one labor leader, Brian McLaughlin, president of the
New York City Central Labor Committee, seemed somewhat eager for
the mayor to attempt to use a court order in the upcoming
negotiations _ if only for the chance to defeat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we look forward to other contracts, you have to realize
that we didn't get to see the whole injunction process played out''
because a strike was averted, he said. He called the order a
decision that could have been challenged.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The overall crime rate in New York City declined
again this year, but a rise in homicides and several other factors
have led some criminologists to question whether the decade-long
descent is about to bottom out.
</P>
<P>
   Through Dec. 12, crime had fallen by 8 percent over last year,
police statistics show. But during that same period, the homicide
rate, which is often viewed as a bellwether for larger trends in
crime, surged by 8 percent. It was the first increase in any major
crime category in the city in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Although crime dropped last year in every one of the city's 76
police precincts, four of them showed increases this year, as local
burglary or robbery rates began to rebound. In one neighborhood,
the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, the number of major crimes
grew by 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many criminologists believe that crime trends are reliably
cyclical, and several predicted that New York, given the patterns
in its history, was at the end of the downturn. ``I am leaning
toward the conclusion that we have reached bottom,'' said James
Alan Fox, the Lipman professor of criminal justice at Northeastern
University in Boston. ``The years of double-digit declines may be
over.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's police officials, whose efforts have helped push
crime to 30-year lows, rejected any suggestion that the tide was
turning. They said they had battled such skepticism and pessimism
since the early 1990s, when many people kept insisting that a safer
city was a pipe dream long after the crime rate had begun to
plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Although the homicide rate rose this year, the officials said,
158 American cities still rank above New York in crimes reported
per capita, including tourist destinations like Orlando, Fla. And,
they said, the broad pattern of decreases in other offenses is
evidence that the rise in homicides is an aberration, not a
portent.
</P>
<P>
   For example, robberies fell by 9 percent and assaults declined
by 10 percent this year. Overall, crime remains down 55 percent
compared with the rate six years ago, a statistic that many credit
with fueling New York's booming popularity with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``People every year keep saying, `It's bottomed out. It's
over,''' said Edward Norris, the Police Department's deputy
commissioner for operations. ``But we still find areas where we can
improve on. I don't know when we will bottom out, but I don't think
we have hit the bottom yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, crime is now dropping even faster than it is in New
York. Overall, crime was down 10 percent nationwide for the first
six months of this year, the latest period for which comparative
data are available, according to the Department of Justice,
compared with 7.7 percent in New York City. Crime in New York state
declined by 9 percent during the same six-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, homicides are still down nationally, by 13 percent,
although they are up slightly in cities with populations greater
than 1 million, like New York. Although criminologists cautioned
against making sweeping predictions from a year's worth of data,
some suggested that New York's small rise in homicides might
foretell a national trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big cities led the way when the numbers went down, and
they also may be leading the way as the numbers plateau,'' Fox
said.
</P>
<P>
   But several other criminologists said they shared the Police
Department's optimism, largely because of a continuing decline in
auto theft in the city, which fell by 10 percent this year and is
considered a very reliable indicator. ``Auto theft is reported well
because the insurance company won't pay you unless you file a
police report,'' said Thomas Reppetto, president of the Citizens
Crime Commission, a private organization.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also noted that the social forces that drove the crime
wave of the late 1980s _ a stagnant economy and a raging epidemic
of drug use that lured many unemployed young men into the violence
of the narcotics trade _ have not resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   But other criminologists said that even without such social
accelerants, crime in the city has historically spiraled up and
down in fairly regular cycles. In the last three decades, for
example, the crime rate has peaked in 1972, 1979 and 1990, and then
slumped for several years before rising again, said Jeffrey Fagan,
a criminologist who teaches at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are not at the bottom now, we are likely to hit the
bottom very soon,'' Fagan said. ``You can't have unending crime
increases or decreases, and the past is the best predictor of the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In neighborhoods where crime has rebounded, it is often the
sight of resurgent street-corner drug traffic, not any statistical
abstraction, that has local leaders concerned. In the 7th Precinct,
for example, which covers the Lower East Side, serious crime is up
8 percent, including a 16 percent rise in robberies and a 26
percent increase in burglaries. City Councilwoman Margarita Lopez
said tenant groups began noticing an increase in street-corner drug
sales about 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there is a connection between this activity and the
rise in burglaries and the robberies,'' she said. ``There is no
question to me.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many criminologists say it is difficult to draw conclusions from
changes observed in a single year's data. Fox, for example, said
his conclusion would remain a hunch until more time unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting patterns becomes particularly difficult when the
period being studied is already somewhat unusual, as the last nine
years have been. Seldom has crime in the city declined as sharply
as it has in the past few years, criminologists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at how much difficulty economists have with the stock
market,'' said Eric Monkkonen, a historian of crime who teaches at
the University of California, Los Angeles. ``And this is much more
complicated than the stock market.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This year, overall crime has declined in every borough, as well
as in the subway system and in public housing. Citywide, rapes went
down by 16 percent and burglaries declined by 13 percent. Shooting
incidents increased by less than 1 percent, even though gun arrests
were down by 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the homicide rate rose for reasons that police officials are
still exploring. Officials estimate the homicide count will rise to
680 by year's end, compared with 633 last year, although the number
is still nowhere near the toll of 1990, when the city suffered
through a record 2,245 homicides.
</P>
<P>
   Norris said the homicide rate appeared to have been driven up by
an increase in gang activity, a surge in domestic violence and a
downturn in aggressiveness by the police after the shooting of
Amadou Diallo, which provoked criticism that too many officers were
brutish on patrol. The department has tried to address these
concerns with initiatives, the commissioner said, like expanding
domestic violence units in some precincts and forcing more officers
to work weekends, when much of the alcohol-related domestic abuse
occurs.

WORKER KILLED AND SEVERAL SICKENED BY FUMES AT TIMES SQUARE CLUB
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gas fumes in a popular supper club in Times Square
left one night-shift employee dead Saturday and four others
hospitalized, as the police closed off the block, evacuated a
building next door and checked manholes and nearby basements for
evidence of carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   Five rescue workers were also overcome by fumes. Three of them,
who entered the club, were hospitalized and two were treated and
released. Another club employee who had difficulty breathing was
treated at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters dragged the five unconscious custodial workers from
the Laura Belle restaurant at 120 W. 43rd St. shortly after 10 a.m.
as the owner and several workers from the day shift stood in the
faint winter sun and wept. The men, believed to have ranged in age
from their late 20s to early 50s, were still wearing their white
janitor uniforms when they were put onto stretchers and raced to
waiting ambulances. One worker, believed to be in his 50s, was in
cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead on arrival at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. Another worker was in critical
condition and on a ventilator, a hospital spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was probably caused by carbon monoxide from an
unknown source, possibly aggravated by a noxious mixture of
cleaning fluids, including ammonia, window cleaner and bleach, said
Thomas Galvin, a Fire Department division chief. Mixing such
cleaning fluids, sometimes haphazardly, is common practice by
custodial workers around the city, said a fire department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Police detectives said they were also investigating whether
there were any safety violations that might have contributed to the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The men were first discovered by Gary Marcius, an employee who
arrived Saturday morning to lock up the night club and found the
five workers unconscious on the basement floor, one in a small
office. ``I go downstairs, and all of them lay down,'' Marcius
said, his eyes welling with tears. ``I say, `What is it?' but
nobody talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcius said that he then raced upstairs and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   The first fire truck arrived three minutes later, and
firefighters entered the building. When they saw the men, they
immediately called for backup and the street quickly filled with
emergency vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The men were dragged from the basement and onto stretchers, as
paramedics pumped oxygen into their mouths. Foam bubbled from the
mouth of one worker, his white uniform twisted and half off. A Fire
Department spokesman said that a combination of the gas and the
cleaning solvents might have caused that reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were believed to have been in the building for at
least 11 hours before they were discovered, Galvin said. The level
of carbon monoxide was extremely high, he added. In some parts of
the basement, firefighters recorded levels in excess of 500 parts
per million; a safe level is 35 parts per million.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Clare's Hospital, nursing administrator Lito Bathan said
two of the victims were being transferred to Jacobi Medical Center
in the Bronx for deep oxygen treatment in a hyperbaric chamber. One
victim, in his late 20s, was unconscious but in stable condition.
Another, in his mid-30s, was alert and in good condition, Bathan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of St. Clare's emergency medical technicians were briefly
overcome by the fumes, but were treated at the hospital and
released.
</P>
<P>
   Two other emergency medical workers and a police officer were
overcome by fumes and began feeling ill while in an ambulance
taking a victim to the hospital, said Paul Iannizzotto, a Fire
Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The two emergency medical workers were taken to New
York-Presbyterian Hospital, where they were hosed down as a
precautionary measure. They were in stable condition with
respiratory problems, according to one of their co-workers. The
Fire Department did not release their names.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Iannizzotto said it was unclear whether the emergency workers
and police officer had become ill from having entered the club.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Laura Belle, a woman who identified herself as an owner,
Joanne O'Connor, looked stunned as she was surrounded by
firefighters and plainclothes officers. ``I left here at 2 a.m.,''
and everything was fine at that time, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison emergency workers searched the surrounding
underground access points, manhole covers and the basements of
nearby buildings, but detected no natural-gas leaks, emergency
workers at the scene said.
</P>
<P>
   Onlookers and workers from an Airborne Express shipping office
next door, and from other nearby businesses watched yet another
disaster unfolding on what they said was a star-crossed block. ``We
thought maybe 4 Times Square was coming down again,'' said Erik
Sundve, referring to the scaffolding collapse and other accidents
that bedeviled the Conde Nast building while it was under
construction a few doors down.
</P>
<P>
   His co-worker said, ``It's a block of gridlock now.'' At that
moment, the police began to clear the street of onlookers and
Sundve was forced back into his company's docking area and the
metal door of the garage was lowered.
</P>
<P>
   As rescue workers carried out the personal effects of the
workers, emergency workers wearing masks rolled in portable gas
gauges and police officers evacuated the staff of Airborne Express.
</P>
<P>
   One Airborne Express delivery man, William Smith, wheeled a cart
of packages out, shaking his head as he headed up the Avenue of the
Americas. ``The police, they just made us get out,'' he said.
``They said it was poison gas and we had to evacuate the building.
I am too nervous,'' he said. ``I just wanted to get out of there.''

CO-OP BOARDS NAVIGATE ADMISSIONS-BIAS MINEFIELD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christie Bunnell, a board member of a six-unit co-op
in Chelsea, became concerned recently when an apartment in her
building was listed for sale. Since all the residents of the
building are middle-aged adults, she said, and since the building
has ``acoustically challenged walls,'' the shareholders wanted a
purchaser who was ``childless and middle-aged'' like them.
</P>
<P>
   But while friends in other co-ops advised Ms. Bunnell that co-op
boards can reject a purchaser ``for any reason, as long as the
reason isn't stated,'' her fellow board members garnered different
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some members feel that to reject an applicant could expose us
to a lawsuit for discrimination,'' she said. ``One member even said
we could be held personally liable. It seems like we're in a whole
new ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, co-op lawyers say, the laws against discrimination on
the federal, state and local levels, along with several court cases
that have applied those laws, have resulted in a sea change in
co-op admissions practices.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes, lawyers and brokers say, are a hesitancy on
the part of boards to reject applicants they know belong to
protected groups, and an increasing number of rejections based on
stricter financial requirements before the board even meets or
interviews the applicant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now get a telephone call before any one of our client
boards rejects anyone,'' said Stuart Saft, a Manhattan co-op lawyer
who is also chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and
Condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Saft explained that until fairly recently, the prevailing belief
was that co-op boards could reject an applicant ``for any reason or
for no reason at all'' _ as long as the ``any reason'' didn't
include unlawful discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, he said, the operative rule seems to be that
boards that reject applicants for any reason other than one that
can be clearly articulated _ generally, one that relates to the
applicant's finances _ could easily find themselves on the wrong
end of an expensive and time-consuming lawsuit. And such a lawsuit,
Saft said, could indeed result in members being held personally
liable for damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason this is happening is because a lot of boards were
going too far and rejecting too many applicants,'' Saft said,
referring to the perception that co-op boards, particularly in
Manhattan, were becoming increasingly fussy about whom they would
accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the pendulum is swinging too far in the other direction,''
Saft said. ``And we've been warning boards for years that this
would be the end result.''
</P>
<P>
   While anti-discrimination laws relating to housing have been on
the books for decades _ the New York State Human Rights Law, for
example, was adopted in the mid-1940s _ co-op boards have generally
been insulated from claims of discrimination by virtue of the fact
that they traditionally _ and legally, lawyers say _ decline to
provide a rejected applicant with the reason for the rejection.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of security provided by that practice, however, was
turned on its head in May 1997 when a Manhattan jury in a federal
race-discrimination case awarded $640,000 in damages to an
African-American man and his wife. The jury found that the couple's
application to sublet an apartment in a co-op was rejected by the
co-op's board for reasons that the jury believed were racial.
</P>
<P>
   The case, filed under the Federal Fair Housing Act by Gregory
and Shannon Broome against Beekman Hill House Apartment Corp., a
co-op at 425 East 51st St., stunned co-op boards and their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The shock was not just because the award was the largest housing
discrimination award anyone could remember, or because the case
shattered the notion that a board's admissions decisions were
virtually bulletproof. The stunning part of the decision was that
several board members were held to have personal liability for a
significant portion of the damages, money that ultimately came out
of the board members' own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, co-op lawyers say, boards have become increasingly
skittish about skirting the boundaries of anti-discrimination laws
when making decisions about sublets and admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that is constantly being discussed between
co-op boards and their lawyers,'' said Arthur Gussaroff, a
Manhattan co-op lawyer. ``The fact is, fortunately or
unfortunately, when you put together all of the federal, state and
municipal anti-discrimination laws, you end up with a whole bunch
of categories of people who are protected from discrimination in
housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gussaroff explained that taking all three levels of
anti-discrimination laws into consideration, it is now illegal to
discriminate against a prospective purchaser _ or renter _ based on
the individual's race, creed, color, national origin, physical or
mental disability, gender, age, sexual orientation, marital status,
citizenship, occupation, and whether children will _ or may in the
future _ live in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gussaroff said, since everyone alive is arguably a
member of several protected categories, boards have to be extremely
careful about what questions they ask an applicant and how those
questions are asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can ask applicants if they are 18 or older, but you can't
ask how old they are,'' he said. ``You can't even ask the applicant
to submit any document that reveals the applicant's age _ something
I consider a little nutty.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gussaroff said, while boards can ask how many
people will be living in an apartment, they should not ask the ages
of the occupants or whether some are children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can ask about criminal convictions, but you can't ask
about arrests,'' he said. ``And you can ask a convicted applicant
about drug use, but you better be careful, because drug use can be
regarded as a disability. And here's a good one: You can't ask a
person if he's a citizen, or even if he has a legal right to remain
permanently in the United States, because that can be used as the
basis for a claim for discrimination based on national origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Gussaroff said that the only information a board can inquire
about with confidence _ both on the written application and during
a board interview _ relates to the individual's financial status,
creditworthiness and history as a tenant or shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Questions about an applicant's financial condition are safe,''
he said. ``But ask one stupid question about something you
shouldn't ask about, and it will blow you right out of the water.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even boards that ask all the right questions, Gussaroff said,
are vulnerable to charges of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that every time a board turns somebody down, if the
person who was rejected is a member of a protected class, there's a
good chance the co-op is going to end up getting hit with a
discrimination complaint,'' he said. ``And the minute someone files
a discrimination complaint, the burden shifts to the board to prove
that the reason the person was turned down was not
discriminatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Braverman, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that because of
the difficulty involved in establishing proof of discrimination _
which essentially involves proving what is in someone else's mind _
state and federal courts have adopted a rule that reduces the
burden on the part of the person bringing the suit.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that under what is known as the ``discriminatory
effect'' standard, a complainant need only show that he is a member
of a protected class, that he applied for and was qualified to rent
or buy the housing, that he was denied the opportunity to do so,
and that the housing remained available thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person is considered qualified if he is financially able to
rent or buy the unit,'' Braverman said, adding that once that
hurdle is surmounted, the burden shifts to the co-op, or the rental
landlord, to prove that the reason for the rejection was not
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be indelibly noted by every board member that
subjective explanations will be viewed by the courts with
considerable skepticism,'' he said, explaining that rejecting an
applicant for subjective reasons such as ``being confrontational''
or ``being litigious'' could be deemed a pretext for
discrimination, thereby exposing the board and individual members
to liability.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Weinstein, a lawyer who is vice president of the Council
of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that a similar
``shifting of the burden of proof'' occurs with complaints filed
with the New York City Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein added that since New York City's human rights law
affords even broader protection than its state and federal
counterparts _ prohibiting, for example, discrimination based on an
individual's occupation _ and since an individual does not need to
hire a lawyer to file such a complaint, the possibility of being
subject to such complaints presents the most immediate concern to
boards in the city.
</P>
<P>
   And while the commission is required to investigate all
complaints it receives before determining whether ``probable
cause'' exists for the filing of a formal complaint, Weinstein
said, there is a perception among co-op lawyers that the commission
finds probable cause even in cases that do not warrant such a
finding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the findings of probable cause have been absurd,''
Weinstein said, citing as an example a case he was involved with in
which the New York City Commission on Human Rights found that
probable cause existed in the case of an individual who believed he
was rejected because of his national origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turndown was clearly financial in nature,'' Weinstein
said, explaining that the applicant _ who intended to purchase the
apartment for cash _ could produce no financial records or proof of
employment documenting his ability to pay monthly maintenance
charges. Notwithstanding that, Weinstein said, the commission found
that a casual remark made by one of the board members constituted
probable cause for the issuance of the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The remark?
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `What a lovely accent you have,''' Weinstein said.
```Is it Scottish or Irish?'''
</P>
<P>
   And while the complaint was ultimately dismissed, he said, the
encounter cost the co-op several thousand dollars in legal
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson here,'' he said, ``is that every interaction
between a board and an applicant is potentially dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Wills, deputy commissioner of the law enforcement
bureau of the New York City Commission on Human Rights,
acknowledged that under current law, many individuals are covered
under the umbrella of protection provided by anti-discrimination
laws. He added, however, that the commission finds probable cause
for only a small percentage of the complaints it receives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, during the 12-month period between July 1,
1998, and June 30, 1999, the commission received a total of 160
housing discrimination complaints. Of that number, he said, the
commission found that probable cause existed in only 8 percent of
the complaints that were filed. The remaining cases, he said, were
either dismissed, withdrawn or settled as a result of mediation
conducted by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a delicate balancing act that goes along with making
these kinds of determinations,'' Wills said. ``And rejecting an
applicant who happens to be in a protected class could very well
result in a lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Wills explained that there are two types of discrimination:
lawful discrimination and unlawful discrimination. A clear example
of lawful discrimination, he said, might be a situation in which a
co-op board rejects an applicant who does not meet the building's
financial requirements. A less clear example, he said, might be a
board that rejects applicants that the board believes will make
excessive noise.
</P>
<P>
   In such a case, he said, it might be lawful for a board to
discriminate against a drummer who insists that he or she must
practice in the apartment for several hours a day _ even though it
would be unlawful to discriminate against a person solely because
of occupation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Wills said, it would be unlawful for a co-op
board to assume that just because an applicant has children, those
children will be a source of excessive noise in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discrimination is all about making choices,'' he said. ``And
the wrong choices are what society has deemed to be unlawful.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the relatively small number of complaints that
resulted in formal charges being filed by the city's Human Rights
Commission, co-op lawyers and real estate agents said that the mere
possibility that a co-op board could be named in such a complaint
has resulted in changes in the way boards handle admissions
requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolute paranoia on the part of some boards in the
city,'' said Weinstein, the lawyer. ``And ironically, it may result
in more turndowns by boards rather than less.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein explained that since boards are precluded from
discriminating against applicants on the basis of age, there is a
likelihood that some boards will compensate for their inability to
make informed decisions regarding whether an individual will be a
responsible or troublesome neighbor by adopting more rigid
objective criteria.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, it is possible that boards that would
rather not have young college students living in an apartment
bought by the students' parents could impose a requirement that
every shareholder must be a full-time occupant of the apartment and
a financially responsible individual in his or her own right.
</P>
<P>
   Such a requirement, he said, would permit a board to reject an
applicant in cases where a parent is purchasing an apartment for a
college-age child, where a child is purchasing an apartment for an
elderly parent, and when anyone is purchasing an apartment for use
as a pied-a-terre.
</P>
<P>
   Saft of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums
said that the ``paranoia'' referred to by Weinstein could also
result in some boards accepting applicants with borderline
financials if the board learns that the applicant is a member of a
protected class.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, the likelihood of that happening increases
with the filing of a complaint with the Human Rights Commission,
because the prospect of being put in the position of having to
prove that a board is not discriminating is itself distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boards will bend over backward to avoid a confrontation with
the commission,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Associates, a
Manhattan brokerage company, said he had noticed another change in
co-op admissions practices in the last couple of years. ``It's
certainly true that we've seen an increase in pre-interview
rejections,'' Peters said. ``And an increase in rejections at any
time makes our job harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters acknowledged that boards also appear to be increasingly
skittish about rejecting an applicant who is a member of a
protected class when the board is aware of such information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boards are clearly pretty sensitive now about being sued,'' he
said. ``So any time I have a member of a protected group come in as
a customer, I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Schechter, a Manhattan lawyer who conducts seminars for
board members on the issue of discrimination, said that while
boards still have the ability to reject ``unsuitable'' applicants,
they must make sure that their definition of what is considered
suitable is not really a concealed basis for engaging in unlawful
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a practical perspective, if a rejected applicant asserts
a claim of discrimination, the board is probably going to have to
articulate the reason for turning him down,'' Schechter said.
``That's why I advise boards to deal with objective characteristics
_ like finances _ rather than with subjective feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Gussaroff, who is the lawyer for the Coordinating Council of
Cooperatives, an organization of Mitchell-Lama and other
government-assisted co-ops, said that he actually provides training
to boards he represents, to ensure that they will make as few
mistakes as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cholst, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that while it is
impossible to prevent a rejected applicant from bringing a
discrimination lawsuit, there are steps that can be taken by boards
to discourage such suits.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Cholst said, boards should conduct extensive
background screening of an applicant before interviewing the
person.
</P>
<P>
   Such pre-interview screening, he said, should include inquiries
about the applicant's finances, creditworthiness and history as a
tenant or shareholder _ including investigations into whether the
person has a propensity for violence or for flouting the rules, or
has a history of initiating vexatious litigation. To the extent
possible and legal, Cholst said, a criminal background check should
also be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   If the screening and investigation produce legitimate reasons
for rejecting the applicant, he said, the applicant should be
rejected before an interview is even conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more difficult for a person to prove discriminatory
conduct when he has never met the board members and they have never
met him,'' Cholst said.

NEW YORK'S PLAN FOR UNINSURED SENDS NATIONAL MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis.)   (jw) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By agreeing Friday on a $1 billion plan to provide
health insurance for a third of the state's 3.2 million uninsured,
Gov. George Pataki and legislative leaders sent a message to the
rest of the country that the state was trying to regain its stature
as a leader on health care policy.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the decade, the number of New Yorkers
without health insurance was below the national average; now, at
the end of the decade, it exceeds it. Roughly 20 percent of New
York's residents under 65 do not have insurance; the national
average is 16.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders have been locked in a battle with the
governor for most of his term over Medicaid, medical education
costs and, more recently, how to use the state's portion of a
settlement with tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   But in an 11th-hour deal a few weeks before the expiration of
state laws governing health care financing, all camps cobbled
together an ambitious plan aimed at the state's uninsured
population _ from poor families with members who work sporadically
to self-employed people who cannot afford premiums to low-income
workers whose employers do not provide insurance but who make too
much to qualify for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, believed to be the largest effort in the nation to
help the uninsured, will be paid for in large part through a
55-cent increase in the tax on cigarettes and part of the $500
million in tobacco settlement money over 3{ years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in other states and in Washington who have been
challenged to deal with swelling ranks of uninsured will be all but
sure to watch New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``By taking such a significant step,'' said James Tallon,
president of the United Hospital Fund, a philanthropy group, ``New
York sends a clear signal to Congress that there is a groundswell
on the state level to get on with taking care of the problem of the
uninsured. It has put the subject back on the agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on Saturday, the final terms of the deal were still being
negotiated. But the plan calls for roughly $600 million _ part of
which is federal matching funds _ to pay for a program to insure
poor families.
</P>
<P>
   The program, Family Health Plus, will be modeled on a state
program for children, Child Health Plus. That program arose from a
move by Congress in 1997 to create the Children's Health Insurance
Program, which provided $24 billion over five years and a total of
$39 billion over 10 years to states to insure children. New York's
program has so far enrolled 415,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   Both the family program and the children's program are, in
essence, a newfangled form of Medicaid in which states subsidize
health insurance and the federal government gives matching money,
but the list of doctors that participants have to choose from is
substantially broader than that of the Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   The family program would expand those benefits on an sliding
scale; the poorest of families would pay no premiums and others
would pay premiums based on their income to participate in managed
care plans. Families earning up to 150 percent of the poverty line
_ like a family of four with an annual income of $25,000 or less _
could receive coverage without paying premiums. Childless single
people earning up to 100 percent above the poverty level would also
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The program is significant in several ways. Most importantly, it
provides coverage for single people and those without children, a
far less politically attractive group of people than mothers and
their young children. At the same time, it raises the likelihood
that more children will be insured, because parents are often
reluctant to enroll their children by themselves or are unable to
maneuver the system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The best way to get children insured is to get the whole
family insured,'' said Joe Leean, the secretary of Wisconsin's
Department of Health and Family Services. That state's program,
BadgerCare, which started in July, is considered the earliest model
of how states can insure large populations of people. It is a
prototype for New York's plan, although in Wisconsin the number of
uninsured was far lower, at 330,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, until a child gets sick, parents don't think their kid
needs insurance,'' Leean said. ``Furthermore, once we have parents
working, it is their own health that secures the family well being.
And if you get them all in, in the same clinic or HMO, it works
much better. We think the success is bearing out.'' The goal was to
reduce Wisconsin's ratio of uninsured residents to 4 percent from 6
percent, but Leean said the goal had already been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Uninsured Americans are far from homogenous. Many of them work
and therefore do not qualify for Medicaid, but are either not
offered insurance by their employers or opt not to incur the
expense of the premiums. Others are self-employed and either cannot
afford insurance or also chose to not pay for it, crossing their
fingers and praying against calamity instead.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the working uninsured _ roughly three-quarters of
New York's uninsured _ has resulted from exploding insurance
premiums in recent years and employers' efforts to reign in costs.
The New York plan addresses these people through two components.
</P>
<P>
   It will pay about $220 million to subsidize small businesses
that want to offer insurance to employees, most likely through a
group purchasing plan in which many companies get together to
bargain for a good rate from an insurance carrier. Group purchasing
plans have met with mixed success in other states, depending
largely on the rates that groups are able to negotiate from
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Through another component, the state has earmarked about $180
million to help reduce premiums for people who wish to buy their
own private plans. Those who usually choose to buy individual
plans, which are very expensive, often have chronic illnesses and
know they must incur the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The state has also set aside about $120 million for a pilot
program to insure home health care workers, who often go for long
periods without work assignments and therefore are often uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   The state will be most challenged in its family program in the
enrollment process. Children's health programs nationwide have
suffered low enrollment rates, largely because of complicated
enrollment procedures that stymie those who try to enroll, and poor
outreach. New York officials say that using community groups to
assist people in assessing their eligibility and signing them up
will be a crucial part of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest lesson we learned with children is that creating a
program and expanding eligibility does not ensure by itself that
people are going to get covered,'' said David Sandman, a program
officer at the Commonwealth Fund, a large, private philanthropic
organization in New York. ``It needs to be augmented by intensive
outreach and enrollment efforts. Our research shows that two-thirds
of children who are uninsured do qualify for either Medicaid or
Child Health Plus chips but are not signed up.'' The state recently
announced a $10 million addition to the Child Health Plus program
for community-based groups to help with enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Further, some critics of government programs worry that they can
backfire _ if too many people sign up for subsidized health
insurance, they argue, businesses may be dissuaded from offering
their employees benefits. As a result, eligibility requirements
must be carefully monitored.
</P>
<P>
   But if New York can make a substantial dent in its uninsured
populace, it may be able to polish its image as a health care
leader, an image much tarnished by bitter labor disputes, exploding
costs and a high number of those without coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If New York were to do these things,'' Sandman said, ``it
would be a major step to restoring its position as a leader among
states in ensuring insurance for working adults who have nowhere
else to turn.''

 &HT;    Laettner still trying to find his place
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christian Laettner has felt like an outsider in Detroit,
especially on offense, and he's voiced his concerns, which did not
go over well with the Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to get it going (Tuesday at Phoenix for a
season-high 26 points), but it seems like you have to start yelling
and barking your name to get some plays for you out there,'' he
said, ``and I don't think that's the way it should be. I don't like
feeling like I have to be overly aggressive like, `Give me the
ball, I want the ball,' to get the ball. You shouldn't have to play
basketball like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Laettner has been accused of being nonchalant on the court
before _ in Minnesota and Atlanta. Now, maybe, it seems he has come
to understand that quality players demand the ball when it does not
come their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started yelling for the ball and demanding it a little bit.
But I don't believe that and I never bought into that _ that you're
ready to play or you're going to have a good night if you're
demanding the ball. It's never the way I played in college, and
it's still not the way I like to play. It seems like it's the
players' fault because the coaches are giving us a lot of freedom
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Laettner is averaging 11 shots a game in 30 minutes, compared to
Grant Hill's 20 in 38 minutes and Jerry Stackhouse's 16 in 38.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Alvin Gentry wasn't moved. ``If he wants to use that as a
cop-out,'' Gentry said, ``then let him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick vs. George
</P>
<P>
   Nick Van Exel thought he had a good relationship with Milwaukee
coach George Karl. Then Karl _ as he is wont to do _ spoke his mind
when asked about the Denver Nuggets guard.
</P>
<P>
   Said Karl: ``He's a talented player when he wants to play. But
he doesn't have an 82-game commitment. He does not have a serious
enough attitude to lead a team to a lot of success. But he can
really play on a given night. He really is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have trouble giving Nick Van Exel $70million and
thinking that's going to motivate him when he hasn't been motivated
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel responded by going for 27 points in Milwaukee as the
Nuggets erased a 16-point deficit to win. Afterward, with a chance
to blast Karl, Van Exel took a surprisingly mature approach.
</P>
<P>
   Said Van Exel: ``For a guy like him to say that after I torched
him in the playoffs before and all those things that we've been
through, and then I go to him and tell him I think he's a great
guy, I think he gets the best out of his players, I think he's a
good coach. I told him that last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him to turn around and make those remarks about me is just
typical. It's just typical. I'm not going to say anything bad about
him. I guess that's the way he feels, and I can't do anything about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   First steps
</P>
<P>
   It took a while for straight-out-of-high-school forward Jonathan
Bender to make his NBA debut. But when he did last week against
Cleveland, he impressed none other than his coach, Indiana's Larry
Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Bender, right off the injured list, played 13 minutes, going
4-for-7 with a 3-pointer for 10 points _ an NBA record for a high
school draftee in his first game. He also blocked two shots, and
generally looked comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Bird saved the game ball, which will be painted and presented to
Bender at a later date. ``I was really surprised by how well he
played,'' Bird said. ``You saw how he's going to be able to score
points in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bender: ``I had jitters at first, but once I got on the
court and took a couple of steps, it was like practice. I'm not the
type of person to get all excited by stuff. It's a game, you go out
and score, and that's the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs up
</P>
<P>
   To the Lakers' Kobe Bryant. At 21, the spectacular guard
purchased half of the Italian professional team Olympia Milano. It
is the team his father, Joe Bryant, played for in Italy. Bryant's
the first active athlete to buy such a major stake in another pro
team.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs down
</P>
<P>
   To the Los Angeles Clippers. They score just 19 points in the
first half of a debacle against the Lakers _ an NBA record for
futility. It was so bad the Lakers would not even take credit
afterward for playing quality defense. They pointed to the Clips'
ineptitude.

   Figuring the Grizzlies
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has hired the accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young to determine
the fair market value of its franchises, at a time when attendance
figures are down in most cities. The results are expected in
mid-January, and then Bill Laurie will be forwarded the league's
new terms as to how and when he can acquire the Vancouver
Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   That means the sale of the Grizzlies is very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the league believes the Grizzlies have duped their
fans and the media with inflated turnstile numbers the past few
years, but they could not fool Laurie. There were no surprises in
the Laurie camp when the Grizzlies dropped their charade this fall
and began announcing actual paid attendance without complimentary
tickets and promotional giveaways. Prior to last year's shortened
lockout season, the Grizzlies were padding their attendance numbers
by an average of 2,000 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding the Rockets
</P>
<P>
   With Charles Barkley gone and Hakeem Olajuwon on an extended
absence, the Rockets are almost blowing off the rest of the season
as a 60-game training camp. The primary goals now are to rebuild
and find out who on the roster can play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really just speeds up the process we were going to have to
go through at the beginning of the year when we wouldn't have had
Charles,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Of 16 who played in Houston last season, only Cuttino Mobley,
Bryce Drew and Matt Bullard are on the active roster.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's nod to Barkley
</P>
<P>
   Here's Scottie Pippen's take on Barkley's farewell. ``I might
send him a plant,'' Pippen said, laughing. ``I feel bad for him,
actually. But I don't know if I plan on doing anything for him. I
may give him a call, just to make him feel better ... or worse, I
don't know. I didn't want to see him end his career like that. I
wanted to see him go out as a fighter and a warrior, the type of
player he's been his whole career. Charles is a legend ... he'll be
remembered like all the great players to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Scrape off the rust
</P>
<P>
   Almost two weeks overdue, Mavericks forward Gary Trent suited up
Tuesday for the first time this season. As much as the Mavericks
desperately need Trent's rebounding and low-post scoring,
coach-general manager Don Nelson is worrying about Trent's rusty
game and the effect his return will have on Dallas' fragile
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks awful,'' Nelson said. ``Trent's very rusty.''
</P>
<P>
   Saving his job for now
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Carlesimo was all set to be fired by Golden State last
Sunday but an improbable victory over Minnesota the night before
changed the plan. General manager Garry St. Jean will take over at
some point this season unless the Warriors win something like 60
percent of their remaining games.
</P>
<P>
   Layups
</P>
<P>
   Timberwolves coach Flip Saunders denied that he and vice
president Kevin McHale talked to the Knicks about a trade for
Minnesota guard Terrell Brandon. ``No one's even really talked to
us,'' Saunders said. ... When Steve Smith sank 6 of 11 against
Seattle, he reversed a down trend in which he had gone 28-for-85
over a seven-game span, including 9-for-33 on 3-pointers. Five off
days helped after the ex-Hawk injured his right thumb.

 &HT;    Skiles private, intense
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scott Skiles took over the Phoenix Suns and made a few things
perfectly clear: His business is his business, so when seeking
personal information, don't expect any help from him. And he's
going to work extremely hard.
</P>
<P>
   The former assistant coach who had an undistinguished NBA career
has had enough of his personal life played out in the media, so
he's guarding it now with a passion. It is the same kind of passion
that he brings to the game as a coach, which has industry people
who've seen him in action expecting big things.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was born to coach,'' said Danny Ainge, whose job Skiles
took when Ainge quit Monday to spend more time with family.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles, the youngest coach in the league at 35, views his family
as the job. He was intense as a star in high school and at Michigan
State, and he remains that way. He once kicked a teammate during a
Spartans game when he did not do what Skiles thought he should. He
has cursed referees _ which makes him a prime coaching candidate _
and collected technical fouls.
</P>
<P>
   And he's proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie, I'm an intense guy,'' Skiles said. ``I
guess my whole life, whatever I'm involved in, I do it all-out. But
I prefer to keep my private life just that _ private. I always
have. I'm a private person.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that Suns general manager Bryan Colangelo said he
doesn't know Skiles that well. But he does know this much: Skiles
started protecting his privacy a few years ago after a public
divorce, custody battle and paternity case.
</P>
<P>
   His past public transgressions did not send Skiles into cover.
His college career was blemished when he was arrested twice for
drunk driving and once on a drug charge. After violating his
probation, Skiles spent 15 days in jail in his hometown of
Plymouth, Ind., a few days after being named the Big Ten Player of
the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the statute of limitations on having it not in print
anymore?'' he said. ``I was a college student, young, and I did
some stupid things. And I paid for them in a lot of ways more than
the average college student pays. That's it. I did some foolish
things a long time ago. And now I'm a grown man.''
</P>
<P>
   No one who knows Skiles is concerned about his ability to coach,
and it starts with his playing days. His 10 years in the league
between four teams were not spectacular, but he did set the record
for assists in a game with 30 in 1990 against Denver.
</P>
<P>
   When he played for Washington, he showed his coaching acumen.
``He not only told his teammates where they were supposed to be, he
used to tell the opponents when they were running a play wrong,''
said New Jersey general manager John Nash, who was GM in Washington
when Skiles played there. ``He'd tell a guy on the other team, `No,
you're supposed to cut through and go stand over there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Williams, Magic senior executive vice president, had a
chance to hire Skiles last summer, but chose Doc Rivers instead.
Still, Willliams said: ``His work ethic, his intensity, his
ferocity is unparalleled. The only guy I've come across in my 32
years I can compare him to is (Utah coach) Jerry Sloan.''

<P>
   No message from Ewing
</P>
<P>
   All this silliness about Patrick Ewing and Miami is going
nowhere. The market for 37-year-old centers making $29 million for
this season and next is nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing understands that. He simply was venting his frustration
when he suggested he might seek a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to send a message to anybody,'' Ewing said.
``I'm just trying to fine-tune my game. I believe in myself. I know
I have a lot of basketball left in me. I think the more I keep
playing, the more and more my skills will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing joked previously about being traded to Miami in the past
year, but this was the first time he sounded serious when he said
he possibly would accept a trade to another team.
</P>
<P>
   Heat cools off
</P>
<P>
   Miami ended its six-game road trip on a sour note, with
consecutive losses in Seattle and Golden State, then came home and
lost to Milwaukee. Tim Hardaway has missed 11 games with a jammed
right knee, and a return date remained uncertain heading into the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It appears only great games from Alonzo Mourning can keep the
Heat on top. Mourning averages fewer shots per game than any other
player currently ranked in the NBA's top 10 in scoring. Coach Pat
Riley said he wants Mourning to take 20 shots a game.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of that soft stuff
</P>
<P>
   Following a 21-point loss to Utah on Tuesday, in which
Washington led 44-43 at halftime, coach Gar Heard said his team
played soft. This infuriated guard Rod Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of them putting that out there,'' Strickland said.
``They're putting that out there a little too much for me. There's
nothing soft about me and there's nothing soft about anybody in
here. ... That soft stuff, he can keep that to himself. ... When we
lose we all lose together. It's everybody's fault, just like when
we win. We don't need them making scapegoats of us for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Center Ike Austin paid the price, losing his starting job.
</P>
<P>
   Layups
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird reiterated he won't change his mind about coaching
the Pacers after this season. But he admits there's one problem:
What to do with all the suits. ``One of my buddies (from Terre
Haute) was here tonight and we were talking about that,'' said
Bird, ``and I told him to come back after the season and he can
have them all.'' ... ``It was pretty tough getting up for a game
with Chicago, but they are an NBA team,'' Pacers guard Travis Best
said. ... Bulls guard Hersey Hawkins said he had 17 messages on his
cell phone when he missed his first game after 527 straight.
``There were a lot of condolences, like I'd passed away.'' ...
Orlando rookie Corey Maggette, on former Duke teammate Elton Brand,
a rookie with the Bulls: ``We talk on the phone all the time. I
think losing is getting to him. He isn't used to it.''

 &HT;    Tension in Miami blamed on media
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson took some more shots at struggling
quarterback Dan Marino after last week's 28-20 loss to the New York
Jets. Later, Johnson accused the media of creating tension between
him and his quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem that I have _ and I don't know that
national people understand quite as much as people who are living
down here _ is that every single word is dissected, is under a
microscope,'' Johnson said. ``I'm asked to analyze the game. And if
I say, 'Well, we turned the ball over and that was the turning
point in the game,' everybody says Jimmy is ripping Dan Marino,
which is not the case at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things are written and things are said, it's going to
cause some tension between us,'' Johnson said. ``But for the most
part, over the last four years, I thought that we had a good
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   After his team's third loss in a row, Johnson pointed to
Marino's two interceptions vs. the Jets as Miami's downfall.
Marino, 38, missed five games this season because of a pinched
nerve in his neck. Since returning, he has thrown eight
interceptions in a three-game span for the first time since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about the blame part,'' Marino said. ``I'm
just worried about doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat's on Beathard
</P>
<P>
   San Diego Chargers team president Dean Spanos continues to stand
by general manager Bobby Beathard, despite a growing movement to
fire him or force him to retire. Beathard, who turns 63 in January,
has been criticized for several controversial moves, including the
trade of three draft picks and two players to Arizona for the No. 2
choice in the 1998 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Bearthard used the Cardinals' pick to draft Washington State
quarterback Ryan Leaf, who has been a bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said that before and I will remain consistent. He has all
of my confidence,'' Spanos said. ``In terms of retirement? You
would have to ask him; I have no idea. I have not heard anything
along those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Beathard, in his 10th season with the team, admits the idea of
retiring crosses his mind. It hit home at a recent lifeguard
reunion, where he saw a large group of his old buddies from his
hometown of El Segundo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of all the guys there, only three of us weren't retired,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Since former Broncos quarterback Jeff Lewis has played so
sparingly for the Panthers this season, Denver will receive the
minimum compensation for him in April's draft. Had Lewis started
eight games, or played more, the Broncos could have gotten
Carolina's second- or third-round pick to complete last year's
trade. Instead, Denver will get only a fourth-rounder. ... After
spending his first 12 seasons with the Raiders, receiver Tim Brown
could be wearing a different uniform next season. Brown confirmed
that he has a clause in his contract that allows him to become a
free agent after this season. One televised report has Brown
heading back to his hometown of Dallas and signing with the
Cowboys. Dallas inquired about trading for him in each of the past
two seasons. ``I don't know what's going to happen,'' Brown said.

CLEVELAND'S LONG ROAD FINALLY LEADS TO FINLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians traveled a long and treacherous road to
sign Chuck Finley. It took them over the ruts and potholes of four
free-agent markets and an endless number of talks aimed at
generating the right trades. They were left behind in the wake of
the movement of pitchers like Roger Clemens, Pedro Martinez,
Orlando Hernandez and Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Before signing Finley last week, the Indians had struck out in
their pursuit of a string of top-line starting pitchers in the past
four years. The only one they succeeded in obtaining was Jack
McDowell, whom they signed as a free agent in December 1995, and
then he blew out his arm after one season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a combination of things,'' John Hart, the Indians'
industrious general manager, said. ``Some of it is economics, some
of it that there were more buyers than players. We just haven't
been able to land the guys we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians wanted Clemens when he was a free agent following
the 1996 season. They competed for him with the New York Yankees
and the Toronto Blue Jays. The offers were similar. Clemens said at
the time he wanted to play for a team that had a chance to go to
the World Series. The Indians went in 1997, the Yankees in '98;
Clemens, however, signed with the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   That same winter the Indians also pursued Alex Fernandez and
thought they had him. But at the last minute his wife persuaded him
to play in Miami, their hometown, and the Indians lost him, too.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1997 season, the Indians renewed their efforts to get
a top-notch starting pitcher. They discussed a trade with Montreal
for Martinez, but the Expos accepted an offer from the Boston Red
Sox. The Indians then negotiated with a trio of free agents, Wilson
Alvarez, Darryl Kile and Andy Benes, but other teams offered far
more than they wanted to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Straying off the beaten path, they looked at another kind of
free agent that winter, the Cuban defector known as El Duque. They
were one of two or three finalists, but the Indians did not feel
they had enough information to warrant the four-year $6.6 million
contract the Yankees offered him. Hernandez became just another one
who got away.
</P>
<P>
   But the one who really got away was Randy Johnson. It was the
day of the 1998 trading deadline, and the Seattle Mariners were
ready to trade Johnson, who was three months from free agency. The
Indians, thinking they were among the front-runners, were
envisioning Johnson at the head of their rotation, pitching against
the Yankees in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Houston Astros swooped in at the last minute and
snatched Johnson out of the Indians' rotation and placed him neatly
into theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at our club traditionally,'' Hart said, ``we've
either developed players or made major trades. Our forays into the
free-agent market haven't been big, except for Robby Alomar last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring Johnson would have been a major trade. That the
Indians did not get him was a major disappointment. When he became
a free agent after he pitched for the Astros in the postseason, the
Indians did not make a competitive offer for him. Nor did they for
Kevin Brown, although they liked the thought of having him. But
then, no one made a competitive offer for Brown. The Los Angeles
Dodgers gave him $40 million more than his next highest offer.
</P>
<P>
   Moving back to the trade route last winter, the Indians tried
again to get Clemens but lost out again, this time to the Yankees.
Then last July they made another deadline stab at bolstering their
corps of starters, trying for Finley and Scott Erickson of
Baltimore. Neither was traded.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Andy Ashby was traded, by the San Diego Padres to the
Philadelphia Phillies. The Indians tried for him, too, but they did
not want to relinquish the prospects the Padres wanted.
</P>
<P>
   It was their desire to hold on to their prospects that prompted
them to pay more to sign Finley for what will turn out to be $25
million for three years, bringing an end to their four years of
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate to land him,'' Hart said. ``I thought we
were out of it at the winter meetings. We were reluctant to go
beyond where we were. But as we examined our club, we kept coming
back to the feeling that Chuck was the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   It also became apparent to Hart at the meetings last week that
he was not going to be able to trade for a pitcher. The Indians
have been one of the best teams in the American League for the past
six seasons. But their experience in the opening round of October's
playoffs was embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   Finding themselves short of starters, the Indians used two on
three days' rest instead of on the usual four. Bartolo Colon and
Charles Nagy lasted a total of four innings as the Indians
squandered a two-games-to-one lead against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Finley gives the Cleveland rotation a stronger look, though how
much stronger they will have to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not advertising him as Randy Johnson or Pedro
Martinez,'' Hart said. But at least the Indians have Finley, the
proverbial bird in hand who is worth the two who never made it to
the Indians.

ZEILE LOVES NEW YORK; THE ETHICS DODGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does Todd Zeile like New York?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always wanted the opportunity to play in New York
City,'' the New York Mets' new first baseman said. ``I've always
loved the opportunity to play there when it's been against the Mets
or the Yankees. I've been there three different times in playoff
atmosphere against the Yankees. In the world of sports there's no
place that compares to New York City for an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   But does he really like New York?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have teammates who are afraid to go out of the hotel when
they get to the city,'' he said. ``I've always loved the city. I
think there's so much to do. I have children I'd love to expose to
the culture. I have great interest in the city as a whole outside
of the game of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he, like some of those teammates, ever just stay in the
hotel?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' he said. ``My representatives have been
there a number of years now, so I've been able to see the city and
the personality of the city for much more than what I initially saw
there. Julianne, my wife, who was involved in gymnastics'' _ she
was Julianne McNamara, 1984 Olympic gold medalist _ ``traveled
extensively since she was young. She helped introduce me to
different things about the city. I figured if she had no fear of
the city and there was so much out there to see and experience, I
should do it. I grew to love it. Every time there was an
opportunity to go to New York City, I couldn't wait, and I often
had my family join me there.''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't he even mind the dreaded news media the city features?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that media scrutiny is a great part of what people are
afraid of in that city,'' he said, ``but I think if you're honest,
if you tell it like it is, if you don't run from your
responsibilities, what's the problem? The key to this is stand up
and be honest with the people who try to interpret what you do and
why. I welcome the challenge. If you can have success there, it's a
different feeling than anywhere else, at least in athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   THE ETHICS DODGERS
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time the Los Angeles Dodgers portrayed themselves as
the epitome of a well-run, highly efficient, purest-of-pure
organization. It was only a fairy tale, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are not the only organization that has signed Latin
players illegally. Nor are they the only one that has been caught.
But the Dodgers were nabbed having scouted players in Cuba and
spiriting them out of the off-limits island, then lying about where
they discovered them, and now they have been caught with a gun that
spews so much smoke the city had to declare a smog alert.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Dodgers sign Adrian Beltre, their young third
baseman from the Dominican Republic, a year before he reached the
legal age of 16, but they kept obviously altered documents in their
files.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig is expected to rule on the matter Monday,
and he may allow the Dodgers to keep Beltre while issuing a heavy
fine and other disciplinary action. And he may extend the
foreign-signing ban imposed on the club in the Cuban matter, which
was supposed to end next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But if he allows the Dodgers to keep Beltre, thus avoiding an
expensive free-agent pursuit among several clubs, he will almost
certainly trigger a grievance from the players association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current inclination is to file if they don't grant him
free agency,'' said Gene Orza, the union's associate general
counsel, ``but I want to read the opinion. It may have something in
it. But it's going to have to be a very persuasive opinion for us
not to file.''

 &HT;    Neilson an upbeat Flyer
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is on a cell phone in a car doing an interview as he is being
driven from one function to another. It has been this way for a
week, ever since Philadelphia Flyers coach Roger Neilson showed his
players a clip from a Monty Python movie to loosen them up, then
broke the news to them and the world: He has cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea there'd be this much publicity over it,''
Neilson said. ``It's really getting a lot more than it deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Flyers arrived in Toronto the other day, a hotel
ballroom was set up for a Neilson news conference. The 65-year-old
coach took one look around and said, ``It reminds me of when I got
fired. Cancer is such a dreaded word. You die and get less
publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   The jokes haven't stopped, nor has Neilson's affinity for loud
ties. But reality will arrive with a cold slap Monday. After
several delays, the Flyers coach is scheduled to begin chemotherapy
treatments for multiple myeloma, an incurable form of bone-marrow
cancer. Dr. Isadore Brodsky, the chief of hematology at Hahnemann
(Pa.) University Hospital, is downplaying statistics that show
patients in Neilson's age bracket generally live five years,
saying, ``I'd put Roger's life expectancy easily beyond five years,
and even 10 or 15 years or longer. People who hear `cancer' or
`leukemia' want to assume it's a death sentence, but that's not
necessarily the case. Georges Pompidou, the premier of France,
lived with multiple myeloma for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Neilson, who hopes to be able to coach Tuesday night in New
Jersey, has received standing ovations at every turn. They stood in
Toronto when the scoreboard read, ``Roger: This cheer's for you.''
They stood in Philadelphia when the video screen showed him behind
the bench at the Flyers' first home game since the announcement. On
both occasions, he was moved to tears.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, they were talking about firing him.
</P>
<P>
   Neilson again: ``I've been getting hundreds of calls and
letters, everybody suggesting cures and telling me encouraging
stories about people who have beat cancer. All the support has been
great. It just seems like right now it's never going to end. I'm
looking forward to the time things get back to normal a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Neilson doesn't believe the Flyers' losses immediately following
his announcement was a case of his players being distracted. ``We
only lost three of our last 23 games,'' he said. ``The problem now
is every time we lost, the media is going to say the players are
distracted. That's not the case at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Neilson is scheduled to have a bone-marrow transplant in late
February or early March, which will require a three-week stay in
the hospital and three to four weeks of recovery. He could miss the
first round of the playoffs, prompting him to allude to his past
early playoff problems and joke, ``(General manager) Bob Clarke
pointed out that wouldn't be a bad idea, me missing the first
round.''
</P>
<P>
   As to his future, Neilson said last week, ``I believe God has a
plan for my life and this is part of that plan. If the plan is to
beat it or not beat it, I accept it. At least in the games up in
heaven you won't have to deal with Kris King or Tie Domi.''

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it worth it?
</P>
<P>
   In a marketing ploy between the league and players union, each
team conducts a ``skills competition'' every year, in which players
compete in a variety of areas: skating, shooting, goaltending _ the
usual. But after Florida goalie Trevor Kidd suffered a dislocated
right shoulder last week, sidelining him for at least two months,
some teams are wondering if it's a bad idea. Kidd's injury occurred
during a rapid-fire shooting drill when he went to reach for a shot
by Peter Worrell.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 6,000 students from 43 South Florida middle
schools watched as Kidd went down to the ice in agony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started skating away, and he started screaming,'' Worrell
said. ``I thought he was just fooling around. I turned back, and I
realized he was in some pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd is 13-4-2 this year and ranks among the league leaders in
save percentage (.930) and goals-against average (2.08).
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers' Scott Mellanby said, ``It's something we shouldn't
have to deal with. There's enough problems trying to stay healthy.
You want to grow the game and all that, but it's a risky thing.''
</P>
<P>
   What's Bruin
</P>
<P>
   Before Boston ended a six-game winless streak _ after a
nine-game winless streak to open the season _ a Boston newspaper
pointed out that such results often get coaches fired. It would be
hard to imagine the Bruins pushing Pat Burns out. He's probably one
of the five best coaches in the league. But Burns read the
commentary and responded the next day, ``Don't stick a fork in us
yet. The fork's getting ready to (be) stuck in me. We're not dead
yet. This is early in the season.'' The coach also put the onus on
some of his team's struggling forwards, like Jason Allison and Dave
Andreychuk. ``The guys who are going to make you win are your
offensive weapons,'' he said. ``If they don't go, I don't know how
we're going to do it. I don't care if the Lord is behind the bench
and Moses is GM, it's not going to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's Michael Peca continues to struggle with five goals in
31 games and is a minus-eight in plus-minus. Peca, a Selke Trophy
winner as the league's best defensive forward, was on the ice for
all four goals in a loss to Philadelphia. ... The latest from
Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek on rumors that he may reverse his
retirement decision with an injury possibly prematurely ending his
season: ``We'll see.'' ... New Jersey did not raise ticket prices
this season, but it failed to sell out any of its first 16 home
games, and average attendance is down about 2,000. ``The people in
charge have to be a little worried,'' goalie Martin Brodeur said.
``At first we thought it was (because of) the Yankees (competing
for fans' dollars), but the Yankees are long gone. And when you
look and see empty seats for a Rangers game, you think, `Wow,
what's going on?''' ... War of words: Toronto's Tie Domi said he
won't fight Philadelphia's Sandy McCarthy, just to teach him a
lesson for falsely accusing Domi of using a racial slur against
McCarthy in a game last year. Domi on McCarthy: ``I think he draws
pictures, but I don't think he knows how to speak. Actually, the
only words he knows how to say are `fight' and `chicken.'''

 &HT;    Faceoff with Steve Yzerman
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Yzerman, Detroit Red Wings
</P>
<P>
   _ Update: Leads Detroit in scoring with 29 points (through
Thursday), with five of his 14 goals coming on the power play.
Ranks 10th all-time in goals (606), ninth in assists (906). Leads
North American team in voting for All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   _ On former N.Y. Islanders star Bryan Trottier: ``He was my
idol. I followed him from the minute he came in the NHL. The
Islanders were an up-and-coming team, so as a young kid I started
to follow them. I just admired the way he played the game and how
he carried himself on the ice. I like the fact that he was pretty
quiet; didn't say a whole lot. I tried to kind of copy a lot of
things he did as far as the kind of helmet he wore; the way he
celebrated a goal; the way he taped his stick. I watched everything
that he did. But most of all I like the way he played.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On playing 17 seasons with one team: ``There were a couple of
occasions where it was possible that I might be traded. I think the
only thing that makes it a little bit more difficult now is a lot
of decisions are going to be based on finance, where in the past, I
don't think that was true because there wasn't such a great range
in salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On Detroit signing Pat Verbeek: ``The best thing he brings to
our team is that he is a hard guy to play against. He's gritty.
He's abrasive. The more guys you can have that are hard to play
against, it's a plus come playoff time. Abrasive guys seem to excel
when it is a tight, close game and there is not a lot of scoring
opportunities and a lot of the soft calls like interference you get
during the regular season aren't called in a tight playoff game
</P>
<P>
   _ On Dallas' post-Cup struggles: ``My feeling is they're going
to get stronger as the playoffs get closer. I don't know how they
felt coming back (after the title). But the way I felt, you've just
been through so much, with the intensity and emotion that you have
in the playoffs, and two months later you've got to turn around and
do it again. Every time a team beats you, particularly when you're
on the road, it's like the Stanley Cup playoff victory for them.
Combined with all the injuries, that's made it difficult for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Catch this
</P>
<P>
   Some goaltenders believe new restrictions on catching gloves,
which are two inches smaller this year, have left them more
susceptible to injury. There was evidence last week, when four
goalies (Phoenix's Sean Burke, Los Angeles' Stephane Fiset,
Detroit's Chris Osgood and Chicago's Jocelyn Thibault) went out
with hand injuries. ``There's no margin for error anymore,'' said
Toronto's Curtis Joseph. ``If you close your hand too fast and
catch a shot on the end of the glove, you're in trouble.'' Thibault
did precisely that on a blast by St. Louis's Al MacInnis and broke
his ring finger in two places.

   Windy City rumors
</P>
<P>
   San Jose coach Darryl Sutter did nothing to shoot down rumors
about his candidacy for the coaching job in Chicago after the
season when he spoke about his goals for the future last week: ``To
win a Stanley Cup for San Jose. After that, I don't give a
(expletive).'' So Sharks general manager Dean Lombardi did his best
to cool things, saying, he ``can't imagine'' Sutter and new
Blackhawks director of operations Mike Smith coexisting. ``They're
opposites as people and opposites in philosophy,'' Lombardi said.
``If I know anything about their philosophies, it would be like oil
and water.'' Lombardi said he and Sutter have a ``handshake''
agreement on a new contract, but that it might not be finalized
until after the season. ``He knows we want him,'' Lombardi said.
``I think he wants to be here. With nine (players) without
contracts (for next season), he's in the trenches, and the last
thing he wants is him getting a contract and them not.'' Meanwhile,
Lorne Molleken continues to act as associate coach as he stands
next to VP-GM-coach-retiree-in-waiting Bob Pulford.
</P>
<P>
   Old ways in Dallas
</P>
<P>
   The signing of free-agent forward Kirk Muller (33) and the
acquisition of defenseman Kevin Dean (30) from the Thrashers seem
to indicate Dallas, after a planned youth movement, has returned to
its old ways. But general manager Bob Gainey said, ``I wouldn't say
we've changed our focus or our plan on how we're using our younger
players. We have four younger players in the lineup right now and
had you asked me at the beginning of the season I probably wouldn't
have thought we'd have that many. This gets us more in line with
where we thought we would be as far as veterans go.'' Dean, who
admitted he could not play an expanded role with the Thrashers,
also said he was beaten down by the losing: ``I played in New
Jersey all those years and got used to winning. I thought I'd like
it in Atlanta, but it was horrible. I didn't think losing was going
to be so frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver has played nine rookies this season, leading coach
Marc Crawford to say, ``It's not very often you get an opportunity
to do that. It's not very often you want an opportunity to do it.''
... Stickgate: Colorado had officials check the sticks of two
Anaheim players (Teemu Selanne and Dominic Roussel) and both were
found to be of illegal proportion. The result was a two-man power
play with a goal by Sandis Ozolinsh, but the Mighty Ducks won 4-2.
The reaction from Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg: ``We're also going
to ask the league to investigate this building (the new Pepsi
Center). There is no door to our stick room and it's right next to
their dressing room door. Maybe we cheated with the illegal sticks,
but maybe they cheated in the way they checked our sticks. Let
other teams that come in here beware.'' ... After scoring five
points in his first game back from shoulder surgery, Colorado's
Peter Forsberg had one assist and was a minus-four in his next six
games. ``I get tired kind of easy,'' he said. ``It's something I
kind of knew would happen, but it's real frustrating.'' ...
Nashville sent goalie Thomas Vokoun (0-8-1, 3.54) to the minors and
next they may send him to a sports psychologist. Vokoun was
12-18-4, 2.95 last year. ``Right now, he's like the second baseman
who can't make the throw to first, or the actor who gets stage
fright,'' goalie coach Mitch Korn said.

ITALY'S PREMIER OUTLINES PLAN TO RESHAPE HIS COALITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Seeking to avert early elections, Italy's beleaguered
prime minister, Massimo D'Alema, told Parliament Saturday that he
wants to remold his fragile, divided majority into a ``stable and
strong'' center-left coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italy does not need lacerations or a traumatic dissolution of
its legislature,'' he said in a 40-minute speech. ``It needs a
government that operates to its full capacity and that can carry
out the necessary and possible reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech was the culmination of a tumultuous political week,
in which the government's inherently brittle center-left coalition
grew badly frayed from within. Unless Parliament decides to support
D'Alema, the prime minister would have to offer his resignation to
President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Ciampi would then consult political
leaders across the board to see if he can give D'Alema a green
light to try to form a new majority, a process that could take
days.
</P>
<P>
   If D'Alema fails, and no other center-left leader succeeds in
forming a majority, then Italy would be plunged into new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's showdown underscored the fragility of Italy's
political system, which still partly awards seats to political
parties on the basis of their share of the national vote, and thus
allows tiny parties representing few voters considerable power in
forming _ and wrecking _ coalitions. Party loyalty is not a
prerequisite for political office. Since April 1996, 108 members of
Parliament have changed parties, 20 have shifted allegiances twice,
and one has moved four times.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, who delivered a state-of-the-nation style address that
highlighted the accomplishments of his 14-month administration,
said that Italy had pulled out of ``the black hole'' it found
itself in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Parliament to help create a bipolar system that would
be more stable. But efforts to streamline the splintered Italian
electoral system and build a two-party system similar to those that
exist in the United States and Britain have continually broken
down.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, last week's free-for-all did not prevent the
government from passing a budget for next year. Saturday night, the
Senate approved an uncontroversial package that includes small tax
cuts and deficit reduction, and which was passed by the lower house
of Parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But internal power struggles with the majority came to a head at
the same time, when the Socialists within the coalition infuriated
the prime minister last weekend by saying he should be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Although the center-left majority is desperate to avoid early
elections, which polls suggest it could lose to the center-right
opposition, there is deep debate within the coalition as to whether
D'Alema is the best choice as leader for elections due in April
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The tension turned dramatic when Beniamino Andreatta, a former
defense minister and a member of Parliament who supports D'Alema,
had a massive heart attack on the house floor late Wednesday night,
and was rushed to a hospital, where he remains in a coma.
</P>
<P>
   Then, things grew ugly when the parliamentarian, Paolo Bampo,
accused another deputy, Luca Bagliani, a member of a centrist party
who is loyal to D'Alema, of seeking to bribe him to support the
prime minister. Bagliani and D'Alema angrily denied the charges,
and the speaker of Parliament set up a special committee to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote-buying accusation prompted Francesco Cossiga, a
former president and a maverick centrist who backed D'Alema in
1998, to pull his support. D'Alema began his speech by saying that
vote-buying was ``intolerable,'' but he failed to mollify Cossiga's
party, which announced afterwards that it would request D'Alema's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Cossiga, long a thorn in the side of the center-left, announced
Saturday night that he would fly to Tunisia to meet with the former
socialist prime minister, Bettino Craxi, a fugitive from justice
who is ill in exile. The surprise trip seemed less like a sickbed
visit than an attempt to lure Socialists over to his side.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, a former Communist who founded a non-Marxist party
after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Democrats of the Left, was
catapulted to power 14 months ago, when his center-left
predecessor, Romano Prodi, lost a confidence vote in Parliament by
one vote.
</P>
<P>
   As with Saturday's drama, that showdown was forced by splits
within the majority. At that time, D'Alema put together a similar
center-left coalition that stretched uncomfortably across the
spectrum, including both Communists and small centrist parties,
like Cossiga's, that sprung up after the Christian Democratic party
collapsed in the early 1990s under the weight of scandals.

BISHOP FULTON SHEEN, ON THE LONG ROAD TO SAINTHOOD
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, whose television ministry
in the 1950s reached 25 million viewers _ more than Milton Berle _
and made him the most prominent spokesman of the Roman Catholic
Church in America, could become a candidate for sainthood under a
process begun by a Franciscan friar he inspired as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Andrew Apostoli, 56, a friar at St. Felix Friary in
Yonkers, has received permission from Cardinal John O'Connor to
begin a study of the life, writings and teachings of the
archbishop, the first of many steps required to canonize the
evangelist, who died in New York City in 1979 at the age of 84.
</P>
<P>
   Apostoli, whom Sheen ordained in 1967, was traveling Saturday
and unavailable for comment, but a spokesman for the New York
Archdiocese, Joseph Zwilling, confirmed that Apostoli and the
Archbishop Fulton Sheen Foundation, based in El Paso, Texas, had
been given permission by the cardinal to began a study that could
lead to canonization.
</P>
<P>
   The study could take five years. If approved by the cardinal's
successor, it would be sent to the Vatican for papal endorsement,
which would be followed by witnesses' testimony and evidence of one
miracle for beatification and two for canonization, or sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Such miracles are usually healings without medical explanation
in people who appealed to the candidate through prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, though he became a titular
archbishop a decade before his death, the evangelist brought a
blend of religion, advice and conservative politics into millions
of homes on his weekly half-hour television show, ``Life Is Worth
Living,'' on the DuMont Network and later ABC from 1951 to 1957.
</P>
<P>
   With high cheekbones and mesmerizing blue eyes so deep-set and
piercing that many thought they were black, Sheen spoke on freedom,
pleasure, war and peace, love and many other subjects, mostly with
a Christian but not specifically Roman Catholic outlook that
appealed to viewers of many faiths. He spoke simply, casually,
often humorously, although he said each talk was carefully prepared
and represented hours of study and rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   Slotted on Tuesday nights against Milton Berle and Frank Sinatra
on larger networks, he swamped the competition with ratings that
soared, and eventually reached more than 25 million viewers on 123
stations. During his heyday, he was national director of the
Society for the Propagation of the Faith, whose goal was to spread
Catholic teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Sheen, who won many awards, including an Emmy, had been
well-known on radio long before the television program. He had been
featured in the Sunday evening ``Catholic Hour'' on NBC in the
1930s and in 1940, he conducted the first telecast religious
service.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his talks were controversial. He was stridently
anti-Communist, and during the Spanish Civil War he supported
Franco's fascist-supported insurgency against the government. He
defended corporal punishment in schools, and opposed Freudianism so
strongly that Catholic psychologists protested, fearing that his
polemics might steer the faithful away from needed therapy.
</P>
<P>
   He was famous for his conversions, of ordinary people en masse
and of such celebrities as Fritz Kreisler, Heywood Broun, Clare
Boothe Luce, Henry Ford II and Louis Budenz, the managing editor of
The Daily Worker, the Communist party newspaper in America.
</P>
<P>
   Sheen, who wrote more than 50 books of popular evangelism and a
widely syndicated newspaper column, lived most of his life in New
York City, but was reassigned in 1966 to become bishop of
Rochester, his first pastoral post in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1969, was given the title of archbishop and moved
back to New York. He is buried beneath the high altar in the crypt
of St. Patrick's Cathedral.

NEW DOWNTOWN FOR A LOS ANGELES SUBURB 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MORRIS NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BREA, Calif. _ This city 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles
is creating an all new downtown around its busiest intersection in
an effort to restore pedestrian activity and public spaces to a
community that has lacked a downtown for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The redevelopment effort is notable in this traditionally
suburban community for introducing such urban approaches as parking
garages to encourage patronage of downtown enterprises and loft
apartment buildings with retail space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to put this downtown back,'' said Shaul Kuba, a
principal of CIM Group LLC, a Los Angeles-based developer that is
constructing 13 buildings, including three with a total of 62 loft
apartments plus retail space here. ``It's basically giving the
heart and soul back to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The redevelopment project, which is expected to be completed
sometime next year, will contain 400,000 square feet of stores and
restaurants, 22 movie screens, 96 detached houses and 40 town
houses in addition to the loft apartments. The Brea Redevelopment
Agency has built two parking structures with a total of 1,750
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Brea's effort is part of a larger trend in California in which
existing, mature cities are being retrofitted with walkable,
villagelike downtown areas. Brea is unusual in creating its
six-block downtown out of an empty site, rather than filling in and
refurbishing an existing urban hub. City officials decided against
redeveloping the historic downtown area because it did not have
enough commercial land for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Brea's loss of its original downtown, and the decision to build
a new one, both stem from the city's pro-growth attitude.
</P>
<P>
   In 1898, oil was discovered in Brea (the word means tar in
Spanish, as evidenced by the La Brea Tar Pits, west of downtown Los
Angeles). Soon, wooden derricks spread across the landscape. The
city remained an oil town, and a bedroom community for employees of
the oil industry, into the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by orange groves, the city was comparatively isolated
until the completion of the Orange Freeway (Route 57) in the early
1970s. The freeway tied Brea more closely to the fast-growing
economy of Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   With the decline of the oil industry, city officials promoted
Brea as a center for both industry and back-office operations,
primarily for insurance and banking concerns. Their efforts seem to
have succeeded, for the city's current daytime population of
100,000 is nearly three times as large as its resident population
of 34,000.
</P>
<P>
   As in many U.S. cities, Brea's rapid growth was paralleled by a
decline in the downtown area. In the early 1970s, when a regional
mall opened several miles away from the traditional town center,
``downtown began to suffer,'' said Susan Georgino, the city's
redevelopment services director.
</P>
<P>
   Further damage to the old downtown occurred in the early '90s,
when transportation officials widened Brea Boulevard, the city's
main street and site of many of older buildings and businesses.
Expanding the boulevard from a four-lane to a six-lane,
140-foot-wide freeway resulted in the loss of a number of older
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of becoming a vibrant business center, Brea lost
its city center as well as part of its history. ``There is no
community gathering place,'' Ms. Georgino said. ``There is no place
that is Brea.''
</P>
<P>
   Brea has been studying a way of restoring a downtown area since
1987. The redevelopment effort has been an ongoing project
involving several designers and developers.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the project was a conventional
200,000-square-foot shopping center and 96 residential ``cottages''
with traditional architectural features, including front porches
and peaked roofs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the city commissioned a new master plan from RTKL
Associates, a Baltimore-based architectural firm, which included
the design of the remaining four blocks of vacant land that the
city had owned for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   RTKL's design extended Birch Street into the vacant site, and
surrounded it with entertainment and retail uses. The designers
were also careful to include a number of small public spaces
throughout the site. On the other side of Brea, town houses and
apartment houses are expected to fill three full blocks. Olson Co.
of Seal Beach, Calif., plans to start construction on the housing
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Cherry, the master-plan architect, said that the project
contained other elements beyond retail, such as a new church,
public art and newly planted trees.
</P>
<P>
   Those elements, he said, provide a ``critical mass of civic
elements that are really going to make the thing authentic.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not all Brea residents were receptive to Cherry's urban-design
ideas, however. He recalled one city councilman saying to him, ``I
don't think that parking structure is going to work,'' because the
stroll from the parking stall to a new restaurant in the area took
three minutes. But Cherry said that many urban designers now
believe that a walking time between parking and destination of five
minutes or less is considered ideal for promoting foot traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The first project to be built under RTKL's master plan was the
Birch Street Promenade, the retail and mixed-use portion undertaken
by CIM Group.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperation between the developer and city government is one
reason for the rapid development of the project, which has taken
little more than two years from the start of design to the
completion of construction, according to Kuba, the developer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically a street consists of many properties and it takes a
long time to assemble enough real estate to get a critical mass,''
he said. But in this case, the city assembled the land and the
development process moved forward quickly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to give Birch Street a sense of urban variety, CIM
Group hired different architects for each of its buildings. ``We
want the area to look as if it evolved over time, even though it
was actually built all at the same time,'' said John Given, an
urban designer and developer with CIM Group.
</P>
<P>
   Architects designed the buildings not only to be attractive, but
also to play distinct roles in the larger life of the street.
</P>
<P>
   A building with storefronts at street level and loft-style
apartments on upper stories, designed by Koning Eizenberg
Architecture of Santa Monica, is a variation on a building type
that was once nearly universal on shopping streets.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the street is a flamboyant two-story retail
building with a decorative obelisk built into the facade that
serves as a visual exclamation point for the new stretch of Birch
Street. The architect is Kanner Associates of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Other buildings are understated, ``background'' buildings such
as the retail building, with loft-style apartments on second and
third levels, designed by Koning Eizenberg. Situated at the center
of the block, the building provides the street with an orderly row
of storefront spaces, without calling undue attention to itself as
a design object.
</P>
<P>
   Although still unfinished, the Promenade is increasingly crowded
with pedestrians, fulfilling the developer's prediction of an unmet
demand for pedestrian-friendly places.
</P>
<P>
   One merchant who is pleased is Sally Waranch, owner of Sarah
Bain Gallery on Birch Street, which moved from nearby Fullerton. In
its former location, visitors to the gallery had to make a special
trip by car, she said, adding that ``there was maybe one walk-in a
day.''
</P>
<P>

people show up on weekends. ``We are selling quite a bit of art to

   (NYT9) NEW YORK -- Dec. 18, 1999 -- NY-FATAL-FUMES -- Gas fumes
in a popular supper club, ``The Laura Belle'' restaurant in Times
Square, left one night-shift employee dead Saturday morning and
four others hospitalized, one in critical condition, as the police
closed off the block, evacuated a building next door and checked
manholes and nearby basements for evidence of carbon monoxide. Five
rescue workers were also overcome by fumes. Firefighters dragged
the five unconscious custodial workers from the club at 120 W. 43rd

IN FINAL YEAR 2000 TESTING, FOCUS IS ON SMALLEST FLAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Mass.)   (ADDS missing line in 13th graf) 
 (nk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ The strings of letters and numbers flashing on
his computer screen were unintelligible to Kishore Parwani, but he
knew that each was the name of a computer program with hundreds or
even thousands of lines of code. He also knew something was wrong
because the screen was telling him the code was free of Year 2000
faults, a result as believable as a report that a unicorn had won
the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The programs, sent by one of the nation's largest commercial
real estate companies for testing by Data Integrity Inc., had been
certified as Year 2000-ready by the large software company that
created them. But Data Integrity and other companies that review
code to verify software claims typically find scores, even hundreds
of serious oversights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best clients still have 40 to 50 errors per millions of
lines of code,'' said Richard E. Evans, an analyst with Meta Group
of Stamford, Conn., a consulting firm that provides information on
verification tools and services. ``Half of those could corrupt data
or crash systems.''
</P>
<P>
   That adds up to thousands of potentially serious flaws for
banks, insurance companies and others.
</P>
<P>
   The government and most of corporate America have declared that
virtually all of their critical systems will function normally when
Jan. 1 arrives. But because only a portion of most computer code is
actually tested to make sure the year ``00'' will be correctly
interpreted, even the most confident computer managers anticipate
at least minor flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, as the repairs and testing wind up, Year 2000 is boiling
down to one pressing question: Since stamping out every Year 2000
date problem is impossible, have they at least reduced the caseload
of miscalculations and crashes to manageable levels?
</P>
<P>
   For the real estate company, the mirage of clean code
disappeared when Parwani adjusted his scanning tactics for the
obscure code in which the program was written. A three-day review
of close to 2.5 million lines of the software vendor's supposedly
Year 2000-ready code identified about 250 flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found at least 10 flaws that would have required several
days to fix,'' said a programmer for the real estate company, which
allowed a reporter to observe the procedure on the condition that
it not be identified. ``They would not have stopped business but
they might have interfered with things like tracking how long rents
are overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   While true showstoppers rarely turn up in such inspections, the
number of flaws uncovered naturally raises questions about whether
the government and many corporations are overstating their
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing confidence is probably justified as far as the
New Year's weekend goes, but the longer-term picture is murkier,
according to verification-tool providers like Data Integrity. As
with software flaws in general, system crashes are usually less
troublesome than malfunctions that generate faults that are not be
immediately apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less than 10 percent of the problems we find would cause
something to stop,'' said Scott Hilson, director of technical
support for Reasoning Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif.-based rival of Data
Integrity. ``This is more like termites than an earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 termites might be more dangerous than normal bugs
because signs of the infestation are expected to peak in the first
few weeks of January, when many computer workers are already
stretched thin handling malfunctions that occur as the old year
ends and the new one begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere from 2 percent to 5 percent of computer jobs normally
fail in late December and early January,'' Evans of Meta Group
said. That rate will more than double this year, according to
projections by The Gartner Group, a technology consulting firm in
Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, thanks to the Year 2000 challenge, even the
normal problems are likely to be more common in coming weeks. In
addition to the Year 2000 flaws, programmers will be wrestling with
other errors inadvertently added to the code during repair efforts.
Based on an examination of 30 years of softward records, Capers
Jones, chairman of Softward Productivity Research Inc. in
Burlington, Mass., predicts that Year 2000 workers have introduced
seven flaws for every 100 they fixed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many computer users bought new software to retire
programs that had date problems. But newly installed software tends
to have more bugs than average.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, vendors like Data Integrity have found contracts
harder to come by than analysts had originally projected. Total
sales for the tools have probably reached about $200 million,
according to industry estimates, but expectations had been higher.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The tools are generally modified versions of programs that find
and repair date flaws. One of their biggest selling points, beyond
blazing speed, is that they scan every line in a program. By
contrast, although running test programs provides a better window
on real-world use, such tests require intricate scripts _ and even
complex simulations, like those conducted by Wall Street in March
and April, can exercise only a small percentage of a large user's
code.
</P>
<P>
   Most verification tools start with vast glossaries of all terms
that might be used for dates in coding and for operations using
them, like tracking how many days a payment is overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Data Integrity's approach is somewhat different. It looks not
for date terms but for coding that indicates a mathematical
operation, like ``compare.'' It then tries to filter out commands
that could not involve Year 2000 errors. But regardless of
approach, users generally pay for verification tools based on the
number of lines of code that will be scanned.
</P>
<P>
   Rates generally run between four to 10 cents a line, with a
typical contract covering hundreds of thousands of lines at a
minimum. ``Price can be a sticking point for some smaller
organizations,'' Burgess said, adding that Data Integrity's
contracts have run from $90,000 to more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that the big computer users in the United
States with comprehensive Year 2000 programs have used either tools
or human checks on 40 to 60 percent of their repaired code. ``Once
you get outside the U.S. and a few countries, you get down to
single digits in how much of the code has been independently
verified,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   The first generation of automated Year 2000 tools in the
mid-1990s was difficult to use. The tools frequently overwhelmed
programmers with lists of potential glitches that on closer
inspection had nothing to do with dates. Many computer users turned
instead to so-called body shops like IBM, CAP Gemini and Keane,
which relied more heavily on human programmers than automation for
verifying code.

up even though January is just around the corner.

because the company is shriveling as demand for its main product
slows. The office is a new one that the company moved into
anticipating adding to its staff of 30 next year as its tools, like
those of its rivals, are adapted to cleaning up other faults in
software. Thanks to Year 2000, they should get at least a chance to
make pitches to most of the world's biggest computer users.

IN FINAL YEAR 2000 TESTING, FOCUS IS ON SMALLEST FLAWS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ The strings of letters and numbers flashing on
his computer screen were unintelligible to Kishore Parwani, but he
knew that each was the name of a computer program with hundreds or
even thousands of lines of code. He also knew something was wrong
because the screen was telling him the code was free of Year 2000
faults, a result as believable as a report that a unicorn had won
the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The programs, sent by one of the nation's largest commercial
real estate companies for testing by Data Integrity Inc., had been
certified as Year 2000-ready by the large software company that
created them. But Data Integrity and other companies that review
code to verify software claims typically find scores, even hundreds
of serious oversights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best clients still have 40 to 50 errors per millions of
lines of code,'' said Richard E. Evans, an analyst with Meta Group
of Stamford, Conn., a consulting firm that provides information on
verification tools and services. ``Half of those could corrupt data
or crash systems.''
</P>
<P>
   That adds up to thousands of potentially serious flaws for
banks, insurance companies and others.
</P>
<P>
   The government and most of corporate America have declared that
virtually all of their critical systems will function normally when
Jan. 1 arrives. But because only a portion of most computer code is
actually tested to make sure the year ``00'' will be correctly
interpreted, even the most confident computer managers anticipate
at least minor flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, as the repairs and testing wind up, Year 2000 is boiling
down to one pressing question: Since stamping out every Year 2000
date problem is impossible, have they at least reduced the caseload
of miscalculations and crashes to manageable levels?
</P>
<P>
   For the real estate company, the mirage of clean code
disappeared when Parwani adjusted his scanning tactics for the
obscure code in which the program was written. A three-day review
of close to 2.5 million lines of the software vendor's supposedly
Year 2000-ready code identified about 250 flaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found at least 10 flaws that would have required several
days to fix,'' said a programmer for the real estate company, which
allowed a reporter to observe the procedure on the condition that
it not be identified. ``They would not have stopped business but
they might have interfered with things like tracking how long rents
are overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   While true showstoppers rarely turn up in such inspections, the
number of flaws uncovered naturally raises questions about whether
the government and many corporations are overstating their
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing confidence is probably justified as far as the
New Year's weekend goes, but the longer-term picture is murkier,
according to verification-tool providers like Data Integrity. As
with software flaws in general, system crashes are usually less
troublesome than malfunctions that generate faults that are not be
immediately apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less than 10 percent of the problems we find would cause
something to stop,'' said Scott Hilson, director of technical
support for Reasoning Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif.-based rival of Data
Integrity. ``This is more like termites than an earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 termites might be more dangerous than normal bugs
because signs of the infestation are expected to peak in the first
few weeks of January, when many computer workers are already
stretched thin handling malfunctions that occur as the old year
ends and the new one begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere from 2 percent to 5 percent of computer jobs normally
fail in late December and early January,'' Evans of Meta Group
said. That rate will more than double this year, according to
projections by The Gartner Group, a technology consulting firm in
Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, thanks to the Year 2000 challenge, even the
normal problems are likely to be more common in coming weeks. In
addition to the Year 2000 flaws, programmers will be wrestling with
other errors inadvertently added to the code during repair efforts.
Based on an examination of 30 years of softward records, Capers
Jones, chairman of Softward Productivity Research Inc. in
Burlington, Mass., predicts that Year 2000 workers have introduced
seven flaws for every 100 they fixed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many computer users bought new software to retire
programs that had date problems. But newly installed software tends
to have more bugs than average.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, vendors like Data Integrity have found contracts
harder to come by than analysts had originally projected. Total
sales for the tools have probably reached about $200 million,
according to industry estimates, but expectations had been higher.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The tools are generally modified versions of programs that find
and repair date flaws. One of their biggest selling points, beyond
blazing speed, is that they scan every line in a program. By
contrast, although running test programs provides a better window
on real-world use, such tests require intricate scripts _ and even
complex simulations, like those conducted by Wall Street in March
and April, can exercise only a small percentage of a large user's
code.
</P>
<P>
   Most verification tools start with vast glossaries of all terms
that might be used for dates in coding and for operations using
them, like tracking how many days a payment is overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Data Integrity's approach is somewhat different. It looks not
for date terms but for coding that indicates a mathematical
operation, like ``compare.'' It then tries to filter out commands
that could not involve Year 2000 errors. But regardless of
approach, users generally pay for verification tools based on the
number of lines of code that will be scanned.
</P>
<P>
   Rates generally run between four to 10 cents a line, with a
typical contract covering hundreds of thousands of lines at a
minimum. ``Price can be a sticking point for some smaller
organizations,'' said Allen Burgess, a software engineer who
founded Data In- tegrity in 1984 as a software develop- ment and
consulting company. He added that Data Integrity's contracts have
run from $90,000 to more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that the big computer users in the United
States with comprehensive Year 2000 programs have used either tools
or human checks on 40 to 60 percent of their repaired code. ``Once
you get outside the U.S. and a few countries, you get down to
single digits in how much of the code has been independently
verified,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   The first generation of automated Year 2000 tools in the
mid-1990s was difficult to use. The tools frequently overwhelmed
programmers with lists of potential glitches that on closer
inspection had nothing to do with dates. Many computer users turned
instead to so-called body shops like IBM, CAP Gemini and Keane,

CARRUTH'S GIRLFRIEND IS MOURNED AT SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Rae Carruth remained jailed in Tennessee on
Saturday, while in North Carolina more than 2,000 people turned out
for an emotional funeral service for his girlfriend, whom he is
accused of murdering after she became pregnant with his child.
</P>
<P>
   On a clear and cool day, mourners poured into the Victory
Christian Center church in south Charlotte at 10 a.m. to pay their
respects to Cherica Adams, the 24-year-old real estate agent who
dated Carruth until she was mortally wounded in a drive-by shooting
on Nov. 16. She died on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The police have charged Carruth, a former wide receiver for the
Carolina Panthers, and three other Charlotte men with the shooting,
contending that the football star planned and orchestrated the
attack to avoid being responsible for his baby. Doctors delivered
the boy, named Chancellor, by Caesarian section and he has
survived.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear when Carruth would be returned to North Carolina,
although authorities here expected it would happen within a day or
two. After Carruth agreed not to fight extradition, federal
authorities dropped an unlawful-flight warrant against him and
handed the matter over to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police, which
should speed his return, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While the police were working out the details of moving Carruth,
the mourners packed the large modern church, where Adams' body lay
in a closed silver casket adorned with pink and white flowers. One
of the arrangements was of a butterfly. One by one, hundreds of
relatives and friends hugged Adams' mother, Saundra Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Mothers of Murdered Offspring, a support
group for crime victims' families, handed out tiny portraits of
Adams that people pinned to their chests. The audience included
Gentry Caudill, the assistant district attorney prosecuting the
case against Carruth.
</P>
<P>
   The program for the service described Adams, who was known as
Cookie, as a vivacious woman who loved music and entertainment and
had dropped out of college to attend a school for real estate
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved to travel and enjoyed fine dining and socializing,''
the program said. ``She loved to entertain and was a real social
butterfly.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams' manager at the mortgage company where she had worked for
the last six months described her stubborn refusal to accept
company dictums that seemed nonsensical to her. ``I was the one
being managed,'' Denis-Ane McManus said.
</P>
<P>
   Another family friend, Wayne K. Brown, described how Adams had
taken care of his own children on many occasions and had always
come around on Christmas Day to visit his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will promise you,'' he said to the casket, ``that we will
be there for Chancellor. Let's give Chancellor the chance to be
someone special in this world, just like her mother was.''
</P>
<P>
   But then the Rev. Robyn Gool took the stage and changed the tone
of the ceremony, turning his eulogy into a call to other young
people in the audience to give up the fast life and join the
church. Referring obliquely to Adams' penchant for parties and for
socializing with famous athletes, he said the family should take
comfort that in recent months Adams had ``rededicated her life to
God.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Cherica came to herself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gool said the crime against Adams was evidence of a deep social
malaise. ``If you blow away a pregnant woman, something is wrong
with your head,'' he said, adding: ``What we learn from this is
that people don't value life anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think life is partying,'' he said. ``There is
another party. Where is it? They think life is clubbing. That's
what some of you are thinking. Some people think life is sex, you
know. Always looking for another man or woman. Some people think
life is popularity, moving in the right circles. Some think life is
material possession. Look at all this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these things is life,'' he said. ``Life is a
relationship with God.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams was buried after the service at a local cemetery.

SHOCK OF YOUNG AMERICA'S DEFEAT SINKS IN
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The breeze was building and the seas were stacking up in the
waters off Auckland, New Zealand. It was Nov. 9 and Young America,
the New York Yacht Club's challenger for the America's Cup, had
just begun a race with Japan's Nippon Challenge in the preliminary
trials to determine who would face Team New Zealand in February's
cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the first of Young America's two
multimillion-dollar vessels, USA 53, sustained cataclysmic hull
damage and nearly sank. When Young America was eliminated from the
cup trials last week, USA 53's dramatic accident was cited as the
catalyst for an irreversible downward spiral from which the New
Yorkers never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Now, everyone involved is grappling to comprehend what happened
to a talented syndicate that began last October's cup season as a
huge favorite to advance at least as far as the six-boat
challenger's semifinals, which start Jan. 2. ``It's hard to
identify a single factor,'' said John Marshall, Young America's
president, after his team was ousted.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of Young America was swift and direct. ``They arrived
in Auckland with a kind of swagger, the rightful owners of the cup
come to reclaim their property,'' wrote Ivor Wilkins, a New Zealand
journalist. ``But arrogance left them friendless in a hostile
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hauraki Gulf was the hostile world on Nov. 9. Young
America's problems actually began just moments after the start,
when a critical piece of deck hardware started to peel away.
``There was some delamination under the tracks for our jib leads,''
said Jerry Kirby, a member of the crew. ``We broke a little
structural piece and had to move the leads outboard. We actually
carried the wrong jib for two legs and we were still beating the
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were thinking that even when things don't go perfect for
us, this boat is still fast enough to bail us out.''
</P>
<P>
   But if 53 was fast, it was also flawed. ``Thirty seconds from
the top mark for the last leg, we snapped in half,'' Kirby said.
``Who knows what our future would've been if we'd gotten around
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Kirby says that the delaminated deck was unrelated to the later
incident. But what happened to the carbon-fiber structure remains
unclear, though Russell Bowler of Farr Yacht Designs, the yacht's
designer, has an idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge impact when the boat struck a big wave,''
Bowler said. ``The drives for the on-board computers crashed at the
point of impact. We hit this piece of water pretty hard, and this
one area of the boat wasn't ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Young America hurriedly substituted its second boat, USA 58, for
the remainder of the round. But they forfeited a race in the
change-over, and lost other races because the new boat wasn't
ready. ``We were sort of flying blind,'' Kirby said. ``Those lost
races took away our points buffer and maybe a little confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Young America controlled its destiny going into the third
qualifying round. Quick losses to Italy's Prada Challenge and
Nippon _ races that USA 58 lost because of questionable strategy _
were crucial, but not fatal. But the losing continued, and it
coincided with a winning streak by Le Defi Francais.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter stages of the round, suddenly Young America needed
outside help from two American teams, Paul Cayard's America One and
Dawn Riley's America True, to sustain their hopes of advancing into
the semifinal fleet of six.
</P>
<P>
   That help was not forthcoming. On Dec. 11, Le Defi beat America
One by 25 seconds. Two days later, the French were awarded a
victory when America True, already qualified for the semis and
fearful of damaging its single boat, withdrew from a scheduled
race. For Young America, it was over.
</P>
<P>
   Though Young America's skipper, Ed Baird, concedes that no
matter what the actions of his competitors, his team would have
advanced had it simply won more races. Still, he remains bitter
about what transpired in the final days of the third round.
Specifically, he feels that Cayard handed his race to the French.
``We lost key races at the wrong time and allowed other teams to
make the choices they did,'' Baird said, ``of letting their races
be won.'' Moreover, many Young America team members believe that
there were America One crewmen who knew the outcome of the race in
advance and placed wagers on the French to win.
</P>
<P>
   Cayard denies both allegations. ``We put forth our best race
against the French,'' he said. ``They aren't slow and it was a
pretty good day for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the betting, that's absolutely not true. We heard the
rumors swirling around so we questioned everyone, and no one on our
team made a bet.''
</P>
<P>
   For Young America, it's clear why other syndicates would want
them eliminated. ``Everyone knows we probably have the fastest
boats down here,'' Kirby said.
</P>
<P>
   Baird added: ``A lot of competitors felt our team was a likely
candidate to win this event. They were nervous to race us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Young America was so powerful, why didn't it win
more races?
</P>
<P>
   Some observers conclude it was simply poor sailing due to a lack
of chemistry in Young America's afterguard, which included Baird,
Tony Rey and Ed Adams, both first-time cup competitors. Had Young
America advanced, sources within the camp said a shake-up was in
the works. One possible plan was for Baird to start the boat and
then hand over the helm to concentrate on tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that the loss of USA 53 was the devastating blow,
not only because it was a proven performer, but also because it
served as a tuning benchmark for USA 58.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall was open and reflective in defeat. ``The critical
decision that left us vulnerable was made over a year ago, when we
decided to extend the design program,'' he said. ``That cost us
some time on the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, had his team been sailing months earlier, as was
originally planned, the weakness in USA 53 might have been
discovered earlier, and 58 could have been tuned and ready when the
time came.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, 53 has been repaired and is once again ready to
sail. This week, the Young America team members plan to test its
soundness. They will sail alone and unchallenged, finished with the
event before the money round begins. &QL;

INVESTIGATION WIDENS INTO POSSIBLE TERRORIST BOMB PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ A massive cross-border manhunt is under &UR;  &LR; way for
possible co-conspirators in a suspected millennium-related
terrorist bomb plot against the United States. At one point over
the weekend, police cordoned off an entire block in downtown
Montreal and evacuated an apartment building to search for
explosives and evidence of conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   US and Canadian authorities believe that an Algerian charged in
Seattle on Friday with smuggling bomb-making materials across the
border from British Columbia may be part of a larger conspiracy
stretching from Montreal and other Canadian centers to hideaways of
Islamic extremists around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Ahmed Ressam, 32, identified as an Algerian
national traveling on fake Canadian identity papers and linked to
extremists using Montreal as a North American base of operations,
has underscored fears that Canada might serve as a springboard for
terrorist strikes against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Antiterrorist experts on both sides of the border warn that
Canada's relatively lax immigration rules have made it an
international sanctuary for terrorists. Last year, for example, a
US Justice Department report criticized Canada for granting a
convicted terrorist, Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, a student visa in
1993; he later slipped into the United States and was arrested for
plotting to blow up New York City's subway system.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic radical group Hezbollah, the so-called Islamic Army
of Osama bin Laden, Sri Lanka's Tamil Tigers and an array of other
organizations from the Middle East, former Soviet republics,
Eastern Europe and Asia are thought to use Canada as a place of
refuge and source of money raised through crimes. It is also the
easiest point of entry into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a Club Med for terrorists,'' said Claude Paquette,
an investigator with the intelligence service of the Montreal Urban
Community Police, which last week led a sweep against suspected
Algerian terrorists in Montreal. ``You plant a bomb somewhere. . .
and come back here to undertake other types of activities, such as
financing.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, a report by the Canadian Security and Intelligence
Service warned, ``there are more international terrorist
organizations'' active in Canada ``than any other country.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen major terrorist organizations have operatives
or covert fund-raising agents based in Canada, according to
intelligence sources.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, American officials have complained bitterly
that Canada does a poor job of controlling who enters that country.
Many counterterrorist analysts believe Canada's loose immigration
and refugee policies _ especially the slow-working bureaucratic
mechanisms for expelling illegal entrants _ represent one of the
most dangerous security threats to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was arrested Tuesday by US Customs officials near the
ferry landing in Port Angeles, Wash., after a search of his rented
Chrysler vehicle uncovered bomb-making materials, including timers,
circuit boards, two 22-ounce jars of nitroglycerine, a quantity of
sulphate and 110 pounds of urea _ a legal substance used to
manufacture fertilizers as well as the sort of powerful homemade
explosives used in the Oklahoma City bomb attack in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, who bolted the scene but was grabbed several blocks
away, also carried a Canadian passport bearing an alias, and two
Quebec province driver's licenses in different names. According to
Canadian press reports, Ressam was charged twice this year with
theft in Quebec and British Columbia, but was quickly released
despite his non-citizen status and despite the fact he was already
being sought for violation of immigration rules.
</P>
<P>
   The timing devices found in the rental car were rigged to
Casio-brand watches, a design that intelligence sources described
as typical of the explosives handiwork of the terrorist
organization headed by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi national
suspected of masterminding the 1998 bomb attacks against US
embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was charged in US District Court in Seattle with
smuggling explosives as well as with carrying false identification
and making false statements to Customs. He has not formally entered
a plea, and defense lawyers Saturday protested an order by a
federal judge to destroy the highly volatile nitroglycerine, which
had been stored in a bomb disposal truck.
</P>
<P>
   US and Canadian authorities suspect Ressam may be part of a
larger terrorist plot, possibly one planning an attack pegged to
the new millennium. But Saturday police in both countries refused
to say whether they have any hard evidence pointing to a specific
planned target.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Cannistraro, the CIA's former head of counterintelligence
operations, was quoted in wire service reports as saying the
electronics allegedly carried by Ressam suggest a connection to bin
Laden, whose apprehension the US State Department has posted a $5
million reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way this bomb was put together, particularly the Casio
watch, is a signature of the bin Laden organization,'' Cannistraro
said.
</P>
<P>
   A US-Canada investigation into a possible widespread conspiracy
rooted among Islamic radicals operating out of Canada is being lead
by the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic swoop, bomb specialists with the RCMP sealed off a
block in downtown Montreal late Friday and evacuated a building in
which Ressam rented an apartment under the alias Benni A. Noris,
the name on the passport and one of the driver's licenses.
</P>
<P>
   No explosives were found in the search. The RCMP and Montreal
Police Saturday refused to say whether the low-rent apartment
yielded any other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently by coincidence, Montreal police last week arrested 11
Algerian nationals on charges of operating a theft and extortion
ring to raise money for Islamic terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Canada itself is almost never a target of terrorist attacks. But
its long and open border with the US _ together with large
immigrant communities in such major cities as Montreal, Toronto and
Vancouver, which provide easy camouflage and money sources _ have
made the country a popular lair for international terrorist groups,
according to Canadian law enforcement and intelligence sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terrorists are not putting bombs on street corners here,''
Paquette said. ``They are doing other things, like financing their
fighting friends overseas.''

CONVICTED MURDERER, PRISON GUARD ARRESTED IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT STEARNS and MIKE RICE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The seven-week flight
of a convicted murderer and the prison guard who authorities say
helped him escape from Crossroads Correctional Center in Cameron
ended Saturday morning with their capture in a rural Texas trailer
park.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terry Banks, 26, and Lynette Barnett, 27, of Hamilton were
arrested about 7:30 a.m. on the outskirts of Victoria, Texas, about
120 miles southwest of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The two barricaded themselves in a recreational vehicle parked
next to a trailer for about 30 minutes before their arrests. Police
used a public address system to order them out of the RV.
</P>
<P>
   Banks' father, Charles Banks, was arrested at the scene. A woman
named Roberta Jones and a man named Paul Hoard also were arrested.
Their relationship to the fugitives was unclear Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Banks and Barnett will be arraigned Monday and face
extradition to Missouri. The two walked out of the correctional
center about 45 miles north of Kansas City on Oct. 29. Banks was
wearing a prison guard's uniform and carrying a fake ID that
authorities believe Barnett made for him.
</P>
<P>
   Banks was serving a life term for the 1992 murder of a man in
Rocky Comfort. Barnett, who was assigned to the food service area
where Banks worked, could face two to five years in prison if she
is convicted of helping him flee.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how long the two had been in Texas, or how long
they had planned to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some concern they were getting ready to load up the
RV and take off,'' said FBI agent Kurt Lipanovich.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest was the result of a tip last week from a viewer of
the television show ``America's Most Wanted,'' which featured a
segment on Banks and Barnett on Dec. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The tip was instantly credible to investigators because the
caller went beyond simply saying he recognized Terry Banks and
Barnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person knew that the older guy was using the name
Charlie,'' Lipanovich said. ``He knew something that wasn't on the
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipanovich would not say how the tipster came in contact with
the three.
</P>
<P>
   Agents from the FBI, the Texas Department of Public Safety, the
Victoria Police Department and the Victoria Sheriff's Office had
had several spots around Victoria under surveillance for the last
two days, Lipanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, agents identified the pair in the trailer park
as Banks and Barnett and made the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, a redhead, had dyed her hair black.
</P>
<P>
   The first break in the case for investigators came about two
weeks ago, when they found Barnett's pickup truck near Joplin, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Banks had sold it to a woman there for about $2,000,
Lipanovich said. He then apparently accompanied his son and Barnett
on a route that took them to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Banks has an extensive criminal record, and
authorities believe the trailer belonged to a friend of his,
Lipanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe that Barnett and Banks were having an affair
behind the bars of Crossroads, a 1,500-inmate maximum security
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett's family insists that Banks coerced the guard's
assistance by threatening her family.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the family is relieved to know Barnett is safe, said
Lorra Johnson, one of her sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wait's over,'' Johnson said. ``Lynette's still got a lot
to go through, but she can get through it.''

north Georgia. Skender Rahimi couldn't get this place out of his

   CHINA-MACAU _ MACAU _ The checkered history of this indolent old
Portuguese enclave is about to end, and few are weeping as China
prepares to take over. Four hundred years ago Macau was far richer.
Portuguese traders dined on plates of gold because for a century
Portugal had a world monopoly on trade in silk, gold, porcelain and
silver with Japan and China. Twelve years ago, China and Portugal
had no trouble agreeing that the Portuguese should end their
occupation just before the millennium. Both sides have stuck to
this pact with little friction. And so on the evening of December
19, 2,500 guests from Portugal, Macau and China are due to gather
here just before midnight to toast the end of nearly 450 years of
Portuguese occupation. When the clock in the Macau cathedral
strikes 12 times, Portugal will lower its flag on the last and
oldest Western enclave in Asia. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News

history: no sitting vice president, his interviewer asserted, had
ever been defeated for his party's nomination. Not true, Bradley
responded. Vice President George Clinton lost to James Madison to
succeed President Jefferson _ in 1808. A far better historical
precedent, Bradley said, was the fact that George Bush was the
first vice president to win the presidency in 150 years. Bradley,
trying to wrest the nomination from Vice President Gore, was both
right and wrong. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED

   DOG-FIGHTING _ It's called a blood sport. But when police raided
a dogfight in southeast Georgia's Wayne County, what officers found
was more like a bloodletting. The raid highlighted the popularity
of dogfighting in rural Georgia, where it has been a macabre
tradition for generations. But dogfighting has become more than a
rural pastime. In Georgia and across the country, police say, it is
an increasingly common hobby in urban neighborhoods, especially
among members of street gangs. (Judd, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   Clinton, before leaving office Jan. 20, 2001, has pledged to
change the management of millions of acres of public lands, largely
in the West. If successful, the consequences would range from
increased environmental protections to more limits on access and
how the land can be used.
</P>
<P>
   No other president since Lyndon B. Johnson _ who expanded
national seashores, created national monuments and signed the
Wilderness Act of 1964 _ has shown as much interest in how public
lands in the West and the rest of the nation have been managed.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Clinton has:
</P>
<P>
   _ Signed a bill making the Black Canyon of the Gunnison near
Montrose, Colo., the nation's 55th national park. Great Sand Dunes
National Monument in southern Colorado could also soon be expanded
and elevated to national park status.
</P>
<P>
   _ Used the Antiquities Act of 1906 to declare 1.7 million acres
of southern Utah as the Grand Staircase-Escalante National
Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The monument was created in the back rooms of the White House,
without any public input, and declared less than a year before the
1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could use the same law, again without congressional and
other public input, to expand the Colorado National Monument in
Mesa County, Colo. Also in the works are potentially new or
expanded monuments near Cortez, Colo., and in Arizona, California,
Montana and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Proposed a ban on construction of new roads in 40 million to
60 million acres of national forests now considered as roadless,
including 3 million acres in Colorado. If enacted, the policy could
force restrictions on snowmobiles, mountain bikes and other uses of
the forests.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pushed for the U.S. Forest Service to consider how uses of the
national forests affect the ecological welfare of the landscape.
This focus already has surfaced in the proposed White River
National Forest management plan and is expected to shape the
upcoming plans for the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison
national forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Theodore Roosevelt, I believe there are certain places
humankind simply cannot improve upon, places whose beauty and
interest no photograph could capture, places you simply have to see
for yourself,'' Clinton said last week in announcing that he was
considering naming new national monuments. ``We must use this time
of unparalleled prosperity to ensure people will always be able to
see these places as we see them today.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has called this the ``legacy'' he wants his presidency
to be remembered for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the legacy we have in mind is a legacy for future
generations,'' said Eliott Diringer, spokesman for White House
Council on Environmental Quality. ``The president and
administration have, over the last several years, taken many
actions to protect the unique and fragile lands across the country,
from the Everglades to the California redwoods. The interest is
driven primarily by the desire to ensure future generations of
Americans can enjoy these lands.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Scott McInnis, R-Colo., said it's easy for him to
decipher why Clinton is using the West to help set his place in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The warmest, fuzziest feeling you have is family,'' McInnis
said. ``Figuring he can't build his legacy on that, the next one
down the list is parks and wilderness. He wants to do it like Teddy
Roosevelt.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton keeps making connections with Roosevelt, who set up the
national park system and protected millions of acres of Western
land.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement about potential new monuments was made in the
Roosevelt Room of the White House, and in October Clinton referred
to Roosevelt when he launched his effort to limit road construction
in national forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants his legacy to be of (President William Howard) Taft
and Roosevelt,'' said Stan Broome, president of Club 20, a western
Colorado lobbying and promotional group. ``The big setasides those
guys were involved in were more far-reaching. They weren't setting
aside public lands to lock up. They were doing so for the general
use of public lands and multiple use.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that is the legacy Clinton wants, he is headed in the wrong
direction. He should take existing public agencies and enhance them
to get things done,'' Broome said.
</P>
<P>
   Broome and other detractors say Clinton is threatening the
economic livelihood of those who rely on access to public lands,
whether it is for logging, recreation or other uses.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, though, say Clinton is responding to a
dwindling sanctuary of space for wildlife, humans and the natural
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the nation wants is more land protection,'' said Ed
Marston, publisher of the Paonia-based High Country News, a
30-year-old environmental watchdog newspaper. ``We in the West have
to figure out how to accommodate that and not fight it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Westerners believe the land and people in the six or seven
largely rural mountain states are being used unjustly by Clinton to
secure his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can try to sell out the entire West to save the Democrats
but that won't happen,'' said John Martin of Grand Junction, a
proponent of off-highway vehicle use on public lands. ``If you
combine the roadless issue with the new planning regulations with
the new planning on the White River and (Grand Mesa National Forest
group), and what they want to do in Utah with wilderness, what you
have is a sellout of the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you throw California east of the Mississippi, 80 percent of
the population would be living east of the Mississippi,'' Martin
said. ``We're becoming insignificant by population and we are a
target.''
</P>
<P>
   Many western environmentalists, though, say people intertwined
with the land for so many decades are unable to step back and see
the bigger issue.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Ann Moon of Grand Junction went to meetings about the
roadless proposal with a warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear a lot of Disneyites who only think about themselves,''
Moon said during a hearing on the roadless initiative. ``The Forest
Service can't even take care of the roads it has now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we construct roads into pristine areas when we can't
afford to maintain what we have?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Marston said the West has two choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can continue to proclaim its sovereignty, and carry on with
a doomed rearguard action,'' he wrote. ``Or it can strengthen its
sovereignty by figuring out how to adhere to the national desire to
protect the land while implementing that protection in a distinctly
western way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cleary, a longtime congressional aide from western
Colorado, recalled when President Johnson enacted many of the
initiatives that were first proposed by Congress. Johnson, too, was
pushed by his Interior secretary, Stewart Udall, to use executive
powers, but not to the extent Clinton appears to be moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a joint effort between the executive and legislative
branches, I suppose,'' Cleary said. ``Compared to when I was back
there, I'm uneasy (Clinton) is doing it by executive order as
opposed to letting Congress work its will.''

 &HT;    Proposed land setaside threatens logging family's 116-year way
of life
 &HT;    By C. Patrick Cleary
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAONIA, Colo. _ Logger Ken Smith is living in the shadow of a
proposed federal rule that could mean the end of a century-long
livelihood for his family.
</P>
<P>
   The ridgeline immediately north of his Paonia sawmill/home,
Smith Forest Products, is the beginning of a roadless area on the
Grand Mesa National Forest that stretches north to Interstate 70.
The area is among the 40 million to 60 million acres of forests
nationwide the Clinton administration wants kept off limits to road
building and associated timber cutting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared,'' the burly 40-year-old father of two young boys
said. ``We're four months away from having to move away to find
work. For a family that has been here 116 years, that's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The threatened closure of potential logging territory might be
the last straw for a family and business that have seen increased
regulation and increased environmental pressure tear apart the
fabric many communities in the West are built upon.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration plan to limit road-building in
national forests is the latest in a long line of federal
regulations that Smith said might result in the Forest Service
having no timber for sale. That, he said, would drive him out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1863 the Smith family migrated from Illinois to the
Uncompahgre Plateau. His family helped found Somerset before
eventually settling in Delta in 1883.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's grandfather, Carl Smith, was the first child born in
incorporated Delta. The family was involved in law enforcement,
worked as mining engineers and helped start Holly Sugar and Delta
Brick and Tile, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came west to stay out of the Civil War,'' Smith said.
``They didn't want to lose their boys to the Civil War. They were
industrialists who built anything and everything back east. These
people were looking for new challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's photo albums are filled with faded photographs of
long-dead relatives sitting atop piles of sawdust and straddling
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Those men cut trees in areas of the western Colorado landscape
that today don't look as if they have been touched, he said,
matching before and after photos.
</P>
<P>
   That work sustained families intertwined with the communities
that sprung up around them.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he hopes he carries on his family's long tradition of
community service. He is a volunteer fireman, works at the schools,
teaches first aid at the mines and has donated goods and services
to make his community a better place. He teaches classes at the
vocational college and works for an ambulance company in Grand
Junction to make ends meet. His family donated the famous Christmas
Tree of the Stinking Desert and thousands of others used by the
town of Paonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the school needs something ... we buy it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This philosophy has been handed down from generation to
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he doesn't think the newcomers who oppose the
multiple use concept of public lands get involved in communities to
the extent as those who have spent a lifetime working with the
land.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, for example, currently has one salvage job that could
provide work for him to support his family through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The job, though, is providing work for seven families. He said
he could lay off those seven employees to guarantee work and income
for himself through the winter. That, though, would put seven men
out of work, seven families without an income. He said he won't do
it.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he is watching the multiple-use view of the West
change. The shadow of the ridge and its implications behind his
house looms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's designs on the West are
jeopardizing more than an ability to go cut trees, said Smith, who
followed his family's footsteps and bought his first sawmill in
1978. It is jeopardizing the only way of life he has known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with waste not, want not, with the environment,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His home is built with logs he cut himself. He didn't use whole
logs, though. He split them in half to save wood. He rails against
the mansion builders of the resorts who build the biggest log homes
only to stay in them a few weeks a year.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he knows there is no God-given right a person has to
operate a business.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you have an individual dedicated to work, has a
terrific work ethic who is willing to donate back to the community,
and he has a reasonable business sense, he should have the
opportunity to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he has worked long hours seasonally while fighting to
defend a business that he said has helped sustain the health of the
forests, the private ground and the communities that land supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never taken welfare,'' he said. ``I've got two kids to
put through school.''

THE DECADE OF THE '80S WAS DOMINATED BY THE ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Long-distance calls
got cheaper, but AT&AMP;T never succeeded in personal computers.
Companies like Apple, Microsoft and Intel sprang from nothing to
dominate the industry that would become essential to world
business.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following the law of unintended consequences, the AT&AMP;T breakup
hastened the arrival of one of the phenomena of our lifetimes, the
Internet. Long-distance upstarts Sprint and MCI laid fiberoptic
cable to compete with AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a fiber network a lot more quickly than we would have
under AT&AMP;T, and fiber is the backbone of the Internet,'' said Litan
of the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The free-market lessons of that deregulation played out in grand
scale in Kansas City. AT&AMP;T cut jobs here. Sprint, essentially
created in 1984, in 15 years became this city's largest
private-sector employer. Now it is the target of acquisition by MCI
in what would be history's largest merger, a $115 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, American business again got serious about ``the
bottom line.'' Some businesses that didn't faced corporate raiders
like Carl Icahn and T. Boone Pickens, who threatened to take over
companies and throw out chief executive officers.
</P>
<P>
   Reorganization, global marketplace and shareholder value became
buzzwords, signals to many workers that layoffs were on the way.
Fewer workers created production gains for companies and financial
gains for Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   For cities, ``jobs became currency,'' and companies used them to
hustle tax breaks from desperate communities. Now jobs go to the
city giving away the most. Sometimes the Kansas City area wins _
Harley-Davidson _ and sometimes it loses _ the headquarters of TWA.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the job cuts of the 1980s, two seemingly unrelated trends
came together to feed the economic wonder that America has become,
said economist David M. Jones. Many dismissed workers decided to
become entrepreneurs. The start-ups that survived found the United
States had created a ``culture of equity'' to finance their
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn into the stock market by better returns, the tax
advantages of retirement plans and the seeming simplicity of mutual
funds, we have become voracious investors. In 1980 we had $134.7
billion invested in all mutual funds. By 1990 it topped $1
trillion, and by last year it was $5.5 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 percent of Americans own stocks. The Dow Jones
industrial average, which measures the growth in the value of
stocks, has moved from 777 in August 1982 to more than 11,000. In
the same time the number of American jobs has grown to 133 million
from about 100 million. Inflation last year dropped to a whimpering
1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 1980s we were a little confused about where
this free-market ride was taking us. We wondered why our companies
could sublimate employee loyalty to profits for shareholders. We
called it the decade of greed, although by almost any measure the
decade of the 1990s has been more about making money than the
decade of the '80s was.
</P>
<P>
   Imperceptibly our attitudes shifted with the transformation of
the economy. Instead of complaining about slow-rising salaries, we
brag about our growing stock portfolios. We began haranguing CEOs
about quarterly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   We were asked to take ownership, and we did. How about
happiness?
</P>
<P>
   Some economic theorists believe that we are in a ``long boom''
that will continue 20 more years and that nearly every
socio-economic substratum is benefiting.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent study, black men 16 to 24 with a high
school diploma or less, many with prison records, are working in
greater numbers, earning more and committing fewer crimes than in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   So is the legacy of the 1980s that we are making more money and
that is making us happier?
</P>
<P>
   Even as our personal wealth has grown, some observers see our
personal satisfaction deflating. With more choices has come far
greater responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by The Kansas City Star found that 40 percent of Kansas
Citians worried that we would see a stock-market crash like the one
in 1929 preceding the Great Depression, although only 6 percent
were greatly worried.
</P>
<P>
   From 1980 until very recently, the chasm between those with the
most of everything and those with the least had grown wider and
deeper. That fact, according to the survey, is what the largest
percentage of Kansas Citians _ 35 percent _ see as the biggest
economic problem facing America as it enters the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet offers easy access to an inconceivable amount of
information but makes it as easy for our children to discover
pornography as they can geography. And what about our privacy?
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that half of Kansas Citians believed the
advantages of the Internet outweighed the dangers it posed to
privacy; 29 percent thought issues of privacy outweighed the
advantages of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   We live with a nagging uncertainty about our jobs. Global
markets and expanding businesses have brought coveted jobs to
cities, but we have no guarantee that our best corporate citizens
won't become branch offices or be swept away by mergers, like
Hoechst Marion Roussel and Sprint.

   ``I think we are coming to the realization, as we come into this
sudden wealth, that there is not as much bang as we imagined,''
said McKenzie, the author. ``It doesn't bring the happiness you
imagined decades earlier.''

INVENTING A WORLD: HOW LIFE AND ART COLLIDED IN WILLIAM W. ADKINS'
DOMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PAUL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _In the last months of
his invented world, William W. Adkins spent many mornings at the
Plaza Library. He sat at a favorite oak table, a sheet of thick
paper rolled out in front of him and light pouring through the
reading room's tall north windows.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one bothered him. He kept to himself. And to his paper. He
listened to the quiet. And, with his black Bic pen, he drew what he
was seeing in his mind's eye.
</P>
<P>
   He sat and drew for hours. Mostly, he made up mechanical devices
that he thought would be useful or that he might later turn into
wooden models. He labeled their parts and gave them names, so the
patent office could follow what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earth-Quake Empty Can,'' for instance. Adkins had in mind
something that could control earthquake damage. Or ``Banana
Split-Eating Shave.'' That improbable combination of cutting device
and container would take longer toexplain.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins not only invented a world on paper. He invented a life
for himself, too.
</P>
<P>
   In his invented world, home was anywhere he landed. For as many
as 20 years, he essentially lived outdoors. And in the last of his
homeless years, he lived like an animal in the back end of a vacant
lot in Westport.
</P>
<P>
   That Adkins created anything at all is extraordinary enough,
given that his impulse to invent might have come from mental
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   That his works ended up in museums, books and on the walls of a
New York art gallery is nothing short of remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   The story of William W. Adkins has too many complications and
too many ironies to be wrapped up neatly. Or happily.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been about how art can change a life. As things
turned out, it's more about how life can get in the way of art.
Piecing it together
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those things,'' Bill Adkins says more than
once, explaining how life happens. It's the closest thing to
self-awareness one can extract from him.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins is 67. He doesn't go to the library to make drawings
anymore. Most of the time he lies on his bed in the Kansas City
nursing home where he now lives. A television chatters in the
background. Groans and loud voices sputter through the hallways.
</P>
<P>
   If visitors arrive, he'll get up and walk slowly to greet them,
a rubber-tipped cane in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   He wears cranberry sweatpants, a green sweatshirt and a ball cap
that's a little too big for his bald head. The teeth he has left
are chipped and yellowed beneath his bulbous nose. The skin of his
face is pasty white, gray at times, but mostly free of the stubble
and grime that used to greet the world.
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then he'll be reminded of something pleasant, and
his ice-blue eyes will light up, and his hands will gesture. And
then, like a balloon losing air, his voice will go flat again, and
his hands will drop to his lap and just shake a little.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't recall exactly when he began to draw or why. ``I just
did, is all,'' he says in his slightly pinched country tenor.
</P>
<P>
   Or how he came to be living in this nursing home: ``It's just
one of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   What Adkins does remember he somehow transforms into black-ink
inventions on white poster board.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Doan first saw one of his drawings nearly five years
ago, and she has been studying them ever since. When she visits
Adkins today, it's not only as a friend, but also as the unofficial
curator, promoter and preserver of his body of work.
</P>
<P>
   As long as she's known him, though, it has been difficult to
piece together what's true about him and what's not.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Kansas City, Kan., on Aug. 8, 1932. He was
married and maybe divorced. He had 10 children, all of whom ended
up in foster families. He was not the world's best father or
husband. ``I like to amble and gamble, and women don't like that,''
he told Doan once.
</P>
<P>
   For a while he lived with his father in an apartment at 43rd and
Bell streets. When his father died, in the early 1970s, Adkins
apparently wandered 10 blocks east into Westport _ wandered, that
is, into the oblivion of his new, invented world.
</P>
<P>
   He just showed up one day, his Clark Avenue neighbors say. But
he appeared regularly and was willing to work.
</P>
<P>
   He patched together a concrete-and-rock wall around one couple's
house. He swept the walkways of a nearby apartment building. He
mowed lawns.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins bought food with the money he made, and some neighbors
fed him regularly. Judith Brougham set out breakfast for him as
often as three times a week. He frequently gave her drawings in
return. He gave lots of people his drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins wore layers of smelly clothes and layers of hats. Sailor
Bill, they called him at the Plaza Library, because of the
captain's hat that sat atop his wool watchcap. Others knew him as
Westport Bill or Wild Bill _ not names, but labels for an odd
character.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in the 1980s a retired teacher who lived at 4143
Clark let Adkins take up residence on her back porch. When she
died, he stayed, living on the porch or even in the crawlspace
beneath it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Roger Coleman, executive director of the nearby
Westport Allen Center, bought the teacher's small house in late
1990 but soon discovered he couldn't afford to bring it up to code.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman pleaded with Adkins to leave. Finally, almost a year
later, Adkins disappeared, and Coleman had the house demolished.
</P>
<P>
   By the next spring, however, in early 1992, Adkins returned to
the lot and staked a claim. He put up some boards and tin and
plastic and fashioned himself a lean-to against a telephone pole
and a clump of trees.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman could imagine Adkins to be some kind of monk ``living
under a tree,'' he says, ``taking care of himself and not bothering
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   And Coleman saw in him a kind of grace, as if some parable were
being played out in his back yard and his own salvation depended on
how he treated this peasant who just might be God.
</P>
<P>
   When summer turned to winter and the temperature dropped to
bitter cold, Coleman told Adkins he could stay warm in the Allen
Center's boiler room. Adkins declined. He just burrowed into his
hole. His golden age
</P>
<P>
   Adkins invented on paper for many years, maybe going back to the
construction and concrete work he had done in the 1950s. But what
might be called his golden age of creativity unfolded in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   We know this, because Margaret Doan began making a record of his
works.
</P>
<P>
   Doan is an independent art historian. As a volunteer travel
coordinator at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, she arranges and
leads tours for museum members to art capitals around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In early February 1995, Judith Brougham, a painter herself,
introduced Doan to the man who made these unusual drawings.
Brougham had hoped to get her homeless neighbor some recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Doan, trim and blonde, with a deliberate Kansas voice, looked
beyond the two hats he wore, the dirty boots and fingerless gloves,
and saw in him a ``polite, kind of funny'' man.
</P>
<P>
   He had a rolled-up batch of drawings under his arm, and one by
one he showed them to her. Although she found his descriptions a
little hard to follow, Doan knew instantly that she had discovered
someone special.

EMPTY SEATS GIVE N.B.A. SOME CAUSE FOR CONCERN 
CARLESIMO HANGS ON
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the foreground of a recent television highlight, Bob Sura of
the Cleveland Cavaliers goes in for a two-hand reverse dunk against
the Boston Celtics. In the background, a smattering of fans stand
and applaud _ amid several hundred vacant seats at Gund Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The reels spin nightly, churning out the best and the worst of
the NBA: unreal athletic feats matched by declining attendance in
many cities. On the whole, the league is averaging 300 fewer paid
fans a game than it was nearly two months into last season. Through
307 games played last week, about 47,000 fewer total tickets were
sold in comparison with that period in the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   Although the numbers represent only a slight decline, the visual
evidence is striking. From Continental Arena in the Meadowlands to
New Arena in Oakland, vast empty spaces can be seen throughout the
NBA In its first 82-game season after Michael Jordan retired and a
contentious labor dispute dribbled into an abbreviated 50-game
season, the league is gradually being hit with an attention deficit
from its fan base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pricing people out of these arenas, that's what
happening,'' said Keith Glass, an agent for several players. ``Who
is compelling out there right now? With tickets and everything
included, I'll bet it costs $200 for a family of four to see a
Net-Clipper game. Exactly who's going to that game?''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern said last week that attendance figures
``need improvement'' while adding that overall paid attendance is
down only about 1 percent from a year ago. ``They always have and
they continue to need improvement,'' Stern said. ``It's hard work,
given the entertainment options that people have, given all the
things they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, Orlando, New Jersey, Vancouver and Seattle are
averaging 2,000 to 3,000 fewer fans for each game than they did
last season. The league does not release figures on people who have
purchased tickets to games but do not show up. But scanning many
NBA arenas the first six weeks of the season makes it easy to see
that the announced attendance figures often inflate the actual
number of fans in the building by several thousand.
</P>
<P>
   Some blame lack of star power. With Jordan gone, Charles Barkley
recently retiring because of injury and several other veteran stars
either injured or past their prime, the league has had to rely on a
few entertainers to bring people into their buildings. Vince
Carter, Allen Iverson, Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan are not only
responsible for lifting their franchises, but also keeping
attendance figures steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while because you have to establish yourself as a
winner,'' Stern said. ``Michael, Magic, Larry, Isiah _ they not
only played for, they made their teams into winners. That's what
our fans are waiting to see. Which players, despite their great
talent, are going to make their teams winners? Sports is
unforgiving in terms of the judgments that they make. We make them
in terms of wins and losses.''
</P>
<P>
   What must be particularly distressing for the league is
attendance at its new arenas. At the four facilities that have
opened so far this season _ Philips Arena in Atlanta, Pepsi Center
in Denver, Staples Center in Los Angeles and Conseco Fieldhouse in
Indianapolis _ the home teams' attendance figures are up from last
year's, but only the new home of the Pacers has sold out nightly.
The Nuggets' attendance is up nearly 25 percent, but their average
announced crowd is still 4,455 short of capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Pacers, the Knicks and the Sacramento Kings are the
only franchises to sell out every home game thus far, there are
other success stories. Portland has sold out all but one of its
games and is often over capacity. And the United Center, despite
the loss of Jordan, Scottie Pippen and most other vestiges of
Chicago's championship team, has managed to average more than
22,000 tickets sold per game.
</P>
<P>
   But there are just as many puzzling figures, like those at Key
Arena in Seattle. Despite the team's resurgence this season, the
SuperSonics are averaging fewer than 15,000 fans in a
17,000-capacity arena.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was the no-show problem more obvious than Thursday
night's game in Dallas between the Knicks and the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd for New York's only visit of the year was announced at
13,000, but fewer than 10,000 people were at Reunion Arena to
witness the game. At times, Gus Johnson, the Knicks' radio
announcer, could be heard as clearly as if he were doing play by
play for the entire arena.
</P>
<P>
   Several agents, including Glass, partly blame new provisions in
the collective bargaining agreement. In addition to establishing
maximum salary limits, both the league and the players union agreed
to more stringent rules regarding player movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inflexibility of the cba (collective bargaining agreement)
is going to kill the league,'' Glass said. ``The Nets, for
instance, have got a $52 million payroll. It's almost impossible
for them to move many of those players, given the new rules. They
can't tell their fans we're changing things. So what are they going
to do? They're stuck with that team. Fans are savvy enough to
realize it's not going to get any better with some of these
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass, who represents mostly journeymen and role players, added:
``And then you have some of these GMs automatically giving out the
maximum, as if that's negotiating. It looks kind of stupid for an
agent to say that, but it's just crazy. Why do they automatically
get the maximum? Can't you say to a guy, just once: `I think you're
a really terrific player. I know I'm allowed to give you $9 million
a year, but I'm only giving you $7.2 million. And I'm sorry.' Are
you kidding me? That's where we're at. Instead, the Boston Celtics
won't be able to give Adrian Griffin an extra $25,000 because they
gave Antoine Walker every penny they have.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of fan interest, the NBA may still be in the midst of a
lockout hangover, less than a year after it nearly lost the season
to labor strife.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Steinberg, the agent for some of the NFL's premier
quarterbacks, said several months ago:``The NBA's battle should not
have been labor versus management. The competition should have been
for the alternate, discretionary leisure dollar out there. They
should have been battling the NFL and Walt Disney World for the
larger share of the pie. HBO. Video games. `The Water Boy.' That's
the competition. That's where the NBA hurt itself with its internal
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Stern, who always seems to point to the positive, seemed to
indicate last week that the league had rested somewhat on its
laurels, that creating pop-culture superstars 10 years ago did not
translate into marketing success for the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be the hungriest,'' he said. ``And although we
continue to preach hunger, some of our teams have gotten a little
bit complacent as the market changes. We're committed to being
current.''
</P>
<P>
   In defense of profit margins and interest, Stern also mentioned
that WNBA viewership is growing, that the league's Internet site,
NBA.com, is flourishing, and that the start of a 24-hour network,
NBA.com TV, has also helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBA television is up to 206 countries,'' Stern added. ``Every
indication of widespread consumer acceptance is very high. But we
have to make sure it's accompanied by strong attendance. That's
very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Until those pockets of uninhabited seats are filled and
attendance steadily rises, his league is still on the comeback
trail.
</P>

   Carlesimo Hangs On
</P>
<P>
   Danny Ainge's stepping down as coach of Phoenix to spend more
time with his family was a bit of a shock. And Brian Hill's being
relieved of his duties in Vancouver, where he coached an inferior
roster, was a mild surprise. But no development in the coaching
fraternity last week was more stunning than P.J. Carlesimo's
keeping his job.
</P>
<P>
   How Carlesimo, the forever-besieged Warriors coach, managed to
avoid being first to the guillotine is a testament to the fine line
in sports and perhaps to his own resilience.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 11 in Minnesota, Golden State was falling apart against
the Timberwolves in the first half, losing by 43-23 at one
juncture. The Warriors were about to suffer a bad loss, return home
with a 1-3 record on their road trip and fall to 2-14 overall.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Western Conference official who requested
anonymity, General Manager Garry St. Jean had arranged to speak
with Carlesimo last Sunday, relieve him of his duties and take over
the coaching duties on Monday. Like Rick Pitino, Don Nelson and Pat
Riley, St. Jean would have overseen the organization on the floor
and off it.
</P>
<P>
   Everything but the details of the news conference had been
worked out when Carlesimo's team suddenly found heart. John Starks
scored 27 points as Golden State outscored Minnesota by 81-36 the
rest of the way. The Warriors then parlayed a respectable 2-2 trip
into a thrilling victory over Miami at home on Tuesday for their
third straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the commotion surrounding his job, Carlesimo has
been oblivious to anything other than getting his team prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he deals with it,'' said one Warrior player
who requested anonymity. ``I couldn't sleep if I knew my job was on
the line every night. But he acts like it's just another day. P.J.
can grate on you, but he's a warrior. He just keeps going, no
matter what's going on around him.''

INVENTING A WORLD: HOW LIFE AND ART COLLIDED IN WILLIAM W. ADKINS'
DOMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PAUL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Every week or every
few days she'd drop by the lot where Adkins camped. She put on her
grubby clothes and drove down from her Briarcliff home to see what
new things came out of his head. She took him paper and pens and
Diet Cokes. Even a banana split for his birthday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doan sat with Adkins amid the weeds and his accumulated junk _
the dirty, old gun case he had salvaged from the trash, the odd
assemblages he had made of wood, rope and wire. Adkins explained as
best as he could each topological marvel that he put in front of
her, things such as the ``Sponge Show Honk Corn Gamble'' and the
``Giddly Gatt Cross Fill.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Adkins' visions had to do with making work easier. He
thought up tools to pick fruit and to mend fences and to sort
through trash. He made up sports and games.
</P>
<P>
   Often he turned the back side of the paper into what to him was
an official patent document.
</P>
<P>
   The everyday utility hinted at by Adkins' descriptions seemed
familiar only on the surface. Once you looked closely, the
inventions were skewed enough to be unrecognizable and, to most
people, nonsensical.
</P>
<P>
   But one person's indecipherable nonsense is another person's
art.
</P>
<P>
   Doan recognized Adkins' inventions as works of art. They had
loopy lines and vibrant, pulsating spaces. Adkins managed to
balance shadow and light to evoke a weird, three-dimensional
quality.
</P>
<P>
   The drawings also reflected an often humorous and quite
unconventional worldview. He was poking fun at the world. He was an
original. Doan realized an uncommon wit lived beneath the stink,
and she saw a kind of poetry in his unique language.
</P>
<P>
   Did he know what he was doing? Was he striving for attention?
Was his warped vision a kind of alternative-universe intelligence?
</P>
<P>
   Doan didn't know for sure, but she knew that Adkins was smarter
than he seemed: ``The real game that Bill is running is for people
like you and me to spend all this time studying it out,'' Doan
says.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars for years have asserted the validity of art that comes
from outside mainstream traditions. And in recent years the field
of ``outsider'' or ``visionary'' art, much of it created in
obscurity and isolation, has taken on a kind of go-go momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The outsider art market has a buy-low, sell-high reputation, but
Doan's interest wasn't in the money. It was in the rare opportunity
to be there at the creation of a bona fide outsider-art talent.
</P>
<P>
   Doan struck up a deal with Adkins. She gave him money _ $5 or
$10 or $20 at a time _ and Adkins gave her his drawings. He didn't
really care what she did with them. To this day he doesn't remember
a single one.
</P>
<P>
   In her mind Doan was becoming the caretaker of an incredibly
rich body of work. Someday, maybe in 20 years, her careful effort
would pay off and the art of William W. Adkins would be famous. Or,
in the unpredictable crapshoot of the art world, maybe not.
Repository of genius
</P>
<P>
   By midsummer 1995, about five months after she and Adkins had
met, Doan had amassed dozens of his works. When she stopped by for
a visit on July 4, he had three more finished patents for her. He
had finally caught on that she'd soon be showing his work to art
enthusiasts. He had one that he thought they'd especially like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tough Bakeialled Mask,'' he called it. He was inspired by a
Mad magazine cover that showed a screaming man and the headline,
``College Roommates from Hell.'' The face on his drawing was
``baked'' in hell, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The piece showed Doan something she hadn't yet seen in the work,
a sense of humanity, even pain: ``Emotion, energy, expression,''
she wrote in her notes. It was an epiphany for her, an entry into
Adkins' own, private, mad world.
</P>
<P>
   Doan empathized with Adkins' compulsive behavior. She thought
she was rather obsessive-compulsive herself. A lawyer who didn't
practice. A folk-art collector. A traveler. A mother of grown
children. She'd been passionate about art ever since her first trip
to Paris in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   She threw herself completely into everything she did _ the field
notes she made every time she visited Adkins, the catalog she was
compiling of every single one of his works. If she didn't do it,
who would? What she learned growing up in Hays, Kan., was, ``If
you're capable of handling something and it comes your way, then
you're supposed to step up to the task.''
</P>
<P>
   Doan started thinking about the nature of creativity and saw
Adkins as a repository of a kind of genius. ``No one else in the
world,'' Doan says, ``thinks like Bill does.''
</P>
<P>
   That August, Doan tested the waters for Adkins' art by renting a
booth at a weekend folk-art fair in Atlanta, a show devoted to the
work of living outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Some passers-by admired the work: ``Looks just like Leonardo,''
someone said, evoking the Renaissance inventor and artist. And a
handful of the pieces sold.
</P>
<P>
   Although Doan didn't come close to covering what it cost her to
be there, the numbers didn't really matter, because the most
important dealings were happening behind the scenes. For better and
for worse. Invented world upended
</P>
<P>
   Roger Coleman found himself in a philosophical quandary. He knew
there was a growing frustration in the neighborhood over Adkins'
trashy encampment on the vacant lot, and he was being pressured by
his board to do something about the squatter. He also knew he had
to balance his desire to let Adkins be with his concern over the
man's welfare.
</P>
<P>
   He checked around to see what kind of help there'd be for
Westport Bill.
</P>
<P>
   When Doan returned to Kansas City from Atlanta, she learned that
social workers had been visiting Adkins. And when, in
mid-September, she returned from another trip, she found that
Adkins' invented world on the lot had been upended.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements were being made to move him elsewhere, and
something had dulled both his vigorous behavior and his art-making
ability. She was pretty sure Adkins had been given some kind of
medication, a fact she soon confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Adkins had agreed to become a client of what
was then known as Network Rehabilitative Services, a private,
nonprofit agency that since has been merged into Truman Medical
Center. It operated a program to identify mentally ill homeless
people, to help them get housing and, after a psychiatric
evaluation, whatever care and services they needed.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatric drugs are a common and often effective tool in such
circumstances. They mitigate psychotic or delusional episodes. They
help give people the possibility of living more normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   Like many drugs of all kinds, psychiatric medications have
various side effects, too, not the least of which is the damper
they can put on the brain's creative functions.
</P>
<P>
   A caseworker helped Adkins find an apartment. Doan took him a
table at which he could sit and draw. He learned to make microwave
burritos for dinner and practiced taking the bus to counseling
sessions downtown. He seemed to understand the transformation he
was making. ``It was crazy living out there,'' he told an outreach
worker.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't entirely successful learning to live as most
people do. After a few months, he was transferred to a group home,
which offered more supervision and a better chance to keep him
clean.

INVENTING A WORLD: HOW LIFE AND ART COLLIDED IN WILLIAM W. ADKINS'
DOMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PAUL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _After moving indoors
Adkins' art-making dropped off, if not in quantity then noticeably
in quality. Doan blamed the drugs but knew there was more to it
than that.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``All artists want to communicate, and he had a desire to
communicate, too,'' Doan says. ``Once his living situation was
changed, his needs to communicate were different. The obsessive
nature of it wasn't the same.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the social workers' mission remained clear:
Adkins was far better off being off the streets and getting
treatment; his health was more important than his art.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, one day in late 1996, Adkins walked away from the
group home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found him covered in his own filth,'' Doan says,
``digging in garbage some place. He was out of it. They took him to
the Trinity Lutheran psych unit. By the time I got there, he was
fine....He said to me that day, `Here I am in another place.' &UR; ''
Outsider discovered
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Doan's trip to the Atlanta Folk Fest, Adkins'
``golden-age'' art had been getting enthusiastic support from
important quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Ricco//Maresca Gallery of New York, one of the nation's top
dealers of work by outsider and self-taught artists, had decided to
handle his drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Doan that summer had shipped more than a hundred of his pieces
to New York; the gallery bought some pieces outright from her and
held others on consignment. It had planned to pay Adkins a regular
stipend for new work. But, Doan says, when it became clear, after
September 1995, that the quality of his art declined, the gallery
pulled back from that.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ricco//Maresca began to create interest for Adkins'
best works. The gallery showed a few of his drawings at the
Outsider Art Fair in New York in January 1996. It also arranged for
a story about Adkins to appear in Raw Vision, an art journal that
showcases outsider art.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at a body of his work, you can see incredible
humor and wit,'' said Eugene W. Metcalf Jr., the scholar who wrote
that article. ``There's an intellectual waspishness. He plays all
sorts of intellectual tricks and cultural tricks and visual tricks
with his art.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, Ricco//Maresca put on the sort of coming-out
party that many artists, untrained or not, can only dream of: a
one-person show in New York. One of Adkins' drawings, ``Angrieyed
Apple Mask,'' even appeared in the calendar section of The New
Yorker magazine, a stamp of cultural attainment if there ever was
one.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins didn't attend the exhibit. At the same time that his
drawings were hanging on the gallery's walls, handsomely framed in
blond wood, he agreed to move into the nursing home where he now
lives with the support of Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Ricco//Maresca priced Adkins' works at $2,200 apiece. It has yet
to sell one, although Stephen Romano, the gallery manager, expects
that over time they will find appreciative owners. Adkins wouldn't
share in the proceeds anyway, since Doan had already paid him for
the work.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the New York exhibit, four of Adkins' drawings
appeared in a sprawling show, called ``The End Is Near,'' at the
American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore. And two of them _
``Your Plums-Fall-Hoe Down'' and ``Banana Split-Eating Shave'' _
made it into a colorful book based on the exhibit, which appeared
in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Just this fall Adkins was one of five outsiders in an exhibit at
Syracuse University's Lowe Art Gallery. And his work also has
joined the collection of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, where
it will be part of a major show in the works for July 2001. New
world, old memories
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, how are you spelling `alfalfa'?''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Doan stood over Bill Adkins' bedside table. He had set
out the seven drawings he made since her visit three days earlier.
She was taking notes, trying to make out Adkins' scrawled
descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins spelled it out for her: ``A-h-l-f-a-f-a-l, I believe. I'm
not too sure about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he added, his voice rising: ``This thing will work. I know
it will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Adkins' contraption sprawled all over a 28-by-22-inch sheet of
white poster board. It was titled ``Young Deer Catcher Mitt.''
Here's the idea: You slip it over your hand and you can feed a deer
an ear of corn or a bunch of alfalfa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught a deer by hand with an ear of corn one day,'' Adkins
said. ``He stayed until I let loose of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what,'' Doan said, ``all the things you've done that
have to do with deer, this is a new one on me. How did you happen
to think of this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Adkins said. ``It just popped into my head.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly three years that Adkins has lived in the nursing
home, Doan occasionally has taken him paper and pens, and every now
and then he has had some drawings to show her. Whether it's a
``setup'' to remove your shoe without bending over or the ``Young
Deer Catcher Mitt,'' they are drawn with a less-sure hand than the
often lyrical pieces he made in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike that prolific period, he now goes weeks or months
without making any drawings at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mind dies away,'' he says of his creative drought. ``The
mental gives out, and you have to wait till something comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   But every now and then it happens. The window blinds above his
neatly made bed are closed. The nursing-home noise around him falls
away. As he lies there on his side, it can become quiet as a
library.
</P>
<P>
   And then a memory floats up from the gray quiet in his head.
Eventually the memory turns into an urge to invent, to make a piece
of the world born of a one-of-a-kind vision. And after that,
sitting in his room, William W. Adkins says, ``I think I've got one
coming up.''

 &HT;    Hampton hammers Southern
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With about seven minutes left in Heritage Bowl IX,
Southern University's cheerleaders packed their bags and called it
a day. At least they put more effort into the outing than the
Jaguars did.
</P>
<P>
   Southern made no bones about the fact it wasn't overly thrilled
about making a fifth consecutive appearance at the Georgia Dome on
Saturday in the so-called ``Black College Super Bowl.'' The Jags
didn't want to be here, and they played that way.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off back-to-back, come-from-behind wins over its biggest
rivals before large crowds, Southern started slow against Hampton
University, never got going and fell 24-3 before 29,561.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Johnson passed for 171 yards and a touchdown and Vincent
Lewis had three interceptions as the Pirates, who finished third in
the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, beat the Southwestern Athletic
Conference champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, we just weren't ready to play,'' Southern coach
Pete Richardson said. ``I sensed it when we came out of the locker
room. It's tough to keep players up for three weeks in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's an advantage for our conference to come
back and play a game a week after our championship game. It's just
tough on kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jags (11-2) were on a high after thrilling wins over
Grambling in the Bayou Classic and Jackson State in last week's
SWAC title game, but soon came crashing down.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, 21-6 losers to Southern during the season, got
inspiration from an outside source. The Pirates (8-4) took it
personal after Richardson called them a ``third-rated team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how bad Southern wanted it, but we wanted it
really bad,'' said Johnson. ``We wanted to prove to everybody that
the comment that was made was a disgrace to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson stood by his charge.
</P>
<P>
   The MEAC's top two teams, Florida A&AMP;M and North Carolina A&AMP;T,
chose to chase a shot at the NCAA Div. I-AA playoffs over playing
in the Heritage Bowl, while the SWAC _ which instituted a title
game this season _ sends its champion.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, 4-2 in Heritage Bowls, says the concept is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you bill this as one of the biggest games in black
college football,'' Richardson said, ``you have to find a way to
get the two best teams playing in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, though, had no problem with the Heritage Bowl stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this is your last opportunity to play college football,
and the fact you're able to play it here _ this is great,'' said
Johnson, who had about 40 family members present.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars may have felt better about the whole scene had they
taken advantage of a golden opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   After gaining just 58 first-half yards yet trailing only 10-3,
Southern picked up that many after taking the second-half kickoff
and driving to the Hampton 9 yardline. But linebacker Corey Cason
made a diving interception of a tipped pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates responded with a 92-yard, 9:44 scoring drive to pull
away, and the party was soon on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a great feeling,'' said Hampton defensive back
Rashad Muyhee, a senior from Westlake High. ``I have friends and
family here who've never seen me play _ in high school or college.
This is great for black college football.''

 &HT;    Georgia Southern scores fifth national title
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chattanooga, Tenn. _ One year of agony finally ended for Georgia
Southern on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   After losing in last year's national title game to
Massachusetts, the Eagles added the school's fifth national
championship by routing Youngstown State 59-24 at Finley Stadium.
The Eagles (13-2) scored 28 unanswered points in the second quarter
and ended with the second-highest margin of victory in the 22-year
history of the Division I-AA championship game.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 20,052 watched All-American fullback Adrian Peterson
lead the way with 247 yards and three touchdowns. Georgia
Southern's option offense had its way against Youngstown State
(12-3), gaining 638 of its 655 total yards on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, who had lost to Youngstown State in three previous
meetings, turned the game into a rout in the third quarter after
Peterson's final touchdown pushed the lead to 45-17. Youngstown
State, which was seeking its fifth national title, could muster
little or nothing against the Eagles' defense after taking a 14-10
lead at the top of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the 55-43 loss to Massachusetts in last year's
championship game, when Hill and Peterson combined for seven
turnovers that helped kill the Eagles here a year ago, Georgia
Southern did not turn the ball over a single time.
</P>
<P>
   In his second appearance in the national championship game, Hill
became the third quarterback in school history to be so successful.
Former Eagles Tracy Ham guided the program to national crowns in
'85 and '86, and Raymond Gross followed suit in '89 and '90.
</P>
<P>
   Like last year's meeting here between Georgia Southern and
Massachusetts, this game early on took on the appearance of a
shootout. Less than 16 minutes into the battle, 24 points had
scored _ 14 of them by Youngstown State.
</P>
<P>
   But after falling behind 14-10 following a 3-yard touchdown run
by Penguins quarterback Jeff Ryan, Georgia Southern opened up its
offensive flood gates.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Peterson, who had 155 yards and two touchdowns at
halftime, the Eagles rolled to 28 consecutive points in the second
period. Peterson, who put his team up 17-14 on a 3-yard to captured
an 88-yard drive with 10:25 remaining in the second quarter, broke
five tackles on a 58-yard run to set another score.
</P>
<P>
   And shortly, topped another Eagles' drive of 57 yards of more
with a 22-yard blast of tackle, punter returner Anthony Williams
got in the scoring act when returned one 72 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of its 38-point offensive explosion, Georgia
Southern by halftime had amassed 342 yards of total offense. Hill,
who scored his team's first TD when he opted to keep on a play off
his right that netted 42 yards, completed his only pass of the game
for 17 yards.
</P>
<P>
   At that juncture, Peterson had not only had surpassed the
100-yard rushing for the 30th consecutive game, but he also
surpassed the Division I-AA single-season playoff rushing record he
established last year.
</P>
<P>
   When this rout was over, five different Eagles had scored,
including Peterson, Hill, Cunningham, punter return Anthony
Williams and backup quarterback J.R. Revere.
</P>
<P>
   The head-to-head battle between Adrian Peterson and Penguins
tailback Adrian Brown ended up no contest. Brown finished the day
with 160 yards and two touchdowns, but most of his yards came in
the first half.

 &HT;    No 2nd-half fade in '99 by George
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Since Eddie George left Ohio State with the
Heisman Trophy and joined the NFL in 1996, he has emerged as one of
the league's best running backs.
</P>
<P>
   George last week became the ninth player in league history to
rush for more than 5,000 yards in his first four seasons, joining,
among others, NFL greats Jim Brown, Earl Campbell, Eric Dickerson
and Walter Payton.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been one glaring omission on George's resume: a
playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston/Tennessee franchise finished 8-8 in George's first
three seasons with the team. But the Titans could end that drought
today by beating the Falcons in Adelphia Coliseum, which would
clinch Tennesee at least a wild-card berth.
</P>
<P>
   George, the 14th pick in the 1996 draft, is a big reason why
Tennessee has the league's fourth-best record at 10-3 with three
games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   George, 6 feet 3 and 240 pounds, rushed for 199 yards and two
touchdowns in a 21-14 victory against the Raiders on Dec. 9. It was
the highest rushing total in the NFL this season and the
second-highest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best effort I've seen since he's been here,''
Titans coach Jeff Fisher said. ``He ran possessed. He feels good.
He told me after the game last week that he could play another
three quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case in George's first three seasons. He seemed
to wear down in the second half of the schedule, so the Titans
would fade from the playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   George had only one 100-yard rushing game in the second half of
the 1996 season, three in the second half of '97 and one in the
second half of '98.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he has rushed for 100 yards or more in three of five
games since the midpoint of the season. He has averaged 110 yards
in those games and scored seven touchdowns. The Titans are 4-0 in
those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, I feel better this year than I have at this point
in the past,'' George said. ``I'm taking care of my body. I've just
made the decision to do what I have to do to be one of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   George is doing it against eight- and nine-man defensive fronts.
The Titans haven't had a passing touchdown in six games, with top
receiver Yancey Thigpen sidelined by an sprained ankle. Quarterback
Steve McNair, who missed six weeks after back surgery, is bothered
by turf toe and a sprained ankle and struggles throwing downfield.
</P>
<P>
   That means George is carrying much of the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the best I can be and that means doing the right
things in all phases of my career,'' George said. ``It's just about
understanding this is my career and doing all of those little
things. I just made the choice. Do you want to be average? Do you
want to be one of the great ones?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be as good as I can be and you can't just say that.
You have to do what's needed.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ht., wt.: 6 feet 3, 240 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Age: 26.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hometown: Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   _ College: Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   _ Career highlights: The ninth player in NFL history to rush for
5,000 yards in his first four seasons. ... George needs 85 rushing
yards to become only the fourth player to gain 1,200 or more in
each of his first four seasons. ... Gained 199 yards vs. Oakland on
Dec. 9, the highest total in the NFL this season. ... Was a
consensus All-American and won the Heisman Trophy at Ohio State in
1995.

<P>
   A paradox attends the parliamentary election in Russia this
Sunday. The issue that most concerns people outside Russia _ the
war in Chechnya _ is barely a matter for discussion among either
the candidates or the voters.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of country can hold a general election without
discussing a civil war whose needless brutality horrifies most
decent outsiders?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is a strange country, perhaps a uniquely
strange country.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the European states (bar Yugoslavia) that sloughed off
communism ten years ago, Russia has made the most uncertain
progress towards adopting democracy and the standards of behavior
usually associated with it.
</P>
<P>
   All the country's mainstream parties back the war, most of them
uncritically. The prime minister, Vladimir Putin, who has a beady
eye on the presidency due to fall vacant in the middle of next
year, has won popularity for his vigorous quest for military
victory.
</P>
<P>
   That the Chechens are unpopular is not surprising; they have all
too often lived up to their reputation for cruelty and violence,
now tinged with Islamic extremism.
</P>
<P>
   That Russians are concerned about terrorism and want to keep
their country intact is also understandable. Yet in most democratic
societies there would be protests about the indiscriminate and
disproportionate response of the Russian army to the Chechen
challenge; and, especially during an election campaign, there would
be debate about how to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   Not, it seems, in Russia. Few Russians seem even to question the
proposition that the only solution is the bloody reconquest of
Chechnya and the subjugation of its people.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps just as odd has been the virtual absence of serious
debate about policies of any other kind. Reform of Russia's
dreadful economy _ smaller now than that of the Netherlands _ has,
for instance, barely been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party on the left and assorted nationalists on the
Slavophile right would plainly like to recreate some kind of
Russian empire, though it is unclear how they would do it.
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism abounds, especially about the corrupt new order that
has replaced the coercively deadening old one. It is matched by
dismay at the degradation into which Russia has sunk, even though
most Russians _ Communists included _ know that a return to a
Soviet-style past is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral contest has, for the most part, been a matter of
dirty money, wild promises, defamation of character and the
promotion, with varying degrees of slickness and sophistication, of
personalities devoid of policies.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder then that the new Duma, the lower house of parliament,
will probably be much like the fairly awful old one.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of its deputies, led by the Communists, have been
hostile to President Boris Yeltsin, they have never quite collected
enough votes to impeach and oust him _ or the guts to risk losing
their seats in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists look set, once again, to gain the largest block
of seats, perhaps a fifth of the total. As before, out-and-out
reformers and liberals will do badly.
</P>
<P>
   As before, the pattern of new alignments will not emerge until
independents start to show their colors; though half the seats are
filled by parties competing on national lists, the other half, in
first-past-the-post constituencies, will contain many candidates,
especially from the remoter regions, whose allegiances will be
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, since the Duma's powers are weak compared with the
president's, the election is unlikely to produce a sudden dramatic
change in the way Russia is run.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Duma matters. It is supposed to make, scrutinize and
revise laws, in tandem with the president. It is supposed to draw
up a budget. It can sack prime ministers and reject new ones
proposed by the president. It can refuse to sign treaties. It can
stir up xenophobia and anti-western feeling, and generally be a
thorough nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   But the main point of interest in Sunday's voting is what it
will indicate about the summer's presidential election _ and about
the sort of Russia that the world is likely to have to deal with in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, any Communist success on Sunday will not be a guide
to next summer's race: the Communists' leader, Gennady Zyuganov,
looks incapable of extending his reach beyond a large minority of
resentful nostalgists.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the presidential candidates whose popularity will be
tested in Sunday's vote are Putin and Yevgeny Primakov, a former
prime minister (and, like the incumbent, also a former KGB man).
</P>
<P>
   Putin is standing above the Duma fray, though he has blessed a
small party called Unity; he is also Yeltsin's anointed heir.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's Fatherland-All Russia party, backed by Moscow's
powerful mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, has no big policy differences with
Yeltsin or Putin. But a Putin presidency would be likely, all the
same, to differ from a Primakov one.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, Putin has concentrated entirely, and with
chilling ruthlessness, on Chechnya. He has ties with some leading
economic reformers, and many businessmen think he might not be bad,
even if, as liberals fear, he sought to be a Russian Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the corrupt coterie around Yeltsin hope Putin would
protect them if he won. His fortunes, however, hinge entirely on
the outcome of the war _ his war _ in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is in poor health. He is tough and canny, and unlikely
to pursue reform with any zeal. But he might, as he did when he was
prime minister, try to bring down some of the more outrageous
business ``oligarchs'' who have so corrupted Russian politics.
</P>
<P>
   Both men might cooperate better with the Duma than Yeltsin has
done. Both would bring a new sense of authority to the Kremlin
after years of erratic behavior alternating with drift.
</P>
<P>
   But both suffer from that grievous Russian fault _ of seeing
politics, at home and abroad, as a zero-sum game in which any gain
for one side inevitably involves a loss, or even a humiliation, for
the other. Both might well make mischief in the world, threaten
neighbors and oppress regions seeking greater autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, neither would be easy for the West. What the current
campaign has most painfully brought out is Russia's moral and
political vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, a multi-party election, however crass, is infinitely
better than the tyranny that went before. But Russia is still far
from being a normal country.
</P>
<P>
   Its tragedy, after centuries of autocracy and 74 years of
mass-murder and ideological lunacy, is that too few of its people
realize that democracy and market economics alike can thrive only
if civic values _ honesty, equality before the law, a modicum of
compassion _ are nurtured at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the members of the Duma, old or new, nor Putin or
Primakov, let alone Yeltsin, understand that. Until they do, Russia
will remain horrible _ especially to its own people, the Chechens
foremost among them. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   A paradox attends the parliamentary election in Russia this
Sunday. The issue that most concerns people outside Russia _ the
war in Chechnya _ is barely a matter for discussion among either
the candidates or the voters.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of country can hold a general election without
discussing a civil war whose needless brutality horrifies most
decent outsiders?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is a strange country, perhaps a uniquely
strange country.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the European states (bar Yugoslavia) that sloughed off
communism ten years ago, Russia has made the most uncertain
progress towards adopting democracy and the standards of behavior
usually associated with it.
</P>
<P>
   All the country's mainstream parties back the war, most of them
uncritically. The prime minister, Vladimir Putin, who has a beady
eye on the presidency due to fall vacant in the middle of next
year, has won popularity for his vigorous quest for military
victory.
</P>
<P>
   That the Chechens are unpopular is not surprising; they have all
too often lived up to their reputation for cruelty and violence,
now tinged with Islamic extremism.
</P>
<P>
   That Russians are concerned about terrorism and want to keep
their country intact is also understandable. Yet in most democratic
societies there would be protests about the indiscriminate and
disproportionate response of the Russian army to the Chechen
challenge; and, especially during an election campaign, there would
be debate about how to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   Not, it seems, in Russia. Few Russians seem even to question the
proposition that the only solution is the bloody reconquest of
Chechnya and the subjugation of its people.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps just as odd has been the virtual absence of serious
debate about policies of any other kind. Reform of Russia's
dreadful economy _ smaller now than that of the Netherlands _ has,
for instance, barely been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party on the left and assorted nationalists on the
Slavophile right would plainly like to recreate some kind of
Russian empire, though it is unclear how they would do it.
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism abounds, especially about the corrupt new order that
has replaced the coercively deadening old one. It is matched by
dismay at the degradation into which Russia has sunk, even though
most Russians _ Communists included _ know that a return to a
Soviet-style past is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral contest has, for the most part, been a matter of
dirty money, wild promises, defamation of character and the
promotion, with varying degrees of slickness and sophistication, of
personalities devoid of policies.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder then that the new Duma, the lower house of parliament,
will probably be much like the fairly awful old one.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of its deputies, led by the Communists, have been
hostile to President Boris Yeltsin, they have never quite collected
enough votes to impeach and oust him _ or the guts to risk losing
their seats in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists look set, once again, to gain the largest block
of seats, perhaps a fifth of the total. As before, out-and-out
reformers and liberals will do badly.
</P>
<P>
   As before, the pattern of new alignments will not emerge until
independents start to show their colors; though half the seats are
filled by parties competing on national lists, the other half, in
first-past-the-post constituencies, will contain many candidates,
especially from the remoter regions, whose allegiances will be
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, since the Duma's powers are weak compared with the
president's, the election is unlikely to produce a sudden dramatic
change in the way Russia is run.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Duma matters. It is supposed to make, scrutinize and
revise laws, in tandem with the president. It is supposed to draw
up a budget. It can sack prime ministers and reject new ones
proposed by the president. It can refuse to sign treaties. It can
stir up xenophobia and anti-western feeling, and generally be a
thorough nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   But the main point of interest in Sunday's voting is what it
will indicate about the summer's presidential election _ and about
the sort of Russia that the world is likely to have to deal with in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, any Communist success on Sunday will not be a guide
to next summer's race: the Communists' leader, Gennady Zyuganov,
looks incapable of extending his reach beyond a large minority of
resentful nostalgists.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the presidential candidates whose popularity will be
tested in Sunday's vote are Putin and Yevgeny Primakov, a former

<P>
   It is tempting to dismiss this week's bash in Panama as the
first of many pointless parties for which the world is bracing
itself over the next fortnight.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that appears to be how the Clinton administration
wants it to be seen. Neither the president himself nor any of his
senior officials could find the time to be present when the United
States formally handed over ownership and operation of the Panama
Canal to the host country, fulfilling the terms of a treaty signed
in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   That is a shame. Admittedly, the United States' withdrawal has
been gradual, and Panama will not take charge of the canal until
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the main reason behind the sudden diary clashes _
which caused even the secretary of state to be absent _ is that the
Panama Canal Treaty is scarcely more popular today in the United
States than when it was approved by the Senate by just one vote.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the handover warn of multiple threats to the canal.
They are worried that it will fall under Chinese control, and that
its operation will be jeopardized by Colombian guerrillas or drug
traffickers _ or, to be blunt, Panamanians.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is only ten years ago this month that the United
States sent thousands of troops to invade Panama to topple the
unpleasant and undemocratic (though not especially threatening)
regime of General Manuel Antonio Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these worries are fantasies or the bogus fears of
partisan Republicans in Congress. Take the ``Chinese threat.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Panama leased the operation of container ports at each
end of the canal to Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong-Kong-based
multinational whose biggest shareholder is a friend of China's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Panama has no diplomatic relations with China (it
recognizes Taiwan), and Hutchison is a capitalist firm with no say
in the canal's operation. But even if it had one, and was a tool of
the Chinese, so what?
</P>
<P>
   As a big user of the canal, China shares with the United States
an interest in making sure it works efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's guerrillas may seem a more genuine threat. On Dec.
12, they chose to draw attention to themselves by attacking a
Colombian navy base close to the Panamanian border, reportedly
killing 45 troops.
</P>
<P>
   But that border is in remote jungle, some 300 kilometers (190
miles) from the canal. It has long been subject to incursions by
all sides in Colombia's wars _ with no discernible effect on the
canal.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, if there ever were a serious threat to the canal, the
1978 treaty would allow the United States to intervene. In fact,
there are two big reasons to welcome this week's handover _ as well
as one genuine worry.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Canal Zone and its military bases were a colonial
oddity, an affront to Panamanian and Latin American nationalism _
even if Panama's birth as a nation in 1903 was decisively assisted
by the United States for its own canal-building purposes, even if
its sense of nationhood is still a bit vague, and even if many
Panamanians now lament the loss of jobs at the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if the canal is to remain competitive in a world of
bigger ships, cheap air freight and potential alternatives (such as
a canal project in Nicaragua), it requires big investment,
especially to modernize and widen its huge locks.
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely to get that as a Panamanian business than as a
distant but cosseted outpost of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is no reason to doubt the ability of Panama's
officials to manage the canal (they have had plenty of practice).
Yet there are grounds for worry about whether the country's
politicians will let them do so.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, Panama has made progress towards becoming
a stable democracy. But corruption is still widespread, perhaps
more so even than it was under General Noriega.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that Panama's politicians will seek to milk the
canal's toll revenues and the assets the Americans are leaving
behind. Panama now has a big interest in making sure that this does
not happen, and so does the rest of the world. &QL;

   ``I feel about airplanes the way I feel about diets. They are
wonderful things for other people to go on,'' Jean Kerr, an
American dramatist, once quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Flying has become safer, faster and cheaper, but it seems ever
more stressful. Having successfully fought for increased
competition, to cut airfares, The Economist has now shifted its
attention to relieving the stress.
</P>
<P>
   One frequent cause is the noise that children, especially bored
ones, inflict on other travellers.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, we proposed that all planes should have child-free
zones, just like no-smoking zones: children (and parents) should be
confined to the back of the plane. As yet, sadly, no airline seems
to agree that children should be screened and not heard.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, we would like to raise another case of what
economists call a negative externality: i.e., something which is
nice for you but imposes costs on others. This is excessive
carry-on luggage.
</P>
<P>
   In America six out of ten passengers now take a suitcase on to a
flight, rather than check it in, three times as many as in 1990.
The result is delay, because flights take longer to board.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers trying to squeeze 3-foot suitcases into 2-foot
overhead bins hold up people trying to board behind them. Some
travellers have tried to take refrigerators, television sets and
even a stuffed moose head on board.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of both children and luggage could be solved in one
stroke by putting the children in the hold, to make more space for
carry-on luggage. But that, we concede, might be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, to reduce delays, most airlines are rightly imposing
stricter limits on the size or weight of bags that can be carried
on to planes.
</P>
<P>
   This has provoked outrage as passengers are forcibly separated
from their belongings at check-in. Understandably: if you put
luggage in the hold, you have to wait ages for it at the other end
_ if it shows up at all.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have experienced the nightmare of waiting at the
luggage carousel until it stops, with no sign of the suitcase you
checked in, it is clear why people prefer to lug their cases on
board.
</P>
<P>
   You took a flight from London to Tokyo; your luggage and your
smart clothes decided to hop on one to Los Angeles. Not an
externality, but certainly negative.
</P>
<P>
   In America only 0.5 percent of bags go missing, but if you are a
frequent traveller that risk is too high.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 150 frequent fliers found that two-thirds had
experienced some sort of delay or loss to their luggage in the
previous 12 months. And if luggage remains lost, your likely
compensation is paltry _ a maximum of $1,250 in America, regardless
of whether your clothes were bought at Wal-Mart or Armani.
</P>
<P>
   If airlines are to restrict carry-ons, therefore, they also need
to offer better compensation for delayed or lost luggage. At the
least they should extend frequent-flier miles to luggage as well as
its owner: if your suitcase travels to Tokyo via Los Angeles, you
should get triple frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, passengers could be made to pay if they want to
take extra luggage on board.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, given the frequent positive correlation between
the size of the traveller and the weight of his (yes, his)
carry-on, why not take a tip from Papua New Guinea?
</P>
<P>
   When flying within the country, a passenger used to be weighed
along with his luggage before boarding the plane. Fight the flab
and you can bring your bag on board. Airplanes and diets would then
indeed be closely connected. &QL;

 &HT;    Soldiers find friendly faces in trek through Atlanta airport
 &HT;    (With photos.)
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For five weeks, 19-year-old Joe Forinash of Beverly
Hills, Calif., has been marching in formation and rising to
reveille at Georgia's Fort Benning, where he is in Army basic
training.
</P>
<P>
   But this weekend, the young private, along with 20,000 more like
him from military posts all over Georgia, is getting a reprieve.
The soldiers are heading home for the holidays in Operation Exodus,
the largest annual movement of troops outside of combat situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to see my parents,'' Forinash said.
</P>
<P>
   The young soldiers are getting a reminder of pre-military life
at Hartsfield International Airport, where staffers and volunteers
with the United Service Organizations of Georgia are feeding them
homemade sandwiches, cookies and other goodies, wrapping their
Christmas presents, helping them untangle airline ticket snafus and
cheering them on their way.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a Santa Claus, 84-year-old George Proctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome them, tell them Merry Christmas and give them
candy,'' said Proctor, a USO volunteer for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Exodus family day assists thousands of military
dependents as they travel to join loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   The whole point of the USO, said Mary Lou Austin, who directs
the organization's flagship center at Hartsfield, is to supply the
troops and their families with whatever they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're mothers, counselors, cooks, social workers,'' she said.
Austin said the USO center will be open around the clock this
weekend and again for Operation Return in early January, when the
troops head back to their posts.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, clean-cut young men and women in green lined up at
the center for food, napped in the quiet room, read books in the
lounge and talked about going home.
</P>
<P>
   Pvt. Nicholas Johnson, 18, on his way to Milwaukee, has been in
basic training since September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got stuck longer because I had trouble doing pushups,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Each soldier has a story and the volunteers, mostly members of
Atlanta service organizations such as the Kiwanis club, are glad to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all so interesting,'' said Patt Duquemin of suburan
Atlanta. After wrapping a Faberge egg for one soldier, she sewed
buttons on for another. Her husband, retired Army Gen. Gordon
Duquemin, helped staff the center's welcoming post.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Maj. Benjamin Palacios, the top non-commissioned officer
with Army Headquarters at Fort McPherson in Atlanta, was at the
airport Saturday to wish each soldier a good journey. Palacios, who
joined the Army at 19, said he remembers the joys of holiday leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at them; they're so young,'' he said. ``Going home is
like heaven.''

 &HT;    Jan. 1 won't tell the full tale of Y2K
 &HT;    By George Bennett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than two weeks from the world's date with computer destiny,
it's hard to find anyone _ even among the original prophets of Y2K
doom _ who expects a midnight meltdown when 1999 rolls over to
2000.
</P>
<P>
   But while New Year's weekend should pass without
cyber-cataclysm, experts say low-grade inconveniences related to
Y2K could persist for weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, that means the worldwide Y2K guessing game
won't end on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world will be well into January before a considered
assessment can be made of Y2K's medium-term effects,'' says a
recent report by the United Nations' special Y2K council.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a myth to think that everything that's a Y2K problem is
going to show up Jan. 1,'' says Jack Gribben, the spokesman for
President Clinton's Council on Year 2000 Conversion. The federal
group plans to be in business through the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   While not expecting major disruptions on or after Jan. 1,
Gribben says some minor problems might not be apparent for two or
three weeks afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at the oft-cited GartnerGroup predict that only 8
percent of all Y2K system failures will occur within two weeks of
Jan. 1. Some failures won't happen until late 2001, the group says.
About 90 percent of these ``failures'' will be fixed within two
days, Gartner says.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts say it's inevitable that some date-change problems
will slip through in the billions of lines of computer code that
have been reprogrammed for Y2K. And the sheer volume of changes
makes it likely that some new glitches will be introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you fix something, you sometimes put in a fresh bug that
wasn't there before,'' says Massachusetts software consultant
Capers Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Doomsayers less doomful
</P>
<P>
   Jones was one of the earliest Y2K alarmists, and he's still a
little uneasy about some foreign countries and small businesses.
But he now expects nothing more than ``spotty and intermittent
problems _ not national problems _ that will probably affect 3 or 4
percent of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones doesn't plan any special preparations for New Year's Eve
and said he recently decided against buying a backup generator for
his Massachusetts home.
</P>
<P>
   Another early Y2K doomsayer, consultant and author Ian Hayes,
also dismisses New Year's catastrophism. But while Hayes isn't
stocking up on extra food or water, he says he'll be giving his
bills and financial statements extra scrutiny for the first few
months of 2000 because of possible Y2K-related errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's so focused on what's going to happen at midnight
... but that's not really the issue,'' says Hayes, who spoke at
what is believed to be the first major conference on the
date-change problem, back in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Another early doom-and-gloom lecturer, Canadian consultant Peter
de Jager, now plans to be sipping champagne on a transatlantic
flight at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Market fears mollified
</P>
<P>
   Even hard-core Y2K apocalypticist Gary North appears to have
softened slightly in his predictions now that the worldwide stock
market crash he expected ``months before Jan. 1, 2000'' hasn't
materialized. His Internet site once predicted a ``nightmare'' in
the first few minutes of Jan. 1. Now, his site says, ``things will
not break down all at once in early January unless the power grid
goes down and stays down.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Y2K pessimist, Wall Street strategist Ed Yardeni, still
predicts a Y2K-related recession during the first six months of
2000, but he says chances are improving that the recession will be
minor rather than major.
</P>
<P>
   And both Yardeni and Ed Yourdon, a computer consultant and
author of doomishTime Bomb 2000, note that the Y2K-fueled investor
skittishness they expected in the second half of 1999 hasn't
happened.

 &HT;    Dog fighting spreading from country to city
 &HT;    (With photos.)
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAYNE COUNTY, Ga. _ It's called a blood sport. But when police
raided a dogfight in southeast Georgia's Wayne County, what
officers found was more like a bloodletting.
</P>
<P>
   Two pit bulls competing in the evening's second fight were
slowly mauling one another. One had his teeth imbedded in the
other's throat. The plywood walls of the 10-by-10-foot wooden pit
were splattered with blood. The new tan carpet that covered the
concrete floor was saturated with gore.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested 66 people on the isolated farm near Jesup that
night, Nov. 19. Officers confiscated $39,000 that had been wagered
on the five scheduled fights. Afterward, though, came the hard job.
First, the officers put the badly injured dog that lost the second
fight out of his misery. Then they put the ``winner'' out of his.
</P>
<P>
   The raid highlighted the popularity of dogfighting in rural
Georgia, where it has been a macabre tradition for generations. It
is so pervasive that, after the raid, police received calls from
several women looking for their husbands. Every man had been at a
dogfight that night; the wives just weren't sure which fight had
been busted.
</P>
<P>
   But dogfighting has become more than a rural pastime. In Georgia
and across the country, police say, it is an increasingly common
hobby in urban neighborhoods, especially among members of street
gangs.
</P>
<P>
   And, thanks to the Internet, this shadowy subculture is reaching
new audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Kennels with names like ``Death Row'' and ``La Cosa Nostra''
offer to sell dogs bred from champion fighters' bloodlines. In chat
rooms and on message boards, dog owners discuss breeding and
fighting strategies. In online magazines, fans read the exploits of
the sport's greatest fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his five contract matches, he destroyed all,'' Pit Bull
Reporter magazine's online edition said in a typical dispatch about
a champion dog named Santa's Mongoose. ``The only one to live
jumped the pit in 15 minutes. He took dogs apart. Bite one got
their attention. Bite number two made them wish they were someplace
else. There never was a need for bite three.''
</P>
<P>
   Such fights are illegal in Georgia and in 46 other states. But
it is rare for charges to be filed unless police officers witness
the matches. Only one person is currently doing time in a Georgia
prison for dogfighting _ one fewer than for hijacking a bus. Ten
Georgians are on probation from dogfighting convictions.
</P>
<P>
   But police and animal-protection activists say the Georgia
General Assembly has a chance this winter to crack down on
dogfighting.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers will consider a bill that would make animal cruelty a
felony, punishable by a five-year prison sentence. Police could
file cruelty charges against owners of fighting dogs even if they
aren't caught in the act. A dog's injuries _ torn ears, gashes in
its throat, bite marks covering its body _ would provide enough
evidence to prove cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   New ways to combat dogfighting are needed, said Bill Garrett,
executive director of the Atlanta Humane Society.
</P>
<P>
   Like other animal abusers, Garrett said, the owners of fighting
dogs ``are like cockroaches. They do most of their work in the dark
and out of sight.''
</P>
<P>
   `Dogfights all the time'
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how widespread dogfighting is in Georgia.
But the Humane Society of the United States ranks Georgia as one of
the sport's most active states, along with California, Florida,
Louisiana and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogfighting is fairly prevalent,'' said Geoffrey Simmons, a
Humane Society official in California. ``It cuts across all
socio-economic boundaries. It simply is a sport that appeals to a
lot of people for a lot of different reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, ``there's a great deal more of it going on than
people realize,'' said Lee Sweat, the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation agent who led 50 officers on the Wayne County raid.
``We hear about dogfights all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But few of the sport's fans are willing to discuss it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to the negative light that the media tends to portray
these dogs in on a regular basis, I highly doubt that anyone would
be interested in discussing anything with any form of media,'' Tim
Murphy of Jefferson, Ga., who publishes an Internet magazine called
Sporting Dog Online, wrote in an e-mail to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's magazine features detailed blood lines of fighting
dogs. It also posts the standard rules for dogfighting. But
fight-related content, the publication says, is ``for entertainment
purposes only.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, after declining to talk with a reporter, Murphy sent
an e-mail to pit bull and dogfighting enthusiasts across the
country, warning of possible scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are these types of people looking for a story about this
breed all the time,'' he wrote, ``so please keep this copy and
remember the (reporter's) name in case you are contacted.''
</P>
<P>
   `Not friendly people'
</P>
<P>
   The secrecy that surrounds dogfighting makes the laws
prohibiting it tough to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true when it comes to so-called
streetfighters. Often members of criminal gangs, these dogfighting
enthusiasts cruise their neighborhoods with their dogs, looking for
fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it's impromptu,'' said Lt. Larry Gibson of the
Clayton County Police Department's animal control unit. The fights
often take place ``right in the middle of the street, right in
somebody's front yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gibson said, ``it's very hard to catch them.'' Even if a
neighbor calls police, the fights are usually over when officers
arrive. And witnesses are often too afraid of the dogs' owners to
testify against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these are not friendly people,'' Gibson said of the
streetfighters. ``The witnesses have a legitimate fear. ... Eighty
percent of the people I've dealt with have gone on to bigger and
better crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, other dogfighting fans revel in their sport's long
history and what they see as the nobility of the American pit bull
terrier. Streetfighters put any breed of dog that will fight into
matches. But traditionalists remain loyal to the pit bull _ a breed
that, they say, is as gentle with humans as it is aggressive toward
other dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the impromptu street fights, many pit bull matches are
planned for weeks or months. And they are widely, if quietly,
advertised.
</P>
<P>
   The 66 people arrested in Wayne County came from all over
Georgia and from six other states. The fight was promoted by a club
called ``20/20'' and was held on a farm where the club's secretary
lives. To promote secrecy, spectators had been told to assemble on
another farm. From there, they were led to the fight location by
the club's chief of security.
</P>
<P>
   Each fight was expected to last as long as two hours. Each would
continue, the GBI's Sweat said, ``until one dog wins by either
killing the other dog or the other dog's so incapacitated he can't
fight any more.''
</P>
<P>
   All 66 who were arrested are free on bond, awaiting trial. Few
had ever been in trouble with the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their own little parts of the world, they're not the street
gang drug dealers,'' Sweat said. ``Probably everybody was gainfully
employed. They all drove nice vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   All, too, enjoyed what Sweat called ``the perverse excitement of
watching one animal tearing another one up.''
</P>
<P>
   A dogfighter's story
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Clark watched his first dogfight when he was 7. It was
the same year he began breeding pit bulls.
</P>
<P>
   With family friends, he went to fights ``all over Georgia,
Florida, Alabama, Texas,'' recalled Davis, now 28. ``It happens
everywhere in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The early exposure led to a lifelong enchantment with the sport
_ a fascination that ultimately brought Davis a dubious
distinction: He is the only person serving time in a Georgia prison
for dogfighting.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't start out fighting the dogs he raised, Davis said
during an interview at the Carroll County Prison, where he is
serving one year of a five-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pit bulls, when they first started breeding them, were bred
for their gameness _ not to stop fighting,'' Davis said. ``Like
anybody else, I wanted to breed the best.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past two decades, he said, he has bred about 1,000
pit bull puppies. Each, he said, sold for $400 to $500.
</P>
<P>
   Davis wouldn't say when he started putting his dogs in fights.
But he said that before his arrest, he had success with a
particularly strong fighter he had bred. He named the dog Silkkthe
Shocka, after the rapper.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, Davis put Silkk the Shocka in a fight
against a dog with a lesser reputation. The other dog's owner
videotaped the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Davis and several friends were in Friendship
Park in Clarkston, watching the tape on a video camera. A police
officer drove up _ thinking, Davis said, that the group was smoking
marijuana. After seeing what was on the tape, the officer charged
Davis with dogfighting. He pleaded guilty last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in prison, wearing a white uniform a shade duller than
the white concrete walls, Davis recalled a world of large bets _
``maybe five G's, 15 G's'' _ and fight purses that reached $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his conviction, he expressed little remorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going by the law books, yeah, I did something wrong,''
he said. ``But in society, the way people live today, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitting one dog against another isn't cruel, he maintained, ``no
more than it is cruel to have two men in the ring boxing. You take
care of the dogs. They have a choice to fight like a man has a
choice to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis is scheduled to leave prison Feb. 4. A condition of his
probation is that he own no dogs for another four years.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor asked whether he would wait that long to resume
dogfighting.
</P>
<P>
   A smile crossed Davis' face as he replied, ``On or off the
record?''

THE DECADE OF THE '80S WAS DOMINATED BY THE ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The future looked
bleak for the United States at the beginning of the 1980s.
<TEXT>
<P>
   We were exhausted by the fallout from the Vietnam War and
Watergate. Inflation was high _ 13.5 percent _ and Americans'
confidence was low.
</P>
<P>
   The attitude of many was reflected in the Jan. 20, 1981,
inaugural address of the new president, Ronald Reagan:
</P>
<P>
   ``These United States are confronted with an economic affliction
of great proportions. We suffer from the longest and one of the
worst sustained inflations in our national history.... It threatens
to shatter the lives of millions of our people. Idle industries
have cast workers into unemployment, human misery and personal
indignity.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an inauspicious beginning to a wrenching 10 years that,
in hindsight, set up the country for the tremendous economic gains
it is now producing.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. industries transformed themselves _ snatching each other up
and sloughing off managers and workers, but then creating jobs and
becoming strong global competitors. Deregulation reigned, and union
power declined. The government cut taxes and strengthened defense,
but ran up a massive debt. The stock market revived, crashed and
revived again.
</P>
<P>
   By decade's end, however, free-market economics would vault the
United States back to its place as the premier economy, and set the
world, well, free. At least free to own things.
</P>
<P>
   A growing intolerance of repressive regimes and a growing
interest in consumer products converted practitioners of communism
into devotees of capitalism. Democracy of sorts was the by-product.
</P>
<P>
   Americans did not even see the fall of communism coming. We were
worrying about jobs, mortgage rates, failing banks, AIDS, cocaine
and failing marriages.
</P>
<P>
   We realized capitalism had triumphed with the fall of the Berlin
Wall in November 1989. We caught it on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Berlin wall came down, it sent a message to all but
North Korea and Cuba that markets had won,'' said Robert Litan of
the Brookings Institution. ``Even China has shrunk its state-owned
industries and allowed markets to grow outside of that.'' Debate
over Reagan
</P>
<P>
   When the decade began, the U.S. economy could not whip Japan,
not to mention communism. The country we vanquished in World War II
was selling us a future in which it was the economic world power.
</P>
<P>
   We found Japanese cars more reliable and their electronics more
desirable. They lectured us on quality, lessons they had learned
from American W. Edwards Deming.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan proposed restoring America's economic dominance by
cutting taxes and building a strong defense. He preached taking
personal responsibility and cutting our reliance on the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan was popular with a majority of Americans. He also ignited
visceral feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Some credit him with reviving the economy and defeating the
Soviet Union. Others think he falsely professed a concern for
``family values'' while his administration turned its back on the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Miller, an economics professor at Rockhurst College and
an old-line Kennedy Democrat, said he initially could not imagine
Reagan as president. But Miller became a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe Reagan, more than any other individual,
almost single-handedly is responsible for the fabulous economy we
are enjoying,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthiest Americans saw the most dramatic cuts in their tax
rates. Government spending went up, not down, creating record
federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the success of his tax cuts and supply-side economics lifted
all boats. The eventual results generated the jobs for minorities
and women that eluded the job programs that grew out of President
Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result we have had our longest postwar economic
expansion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To Marcus Raskin, co-founder of the Institute for Policy
Studies, Reagan's politics were a scripted sham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was a divisive president culturally,'' said Raskin.
</P>
<P>
   He made people feel it was OK to get rich without worrying about
the plight of others, that narcissism was ``a good basis for public
policy,'' Raskin said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years after Reagan was elected president, the chest
beating from both sides rings hollow. Recent economic data suggest
our current economic boom had its beginning with some of the Reagan
policies but was propelled by other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Crippling inflation was tamed by Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker's strangling interest rates. Productivity improvements
started after the Reagan tax cuts, as supply-siders predicted. Yet
greater productivity growth followed tax increases in 1990 and
1993.
</P>
<P>
   While a call for a smaller federal government was at the center
of the Reagan philosophy, it did not shrink until the Clinton
presidency, said Richard B. McKenzie, a Reagan supporter and author
of What Went Right in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a record no one wants to acknowledge,'' McKenzie said.
``The Democrats don't want to say they out-Reaganed Reagan, and the
Reaganites don't want to acknowledge it for the same reason.''
Recipe for a remaking
</P>
<P>
   So how did America in the 1980s remake itself into the world's
dominant economic power?
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation of industries like airlines and long distance, the
reorganization of companies to do more work with fewer employees,
the emergence of the personal computer and the creation of a nation
of stock investors all came together into a beam of economic
brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   The icon of deregulation was the breakup of AT&AMP;T. It was broken
into eight independent companies and in exchange was allowed to
compete in unregulated industries, like computers.

 &HT;    Tourist haunt masks bitter New Orleans infighting
 &HT;    (With photos.)
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ On a blustery December day in the French Quarter,
Jackson Square is alive with free entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-piece band plays jazz to one side of St. Louis
Cathedral. Artists paint pictures of courtyards and oak trees
sagging with Spanish moss. Tarot card readers entice the few
tourists who are in town to have a reading.
</P>
<P>
   This scene, which to visitors seems quintessentially New
Orleans, is ground zero in a bitter turf war that pits residents
against entertainers and entertainers against one another. And this
is no mere war of words: There have been lawsuits, shoving matches,
arrests, even firebombings. Task forces have formed and disbanded,
laws and ordinances have been passed, then overturned or ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Even the soothsayers can't predict how the struggles will be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite sad that people can't live in harmony and peace,''
said Mystic Goddess, a psychic who sets up her table in front of
the church doors.
</P>
<P>
   Residents say the quarter, one of the nation's oldest and
best-preserved residential districts, is being turned into a
Disneyland entertainment center catering to the 11 million annual
tourists and the businesses that feed off them. They have filed
lawsuits complaining that the city does not enforce zoning laws by
allowing amplified music in residential zones. Jackson Square, for
example, is residential.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the pending litigation, city officials declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Cathedral parishioners say the brass bands disturb
services. The Legislature passed a noise ordinance that applied to
areas around churches and hospitals statewide, but it was struck
down in court as too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street from the square, two bars at the French Market,
which is city property, blare music from live bands, disturbing
Stuart Smith and his neighbors. Smith, an attorney, has filed
several suits, one last week, to get the city to turn down the
volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those bars are not zoned for live entertainment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gazebo Bar and the Market Cafe contend that because they've
been allowed to have live music for decades, they should be able to
continue. George Mellen of the Gazebo Bar tried to get a legitimate
live entertainment license last year, and Smith went to court to
stop him.
</P>
<P>
   Mellen responded by hurling Molotov cocktails onto Smith's
Mercedes and into the courtyard of his 5,000-square-foot home.
Mellen and an associate were sentenced Thursday to three years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Mellen this year sold the bar to a municipal judge and a city
assessor, who were able to get the live entertainment license that
eluded Mellen. Smith filed a suit against the city last week
claiming the license is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's been allowed to happen in the French Quarter is
disgraceful,'' Smith said. ``There are right and wrong places to
party in this city, as in every city. It's destroying the
residential base of the quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new issue. In the early 1990s, the quarter was
listed three years in a row as one of the nation's most endangered
historic treasures by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The trust cited encroaching commercialism as the chief threat.
Lawsuits were filed, and a city task force in 1991 was to try to
make peace between residents and revelers.
</P>
<P>
   The revelers seem to be winning: The French Quarter's population
has declined sharply in a decade, from 7,000 to 3,000. Meanwhile,
tourism is at an all-time high, and bars, T-shirt shops and street
entertainers seem to operate by their own rules.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Tucker, an artist selling paintings in Jackson Square since
1971, said he doesn't mind street music but thinks it is
inappropriate so close to homes and the cathedral. He also thinks
it's unfair that only artists must get a city license to operate
and must pay taxes on their earnings. Musicians, mimes and other
entertainers have no such requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just too loud,'' Tucker said over the bang of a drum
and the blare of a trumpet. ``Public activity should enhance the
residential nature of the area. We feel the artists enhance the
area, the musicians do not.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the tarot card readers. Taking advantage of the
city's lax regulations, psychics in recent years have come from all
over the country to set up along the square. Now more than 50 vie
for the limited space.
</P>
<P>
   In October, two psychics got into a fight over a prime spot.
William Alobar Greywalker went after newcomer Margaret Avalon
Nemith with a folding chair. She twisted her ankle running away.
Police were called. The case will go to court in February, with a
mime as the key witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe the harassment,'' said Mystic Goddess,
another relative newcomer who came to Nemith's aid. ``The other
readers call me a transvestite! And residents say they don't like
the way we look or how loud we are. Am I loud? Is a mime loud?''
</P>
<P>
   But Mystic Goddess sides with residents when it comes to the
brass band.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're offensive, obnoxious,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence and Doreen Ketchens have been playing with whoever else
comes up with an instrument for 10 years in Jackson Square.
</P>
<P>
   On a wintry afternoon, they are attracting all the attention. A
crowd of tourists lingers, sometimes for hours, to listen to the
trombone, the tuba and a little crooning.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis and Lou Zanner, visiting from Sonoma, Calif., were
surprised to hear that anyone would object to the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, hamburger!'' Phyllis Zanner said. ``Where's the fun in
life anymore? Tell the residents to go somewhere where it's quiet.
This is New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   Doreen Ketchens agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music has been here for centuries,'' she said. ``This has
always been a public square. Anyone who came and looked at
apartments here and moved here knew there was music. To come in and
try and change the culture is hypocritical.''

 &HT;    Music helps Sam Taylor conduct a bittersweet life of
independence with autism
 &HT;    (Moving in two takes. With photos. Moving in (a) national and
(l) lifestyle categories.)
 &HT;    By Jim Dyer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sam Taylor walked through downtown Atlanta untangling
public telephone cords, straightening strange men's ties and
putting order in a world he could never understand.
</P>
<P>
   He loped down the streets, his left pinkie finger extended on
even blocks and his right pinkie on odd ones. In his wallet, he
carried a few dollar bills that he'd starched and pressed to smooth
out the wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   As he marched, he hummed a rhythmic chant in time with his gait.
It spilled out loudly, drowning out the din of the streets as if it
were off-key.
</P>
<P>
   Sam stopped and memorized the text of posters, plaques and
historical monuments, and struck up conversations with passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know any Secret Service agents to the president of the
United States?'' he asked a man carrying a briefcase. The man
squinted in confusion and went on without replying. Sam raised his
finger and mumbled, ``Check. Top secret. Top secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Two blocks later, he asked a woman if she knew Ted Turner. When
she furrowed her eyebrows, he rattled off the history of Turner's
TBS station, its earlier years as WTCG and WJRJ and its programs.
</P>
<P>
   She smiled _ there was something innocent in his voice _ and
commented that Sam must be an expert on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am. I am. I am am am am am am ...'' he said, his voice
booming from his 6-foot-3 frame like a jackhammer. ``I'm also a
Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets fan. Been one my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing on his journey, he walked across to Underground
Atlanta where he passed a woman in tight jeans and lacy blouse
leaning against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, there,'' she said alluringly. ``You want a date?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, thank you, ma'am. I'm going to see the governor,'' he
replied and walked past. Ten feet away he turned and shouted back
to her: ``Don't forget to turn your clock back one hour to Eastern
Standard Time.''
</P>
<P>
   On this warm autumn afternoon, the world seemed hospitable,
rather than hostile. People seemed friendlier, and Sam, a
40-year-old autistic man, was enjoying himself.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the 6-foot fence that confined the strange blond boy
who screamed and threw glass milk bottles and bit himself. Gone
were the weeks at Milledgeville's state mental institution, where a
5-year-old Sam learned how to curse, smoke and endure cigarette
burns without crying. Gone were the doctors who said Sam would
never be normal or learn to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sam exceeded the experts' predictions, he still suffers
from autism, an incurable neurological disorder characterized by
extreme withdrawal, impaired communication and emotional
detachment. It affects between 1 and 2 of every 1,000 newborns.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he struggles to be as independent and self-reliant as the
people he passes in the streets. He wants to drive, to live alone,
to have a girlfriend, to go to college.
</P>
<P>
   Goals attained in a different world from Sam's, a world just out
of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not autistic anymore,'' he often shouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam is very bright _ a walking database of facts and
information, but he can't process it,'' said Nan Pigot, a
58-year-old cousin who lived with Sam's family for several years
when Sam was young.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a life of frustration because he wants to be like
other people but he can't, and deep down he knows he can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The music child
</P>
<P>
   As a baby, Sam rarely slept and never cried. He became stiff and
robotic when his mother picked him up or tried to nurse him.
</P>
<P>
   So little was known about autism during Sam's first 10 years
that his family searched in vain for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were days I wanted to cry,'' said his mother, Lenora
Taylor. ``I prayed to God to show me where the button was that I
pushed to make him normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, though, there had been the music.
</P>
<P>
   Sam's parents were professional musicians, and his mother
noticed early on that when she sang or played music, Sam was
transformed from an indifferent infant to a warm cuddling baby.
</P>
<P>
   As a young boy, he spent hours cuddling against the washing
machine, absorbing the vibrations and humming in key to the
machine.
</P>
<P>
   For years he didn't speak, but adeptly hummed jingles from TV
and radio in perfect pitch. If his family sang jingles off-key, Sam
grew angry and corrected them with his own humming.
</P>
<P>
   By humming and chanting, Sam was imposing his own rhythm on the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Like most autistic children, he grew up socially withdrawn and
unable to process emotions outside of anger and frustration. He
didn't laugh at jokes because he didn't understand humor. He didn't
cry because he didn't understand sadness. When his grandmother
died, he walked uncomfortably among the mourners at her funeral and
finally approached his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to cry,'' he said. ``If I put an onion under my eye,
will I cry?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, his mother took him to the first national conference on
autism in Washington. Sam distanced himself from the other autistic
children and spent the day conversing with adults, especially those
he perceived to be important.
</P>
<P>
   He needed absolute order and symmetry in his world. Little
things, like toothbrushes not facing the same direction, sent him
into explosive tantrums. He often intentionally injured himself or
destroyed things in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Sam's disruptive behavior put intense pressure on the family.
For years, his two older brothers watched most of the basic
parental support being redirected toward Sam. Normal family outings
to restaurants or movies were impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The family's unity began to fray and his mother and father
separated and eventually divorced. Sam took it hard and blamed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did I have to be born autistic?'' the 14-year-old shouted
at his brother when his father moved out.
</P>
<P>
   But through music and his mother's persistence, Sam eventually
learned to read and write, and eventually attended special
education courses in school. He had rare gifts of perfect pitch and
photographic memory, but he still had difficulty fitting in.
</P>
<P>
   When the outside world became too frustrating for him, Sam would
sit on the carpet or in bed, head tilted to one side, and hum. He
closed his eyes and smiled, seemingly lost in another world while
he rocked back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a special moment between Sam and himself, a time when
he seemed at ease and was not screaming or destructive,'' said his
brother Jeff Taylor, 44, a professional musician.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called it 'Sam's Song.'''The coach
</P>
<P>
   Every Wednesday evening, Creative Community Services, an
organization that provides supported home care for disabled adults,
takes Sam to a bowling alley with about two dozen disabled adults
with autism, mental retardation or schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   But Sam never bowls. Just as he did as a child, he distances
himself from his peers. Sam sits alone, smoking cigars and eating
double cheeseburgers and french fries.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours, the group laughs and shouts and bowls. They share
Cokes and candy and give each other tips and pats on the back.
</P>
<P>
   From his solitary table, Sam looks down at the group with cold
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not like them,'' he says, picking up french fries with
alternating hands _ first the right, then the left _ and placing
them in his mouth. ``I'm not autistic anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Once or twice during the evening, Sam walks behind the lanes and
claps his hands loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go. Let's go. LET'S GO!'' the self-appointed coach
shouts.
</P>
<P>
   He once chastised a young, mildly retarded man who was teasing
one of the Creative Community Services employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you have to be yelling so loud?'' the man snapped back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm the coach, and you have to do what I say,'' Sam
shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Sam's never bowled before, but he understands the importance of
a coach. Although he has higher abilities than most of the
developmentally disabled adults on the bowling team, he couldn't
function in the adult world without a coach for work and one for
home.
</P>
<P>
   His job coach from Briggs &AMP; Associates helps map out his
professional life, getting him job interviews, helping employers
train him, dictating how he should behave with coworkers and
customers. His home coach from Creative Community Services helps
organize his personal life, taking him to appointments, to the
grocery store, telling him how much money he can spend and what
types of food he should buy.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, Sam feels the support cuts into his lifelong goal
of being normal and independent. His two older brothers are married
and have families, good jobs, cars and independence.
</P>
<P>
   But everywhere Sam goes, people _ his family, his job coach, his
home coach _ dictate what he should buy, where he should work, how
he should live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam is smart enough to know that he's not running his own
life,'' his mother said. And it frustrates him.
</P>
<P>
   He can't even buy a can of tuna fish in oil without getting a
lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just try the tuna in spring water,'' his home coach, Kathryn
Flight, explained recently at Sam's neighborhood grocery store.
``There's less calories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a right to be fat,'' Sam shouted, his 256-pound body
tensing up. ``I do. I do. I do-do-do-do-do-doooo! You're trying to
violate my rights.''
</P>
<P>
   She tried to reason with him about eating healthy, but Sam had
heard enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fed up with everybody fussing,'' he said. ``I'm an adult
and registered voter and I have a right to eat what I want and live
alone and drive a car and do what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   First job
</P>
<P>
   When Sam walked up on stage in 1978 to receive his high school
diploma in special education, the entire senior class from
Atlanta's Northside High School gave him a standing ovation. It was
a glorious moment for the 19-year-old and his family.
</P>
<P>
   But 11 years would pass before Sam would find much meaning in
the adult world. He wandered the streets, worked in sheltered
workshops for developmentally disabled adults, and earned pocket
money by walking the neighbor's dogs or cutting the grass. He
looked enviously at his older brothers Bud and Jeff, who moved out
and landed jobs at symphonies. Bud plays for the Columbus and Macon
symphonies, and Jeff freelances for the Lyric Opera Symphony of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Briggs &AMP; Associates landed Sam a job as a bagger at the
Kroger store off Roswell Road near Chastain Park. Sam was elated.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, he arrived dressed in his Sunday best _ blue slacks,
shirt, tie _ and carrying a black leather briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   During training, his managers told him to be quick and polite.
Every time he bagged groceries, they said, he needed to ask the
customers their bag preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like paper or plastic, ma'am?'' Sam asked his first
customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plastic, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, after filling her first bag, Sam turned to her
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like paper or plastic, ma'am?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plastic,'' she replied. ``I already said plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sam loaded up the second bag, he asked again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like paper or plastic, ma'am?''
</P>
<P>
   His managers sighed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam took things extremely literal,'' said Gary Libowsky, the
store manager at the time. ``We had to make sure we were talking on
the same level with him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first few months, Sam became obsessed with making sure
customers were happy and that the store attracted as many shoppers
as possible. One afternoon, coworkers had to frantically pull him
out of the middle of Roswell Road as he directed lanes of angry
motorists into the store's parking lot. He was also told not to
yell at people who said they preferred to shop elsewhere. He
followed Kroger's stock daily and whenever it fell on the market,
he'd run into work the next day and demand to speak with the
company's president in Cincinnati, Ohio, to inform him of the loss.
</P>
<P>
   After working through the initial difficulties, Sam's
supervisors discovered he was reliable, never late, always eager to
work and extremely personable with customers.
</P>
<P>
   In his first six months, Sam was named Kroger employee of the
period.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his reward, he met the company president, Atlanta
Mayor Maynard Jackson, and Gov. Joe Frank Harris at the state
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Sam basked in the attention. Never before did he feel so
accepted in the world. Since his youth, Sam was always fascinated
with VIPS.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was seeking approval,'' his mother said. ``Talking to them
made him feel accepted and important and, in a sense, normal.''
</P>
<P>
   But after winning the award and meeting the governor, Sam's
attitude changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have autism anymore,'' he defiantly told his job
coach. Sam swaggered around work like he was invincible. His
behavior began to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   His photographic memory became a curse. When he carried out
customers' groceries, he remembered their names, the type of cars
they drove, the county where they lived, even the license plate
numbers. Women began complaining that Sam was stalking them.
</P>
<P>
   His job coach told Sam to talk only about work, weather or
sports with customers, but Sam found loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure was hot yesterday,'' he began asking women. ``What
sort of lingerie did you wear to bed last night?'' Trouble at work
bled over to his private life.
</P>
<P>
   He met prostitutes. They picked him up every Friday when he was
paid in cash and persuaded him to buy them fancy clothes and
dinners at lavish restaurants. When he woke up Saturday morning, he
was broke. He began wandering the streets, going to strip clubs,
sometimes returning home after 2 a.m. His mother grew worried and
both she and his job coach tried to intercede.
</P>
<P>
   But Sam became more obstinate. He didn't need anyone's help, he
told them. After all, he was an award-winning employee who knew he
wasn't autistic anymore.
</P>
<P>
   At work, his behavior worsened. When he was brought into
disciplinary meetings with the manager, he claimed that his rights
of free speech were being violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam got too big for his britches,'' Libowsky recalled.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1995, after five and a half years of working at Kroger,
Sam was fired.
</P>
<P>
   The new job
</P>
<P>
   Today when Sam wakes up to shower, shave and dress, he does so
in his own apartment. When he sets off for work, it's not just for
any job. He works for the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep the blinds closed,'' he shouts at his roommate, also a
developmentally disabled adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calm down, Sam,'' his roommate replies. ``I'm just looking
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them closed,'' Sam yells. ``I do, I do. I do do do.''
</P>
<P>
   With a bowl full of Nesquik chocolate-flavored cereal and whole
milk, Sam sits down in his recliner to have breakfast and watch
Channel 11. There's never a deviation. Recliner. Channel 11.
Nesquik. Newspapers and magazines that he's read and memorized are
strewn about the room. World Championship Wrestling star Goldberg
glowers down from a poster in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Sam hums as he shovels spoonfuls of cereal into his mouth. He
closes his eyes while he chews.
</P>
<P>
   On his way outside, he checks to make sure he has everything he
needs: Wallet. Keys. Airhorn.
</P>
<P>
   He sits on a small wall alongside Ashford Dunwoody Road and hums
while waiting for the 29 MARTA bus. Cars whiz past in the rush hour
traffic. Drivers honk at each other.
</P>
<P>
   The noise disrupts Sam's internal rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   He pulls out his airhorn and blasts back at the cars.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chamblee MARTA Station, he transfers to the southbound
train and gets off at the Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   When he reaches his office across the street, he greets his
boss, Charlotte Hankins, grabs a large stack of papers and begins
filing the names of past ticketholders. He flips through the
papers, memorizing a special code for the ticketholder's home
location, and meticulously arranges them in neat stacks on his
desk. He then sorts them into stacks of 25 for telemarketers on the
day and night shifts.
</P>
<P>
   His job coach at Briggs &AMP; Associates knew that because of his
family's background in music, Sam would feel at home working with
the symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus Sam has some rough edges, and I thought that the art
world would be a little more accepting,'' Lee Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   When Sam told his family about the new job, he could hardly
contain his excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen him that excited in a long time,'' his mother
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Hankins lauded Sam's skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great worker and very well liked,'' she said. ``He has
his days, but so does everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Sam's job coach instructed him not to strike up
conversations with female colleagues, Sam still does, especially
with minority women.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, an attractive female colleague with Korean ancestry
enters the office and Sam watches her from his chair. And every day
Sam strikes up the same conversation with her about her heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to America,'' he says in the end and smiles. Later on,
he explains that as a Southern man, he never embraced a hatred
toward minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like prejudice and I don't like racism and I don't
like segregation, but I do like Great Danes.''
</P>
<P>
   After especially busy weeks, his boss often rewards his hard
work with free symphony tickets. Recently, she booked him a seat
for a Friday morning Coffee Concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you dress nice, Sam,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech
</P>
<P>
   He had a job. With the symphony no less.
</P>
<P>
   He had an apartment and a relatively independent life. But he
had not achieved one lifelong dream: a college degree from his
favorite school, Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The timing this fall seemed right. Tech's football team was
winning, led by a Heisman Trophy candidate. The campus was only a
short distance from work. He felt more confident than ever.
</P>
<P>
   One day after work, he loped across Georgia Tech's sun-dappled
campus, humming, reading plaques and posters and following a line
of insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the bumblebees,'' he said to a passing student.
``Bzzzzzzzz. Bzzzzzzz.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached the admissions office, he was wiping
sweat from his brow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go to Georgia Tech because I've been a Yellow
Jackets fan my whole life,'' Sam told Ingrid Hayes, associate
director of admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you interested in as a major?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything,'' he said. ``A-L-L.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes furrowed her eyebrows, but proceeded to detail the
requirements to enter Georgia Tech, discussing the necessary
background classes in mathematics, science and English.
</P>
<P>
   Sam smiled as she spoke but focused his eyes on the Georgia Tech
alumni mug on the corner of her desk. When she finished, he
grinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they sell those at the Georgia Tech bookstore?'' he asked
pointing to the mug. ``And ... those Georgia Tech golf umbrellas?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said and smiled. She gently moved the conversation
back to college admissions, but Sam interrupted again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the president's office?'' he asked and began rattling
off the names of past presidents of Georgia Tech _ Marion Luther
Brittain, Joseph Pettit, Isaac Hopkins. He knew them all, their
birthdates, their accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   It took 25 minutes before Sam mentioned that in high school, he
had been in special education.
</P>
<P>
   ``What types of courses did you take in special education?'' she
inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took everything. Everything. Everything. EVERYTHING!'' Sam
shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes could see that he was getting agitated, so she gently
explained the goals of Georgia Tech and detailed many of the
options that he could take to gain entrance.
</P>
<P>
   But Sam wasn't listening. ``May I see that Georgia Tech football
schedule behind you?'' he interrupted. Minutes later, he was
flipping through a picture book of Georgia Tech's history and
commenting on important figures and dates he knew.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes slipped out of the office and returned with a football
schedule and poster of Tech's football team.
</P>
<P>
   Sam left her office beaming, his hand clasping the rolled-up
poster like it was a college diploma. He passed through campus,
closing open doors, untangling telephone cords, and cleaning the
leaves off of the Georgia Tech sign on North Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to go to Georgia Tech to be a Georgia Tech fan,''
he said as he walked up North Avenue. ``I don't. I don't. I don't
don't don't ...''
</P>
<P>
   The concert
</P>
<P>
   Sam, wearing a suit and tie, lumbered among the elegantly
dressed patrons, cordially greeting them as if he were the host.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning. Welcome,'' he said. ``How are you?''
</P>
<P>
   He approached a table of pastries and coffee and began shoveling
free muffins into his mouth. Then he stood at the coffee dispenser
and poured packet after packet of sugar into his coffee cup,
carefully flicking every last granule into his coffee. A long line
of concert goers stood behind him, impatiently. He shouted that
there was no more cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you finished, sir?'' a woman behind him snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I am,'' he replied. ``I am. I am. I am. I am. I am ...''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the lights flickered on and off and Sam rushed
into the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   He sat down and looked up at the musicians tuning their
instruments on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime emcee Miles Hoffman warmly greeted the crowd of several
hundred and urged them to relax. Coffee concerts are casual, more
laid-back than evening performances, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after the concert,'' he joked, ``there will be a test on
the names of all the musicians and their birthstones.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughed but Sam.
</P>
<P>
   He feverishly opened his concert booklet and flipped through the
pages. On page 22, he began running through the list of musicians,
fingering down through their names. First violin. Cecylia Arzewski,
Beth Newdome, Jun-Chung Lin. ...
</P>
<P>
   He turned the page and memorized more.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman continued charming the audience, mixing jokes with a
discussion of the three composers, Stravinsky, Debussy and de
Falla. Sam continued memorizing names.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman told the audience that each of the musical pieces had
elusive melodies.
</P>
<P>
   An elusive melody. Like Sam's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have rhythm with just enough melody to make it
interesting,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   As Sam continued memorizing names, Hoffman said, ``They are
fragments of melody, not connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman left the stage and the conductor raised his arms.
</P>
<P>
   The first notes hit Sam like a tranquilizer.
</P>
<P>
   He closed his eyes, smiled, and bowed his head.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky's sumptuous mixture of violins, clarinets and harp
washed over Sam and he began to rock gently as he had as a child.
</P>
<P>
   In seat L-F-22, there was no traffic congestion. No crooked ties
or tangled phone cords. No unattainable goals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it was just him and the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam's song'' was playing again.

   Music helps Sam Taylor conduct a bittersweet life of

</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   ... Sam was fired.
</P>
<P>
   The new job
</P>
<P>
   Today when Sam wakes up to shower, shave and dress, he does so
in his own apartment. When he sets off for work, it's not just for
any job. He works for the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra.

</P>
<P>
   Sam, wearing a suit and tie, lumbered among the elegantly
dressed patrons, cordially greeting them as if he were the host.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning. Welcome,'' he said. ``How are you?''
</P>
<P>
   He approached a table of pastries and coffee and began shoveling
free muffins into his mouth. Then he stood at the coffee dispenser
and poured packet after packet of sugar into his coffee cup,
carefully flicking every last granule into his coffee. A long line
of concert goers stood behind him, impatiently. He shouted that
there was no more cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you finished, sir?'' a woman behind him snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I am,'' he replied. ``I am. I am. I am. I am. I am ...''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the lights flickered on and off and Sam rushed
into the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   He sat down and looked up at the musicians tuning their
instruments on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime emcee Miles Hoffman warmly greeted the crowd of several
hundred and urged them to relax. Coffee concerts are casual, more
laid-back than evening performances, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after the concert,'' he joked, ``there will be a test on
the names of all the musicians and their birthstones.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughed but Sam.
</P>
<P>
   He feverishly opened his concert booklet and flipped through the
pages. On page 22, he began running through the list of musicians,
fingering down through their names. First violin. Cecylia Arzewski,
Beth Newdome, Jun-Chung Lin. ...
</P>
<P>
   He turned the page and memorized more.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman continued charming the audience, mixing jokes with a
discussion of the three composers, Stravinsky, Debussy and de
Falla. Sam continued memorizing names.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman told the audience that each of the musical pieces had
elusive melodies.
</P>
<P>
   An elusive melody. Like Sam's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have rhythm with just enough melody to make it
interesting,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   As Sam continued memorizing names, Hoffman said, ``They are
fragments of melody, not connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman left the stage and the conductor raised his arms.
</P>
<P>
   The first notes hit Sam like a tranquilizer.
</P>
<P>
   He closed his eyes, smiled, and bowed his head.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky's sumptuous mixture of violins, clarinets and harp
washed over Sam and he began to rock gently as he had as a child.
</P>
<P>
   In seat L-F-22, there was no traffic congestion. No crooked ties
or tangled phone cords. No unattainable goals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it was just him and the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam's song'' was playing again.

 &HT;    Music helps Sam Taylor conduct a bittersweet life of
independence with autism

(l) lifestyle categories.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sam Taylor walked through downtown Atlanta untangling
public telephone cords, straightening strange men's ties and
putting order in a world he could never understand.
</P>
<P>
   He loped down the streets, his left pinkie finger extended on
even blocks and his right pinkie on odd ones. In his wallet, he
carried a few dollar bills that he'd starched and pressed to smooth
out the wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   As he marched, he hummed a rhythmic chant in time with his gait.
It spilled out loudly, drowning out the din of the streets as if it
were off-key.
</P>
<P>
   Sam stopped and memorized the text of posters, plaques and
historical monuments, and struck up conversations with passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know any Secret Service agents to the president of the
United States?'' he asked a man carrying a briefcase. The man
squinted in confusion and went on without replying. Sam raised his
finger and mumbled, ``Check. Top secret. Top secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Two blocks later, he asked a woman if she knew Ted Turner. When
she furrowed her eyebrows, he rattled off the history of Turner's
TBS station, its earlier years as WTCG and WJRJ and its programs.
</P>
<P>
   She smiled _ there was something innocent in his voice _ and
commented that Sam must be an expert on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am. I am. I am am am am am am ...'' he said, his voice
booming from his 6-foot-3 frame like a jackhammer. ``I'm also a
Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets fan. Been one my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing on his journey, he walked across to Underground
Atlanta where he passed a woman in tight jeans and lacy blouse
leaning against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, there,'' she said alluringly. ``You want a date?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, thank you, ma'am. I'm going to see the governor,'' he
replied and walked past. Ten feet away he turned and shouted back
to her: ``Don't forget to turn your clock back one hour to Eastern
Standard Time.''
</P>
<P>
   On this warm autumn afternoon, the world seemed hospitable,
rather than hostile. People seemed friendlier, and Sam, a
40-year-old autistic man, was enjoying himself.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the 6-foot fence that confined the strange blond boy
who screamed and threw glass milk bottles and bit himself. Gone
were the weeks at Milledgeville's state mental institution, where a
5-year-old Sam learned how to curse, smoke and endure cigarette
burns without crying. Gone were the doctors who said Sam would
never be normal or learn to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sam exceeded the experts' predictions, he still suffers
from autism, an incurable neurological disorder characterized by
extreme withdrawal, impaired communication and emotional
detachment. It affects between 1 and 2 of every 1,000 newborns.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he struggles to be as independent and self-reliant as the
people he passes in the streets. He wants to drive, to live alone,
to have a girlfriend, to go to college.
</P>
<P>
   Goals attained in a different world from Sam's, a world just out
of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not autistic anymore,'' he often shouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam is very bright _ a walking database of facts and
information, but he can't process it,'' said Nan Pigot, a
58-year-old cousin who lived with Sam's family for several years
when Sam was young.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a life of frustration because he wants to be like
other people but he can't, and deep down he knows he can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The music child
</P>
<P>
   As a baby, Sam rarely slept and never cried. He became stiff and
robotic when his mother picked him up or tried to nurse him.
</P>
<P>
   So little was known about autism during Sam's first 10 years
that his family searched in vain for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were days I wanted to cry,'' said his mother, Lenora
Taylor. ``I prayed to God to show me where the button was that I
pushed to make him normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, though, there had been the music.
</P>
<P>
   Sam's parents were professional musicians, and his mother
noticed early on that when she sang or played music, Sam was
transformed from an indifferent infant to a warm cuddling baby.
</P>
<P>
   As a young boy, he spent hours cuddling against the washing
machine, absorbing the vibrations and humming in key to the
machine.
</P>
<P>
   For years he didn't speak, but adeptly hummed jingles from TV
and radio in perfect pitch. If his family sang jingles off-key, Sam
grew angry and corrected them with his own humming.
</P>
<P>
   By humming and chanting, Sam was imposing his own rhythm on the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Like most autistic children, he grew up socially withdrawn and
unable to process emotions outside of anger and frustration. He
didn't laugh at jokes because he didn't understand humor. He didn't
cry because he didn't understand sadness. When his grandmother
died, he walked uncomfortably among the mourners at her funeral and
finally approached his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to cry,'' he said. ``If I put an onion under my eye,
will I cry?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, his mother took him to the first national conference on
autism in Washington. Sam distanced himself from the other autistic
children and spent the day conversing with adults, especially those
he perceived to be important.
</P>
<P>
   He needed absolute order and symmetry in his world. Little
things, like toothbrushes not facing the same direction, sent him
into explosive tantrums. He often intentionally injured himself or
destroyed things in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Sam's disruptive behavior put intense pressure on the family.
For years, his two older brothers watched most of the basic
parental support being redirected toward Sam. Normal family outings
to restaurants or movies were impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The family's unity began to fray and his mother and father
separated and eventually divorced. Sam took it hard and blamed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did I have to be born autistic?'' the 14-year-old shouted
at his brother when his father moved out.
</P>
<P>
   But through music and his mother's persistence, Sam eventually
learned to read and write, and eventually attended special
education courses in school. He had rare gifts of perfect pitch and
photographic memory, but he still had difficulty fitting in.
</P>
<P>
   When the outside world became too frustrating for him, Sam would
sit on the carpet or in bed, head tilted to one side, and hum. He
closed his eyes and smiled, seemingly lost in another world while
he rocked back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a special moment between Sam and himself, a time when
he seemed at ease and was not screaming or destructive,'' said his
brother Jeff Taylor, 44, a professional musician.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called it 'Sam's Song.'''The coach
</P>
<P>
   Every Wednesday evening, Creative Community Services, an
organization that provides supported home care for disabled adults,
takes Sam to a bowling alley with about two dozen disabled adults
with autism, mental retardation or schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   But Sam never bowls. Just as he did as a child, he distances
himself from his peers. Sam sits alone, smoking cigars and eating
double cheeseburgers and french fries.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours, the group laughs and shouts and bowls. They share
Cokes and candy and give each other tips and pats on the back.
</P>
<P>
   From his solitary table, Sam looks down at the group with cold
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not like them,'' he says, picking up french fries with
alternating hands _ first the right, then the left _ and placing
them in his mouth. ``I'm not autistic anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Once or twice during the evening, Sam walks behind the lanes and
claps his hands loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go. Let's go. LET'S GO!'' the self-appointed coach
shouts.
</P>
<P>
   He once chastised a young, mildly retarded man who was teasing
one of the Creative Community Services employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you have to be yelling so loud?'' the man snapped back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm the coach, and you have to do what I say,'' Sam
shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Sam's never bowled before, but he understands the importance of
a coach. Although he has higher abilities than most of the
developmentally disabled adults on the bowling team, he couldn't
function in the adult world without a coach for work and one for
home.
</P>
<P>
   His job coach from Briggs &AMP; Associates helps map out his
professional life, getting him job interviews, helping employers
train him, dictating how he should behave with coworkers and
customers. His home coach from Creative Community Services helps
organize his personal life, taking him to appointments, to the
grocery store, telling him how much money he can spend and what
types of food he should buy.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, Sam feels the support cuts into his lifelong goal
of being normal and independent. His two older brothers are married
and have families, good jobs, cars and independence.
</P>
<P>
   But everywhere Sam goes, people _ his family, his job coach, his
home coach _ dictate what he should buy, where he should work, how
he should live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam is smart enough to know that he's not running his own
life,'' his mother said. And it frustrates him.
</P>
<P>
   He can't even buy a can of tuna fish in oil without getting a
lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just try the tuna in spring water,'' his home coach, Kathryn
Flight, explained recently at Sam's neighborhood grocery store.
``There's less calories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a right to be fat,'' Sam shouted, his 256-pound body
tensing up. ``I do. I do. I do-do-do-do-do-doooo! You're trying to
violate my rights.''
</P>
<P>
   She tried to reason with him about eating healthy, but Sam had
heard enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fed up with everybody fussing,'' he said. ``I'm an adult
and registered voter and I have a right to eat what I want and live
alone and drive a car and do what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   First job
</P>
<P>
   When Sam walked up on stage in 1978 to receive his high school
diploma in special education, the entire senior class from
Atlanta's Northside High School gave him a standing ovation. It was
a glorious moment for the 19-year-old and his family.
</P>
<P>
   But 11 years would pass before Sam would find much meaning in
the adult world. He wandered the streets, worked in sheltered
workshops for developmentally disabled adults, and earned pocket
money by walking the neighbor's dogs or cutting the grass. He
looked enviously at his older brothers Bud and Jeff, who moved out
and landed jobs at symphonies. Bud plays for the Columbus and Macon
symphonies, and Jeff freelances for the Lyric Opera Symphony of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Briggs &AMP; Associates landed Sam a job as a bagger at the
Kroger store off Roswell Road near Chastain Park. Sam was elated.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, he arrived dressed in his Sunday best _ blue slacks,
shirt, tie _ and carrying a black leather briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   During training, his managers told him to be quick and polite.
Every time he bagged groceries, they said, he needed to ask the
customers their bag preference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like paper or plastic, ma'am?'' Sam asked his first
customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plastic, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, after filling her first bag, Sam turned to her
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like paper or plastic, ma'am?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Plastic,'' she replied. ``I already said plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sam loaded up the second bag, he asked again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like paper or plastic, ma'am?''
</P>
<P>
   His managers sighed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam took things extremely literal,'' said Gary Libowsky, the
store manager at the time. ``We had to make sure we were talking on
the same level with him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first few months, Sam became obsessed with making sure
customers were happy and that the store attracted as many shoppers
as possible. One afternoon, coworkers had to frantically pull him
out of the middle of Roswell Road as he directed lanes of angry
motorists into the store's parking lot. He was also told not to
yell at people who said they preferred to shop elsewhere. He
followed Kroger's stock daily and whenever it fell on the market,
he'd run into work the next day and demand to speak with the
company's president in Cincinnati, Ohio, to inform him of the loss.
</P>
<P>
   After working through the initial difficulties, Sam's
supervisors discovered he was reliable, never late, always eager to
work and extremely personable with customers.
</P>
<P>
   In his first six months, Sam was named Kroger employee of the
period.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his reward, he met the company president, Atlanta
Mayor Maynard Jackson, and Gov. Joe Frank Harris at the state
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Sam basked in the attention. Never before did he feel so
accepted in the world. Since his youth, Sam was always fascinated
with VIPS.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was seeking approval,'' his mother said. ``Talking to them
made him feel accepted and important and, in a sense, normal.''
</P>
<P>
   But after winning the award and meeting the governor, Sam's
attitude changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have autism anymore,'' he defiantly told his job
coach. Sam swaggered around work like he was invincible. His
behavior began to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   His photographic memory became a curse. When he carried out
customers' groceries, he remembered their names, the type of cars
they drove, the county where they lived, even the license plate
numbers. Women began complaining that Sam was stalking them.
</P>
<P>
   His job coach told Sam to talk only about work, weather or
sports with customers, but Sam found loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure was hot yesterday,'' he began asking women. ``What
sort of lingerie did you wear to bed last night?'' Trouble at work
bled over to his private life.
</P>
<P>
   He met prostitutes. They picked him up every Friday when he was
paid in cash and persuaded him to buy them fancy clothes and
dinners at lavish restaurants. When he woke up Saturday morning, he
was broke. He began wandering the streets, going to strip clubs,
sometimes returning home after 2 a.m. His mother grew worried and
both she and his job coach tried to intercede.
</P>
<P>
   But Sam became more obstinate. He didn't need anyone's help, he
told them. After all, he was an award-winning employee who knew he
wasn't autistic anymore.
</P>
<P>
   At work, his behavior worsened. When he was brought into
disciplinary meetings with the manager, he claimed that his rights
of free speech were being violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam got too big for his britches,'' Libowsky recalled.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1995, after five and a half years of working at Kroger,
Sam was fired.
</P>
<P>
   The new job
</P>
<P>
   Today when Sam wakes up to shower, shave and dress, he does so
in his own apartment. When he sets off for work, it's not just for
any job. He works for the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep the blinds closed,'' he shouts at his roommate, also a
developmentally disabled adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calm down, Sam,'' his roommate replies. ``I'm just looking
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them closed,'' Sam yells. ``I do, I do. I do do do.''
</P>
<P>
   With a bowl full of Nesquik chocolate-flavored cereal and whole
milk, Sam sits down in his recliner to have breakfast and watch
Channel 11. There's never a deviation. Recliner. Channel 11.
Nesquik. Newspapers and magazines that he's read and memorized are
strewn about the room. World Championship Wrestling star Goldberg
glowers down from a poster in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Sam hums as he shovels spoonfuls of cereal into his mouth. He
closes his eyes while he chews.
</P>
<P>
   On his way outside, he checks to make sure he has everything he
needs: Wallet. Keys. Airhorn.
</P>
<P>
   He sits on a small wall alongside Ashford Dunwoody Road and hums
while waiting for the 29 MARTA bus. Cars whiz past in the rush hour
traffic. Drivers honk at each other.
</P>
<P>
   The noise disrupts Sam's internal rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   He pulls out his airhorn and blasts back at the cars.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chamblee MARTA Station, he transfers to the southbound
train and gets off at the Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   When he reaches his office across the street, he greets his
boss, Charlotte Hankins, grabs a large stack of papers and begins
filing the names of past ticketholders. He flips through the
papers, memorizing a special code for the ticketholder's home
location, and meticulously arranges them in neat stacks on his
desk. He then sorts them into stacks of 25 for telemarketers on the
day and night shifts.
</P>
<P>
   His job coach at Briggs &AMP; Associates knew that because of his
family's background in music, Sam would feel at home working with
the symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus Sam has some rough edges, and I thought that the art
world would be a little more accepting,'' Lee Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   When Sam told his family about the new job, he could hardly
contain his excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen him that excited in a long time,'' his mother
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Hankins lauded Sam's skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great worker and very well liked,'' she said. ``He has
his days, but so does everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Sam's job coach instructed him not to strike up
conversations with female colleagues, Sam still does, especially
with minority women.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, an attractive female colleague with Korean ancestry
enters the office and Sam watches her from his chair. And every day
Sam strikes up the same conversation with her about her heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to America,'' he says in the end and smiles. Later on,
he explains that as a Southern man, he never embraced a hatred
toward minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like prejudice and I don't like racism and I don't
like segregation, but I do like Great Danes.''
</P>
<P>
   After especially busy weeks, his boss often rewards his hard
work with free symphony tickets. Recently, she booked him a seat
for a Friday morning Coffee Concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you dress nice, Sam,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech
</P>
<P>
   He had a job. With the symphony no less.
</P>
<P>
   He had an apartment and a relatively independent life. But he
had not achieved one lifelong dream: a college degree from his
favorite school, Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The timing this fall seemed right. Tech's football team was
winning, led by a Heisman Trophy candidate. The campus was only a
short distance from work. He felt more confident than ever.
</P>
<P>
   One day after work, he loped across Georgia Tech's sun-dappled
campus, humming, reading plaques and posters and following a line
of insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the bumblebees,'' he said to a passing student.
``Bzzzzzzzz. Bzzzzzzz.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached the admissions office, he was wiping
sweat from his brow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go to Georgia Tech because I've been a Yellow
Jackets fan my whole life,'' Sam told Ingrid Hayes, associate
director of admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you interested in as a major?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything,'' he said. ``A-L-L.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes furrowed her eyebrows, but proceeded to detail the
requirements to enter Georgia Tech, discussing the necessary
background classes in mathematics, science and English.
</P>
<P>
   Sam smiled as she spoke but focused his eyes on the Georgia Tech
alumni mug on the corner of her desk. When she finished, he
grinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they sell those at the Georgia Tech bookstore?'' he asked
pointing to the mug. ``And ... those Georgia Tech golf umbrellas?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said and smiled. She gently moved the conversation
back to college admissions, but Sam interrupted again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the president's office?'' he asked and began rattling
off the names of past presidents of Georgia Tech _ Marion Luther
Brittain, Joseph Pettit, Isaac Hopkins. He knew them all, their
birthdates, their accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   It took 25 minutes before Sam mentioned that in high school, he
had been in special education.
</P>
<P>
   ``What types of courses did you take in special education?'' she
inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took everything. Everything. Everything. EVERYTHING!'' Sam
shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes could see that he was getting agitated, so she gently
explained the goals of Georgia Tech and detailed many of the
options that he could take to gain entrance.
</P>
<P>
   But Sam wasn't listening. ``May I see that Georgia Tech football
schedule behind you?'' he interrupted. Minutes later, he was
flipping through a picture book of Georgia Tech's history and
commenting on important figures and dates he knew.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes slipped out of the office and returned with a football
schedule and poster of Tech's football team.
</P>
<P>
   Sam left her office beaming, his hand clasping the rolled-up
poster like it was a college diploma. He passed through campus,
closing open doors, untangling telephone cords, and cleaning the
leaves off of the Georgia Tech sign on North Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to go to Georgia Tech to be a Georgia Tech fan,''
he said as he walked up North Avenue. ``I don't. I don't. I don't
don't don't ...''
</P>
<P>
   The concert
</P>
<P>
   Sam, wearing a suit and tie, lumbered among the elegantly
dressed patrons, cordially greeting them as if he were the host.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning. Welcome,'' he said. ``How are you?''
</P>
<P>
   He approached a table of pastries and coffee and began shoveling
free muffins into his mouth. Then he stood at the coffee dispenser
and poured packet after packet of sugar into his coffee cup,
carefully flicking every last granule into his coffee. A long line
of concert goers stood behind him, impatiently. He shouted that
there was no more cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you finished, sir?'' a woman behind him snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I am,'' he replied. ``I am. I am. I am. I am. I am ...''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the lights flickered on and off and Sam rushed
into the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   He sat down and looked up at the musicians tuning their
instruments on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime emcee Miles Hoffman warmly greeted the crowd of several
hundred and urged them to relax. Coffee concerts are casual, more
laid-back than evening performances, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after the concert,'' he joked, ``there will be a test on
the names of all the musicians and their birthstones.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone laughed but Sam.
</P>
<P>
   He feverishly opened his concert booklet and flipped through the
pages. On page 22, he began running through the list of musicians,
fingering down through their names. First violin. Cecylia Arzewski,
Beth Newdome, Jun-Chung Lin. ...
</P>
<P>
   He turned the page and memorized more.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman continued charming the audience, mixing jokes with a
discussion of the three composers, Stravinsky, Debussy and de
Falla. Sam continued memorizing names.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman told the audience that each of the musical pieces had
elusive melodies.
</P>
<P>
   An elusive melody. Like Sam's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have rhythm with just enough melody to make it
interesting,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   As Sam continued memorizing names, Hoffman said, ``They are
fragments of melody, not connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman left the stage and the conductor raised his arms.
</P>
<P>
   The first notes hit Sam like a tranquilizer.
</P>
<P>
   He closed his eyes, smiled, and bowed his head.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky's sumptuous mixture of violins, clarinets and harp
washed over Sam and he began to rock gently as he had as a child.
</P>
<P>
   In seat L-F-22, there was no traffic congestion. No crooked ties
or tangled phone cords. No unattainable goals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it was just him and the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam's song'' was playing again.

   Music helps Sam Taylor conduct a bittersweet life of
independence with autism
</P>
<P>
   (Second take. With photos. Moving in (a) national and (l)
lifestyle categories.)
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   ... Sam was fired.
</P>
<P>
   The new job
</P>
<P>
   Today when Sam wakes up to shower, shave and dress, he does so
in his own apartment. When he sets off for work, it's not just for
any job. He works for the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep the blinds closed,'' he shouts at his roommate, also a
developmentally disabled adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calm down, Sam,'' his roommate replies. ``I'm just looking
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them closed,'' Sam yells. ``I do, I do. I do do do.''
</P>
<P>
   With a bowl full of Nesquik chocolate-flavored cereal and whole
milk, Sam sits down in his recliner to have breakfast and watch
Channel 11. There's never a deviation. Recliner. Channel 11.
Nesquik. Newspapers and magazines that he's read and memorized are
strewn about the room. World Championship Wrestling star Goldberg
glowers down from a poster in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Sam hums as he shovels spoonfuls of cereal into his mouth. He
closes his eyes while he chews.
</P>
<P>
   On his way outside, he checks to make sure he has everything he
needs: Wallet. Keys. Airhorn.
</P>
<P>
   He sits on a small wall alongside Ashford Dunwoody Road and hums
while waiting for the 29 MARTA bus. Cars whiz past in the rush hour
traffic. Drivers honk at each other.
</P>
<P>
   The noise disrupts Sam's internal rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   He pulls out his airhorn and blasts back at the cars.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chamblee MARTA Station, he transfers to the southbound
train and gets off at the Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   When he reaches his office across the street, he greets his
boss, Charlotte Hankins, grabs a large stack of papers and begins
filing the names of past ticketholders. He flips through the
papers, memorizing a special code for the ticketholder's home
location, and meticulously arranges them in neat stacks on his
desk. He then sorts them into stacks of 25 for telemarketers on the
day and night shifts.
</P>
<P>
   His job coach at Briggs &AMP; Associates knew that because of his
family's background in music, Sam would feel at home working with
the symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus Sam has some rough edges, and I thought that the art
world would be a little more accepting,'' Lee Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   When Sam told his family about the new job, he could hardly
contain his excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen him that excited in a long time,'' his mother
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Hankins lauded Sam's skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great worker and very well liked,'' she said. ``He has
his days, but so does everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Sam's job coach instructed him not to strike up
conversations with female colleagues, Sam still does, especially
with minority women.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, an attractive female colleague with Korean ancestry
enters the office and Sam watches her from his chair. And every day
Sam strikes up the same conversation with her about her heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to America,'' he says in the end and smiles. Later on,
he explains that as a Southern man, he never embraced a hatred
toward minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like prejudice and I don't like racism and I don't
like segregation, but I do like Great Danes.''
</P>
<P>
   After especially busy weeks, his boss often rewards his hard
work with free symphony tickets. Recently, she booked him a seat
for a Friday morning Coffee Concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure you dress nice, Sam,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech
</P>
<P>
   He had a job. With the symphony no less.
</P>
<P>
   He had an apartment and a relatively independent life. But he
had not achieved one lifelong dream: a college degree from his
favorite school, Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The timing this fall seemed right. Tech's football team was
winning, led by a Heisman Trophy candidate. The campus was only a
short distance from work. He felt more confident than ever.
</P>
<P>
   One day after work, he loped across Georgia Tech's sun-dappled
campus, humming, reading plaques and posters and following a line
of insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the bumblebees,'' he said to a passing student.
``Bzzzzzzzz. Bzzzzzzz.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached the admissions office, he was wiping
sweat from his brow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go to Georgia Tech because I've been a Yellow
Jackets fan my whole life,'' Sam told Ingrid Hayes, associate
director of admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you interested in as a major?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything,'' he said. ``A-L-L.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayes furrowed her eyebrows, but proceeded to detail the
requirements to enter Georgia Tech, discussing the necessary
background classes in mathematics, science and English.
</P>
<P>
   Sam smiled as she spoke but focused his eyes on the Georgia Tech
alumni mug on the corner of her desk. When she finished, he
grinned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they sell those at the Georgia Tech bookstore?'' he asked
pointing to the mug. ``And ... those Georgia Tech golf umbrellas?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said and smiled. She gently moved the conversation
back to college admissions, but Sam interrupted again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the president's office?'' he asked and began rattling
off the names of past presidents of Georgia Tech _ Marion Luther
Brittain, Joseph Pettit, Isaac Hopkins. He knew them all, their
birthdates, their accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   It took 25 minutes before Sam mentioned that in high school, he
had been in special education.
</P>
<P>
   ``What types of courses did you take in special education?'' she
inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took everything. Everything. Everything. EVERYTHING!'' Sam
shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes could see that he was getting agitated, so she gently
explained the goals of Georgia Tech and detailed many of the
options that he could take to gain entrance.
</P>
<P>
   But Sam wasn't listening. ``May I see that Georgia Tech football
schedule behind you?'' he interrupted. Minutes later, he was
flipping through a picture book of Georgia Tech's history and
commenting on important figures and dates he knew.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes slipped out of the office and returned with a football
schedule and poster of Tech's football team.
</P>
<P>
   Sam left her office beaming, his hand clasping the rolled-up
poster like it was a college diploma. He passed through campus,
closing open doors, untangling telephone cords, and cleaning the
leaves off of the Georgia Tech sign on North Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to go to Georgia Tech to be a Georgia Tech fan,''
he said as he walked up North Avenue. ``I don't. I don't. I don't
don't don't ...''
</P>
<P>
   The concert
</P>
<P>
   Sam, wearing a suit and tie, lumbered among the elegantly
dressed patrons, cordially greeting them as if he were the host.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning. Welcome,'' he said. ``How are you?''
</P>
<P>
   He approached a table of pastries and coffee and began shoveling
free muffins into his mouth. Then he stood at the coffee dispenser
and poured packet after packet of sugar into his coffee cup,
carefully flicking every last granule into his coffee. A long line
of concert goers stood behind him, impatiently. He shouted that
there was no more cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you finished, sir?'' a woman behind him snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I am,'' he replied. ``I am. I am. I am. I am. I am ...''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the lights flickered on and off and Sam rushed
into the auditorium.

<P>
   He sat down and looked up at the musicians tuning their

fingering down through their names. First violin. Cecylia Arzewski,

OLIVER STONE STRIVING FOR ACCURACY IN `ANY GIVEN SUNDAY'
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is very little that surprises Oliver Stone. He won the
bronze star for valor as an infantryman in Vietnam in the late
1960s. He has been nominated for 11 Academy Awards as a
screenwriter, producer and director of such movies as ``Platoon.''
But in preparing for and directing the new movie ``Any Given
Sunday,'' an accurate look at life in the NFL, even the hardened
Stone could not believe some of the things he encountered.
</P>
<P>
   The list begins with the strong reaction of the NFL, which
refused to cooperate in the making of the film. There was the
lawsuit filed against the studio, Warner Brothers, by a former
Oakland Raiders team physician who said he was not given credit for
his contributions to Stone's script. And there was the more than
competent acting of the current and former NFL players who appear
in the film, and who contributed their knowledge of the sport and
its inner workings.
</P>
<P>
   But at the top of Stone's list of surprises was the speed of the
game. He filmed game scenes that featured actual professional
players and saw the devastating hitting at speeds he thought
impossible for human beings to attain.
</P>
<P>
   In those scenes, Stone used Arena Football League players in
addition to past and current NFL stars like former Giant Lawrence
Taylor, San Francisco wide receiver Terrell Owens, Washington wide
receiver Irving Fryar and Seattle running back Ricky Watters. He
also held an eight-week training camp, the way NFL teams do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now, I think about how fast these guys were running and
how hard they were hitting and it still shocks me,'' Stone said in
a telephone interview last week. ``This movie is a tribute to the
players of the NFL, because they sacrifice everything to play this
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor plays an aging linebacker named Luther Lavay, who makes a
game-saving tackle on fourth-and-short late in the fictional game
(something Taylor, the Hall of Fame linebacker, probably did a
half-dozen times in his 12-year professional career). The running
back in that scene is Watters who, like Taylor, is extremely
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   While practicing the play during rehearsals, Watters dived over
the pile of bodies and collided viciously with Taylor. Then came
more than half a dozen takes, with each hit becoming harder. Taylor
and Watters were feeding off one another. After the last hit, Stone
and others who were present said, Taylor was seriously dazed, lying
on the field, his head throbbing. Filming had to stop for nearly 30
minutes while doctors looked after Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.T. took far more hits than he needed to,'' Stone said of
Taylor. ``But he is so competitive. The Arena League guys were
saying, `Hey, L.T., I'll knock your head off.' That got L.T.
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Film critics will discuss the movie's quality when it opens on
Wednesday. But the incident with Taylor shows how hard Stone and
the athlete-actors worked to achieve a certain degree of realism.
And they were successful.
</P>
<P>
   Stone's look into the league went far beyond what happens on the
field. He dug into every nook and cranny, spending five years
interviewing dozens of people in every aspect of NFL life. Stone
spoke to team owners like Dallas' Jerry Jones (who helped get Stone
into Texas Stadium to film the climactic game scene).
</P>
<P>
   He talked to coaches like the Jets' Bill Parcells, Carolina's
George Seifert and San Francisco's Steve Mariucci. Their
experiences formed the character played by Al Pacino, that of a
head coach having a difficult time blending the personalities of
players from different generations, dealing with the demands of
management and coming to grips with how the game has affected his
personal life. NFL head coaches maintain that those are three of
the toughest aspects of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Other contributions came from quarterback Warren Moon, and
former San Francisco tight end Jamie Williams was a technical
adviser. Past greats like Y.A. Tittle, Dick Butkus and Johnny
Unitas worked closely with Stone, and Butkus and Unitas appear in
the film as coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Stone talked with team physicians, and to the wives and
girlfriends of players. The movie shows how, if two players in a
locker room do not like each other, the players' wives or
girlfriends will dislike each other as well. Such a scenario has
happened several times with recent Giants teams.
</P>
<P>
   The overall result is a depiction of professional football that
almost anyone closely associated with the sport will recognize as
extremely truthful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oliver was around the San Francisco facility a number of times
when I was coaching there,'' Seifert said. ``The one thing I always
noticed was how much he knew about the inside stuff of the game. He
really did his homework.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie pays particular attention to how the game looks and
sounds. The characters use all the proper terminology, such as
``max protect'' (keeping as many people in to safeguard the
quarterback as possible), and actual NFL audibles that quarterbacks
use to change plays at the line of scrimmage. The foul language,
the cheap shots at the bottoms of piles of bodies, the offensive
and defensive formations, the arguments and near fistfights on the
sideline during the game, as well as the pregame and halftime
speeches delivered by Pacino, are all accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Stone may be criticized for the way black characters use a
racial epithet to refer to each other, and for the way players
sometimes talk about women in derogatory terms. While all players
in the NFL do not speak that way, a significant number do. Again,
it is a realistic touch.
</P>
<P>
   Stone also addresses the tough decisions team doctors face. Such
physicians are always walking a fine ethical line between
protecting a player's health and getting him back on the field.
That part of the movie is based, in part, on the 1994 book by the
former Oakland team physician Robert Huizenga, ``You're Okay, It's
Just a Bruise.'' Huizenga confirmed in an interview that he sued
Warner Brothers last month, claiming he should have received part
credit for the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob is just wrong on that issue,'' Stone claimed, saying he
had to limit his comments because of the pending legal action.
Stone acknowledged that he had had extensive conversations with
Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said trying to get the NFL to cooperate was almost as
tough as making the movie. In a series of meetings over a
four-month period, Stone spoke with several high-ranking NFL
officials, hoping to receive permission to use the league's
extensive video library as well as its logos and uniforms. Stone
said the NFL wanted script approval, and that he declined and no
deal was made.
</P>
<P>
   Former NFL president Neil Austrian sent a memo in July 1998 to
each team that explained the league's decision. In his note,
Austrian wrote that the script did not ``accurately or positively
portray our players, club owners or club personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The league's main reason for not cooperating? According to
Stone, it was that the NFL was ``very worried about the domestic
violence issue. They thought the movie was going to get heavily
into that.''
</P>
<P>
   An NFL official confirmed last week that that was a major
concern for the league. The film, however, does not explore that
issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Stone made a movie that looks and feels like a real
NFL season. ``There is no question he really studied our lives,''
Fryar said.

HITTING THE BOOKS  
 A MILESTONE FOR GREEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Professional football players are going back to school in record
numbers, and some are even taking graduate courses. This fall, 13
players are taking courses to finish undergraduate degrees or have
started graduate work as part of the league's continuing education
program.
</P>
<P>
   When the program began in 1991, 141 players and spouses were
enrolled. This past year, 455 people were part of the program. The
NFL picks up all or a portion of the cost, and players in the
program, like Kansas City's Derrick Thomas, say it is a tremendous
self-esteem booster.
</P>
<P>
   A Milestone for Green
</P>
<P>
   One of the most significant achievements of this season
occurred, rather quietly, one week ago: the 50th interception by
Washington cornerback Darrell Green, a great player and one of the
league's best citizens.
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as Green's mark is, he still trails the career
interceptions leader, Paul Krause, who had 81 while playing with
Washington and Minnesota. &QL;

1960s. He has been nominated for 11 Academy Awards as a
screenwriter, producer and director of such movies as ``Platoon.''
But in preparing for and directing the new movie ``Any Given
Sunday,'' an accurate look at life in the NFL, even the hardened
Stone could not believe some of the things he encountered.
</P>
<P>
   The list begins with the strong reaction of the NFL, which
refused to cooperate in the making of the film. There was the
lawsuit filed against the studio, Warner Brothers, by a former
Oakland Raiders team physician who said he was not given credit for
his contributions to Stone's script. And there was the more than
competent acting of the current and former NFL players who appear
in the film, and who contributed their knowledge of the sport and
its inner workings.
</P>
<P>
   But at the top of Stone's list of surprises was the speed of the
game. He filmed game scenes that featured actual professional
players and saw the devastating hitting at speeds he thought
impossible for human beings to attain.
</P>
<P>
   In those scenes, Stone used Arena Football League players in
addition to past and current NFL stars like former Giant Lawrence
Taylor, San Francisco wide receiver Terrell Owens, Washington wide
receiver Irving Fryar and Seattle running back Ricky Watters. He
also held an eight-week training camp, the way NFL teams do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now, I think about how fast these guys were running and
how hard they were hitting and it still shocks me,'' Stone said in
a telephone interview last week. ``This movie is a tribute to the
players of the NFL, because they sacrifice everything to play this
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor plays an aging linebacker named Luther Lavay, who makes a
game-saving tackle on fourth-and-short late in the fictional game
(something Taylor, the Hall of Fame linebacker, probably did a
half-dozen times in his 12-year professional career). The running
back in that scene is Watters who, like Taylor, is extremely
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   While practicing the play during rehearsals, Watters dived over
the pile of bodies and collided viciously with Taylor. Then came
more than half a dozen takes, with each hit becoming harder. Taylor
and Watters were feeding off one another. After the last hit, Stone
and others who were present said, Taylor was seriously dazed, lying
on the field, his head throbbing. Filming had to stop for nearly 30
minutes while doctors looked after Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.T. took far more hits than he needed to,'' Stone said of
Taylor. ``But he is so competitive. The Arena League guys were
saying, `Hey, L.T., I'll knock your head off.' That got L.T.
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Film critics will discuss the movie's quality when it opens on
Wednesday. But the incident with Taylor shows how hard Stone and
the athlete-actors worked to achieve a certain degree of realism.
And they were successful.
</P>
<P>
   Stone's look into the league went far beyond what happens on the
field. He dug into every nook and cranny, spending five years
interviewing dozens of people in every aspect of NFL life. Stone
spoke to team owners like Dallas' Jerry Jones (who helped get Stone
into Texas Stadium to film the climactic game scene).
</P>
<P>
   He talked to coaches like the Jets' Bill Parcells, Carolina's
George Seifert and San Francisco's Steve Mariucci. Their
experiences formed the character played by Al Pacino, that of a
head coach having a difficult time blending the personalities of
players from different generations, dealing with the demands of
management and coming to grips with how the game has affected his
personal life. NFL head coaches maintain that those are three of
the toughest aspects of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Other contributions came from quarterback Warren Moon, and
former San Francisco tight end Jamie Williams was a technical
adviser. Past greats like Y.A. Tittle, Dick Butkus and Johnny
Unitas worked closely with Stone, and Butkus and Unitas appear in
the film as coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Stone talked with team physicians, and to the wives and
girlfriends of players. The movie shows how, if two players in a
locker room do not like each other, the players' wives or
girlfriends will dislike each other as well. Such a scenario has
happened several times with recent Giants teams.
</P>
<P>
   The overall result is a depiction of professional football that
almost anyone closely associated with the sport will recognize as
extremely truthful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oliver was around the San Francisco facility a number of times
when I was coaching there,'' Seifert said. ``The one thing I always
noticed was how much he knew about the inside stuff of the game. He
really did his homework.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie pays particular attention to how the game looks and
sounds. The characters use all the proper terminology, such as
``max protect'' (keeping as many people in to safeguard the
quarterback as possible), and actual NFL audibles that quarterbacks
use to change plays at the line of scrimmage. The foul language,
the cheap shots at the bottoms of piles of bodies, the offensive
and defensive formations, the arguments and near fistfights on the
sideline during the game, as well as the pregame and halftime
speeches delivered by Pacino, are all accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Stone may be criticized for the way black characters use a
racial epithet to refer to each other, and for the way players
sometimes talk about women in derogatory terms. While all players
in the NFL do not speak that way, a significant number do. Again,
it is a realistic touch.
</P>
<P>
   Stone also addresses the tough decisions team doctors face. Such
physicians are always walking a fine ethical line between
protecting a player's health and getting him back on the field.
That part of the movie is based, in part, on the 1994 book by the
former Oakland team physician Robert Huizenga, ``You're Okay, It's
Just a Bruise.'' Huizenga confirmed in an interview that he sued
Warner Brothers last month, claiming he should have received part
credit for the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob is just wrong on that issue,'' Stone claimed, saying he
had to limit his comments because of the pending legal action.
Stone acknowledged that he had had extensive conversations with
Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said trying to get the NFL to cooperate was almost as
tough as making the movie. In a series of meetings over a
four-month period, Stone spoke with several high-ranking NFL
officials, hoping to receive permission to use the league's
extensive video library as well as its logos and uniforms. Stone
said the NFL wanted script approval, and that he declined and no
deal was made.
</P>
<P>
   Former NFL president Neil Austrian sent a memo in July 1998 to
each team that explained the league's decision. In his note,
Austrian wrote that the script did not ``accurately or positively
portray our players, club owners or club personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The league's main reason for not cooperating? According to
Stone, it was that the NFL was ``very worried about the domestic
violence issue. They thought the movie was going to get heavily
into that.''
</P>
<P>
   An NFL official confirmed last week that that was a major
concern for the league. The film, however, does not explore that
issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Stone made a movie that looks and feels like a real
NFL season. ``There is no question he really studied our lives,''
Fryar said.

HITTING THE BOOKS  
 A MILESTONE FOR GREEN

<P>
   Professional football players are going back to school in record
numbers, and some are even taking graduate courses. This fall, 13
players are taking courses to finish undergraduate degrees or have
started graduate work as part of the league's continuing education
program.
</P>
<P>
   When the program began in 1991, 141 players and spouses were
enrolled. This past year, 455 people were part of the program. The
NFL picks up all or a portion of the cost, and players in the
program, like Kansas City's Derrick Thomas, say it is a tremendous
self-esteem booster.
</P>
<P>
   A Milestone for Green
</P>
<P>
   One of the most significant achievements of this season
occurred, rather quietly, one week ago: the 50th interception by
Washington cornerback Darrell Green, a great player and one of the
league's best citizens.
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as Green's mark is, he still trails the career
interceptions leader, Paul Krause, who had 81 while playing with
Washington and Minnesota. &QL;

ITALY'S PREMIER STEPS DOWN AS COALITION CRUMBLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Updates earlier story, following prime minister's
resignation)  (lb) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Seeking to forge a stronger coalition from his fractured
center-left majority, Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema resigned
Saturday, bringing to an end Italy's 56th government since World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italy does not need lacerations or a traumatic dissolution of
its legislature,'' he said in a 40-minute speech to Parliament.
``It needs a government that operates to its full capacity and that
can carry out the necessary and possible reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   His resignation was the culmination of a tumultuous political
week, in which the government's inherently brittle center-left
coalition grew badly frayed from within. After a parliamentary
debate made it clear that his majority was divided, D'Alema
formally tendered his resignation to the Italian president, Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi.
</P>
<P>
   Ciampi, who asked D'Alema to stay on as a caretaker to handle
routine matters until a new government is formed, will begin
consulting political leaders across the board on Sunday to see if
he can give D'Alema a green light to try to form a new majority, a
process that could take days. His coalition would then face a vote
of confidence in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   If D'Alema fails, and no other center-left leader succeeds in
forming a majority, then Italy would be plunged into new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's showdown underscored the fragility of Italy's
political system, which still partly awards seats to political
parties on the basis of their share of the national vote, and thus
allows tiny parties representing few voters considerable power in
forming _ and wrecking _ coalitions. Party loyalty is not a
prerequisite for political office. Since April 1996, 108 members of
Parliament have changed parties, 20 have shifted allegiances twice,
and one has moved four times.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, who delivered a state-of-the-nation style address that
highlighted the accomplishments of his 14-month administration,
said that Italy had pulled out of ``the black hole'' it found
itself in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Parliament to help create a bipolar system that would
be more stable. But efforts to streamline the splintered Italian
electoral system and build a two-party system similar to those that
exist in the United States and Britain have continually broken
down.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, last week's free-for-all did not prevent the
government from passing a budget for next year. Saturday night, the
Senate approved an uncontroversial package that includes small tax
cuts and deficit reduction, and which was passed by the lower house
of Parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But internal power struggles in the majority came to a head at
the same time, when the Socialists within the coalition infuriated
the prime minister last weekend by saying he should be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Although the center-left majority is desperate to avoid early
elections, which polls suggest it could lose to the center-right
opposition, there is deep debate within the coalition as to whether
D'Alema is the best choice as leader for elections due in April
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The tension turned dramatic when Beniamino Andreatta, a former
defense minister and a member of Parliament who supports D'Alema,
had a massive heart attack on the house floor late Wednesday night,
and was rushed to a hospital, where he remains in a coma.
</P>
<P>
   Then things grew ugly when one member of Parliament, Paolo
Bampo, accused another deputy, Luca Bagliani, a member of a
centrist party who is loyal to D'Alema, of seeking to bribe him to
support the prime minister. Bagliani and D'Alema angrily denied the
charges, and the speaker of Parliament set up a special committee
to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote-buying accusation prompted Francesco Cossiga, a
former president and a maverick centrist who backed D'Alema in
1998, to withdraw his support. D'Alema began his speech by saying
that vote-buying was ``intolerable,'' but he failed to mollify
Cossiga's party, which announced afterwards that it would request
D'Alema's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema is a former communist who founded the Democrats of the
Left, a non-Marxist party, after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
He was catapulted to power 14 months ago, when his center-left
predecessor, Romano Prodi, lost a confidence vote in Parliament by
one vote.
</P>
<P>
   As with Saturday's drama, that showdown was forced by splits
within the majority. At that time, D'Alema put together a similar
center-left coalition that stretched uncomfortably across the
spectrum, including both Communists and small centrist parties,
like Cossiga's, that sprang up after the Christian Democratic party
collapsed in the early 1990s under the weight of scandals.

LONG-STAY HOTELS CATER TO FAMILIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Fla., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any owner of a house or apartment who has suffered through a
lengthy renovation or redecoration project quickly learns that a
house is hardly a home when strangers with saws, hammers and drills
are traipsing about.
</P>
<P>
   And any contractor who has attempted to accomplish such a
project knows all too well that work will proceed more quickly and
more efficiently _ and perhaps even less expensively _ if the
occupants are out of their house rather than out of their minds
with dust-induced stress.
</P>
<P>
   And while it might at first seem that getting an entire family
out of the house and into temporary lodgings during a renovation
project could end up costing more than the project itself, there
are increasing numbers of relatively inexpensive options available
for doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   While most extended-stay hotels, whether in cities or suburbs,
cater primarily to business travelers, many are more than happy to
extend their hospitality to families hoping to escape the noisy
hordes of contractors who have invaded their real home for a
renovation or redecoration project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what we offer is a home away from home,'' said
Jennifer Coleman, marketing services manager for Manhattan East
Suite Hotels.``We're a very family-oriented company. Kids and dogs
are fine with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan East. which has 10 all-suite hotels scattered around
Midtown, is one of a growing number of companies offering
extended-stay lodgings that include all the amenities an individual
or family needs to feel at home.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the all-suite hotels in the chain, said Ms. Coleman,
have various-sized suites to accommodate families of most sizes.
The company's 300- to 400-square-foot studio suites, for example,
contain an oversized sleeping room with a dining or sitting area
and kitchen facilities. The two-bedroom suites, on the other hand,
range in size from 700 to 950 square feet and contain a living
room, separate bedrooms and a fully appointed kitchen. In between
are ``junior'' and one-bedroom suites that range from 400 to 650
square feet, including kitchen facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coleman explained that while the nightly rates at Manhattan
East hotels range from $164 for a guest room to $725 for the most
expensive two-bedroom suite, most accommodations range from $200 to
$300. Reduced rates are available for stays of more than 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extended-stay rates are negotiated rates that depend on
the total length of stay,'' she said, adding that her company's
most ``family-friendly'' building was the Surrey Hotel on 76th
Street between Fifth and Madison avenues.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main draws of extended-stay facilities, particularly
for families, is their ability to provide _ quite literally _ soup
to nuts services for their guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we do offer grocery-shopping services,'' said Gordon
Lambourne, a vice president of Marriott International, the
Washington-based hotel chain that pioneered the extended-stay
concept with its Residence Inn Hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing people have to know about our extended-stay
facilities is the concept of the descending rate,'' Lambourne said.
``That means that the longer you stay, the less you pay.''
Generally speaking, he said, rates for the company's Residence Inn
suites in the New York City area start at about $99 a night for the
smaller units.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our suites have a sitting area, a separate bedroom,
and a fully equipped kitchen with a stove, microwave, full-sized
refrigerator and all the china, silverware and glassware you
need,'' Lambourne said. ``Some even have working fireplaces.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike some extended-stay hotels, he said, Marriott does not
have a minimum-stay requirement. ``The average stay is probably
five nights to two weeks,'' Lambourne said.
</P>
<P>
   Another company that has extended-stay lodging is Extended
StayAmerica, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ``For us, seven nights
or more are considered an extended stay,'' said Monique Damiano, a
spokeswoman for the company. ``And at our hotels, there's no need
to negotiate with the hotel manager over your room rate. Guests pay
the same rate as their neighbor in similarly sized rooms or
suites.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Damiano explained that each of the company's hotel brands
offered different types of room arrangements and services. For
example, she said, Extended StayAmerica's Crossland Economy Studios
are generally 227 square feet in size and furnished with a double
bed, kitchenette, refrigerator-freezer, two-burner stove, a
microwave and all necessary utensils and tableware. Rates for such
rooms range from $159 to $199 a week.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Extended StayAmerica Efficiency Studios hotel
brand, which are about 300 square feet and similarly furnished,
range from $199 to $299 a week.
</P>
<P>
   And the company's StudioPlus Deluxe Studios hotel brand, Ms.
Damiano said, has suites of about 425 square feet, generally with
separate living, sleeping and eating areas and a pull-out sleeper
sofa. The rates for those units, she said, range from $299 to $399
a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``To keep our rates affordable, our hotels don't have
restaurants, bars, meeting spaces or little plastic shoe-shine kits
in the rooms,'' Ms. Damiano said. ``But they do have all the things
you need for a comfortable stay.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that while guests might request daily housekeeping
services, extended-stay guests can generally save money by using
housekeeping services just once a week. In addition, she said, all
of the company's hotels offer on-premises, coin-operated guest
laundry rooms, free local phone calls and a room wired with a
dedicated computer data port.
</P>
<P>
   For those who prefer the ambiance of a real Manhattan apartment
while their own apartment is being torn asunder, there is a company
in Manhattan that rents one- and two-bedroom apartments at rates
that are, in some cases, less than what it would cost to rent a
similarly sized unfurnished Manhattan apartment on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have all the services of a hotel, but when people see
our rates, they're usually willing to make their own beds,'' said
Elizabeth Calogero, a spokeswoman for A Hospitality Company, a
Manhattan-based company that owns about 150 apartments that it
rents out to extended-stay guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our flagship property is the Hospitality House,'' Ms. Calogero
said, referring to the 36-unit building the company owns on 49th
Street between Lexington and Third avenues. Apartments in the
building, which start at $99 a night for a small studio, have all
the necessary furniture and furnishings, including a fully-equipped
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Apartments in other buildings scattered throughout Manhattan,
she said, range from small studios to large, two-bedroom units, all
similarly furnished. Rates in those buildings range from $99 to
$325 a night or, for stays of 30 days or more, from $1,950 to
$5,750 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously prefer longer corporate stays,'' Ms. Calogero
said. ``But our two-bedroom apartments sleep six people
comfortably, so we're family-friendly, too.''

LAKERS NOT CONTENT WITH JUST WINNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ It could be a sign of growing maturity, a new
self-awareness inspired by coach Phil Jackson or perhaps just a
case of grouchiness, but the Lakers are getting harder to please.
</P>
<P>
   At the halfway point of a four-game road trip that Jackson has
called an early season barometer, the Lakers are 2-0, have a
five-game winning streak and the best record in the league (20-5).
And yet they found any number of ways to censure themselves _ and
occasionally each other _ after turning a 20-point lead into a mere
97-88 win Friday at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe that's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's the maturity of the team,'' Glen Rice said.
``You realize that it was definitely not one of our better games
and we could have played a lot better. And we learn from that. We
learn from the times when we go out there and lose and also when we
win and it's not particularly so pretty, we learn from that as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   All that learning has translated to 12 wins in 13 games and an
8-3 road record that rates as the second best in the league. And
they actually have a chance to sweep their first significant road
trip of the season, which continues today against the Toronto
Raptors and concludes Monday night against the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great for us if we can come out of this road trip
undefeated,'' Rice said. ``It really says a lot about this team at
the early stage that would give us something to build on.''
</P>
<P>
   Critique: There was more than enough grousing to go around
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson criticized Shaquille O'Neal, O'Neal took a swipe at his
teammates and everyone else just offered general discontent with
their inability to sustain the rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq didn't rebound at all in the second half,'' Jackson said.
``I think he got one rebound.... He had a lackadaisical effort the
second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered O'Neal: ``I had more (rebounds) than that. The local
statisticians don't want me to get the league lead in
rebounding.... I had more than one (bleeping) rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was equally unhappy with his teammates taking
``ill-advised shots'' instead of getting him the ball more often,
especially in the fourth quarter, when he took just four shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, a lot of dribbling going on,'' O'Neal said, naming no
one in particular. ``When a team's double-teaming (me) like that,
and everybody's getting open shots, you should want to throw it
down to me.''
</P>
<P>
   On that last note, Jackson and O'Neal agreed. ``I was upset that
they didn't find him and get him the ball and we were willing to
just take the available shots,'' Jackson said.

GRIZZLIES' WOES MORE THAN A MOLE-HILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The team's ownership is uncertain, there's
speculation it could relocate, and a revamped roster has produced a
record that is just as bad as a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   So what did the Vancouver Grizzlies do to reassure fans about
the stability of their franchise?
</P>
<P>
   Fire coach Brian Hill, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was fired by general manager Stu Jackson, who many would
like to see leave next, to demonstrate the Grizzlies should be more
than a lottery team this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Vancouver's problems go far deeper than Hill's coaching.
Team owner John E. McCaw Jr. of Seattle announced in September he
was selling the team to Missouri billionaire Bill Laurie.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has not approved the deal, telling Laurie and Orca Bay
Sports and Entertainment (the Grizzlies' parent company) to rework
the deal so the franchise might stay in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   That's done little to silence skeptics, who believe Laurie can't
wait to move the team to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't helped that the Grizzlies have lost several million
dollars the past two years, which was one reason McCaw is believed
to have sold the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see this business turning a profit under this current
structure,'' former top executive Stephen Bellringer told the
Toronto Globe and Mail this week.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nothing Jackson does seems to work. He drafted point
guard Mike Bibby with the No. 2 pick, a good but not franchise
player. Of course, no one else really thought Vince Carter would be
the best player available that draft.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, he passed on Lamar Odom, but so did a lot of other
teams, and took Steve Francis. He then traded Francis to Houston
essentially for Michael Dickerson, Othella Harrington and the
Rockets' No. 1 pick, which looks like a lottery selection.
</P>
<P>
   That would give Vancouver two lottery picks in next year's
draft.
</P>
<P>
   A nice future thought, but it does little to soothe the
frustrations over this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all agree that this is the most talented team that
we have had and it's the deepest team that we have had,'' Jackson
said. ``I personally have expected better from this unit. I'm not
real happy with the play of our club.''
</P>
<P>
   So Jackson did what any GM does when the pressure builds, by
firing Hill and replacing him with assistant coach Lionel Hollins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has to be accountable. I'm talking about the
players, myself, the coaching staff, our general staff,'' Jackson
said. ``We all have to look at what we can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   It's likely Jackson will be the next to go, considering he is in
the final year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``For someone to imply that my strategy or my decisions are
going to be compromised based upon my own personal situation is
insulting and not warranted,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Trade talk: About 130 players became eligible to change teams
Wednesday. Under a new NBA rule, players who signed new contracts
during the season couldn't be traded until three months later or
Dec. 15, whichever was later.
</P>
<P>
   That opened possibilities for more deals, and nearly every NBA
team was listening to some type of proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte was believed to have offered Anthony Mason to the
Lakers, Bucks and Magic, who all politely said no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets, who fear losing Ron Mercer to free agency (after
rejecting his offer to sign a new contract in the summer),
reportedly offered Mercer and Bryant Stith to the 76ers for point
guard Larry Hughes and forward Tyrone Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers offered the same package to the Sonics for Horace
Grant and Brent Barry, and were quickly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Unattractive tractor: One player who is clearly on the block is
Milwaukee's Robert Traylor, a first-round draft choice in 1998. Few
teams want the former Michigan star, because he is too small to
play center and unable to play power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Davis gets fingered: Raptors center Antonio Davis was fined
$5,000 for making an obscene gesture to a fan during Toronto's
105-97 win against the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting a free throw in the fourth quarter against his
former team, Davis reacted to a fan sitting near Indiana's bench by
making a hand gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Davis denied any wrongdoing, but the NBA disagreed after
reviewing the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Family man: Danny Ainge has been frustrated over all the
speculation surrounding his resignation as Phoenix Suns coach.
Ainge said he resigned to spend more time with his family, although
he wasn't exactly thrilled with the way the Suns were playing.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said former players have called seeking ``the real
reason,'' he quit. Among the stories: He would coach Brigham
Young's basketball team; did not like assistant coach Scott Skiles,
or had a family medical emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably talked to 25 guys who are coaches or general
managers or they've been coaches,'' Ainge said. ``They all believe
me. You can't really understand it unless you've been a coach _ and
you have six kids.''
</P>
<P>
   New role: Former Laker Eddie Jones, who was often criticized for
being too unselfish, has decided to become the Charlotte Hornets'
go-to guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I want _ to be held responsible for whether we
win or lose,'' Jones said. ``If it takes me going and taking (the
ball) out of someone else's hands, to create my own thing or for
someone else, I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie of the Year? Houston Rockets point guard Steve Francis
has been overshadowed by the Clippers' Odom, but he leads all
rookies in scoring (17.4) and assists (6.0). &QL;

2ND MAN SOUGHT FOR QUESTIONING IN BOMB PLOT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ American and Canadian officials are searching for a
man who may have been an accomplice to a man who was arrested
Tuesday with powerful bomb-making materials, the authorities said
Saturday as they continued their investigation into the apparent
terrorist plot.
</P>
<P>
   In Montreal, which the authorities say served as a base for the
arrested suspect, Ahmed Ressam, before he traveled to Vancouver
several weeks ago, police officers evacuated a block on Friday
night that included the apartment building where Ressam lived. But
the bomb squad of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police found no
evidence of explosives there, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, a 32-year-old Algerian native, is being held without
bail here in connection with the Tuesday night incident. He was
arrested after driving off the ferry from Victoria, B.C., to Port
Angeles, Wash. Customs Service authorities found liquid
nitroglycerine, urea powder and timing devices in the man's car
that one government official said Saturday could have made a bomb
capable of causing tremendous damage in a city office building or a
crowd of people.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, carrying a fake Quebec driver's license, had made a
motel reservation under the fictitious name of Benni A. Noris for
Tuesday night in Seattle and had a reservation to fly the next day
to New York City, with a connecting flight to London.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the second man being sought Saturday had
stayed with Ressam for the last three weeks at a motel south of
downtown Vancouver, B.C. That room was also reserved in the Noris
name, the authorities said. They said they knew little about the
second man and were not certain the man was an accomplice, but they
were seeking him for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Saturday
that the authorities believed the second man had returned to
Montreal, which Canadian authorities have described as the base of
an ``Algerian cell'' created to finance terrorist organizations
elsewhere. Agence France-Presse, the French news agency, quoted
Canadian officials Saturday as saying that Ressam belongs to the
Islamic Armed Group, a terrorist organization that operates
primarily in North Africa and Europe. The officials told the news
agency that Ressam had recently tried to obtain Canadian
citizenship, but was denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven men, most of Algerian origin, are awaiting trial in
Quebec on theft charges in connection with the financing of
Algerian terrorist groups operating in France and elsewhere, the
Montreal Urban Community Police Service said.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam has a Canadian criminal record for theft under $5,000 and
was being sought on a Canadian immigration arrest warrant for theft
under $5,000, according to court papers filed by federal
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials in Washington, D.C., announced Friday that, as
a precaution, they were imposing more stringent questioning and
search procedures at border checkpoints around the nation, a move
expected to lengthen crossings for travelers at least through the
new year.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, a diminutive man with short black hair who said nothing
Friday during an appearance before a federal magistrate but
listened intently as a translator described the proceedings in
Arabic, has not cooperated with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   After Magistrate Judge David E. Wilson ordered on Friday that
the remainder of the nitroglycerine be destroyed as a safety
measure, Ressam's court-appointed lawyers objected that the defense
had not been able to test it, but the lawyers have otherwise made
no public comment on Ressam's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials said they strongly believed that Ressam
was not acting alone, but they have not publicly tied him to any
other suspect or terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and the CIA have taken over the investigation from the
U.S. Customs Service.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Kelly, commissioner of the Customs Service, said
Saturday that his agency was increasing security at remote entry
points like the one where the suspect attempted to enter the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that after the incident he ordered the agency to send
agents from other locations and have them work overtime so more
people passing at these points would be subjected to interrogations
like the one that caught the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 301 entry points into the United States, and some of
them are pretty remote,'' Kelly said. ``Port Angeles was one.''

A CLIPPERS CHRISTMAS STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With last Tuesday's Laker calamity promoting a
spirit of giving up, we have decided to offer up that timely
Christmas classic, ``A Clip per Carol.''
</P>
<P>
   Fade in: the hammock of team owner Ebenezer T. Sterling.
Sterling is either sleeping or faking it really well. We hear a
knock on a door we can't even see.
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: I don't need any more magazines. Go away!
</P>
<P>
   VOICE: I'm the Ghost of Clippers past ... let me in.
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: A party? Cool. (Sterling gets up and opens the door we
still can't see.) Hey, you're Clippers announcer Ralph Lawler.
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: Bingo!
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: I'm not payin' over time for this.
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: Oh, I suppose I can exhale now. Anyway, fasten your seat
belt ... I'm taking you on a trip.
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: Whoa, we're up so high, I can almost see Jerry Buss.
Say, spirit, who's that down there.
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: That's Larry Brown, the greatest coach in Clipper
history.
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: Isn't that like being the valedictorian of summer
school? Don't answer. What's Larry doing?
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: He's putting his letter of resignation in a bottle and
preparing to hurl it into the San Gabriel River because you didn't
give him a lifetime contract.
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: (After 30 seconds of laughter) Oh, yeah. Say, spirit,
what's that way over there, one of my apartment buildings?
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: No, that's the Pond in Anaheim. You could've been the
main tenant, remember?
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: Yeah, well look how far it is from Hollywood. After
all that Perrier, my celebrity friends would have to ask the limo
driver to pull over two or three times on the trip down. Say, who's
that man over there?
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: That's Bill Fitch, and he's busy trading Antonio McDyess,
refusing to give Darrell Armstrong guaranteed money to play on our
summer league team, and threatening to throw a tantrum if we draft
a high school kid.
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: What high school kid?
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: Kobe Bryant. Well, we're done here.
</P>
<P>
   (Sterling returns to his hammock. Again, we hear knocking.)
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: It's open. Hey, Ralph, you're back.
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: Yeah, I'm also the Ghost of Christmas Present. We're
working on a budget here.
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: Good. Let's ride. Hey, is that Chris Ford down there?
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: Indeed. He's shaking his head because you refused to let
Elgin Baylor hire some veterans to go with all of the young kids we
have, and because you didn't renew the contract of assistant coach
Jim Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: Is that Laker game my fault, too?
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: No, that's on him and the players.
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: Why haven't I fired Chris?
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: You hired him. It was your idea. And because you don't
want to finish the season paying two head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: I'm a smart guy, Ralph. Ralph? Hey, you're not Ralph,
you're Bill Walton.
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: Bingo!
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: It just isn't the same when you say it.
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: Sorry. By the way, I'm the Ghost of Christmas Future.
Pull my finger ... just kidding.
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: Oh, Bill. Hey, who's that down there?
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: That's me. I'm sitting on the bench because I'm going to
be your head coach.
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: Interesting. Why the head phones?
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: I'm also your lead broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: Where are Ralph and Mike Smith?
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: Long Beach. They were hired by that new CBA team down
there. Selling out every game.
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: Bah, hamburger. Long Beach is too far from Hollywood.
Say, redhead. Is that Lamar Odom over there?
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: You bet.
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: Look, he's become so good, he's playing with one arm
tied behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: That's a sling. And that piece of paper on his jersey is
his price tag.
</P>
<P>
   STERLING: Who are those other guys?
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: Bo Kimble and Randy Woods.
</P>
<P>
   GHOST: Wow, we hire those guys again? I'll bet they'll play for
the minimum! This is a wonderful dream, Bill. Bill? Hey, I think I
see Tiny Tim Hardaway. If we wait a few years, I'll bet we could
sign him for almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Strange Ainge
</P>
<P>
   While Danny Ainge insists it was his decision to quit coaching
the Phoenix Suns, league chatterboxes aren't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternal order of gossiping assistant coaches has endorsed
the notion that Suns boss Jerry Colangelo pulled the plug, then
orchestrated some tidy spin in an agreement with Ainge.
</P>
<P>
   It would go something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Ainge looks like a saint for putting family first and leaving
big-contract money on the table; Colangelo doesn't smell like
George Steinbrenner for firing a coach whose team was 13-7,
including a seven-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   For the Suns and new coach Scott Skiles, who began his expected
honeymoon period at 2-0, the move could turn out swell. According
to sources close to the Suns, Ainge didn't exactly promote
excellence through tough and thorough practices. Skiles, an
ex-point guard who once went after teammate Shaquille O'Neal during
a practice in Orlando, is considered tougher than getting a paying
raise from Ebenezer T. Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations
</P>
<P>
   The why-are-they-still unemployed? NBA coaches list includes
former Cavalier sharpie Mike Fratello - whose methodical approach
to offense scares owners who prefer selling tickets -- and
ex-Hornets dictator Dave Cowens - whose reputation for player
relations is bad and amplified when he walked out on his team in a
contract dispute before last season. ... Underclass men (and high
school hotshots) always alter the order of an NBA Draft, but many
scouts think Cincinnati power forward Kenyon Martin could be the
first senior selected next June. Martin is only 6-foot-8, but his
eye-popping athleticism, strength and relentless nature should make
him very ef fective. ... Denver point guard Nick Van Exel stirred
things up last week when he said reporters wouldn't swoon over
flashy Jason Williams if the Sacramento playmaker had black skin.
Van Exel is right. ...Clipper free-agent-to-be Maurice Taylor said
he and crony Jalen Rose (a Pacer on his way to free agency) are
hoping to go in a package deal. Their hometown of Detroit is one
target, Orlando is another. But when the tricky nature of cap room
is factored, the odds look long. ... Clipper back- back-backup
center Keith Closs paid tribute to the throwback style of Conseco
Fieldhouse in Indianapolis by wearing canvas Chuck Taylor hi-tops
during last weekend's visit. But when the Pacers began pulling away
and Closs looked ripe to participate in garbage time, he asked
equipment manager Pete Serrano to break out the standard,
post-apocalyptic leather Nikes.

RODNEY SMITH, 97, DEPUTY CHIEF IN THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (js) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   C. Rodney Smith, a retired major general in the Army Corps of
Engineers and later the director of Radio Free Europe, died Nov. 28
at his home in Annandale, Va. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Smith spent 31 years in the Army Corps of Engineers, retiring as
a deputy chief of engineers, the No. 2 position in the corps, in
1957; he had been promoted to major general in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   He then worked for three years with International Telephone and
Telegraph Corp. in Paris and Chicago before taking a position as a
vice president of Free Europe Inc. in New York City, the parent
company of Radio Free Europe, in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Smith became the director of Radio Free
Europe in Munich, a post he held for seven years. At the time,
Radio Free Europe was in turmoil in the wake of the Hungarian
uprising in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Many believed that the radio system, which was then financed by
the CIA, helped incite the revolt against a hard-line Communist
government and led Hungarian freedom-fighters to believe that the
United States would intervene. No such assistance arrived, and the
revolution was quickly crushed by the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rodney Smith restored morale at Radio Free Europe after the
Soviet crackdown triggered by the 1956 revolt in Hungary and helped
Radio Free Europe build up the democracy movements of the late
1960s,'' said Paul Gobel, a spokesman for the radio service.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Radio Free Europe in 1967, Smith spent a decade as
an arbitrator with the International Court of Arbitration. He also
worked as a consultant to the Board for International Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Clerin Rodney Smith graduated from the U. S. Military Academy at
West Point in 1926. He taught military history and engineering at
West Point from 1936 to 1940. After serving in World War II in
Europe and the Far East, he graduated from the Army Industrial
College.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was awarded the Legion of Merit three times by the United
States and the Cavalier Cross of the Order of Merit by Poland.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife, Ethel, died in 1967. His son Rodney was killed
in the Vietnam war the same year his mother died.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is survived by his wife, Katherine de Dory Smith; a son,
Brig. Gen. Anthony A. Smith of Alexandria, Va., who is retired from
the Army; a sister, Faye Eggert of Casper, Wyo.; six grandchildren,
and five great-grandchildren.

<P>
   Al Gore, at a fund-raiser in Brooklyn last week, talking about
vouchers for private school:
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the feeling that payment of taxes in support of
the public schools and simultaneously paying tuition in private
schools can create the feeling that there is a problem that must be
addressed with changes in public policy. I'm well aware that most
of you here feel that way. I have to tell you that I have not
supported vouchers for private schools and I want to tell you why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since early in the last century, this has been an issue in the
United States. When Abraham Lincoln ran for the state legislature
in Illinois, it was an issue in his race. The prevailing opinion
after much debate, repeated many times in our history, assumes that
if the national government begins to put taxpayer funding into
religious schools in response to the political divide of this
community or that community, then the line which is crossed is a
line that was originally put in place to protect religious freedom
and to guard against religious intolerance. ``Many came to the
United States generations ago, and in this generation, to seek
religious freedom. The history of the founding of the United States
conveys with it a definition of religious freedom which is
dominated by the concept of freedom from government participation
in religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The religious faith as practiced by minorities in this
country, whether Catholic some time back, whether Huegonots, as my
mother's family were so many generations ago, or Jews, especially
in parts of our country, such as rural middle Tennessee, where I
represented a congressional district for so long _ minority faiths
have been protected and have been a part of this country to an
exactly equal degree as the faith traditions of the largest
congregation of the largest religious tradition. In order to keep
it that way, I think the separation of church and state is a
principle which must be respected. ''

 WORKERS HURT AS 3 FLOORS OF HARLEM BUILDING COLLAPSE  (jw) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three floors of a building under renovation in Harlem
collapsed Saturday, seriously injuring at least two workers as they
fell to the basement of the structure, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The building, at North General Hospital, was scheduled to open
in the spring and provide shelter to Harlem's growing number of
AIDS patients. The third floor of the structure gave way about 11
a.m. as bricklayers were trying to shift scaffolding, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said it was unclear what had caused the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Records of the Department of Buildings showed 14 violations
under investigation on the five-story red brick building, which had
recently been gutted with explosives for renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse follows other construction accidents in Manhattan
in recent months in which people have been injured or killed. Fire
officials said the workers at the Harlem site appeared to have been
installing floor joists, the same items that failed in a fatal
collapse in Brooklyn last month.
</P>
<P>
   Building inspectors were looking at the building and poring over
records Saturday to see whether the type of work being done had
been authorized and whether the remaining structure would have to
be demolished.
</P>
<P>
   One of the injured, who was a bricklayer's assistant, suffered
severe head and leg injuries after the floor fell from under him,
creating a cascading effect that hurled the man onto the first
floor as it buckled.
</P>
<P>
   The man was taken to St. Luke's Medical Center in Harlem after
being removed from the building by the police, officials added.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cottingham, a police spokesman, said that worker was in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the injured were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The collapsed building is at 1997 Lexington Ave., near 121st

KNICKS DON'T WAKE UP, AND WIZARDS ROLL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Without an NBC camera for motivation _ and without a
night game to warm up for _ Latrell Sprewell fought his energy
level all afternoon Saturday , trying anything to conjure up enough
strength for a quiet matinee with the woeful Washington Wizards. He
finally lifted off from the left baseline with 7 minutes 3 seconds
left in the game, a few inches away from jolting the New York
Knicks and Madison Square Garden from their slumber.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Williams rose, too. The Wizards' spry forward sent
Sprewell's dunk attempt ferociously to the floor, as clear an
illustration as any that some people like to get up early and play
basketball more than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not a morning person,'' Sprewell said after
Washington's 95-83 victory ended the Knicks' five-game winning
streak. ``I'm not. Me, personally, I like later games. I feel like
I should be resting at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' block came after the Wizards had built a 12-point
lead, and it encapsulated not only Sprewell's abysmal 3-for-11 day
from the field but also the Knicks' utter inability to get back in
the game. The Garden crowd was hushed for most of the game, but it
voiced its displeasure by unleashing a few boos as the final buzzer
sounded.
</P>
<P>
   The fans came to see a surging team that had played smart and
well the past 10 days, piling up victories with intelligence and
intensity in the final minutes of tight games. Instead, they
watched an uninspired unit go through the motions for most of the
first three quarters before understanding how much trouble it was
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost more or less because of the way we came out, the way
we executed,'' Sprewell said.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston, who missed 9 of his 14 shots but still managed to
lead the Knicks with 20 points, said: ``We never got the intensity
or enough energy to get over the hump. A game like this shows that
we aren't there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy stood there in a charcoal-black suit for
much of the game, the look on his face somewhere between perturbed
and disgusted. As usual, he was playing the part of funeral home
director well. Before the game, he remarked on the MSG network that
he was bothered by a recent newspaper headline that labeled him
``Van Grinch.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach who stole Christmas proceeded to say the Knicks were
fooling themselves if they believed they had truly accomplished
something special by winning five straight games. After all, he
said, knocking off Golden State and a Philadelphia team without
Allen Iverson, holding off Boston at home and then beating depleted
Houston and dismal Dallas on the road was nothing to get excited
about.
</P>
<P>
   As pessimistic as he sounded, his concerns proved prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second quarter, the Knicks (15-10) were on
the verge of taking a seven-point lead. But defensive miscues
helped the Wizards (8-17) erase the deficit and creep to within
45-44 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson's departure for the training room in the first
quarter because of a severely upset stomach _ he did not return
until the start of the third quarter _ did not help the Knicks.
Without their defensive anchor, they were exploited inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think you have to work hard to win an NBA game,'' Van
Gundy said. ``You have to work extremely hard. We had a couple of
guys do that, but mostly we were very slow reacting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks usually take all the heat when they lose. Saturday
the Wizards had much to do with their demise. Washington is as good
an example of wasted potential as there is in the NBA, but for an
afternoon it showed its promise. Mitch Richmond (19 points on
9-of-15 shooting) and Rod Strickland (10 points, eight assists)
looked at times like one of the most potent backcourts in the game.
Juwan Howard scored 12 points and distributed six assists. He was a
nice complement at forward, moving the ball when he was
double-teamed and employing a nice little jump hook shot when he
was not.
</P>
<P>
   And Jahidi White may have been the most effective Georgetown
center in the building, scoring 15 points and snatching 10 rebounds
away from a more prominent former Hoya. Patrick Ewing finished with
18 points and eight rebounds. He moved fairly well and hit some
difficult shots, but he was neutralized by White.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great experience playing that well against Patrick,''
White said. ``He was one of the biggest reasons I went to
Georgetown and I have always admired his game.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little to admire about Ewing's team Saturday. Marcus
Camby played through an eye infection and gave the Knicks energy
Sprewell and others did not. But the Wizards shot 49.3 percent from
the field, better than any team New York has seen this season.
</P>
<P>
   That is apparently what happens when you don't wake up and play
defense.

PACIFIC LUTHERAN AS GOOD ON FIELD AS ON FILM
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SALEM, Va. _ Rowan Coach K.C. Keeler's worry before Saturday's
Division III national championship game was not that Rowan might
experience a letdown after beating its nemesis, Mount Union, in the
semifinals last week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was not over Rowan's sorry history in the final, either.
</P>
<P>
   What alarmed Keeler was film that he watched of Rowan's opponent
in the title game, Pacific Lutheran of Tacoma, Wash., which had
beaten four higher-seeded playoff teams on the road. Rowan had not
faced an offense quite like Lutheran's, full of misdirection plays
and angle blocking.
</P>
<P>
   And on defense the Lutes' four linebackers flew through the
frames, blitzing and cutting off passing lanes.
</P>
<P>
   After Pacific Lutheran's 42-13 victory Saturday in the Amos
Alonzo Stagg Bowl before 4,101 fans at Salem Stadium, Keeler
acknowledged, ``My worst fears were realized.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The logo on the opponents' helmets has changed, but Rowan's
futility in the Stagg Bowl has not. The Profs lost the final for a
record fifth time in seven years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the disappointment increased with each defeat,
linebacker John Gavlick replied: ``I've been on that playing field
three times and the feeling is the same. I refuse to hang my
head.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Against a Rowan defense that was eager to commit, Chad Johnson
of Pacific Lutheran completed 18 of 28 passes, mostly on dump-offs
and look-ins, with splashy results: 276 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Hicks, a 230-pound transfer from the University of
Washington, battered the Profs with 73 yards and two touchdowns and
finessed them with four receptions for 78 yards, including a
45-yard catch that set up his 1-yard touchdown burst to put
Lutheran ahead for good at the end of the first quarter. ``It's
something we're not used to,'' Gavlick said. ``That's not an
excuse. I take my hats off to them. They executed, we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Execution for Rowan on offense was similar, with Mike Warker
throwing two interceptions and absorbing five sacks as the Profs
limped to minus-63 yards rushing. One of the few positives for
Rowan was Taman Bryant, who had a Stagg Bowl-record 13 catches for
141 yards and a touchdown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the same old story prevailed for Rowan (12-2), Pacific
Lutheran (13-1) romped to a happy ending in the kind of feel-good
story that makes small-college football so compelling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Lutes' 72-year-old coach, Frosty Westering, is a former
Marine drill sergeant who gathers his players to watch the sunset
after practice and has them hold hands as they run off the field
during games. His son, Scott Westering, is the offensive
coordinator, and his grandson is Johnson, the quarterback and a
former ballboy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Lutes took advantage of their first title shot and Rowan's
game-opening jitters. The Lutes pounced on a fumble by Jason
Frabasile on Rowan's first offensive play and turned it into a
31-yard touchdown strike from Johnson to Todd McDevitt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Warker, who was 26 of 46 passing for 264 yards, tied the score
at 7-7 on a one-yard sneak late in the first quarter before Pacific
Lutheran reeled off 28 unanswered points. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the game so much that the scoreboard takes care of
itself,'' Frosty Westering said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Profs, however, faced an eight-hour bus ride home to
Glassboro, N.J., to contemplate their latest loss. It was a road
they have taken many times before.
</P>

   It was a lovely weekday morning and nothing seemed better to
Shari Cohen than a brisk hike through the city's North Mountain
Preserve. For the past several years, Cohen has used the trail at
Shaw Butte as a way to fill her lungs and clear her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful spot,'' she says. ``It's not at all the type
of place where you expect your worst nightmare to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In life and Wes Craven movies, such a statement is referred to
as ``famous last words.''
</P>
<P>
   Shari's bad dream began shortly after she arrived at the
mountain preserve _ when nature called.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next to the parking lot there was one portable toilet,'' she
says. ``That's it. One. It wasn't like I had a lot of choice, you
know, so I went in. I don't mean to gross you out, but . . .'' She
did, mostly because there's no genteel way to describe a lone
outhouse frequented by a procession of fiber-conscious hikers.
</P>
<P>
   Upon entering the loo, Shari set about performing a
contortionist act familiar to anyone who's been to the circus or a
Michael Jackson concert.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to achieve your desired goal without having any part
of the structure come into contact with any part of your body,
including, if possible, the soles of your feet. &QL; 
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?
</P>
<P>
   During one particularly taxing arabesque, or perhaps it was in
mid-pirouette, Shari felt the keys to her house and car slip from
her pocket and fall into the EEEEEEEUUUUUUUUUU.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 years, Shari Cohen has worked as a flight
attendant. She's a mature woman with a husband and a small child.
She's been trained to deal with airplane emergencies ranging from
heart attacks to terrorist assaults.
</P>
<P>
   She calmly assessed the situation inside the outhouse,
contemplated her options, determined the most logical course of
action, then let out a Blair Witch-like scream featuring the short
unprintable word that most succinctly described her predicament,
given where the keys landed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' she says. ``You think, `This can't be
happening to me.' Here are your keys in this . . . stuff, and you
just feel so stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Needing assistance, Shari went outside and explained her
situation to newly arriving hikers. They behaved the way any
caring, compassionate person would when confronted by a frantic
woman standing next to a public toilet.
</P>
<P>
   They slowly backed away until reaching their cars, then sped
off.
</P>
<P>
   No one had a portable phone (or would admit having one.) No one
had a pair of rubber gloves, or a coat hanger.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy did have a Baggie,'' she says, ``but that doesn't
cover much of your hand and when I looked at it closely there were
a few holes in it.'' &QL; 
BEEN THERE, DONE THAT
</P>
<P>
   Just then, a couple in their late 50s or early 60s came along.
Shari outlined her quandary for them and the man smiled and told
her not to fret.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took the plastic bag and put it on his hand,'' she says.
``Then he went into the john and, in a minute, came out with my
keys. He said he was an old farmer who had stuck his hands in
(expletive) many times before.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the man and his wife set off on their hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them if I could buy them lunch,'' Shari says. ``I
asked if I could bake them cookies. I asked for their names and
addresses so I could send them a thank-you note. But they didn't
want anything. They said they simply were helping a stranger. Can
you believe that? I don't know many people willing to do something
like that. Do you?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I've been told many times that, professionally, I
stick my hand in such places each and every day. I've also been
told that reading what I produce is, for some, like reaching into
such a place. But that is only an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   What Shari Cohen's experience provides is documentation of two
far greater truths.
</P>
<P>
   First, it's correct what the bumper sticker (more or less) says:
Stuff happens. Second, it's also true that sometimes, in response:
Good stuff happens. &QL;

EVERETT LADD JR., 62, EXPERT IN POLLING AT THE ROPER CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (js) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everett Carll Ladd Jr., a widely published polling expert who
was executive director of the Roper Center for Public Opinion
Research at the University of Connecticut, died on Dec. 8 at a
hospital in Willimantic, Conn. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   He died of heart failure, said Karen A. Grava, a spokeswoman for
the university.
</P>
<P>
   Ladd, who lived in Storrs, Conn., was a longtime professor of
political science at the university. The Roper Center is one of the
world's largest archives of polling data, with records on more than
14,000 national and foreign surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Under Ladd's leadership, the Roper Center, which was founded in
1946, started a series of publications, including Public
Perspective and America at the Polls.
</P>
<P>
   Burns Roper, son of the founder of the Roper Center, Elmo Roper,
said the recognition the polling center had received in the last 20
years ``is due almost entirely to Everett and the staff he
assembled.''
</P>
<P>
   Ladd was also the director of the Institute for Social Inquiry,
a polling group that is affiliated with the Roper Center and is
part of the university.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Ladd became well known as a critic of some
trends in polling. He said polls often concentrated too much on the
horse race aspect of elections. In 1996, he said that other
polltakers had overstated President Clinton's strength in the
presidential election and unfairly labeled the Republican
candidate, Bob Dole, as destined to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Ladd was born on Sept. 24, 1937, in Saco, Maine. He graduated
from Bates College and earned a Ph.D. from Cornell University. He
began teaching at the University of Connecticut in 1964 and retired
a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He also taught at the American Enterprise Institute for Public
Policy Research in Washington and held fellowships from the Ford,
Guggenheim and Rockefeller foundations, as well as the Center for
International Studies at Harvard, the Hoover Institution at
Stanford and the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Ladd wrote 20 books, including ``The American Polity,'' a
textbook now in its sixth edition. He was also a frequent
contributor to general interest newspapers and magazines. From 1987
through 1995, he was a columnist for The Christian Science Monitor.
He spent 10 years as senior editor of Public Opinion magazine and
six years as opinion-sampling editor at The American Enterprise
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Ladd is survived by his wife, Cynthia; two sons, Everett Carll
Ladd III of Hebron, Conn., and Benjamin Ladd of Savannah, Ga.; two
daughters, Corina Ladd of Willimantic and Melissa Teed of Midland,
Mich.; a sister, Mary Tucker of Biddeford, Me., and five
grandchildren.

JILL CRAIGIE, 85, BRITISH DIRECTOR AND SOCIALIST
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jill Craigie, a devoted socialist and feminist who became one of
Britain's first successful female film directors and whose
half-century marriage to the Labor Party leader Michael Foot put
her at the heart of the country's leftist politics, died on Monday
in London. She was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Craigie first made her mark in documentary filmmaking with
``Out of Chaos,'' a 1943 film about modern art; ``The Way We
Live,'' a 1946 study of the effects of the German blitzkrieg on
Plymouth, and ``Blue Scar,'' a 1948 look at life in an impoverished
Welsh mining village. It was while making her film in Plymouth that
she met Foot, then a candidate for Parliament. She interviewed him
and a relationship began.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Craigie was born in Derbyshire to a Scottish father and a
Russian emigre mother and had, by her own estimation, a wretched
childhood. Her parents divorced when she was an infant. Her father
was killed in World War I and her mother lived mostly abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to spend most of my holidays at boarding school,'' she
once said. ``I went to a dozen different boarding schools over the
years and never learned anything. I was one of the rootless people.
I had a very lonely childhood indeed. I turned to writing because I
was lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   After school, she moved to London and began writing an advice
column and horoscopes for a women's magazine called Betty's Paper.
She quickly found her way into artistic and literary circles. When
she was 19, she married a sculptor, Claude Begbie-Clench, and they
had a daughter, Julie. The marriage was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, she married Jeffrey Dell, a scriptwriter for the
movie producer Alexander Korda, and they wrote a play called ``The
Judge,'' which was staged in London in 1938. This marriage was also
short-lived, but Ms. Craigie was able to use the connections she
made through Dell to get work in the British film industry, first
making sports films and later turning to feature-length
documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   During these years, Ms. Craigie was romantically linked to many
prominent artists and writers.
</P>
<P>
   Foot and Ms. Craigie did not marry for almost two years after
their meeting in Plymouth, though they lived together for much of
that time. They finally married in 1949, she once said, to assuage
the concerns of Foot's family.
</P>
<P>
   Though many at the time doubted that Ms. Craigie's third
marriage would last longer than the first two, theirs turned out to
be a close and loving relationship, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Craigie's work as a filmmaker and writer dwindled after her
third marriage, though she did write the screenplay for ``The
Million Pound Note,'' renamed ``Man With a Million,'' a 1953 film
starring Gregory Peck that was filmed at Ealing Studios in London.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, she wrote and produced a BBC radio documentary about
the British suffragist movement, a subject that was near to her
heart since a chance meeting in 1940 with a group of aging
suffragists at a memorial service for one of their members.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decades of her life, Ms. Craigie was said to be at
work on a history of the movement, left unfinished at her death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, she made a television documentary called ``Who Are the
Vandals?'' that was critical of housing developers. In 1995, she
made ``Two Hours From London,'' a documentary about the former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   As Foot's political career prospered, Ms. Craigie became known
as one of his confidantes as well as the hostess for many Labor
Party gatherings at the couple's home. When Foot became chief of
the Labor Party in 1980, beginning a three-year leadership that
ended with a crushing defeat for the party in 1983, a few asserted
that he was being pushed by an ambitious wife. Ms. Craigie
demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be in exactly the same position he is in today had he
not been married to me, except he wouldn't have had such a nice
house,'' she said.

DREAM HELPS LENDZION COPE WITH HIS GRIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His enthusiasm melted away when he heard the news. Playing golf,
said Bob Lendzion, suddenly wasn't even in the picture, not with
the death of his sister, Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock. She had a stroke and just never recovered,''
said Lendzion, who was in California preparing for the first stage
of Senior PGA Tour qualifying when he got the call from his mother
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``She (Merrill) lived next door to my mother and helped take
care of her,'' said Lendzion, ``so it was hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Lendzion's mother talked him out of withdrawing, and as the
events unfolded, he is thankful she did. In a few weeks, Lendzion
will realize a dream when he tees it up as a full-fledged member of
the Senior PGA Tour and he doesn't deny that visions of another New
England club pro _ Dana Quigley _ sometimes cross his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to use (Quigley) as a front-runner,'' said Lendzion of
his former New England colleague, who has gone over $1 million in
earnings in each of the last two seasons. ``He has improved quite a
bit since I played against him. I don't think I'm at his level and
I've never had this tough a competition, but I think I'm good
enough to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   That he has the opportunity is still somewhat of a surprise, for
at the final stage of qualifying in Arizona Lendzion was a few
shots out of the eighth (and final) spot entering the final round.
Lendzion figured he had to put up a red number, but as birdie
chance after birdie chance slipped away, thoughts of returning to
the European Senior Tour loomed.
</P>
<P>
   At his 72d hole, Lendzion drained a 15-footer for par,
completing his 1-over 73_289. ``Good for 16th, I thought,'' said
Lendzion, ``but the conditions were so hard that day _ cold, windy
_ that the scores weren't very good.''
</P>
<P>
   The 73 looked like a 63 as contenders stumbled in with 76s and
77s. Lendzion vaulted into a tie for eighth, earning a coveted card
to walk the same fairways with Hale Irwin, Tom Watson, Tom Kite,
and the stars of the senior circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad little trip for the guy who laughingly calls himself
``a fair-weather Vermonter.'' That's because in the 24 years he
spent in the Green Mountain state (12 at Stratton, 12 at Quechee),
Lendzion was never there in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with Vermont,'' said the California native,
``but I loved to travel and play golf, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The winter trips were to South America and South Africa, to Asia
and Australia, then back to Vermont for summer. He was New England
PGA Player of the Year in 1992 and also won the national club pro
championship.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Quechee a few years ago, Lendzion settled into a
job in New York and kept his game polished, determined to give it
another shot once he turned 50. His two years with the European
seniors produced a victory in Turkey, but at Senior PGA Tour
qualifying in 1998, he wilted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the confidence,'' said Lendzion. ``I was a
little bit intimidated when I got there and saw Jim Thorpe, Gary
McCord, Bruce Fleisher, Ed Dougherty _ guys who had played in these
things all their life. I was only messing around with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He came up short in '98, but wasn't discouraged. Not as long as
he has a travel bag for his clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long time ago I bought a blank world map,'' said Lendzion,
52, ``and I marked in red all the spots I had been to. It was a lot
of fun. There's a lot of red _ but there's still a lot of white.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll resume that coloring project starting Feb. 4 at the Royal
Caribbean Classic in Key Biscayne, Fla., the first of many weekends
he has booked for 2000. Computer glitches don't concern him, not
when he is faced with such competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit scary to think about, to tell the truth,'' said
Lendzion. ``It takes about $600,000 to (stay in the top 31 and)
keep your card. That's wild for me to think about. Heck, $60,000 is
a good year.''
</P>
<P>
   Continental divide
</P>
<P>
   He authored a rather strange stat in 1999 _ finishing 78th on
money lists in both the United States and Europe _ but for good
measure, Scott Dunlap added success on another continent when he
won last weekend's Argentine Open in Buenos Aires. The 36-year-old
held off a noteworthy leaderboard _ Ian Woosnam, Carlos Franco,
Craig Stadler, and native son Eduardo Romero. Dunlap earned
$533,027 on the US PGA Tour, his season proof positive that you
don't have to win, you just have to be close a few times to earn
some hefty cash. His only Top 10 finishes _ third at Doral, 10th at
British Open, seventh at Canadian Open _ accounted for more than
half ($273,418) his season earnings . . . How to celebrate Tiger
Woods's 24th birthday? What about 24 hours of his golfing
highlights? That's The Golf Channel's present to enthusiasts,
starting Dec. 30 at 6 a.m. . . . When Jack Nicklaus teamed with Tom
Watson to win last weekend's Senior PGA Tour title in the Diners
Club matches, he earned a check for $100,000. Doesn't sound that
impressive given the financial climate in the pro golf world, but
consider this morsel: When he won the 1986 Masters, Nicklaus
received the largest check of his impeccable PGA Tour career _
$144,000 . . . The three-win ``silly season'' cash flow for Fred
Couples ($100,000 at the Diners Club matches with Mark
Calcavecchia, $635,000 at the Skins Game, $175,000 at the Shark
Shootout with David Duval) borders on the obscene, considering that
the total ($910,000) for seven days of golf in less than a month
was more than he made ($769,192) during the season. ``I keep
walking up the fairway in these events and wonder why I can't play
like this during the regular season.'' What regular season? The
tournament or two he squeezes in between vacations? Remember, he
played in two events after July 1, just 16 in all. Wonderful
player, but it's very hard to accept the fact that he skipped the
British Open yet cashed in on all these made-for-TV bonanzas . . .
Then again, some guys can't step into luck even in these
low-pressure offseason tournaments. Bobby Wadkins, many times a
bridesmaid, never a winner in his 25-year tour career, lost in a
playoff to Robin Freeman at the Puerto Rico Challenge . . . Good
financial news is usually reserved for the men, but the women got a
double dose of it recently. The Evian Masters in Switzerland will
be part of the LPGA Tour schedule in 2000 and its purse of $1.8
million makes it the richest stop. Next, officials at the Shoprite
LPGA Classic in New Jersey increased the purse to $1.1 million . .
. Englishman David Carroll's dream of qualifying for the European
Senior Tour came to a crashing halt when he opened with an 86 at
Gloria GC in Turkey. ``I found too many trees,'' said Carroll, who
faced long odds since he is (a) 60 years old, and (b) blind in his
right eye . . . Let the kids have Pokemon, golfers will settle for
books that capture the game's rich history. Two wonderful additions
are selling very well _ ``Pebble Beach Golf Links: The Official
History,'' and ``St. Andrews &AMP; The Open Championship: The Official
History.'' Perfect timing, too, for those fabled courses are
hosting the US and British Opens next summer . . . What are they
feeding these amateurs Down Under? First, 18-year-old Aaron
Baddeley wins the Australian Open, then Brett Rumford, 22, takes
the ANZ Players Championship. Indeed, Rumford drew inspiration from
his fellow amateur in the days between events. ``We went out to
dinner,'' said Rumford, ``and Aaron was waiting for me in the bar,
surrounded by five women. I thought that was really good.'' There
is still plenty of buzz in Australia over Baddeley, and Bruce
Devlin reportedly told Baddeley's father he will lobby on his
behalf for a spot in the Masters, where in the spirit of Bobby
Jones, amateurs are well-liked . . . Baddeley is playing in this
week's Coolum Classic in Australia, but it is a pro-am event and he
is forced to play from forward tees, thus ineligible for the
championship. Still, he attracted the largest gallery . . .
Speaking of the Masters, W.W. ``Hootie'' Johnson, chairman of
Augusta National, recently told a reporter that the club batted
.500 with last year's changes to the famed layout. The 1-inch cut
of ``rough'' was a good decision, he said, but lengthening the
par-4 17th wasn't. ``We really missed it on 17,'' Johnson is quoted
as saying, ``but we've made adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Due recognition
</P>
<P>
   As purses keep soaring, more praise should go toward the
backbone of pro tournaments _ the volunteers. Of course, that
doesn't happen, which is too bad. But here's a round of applause
for one volunteer, Pete Ziner of Sudbury, a fixture at the
BankBoston Classic the past eight years. The 76-year-old Ziner,
long retired from the construction business, was named Volunteer of
the Year (Senior PGA Tour division) by the PGA Tour. ``I knew my
name had been submitted,'' said Ziner, ``but I'm quite honored, but
quite surprised, too.'' He should be honored, but not surprised.
You can't find anyone involved in this event at Nashawtuc CC in
Concord who doesn't sing his praises. Ziner was a general volunteer
for years, but in August he came through in the clutch, assuming
the duties of chairperson of the greens reporters just one week
before the event began . . . Mike San Filippo is riding a pretty
good wave these days. The head pro at Nashawtuc recently won the
Resort Suites Club Professional Invitational in Scottsdale, Ariz.
Returning to his winter home in Florida, San Filippo triumphed
three times in the PGA Tournament Series, the second win at the
expense of Mark Brown, the Milton native who is head professional
at Tam O'Shanter GC in Brookville, N.Y. In that event, John Fields
of Belmont CC finished in a tie for sixth . . . Bermuda shorts:
Paul Parajeckas of Woburn CC finished third and Joe Carr first in
the senior division at what used to be called the Belmont
Invitational. At Port Royal GC, Ron Philo Jr. of the CC of Vermont
triumphed in a playoff at the Goodwill Invitational . . . When the
Golf Course Superintendents Association of America holds its 71st
annual international show in February, Stephen Tibbetts of
Segregansett CC in Rehoboth will be on hand to receive recognition
as a chapter winner . . . Melanie Curtin of Weymouth has decided to
take on the challenge of professional golf, playing on the Futures
Tour in 2000. To help her in this quest, Curtin's friends are
planning a fund-raiser Jan. 21 at the Weymouth Elks Club. For
information, call Patty Buck (617-325-0156), Peter Hess
(617-770-2746), or Lisa Kennedy (781-740-8358).

PETER BAIDA, 49, PRIZE-WINNING WRITER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter Baida, a writer who won first prize in the 1999
O. Henry Awards short-story competition, died on Dec. 10 at New
York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 49 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The causes were liver failure and postsurgical complications,
said his wife, Diane Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Baida won with his tale titled ``A Nurse's Story,'' which his
wife said was based on an account of a nurses' strike that appeared
in The Nation.
</P>
<P>
   The story is also in a new book-length collection, ``Prize
Stories 1999: The O. Henry Awards.'' In the book, the novelist
Sherman Alexie, a judge in the competition, writes of ``A Nurse's
Story'': ``There are no forced epiphanies here, no sermons on the
roofs of churches or hospitals. There are union strikes, tragic
deaths and the small realization that: `A good death. That's what
everybody wants.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a note Baida wrote for the book, he said 22 editors turned
the story down before it was accepted by The Gettysburg Review.
</P>
<P>
   Baida was also the author of a nonfiction book, ``Poor Richard's
Legacy'' (1990), about American business values.
</P>
<P>
   Baida, a native of Baltimore, graduated magna cum laude from
Harvard College and received master's degrees from Boston
University in creative writing and from the University of
Pennsylvania in business administration.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, he was a fund-raising executive at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Edward, and
his parents, Erwin and Lillian Baida of Baltimore.

A LIST WORTH FIGHTING FOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the new millennium closes in, America has become a nation of
lists.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 Greatest This, The 10 Worst That, The 10 Most Memorable
Whatevers. There are more lists being made this month than there
are at the North Pole on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of such lists is to spur interest, conversation, debate
and, since most are published in newspapers and magazines,
readership. Knowing that, the Associated Press has released its Top
10 fighters of the century. The list was broken down by weight
division, but it also included the predictable top 10 of all time,
regardless of tonnage.
</P>
<P>
   One could debate many of these selections all day, especially as
one reviews the top 10 rankings in any weight class over the last
100 years. For example, were there really four welterweights better
than Barney Ross? Was Miguel Canto really better than Jimmy Wilde,
who went 132-3-1 and had 101 knockouts as a flyweight back in the
early years of this century?
</P>
<P>
   Many are the hours you could chew up arguing whether Roberto
Duran or Benny Leonard was the greatest lightweight of all time and
long-time boxing trainer Don Turner insisted, ``They better move
Emile Griffith up to third (among the all-time welterweights)
because he'd beat everybody but Robinson, Henry Armstrong, and
maybe Leonard.''
</P>
<P>
   Fight guys, regular guys, and barber shop guys will argue for
days over the list, which would make the AP happy, but for the
moment let's skip the divisional breakdowns and just debate AP's
top 10 fighters of the century.
</P>
<P>
   According to a five-man panel that included veteran trainers
Eddie Futch, Angelo Dundee, Lou Duva, Gil Clancy, and long-time
West Coast matchmaker and promoter Don Chargin, they are:
</P>
<P>
   1. Ray Robinson
</P>
<P>
   2. Muhammad Ali
</P>
<P>
   3. Henry Armstrong
</P>
<P>
   4. Joe Louis
</P>
<P>
   5. Willie Pep
</P>
<P>
   6. Jack Dempsey
</P>
<P>
   7. Roberto Duran
</P>
<P>
   8. Benny Leonard
</P>
<P>
   9. Billy Conn
</P>
<P>
   10. Harry Greb
</P>
<P>
   Solid as that list is, several names are missing in action.
Where's Sugar Ray Leonard? Where's Barney Ross? Where's Jack
Johnson and, if he's on the list, where's Sam Langford? Johnson
refused to fight The Boston Tar Baby after he won the title because
he knew what was coming _ which was a hard day's night.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Tony Canzoneri, who was the youngest featherweight
champion in history and went on to not only win the lightweight and
junior welterweight titles, but also fight well enough to convince
the panel to rate him third among junior welterweights behind Aaron
Pryor and Ross, third among lightweights behind Duran and Leonard,
and fourth among featherweights behind Pep, Sandy Saddler, and
Salvador Sanchez. Who else was in the top four in three weight
classes in the opinion of these experts?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, that's who, which makes it dificult to believe a guy
could be among the top three or four fighters to box in the last
100 years in three weight classes yet not be considered among the
top 10 in all weight classes.
</P>
<P>
   The one unarguable point is that Sugar Ray Robinson was the
sweetest fighter of all time. That is in the opinion of most anyone
who ever watched him. Robinson was the only fighter to top three
lists _ the all-time fighters' list, the middleweight list, and the
welterweight list. Considering that he never lost to a
welterweight, it's easy to see why he was ahead of both Armstrong
and Leonard at 147 pounds. And considering that he won the
middleweight title five times between 1951 and 1958 it's fair to
say he belongs ahead of Greb and even our local hero, Marvelous
Marvin Hagler, although I'd have paid money to watch Hagler fight
Robinson in their heydays.
</P>
<P>
   So where the debate really begins is in the bottom half of the
all-time top 10 (unless, like Turner, you have a beef with Pep
being fifth because he lost three of four fights to Saddler).
</P>
<P>
   Of Nos. 6-10, the most debatable seem to be Duran and Conn.
Although you could certainly make a case for Duran, what about
Conn?
</P>
<P>
   I know of his great fight with Joe Louis. In fact, I've seen it
on old fight films many times and it was a marvelous show until he
got knocked stiff in the 13th round, but one night is not reason
enough to put him in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, you might argue, his greatness as a light heavyweight
would carry the day for him, but it didn't even carry the day for
the panel that placed him ninth among all fighters because the same
guys didn't even select him as the best light heavyweight of all
time. That spot went to Archie Moore, who didn't get a title shot
until his 159th fight, 16 years after his pro career began. Moore
finished 194-16-8 with 141 knockouts while Conn finished 63-11-1
with only 14 KOs, so you can see how Moore nosed him out. That
being the case, how did Conn end up in the top 10 all-time if Moore
did not?
</P>
<P>
   How can a guy be the ninth-rated fighter of the last 100 years
among everyone who ever boxed and yet not be rated first in his own
weight class? This baffles the mind. What is more baffling is that
Conn's presence resulted in the exclusion of the following: Rocky
Marciano, Langford, Johnson, Canzoneri, Ross, Wilde, and Sugar Ray
Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   Many will say the mention of Marciano in this corner is a
hometown decision, and maybe so, but only one heavyweight champion
in history has retired undefeated. I don't care who you're fighting
_ if you go 49-0, you could fight better than anybody in your era.
</P>
<P>
   Marciano, whose career ended in 1956, was the dominant
heavyweight of his time, and the panel voted him ahead of Dempsey
on the heavyweight list. Yet, they listed Dempsey on the all-time
top 10 and not Marciano. Apparently there's no consistency in
boxing ratings, even if not issued by the WBC, WBA, or IBF.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true Marciano was a small man by heavyweight
standards, so was Joe Frazier, and go ask Ali what it was like to
fight him. Marciano came with a big heart and the kind of power
that scrambled an opponent's mind with one punch. One-punch power
is the essence of heavyweight boxing. Who had it more than
Marciano?
</P>
<P>
   Langford fought at every level from featherweight to heayweight
and is the greatest fighter never to get a title shot, going
167-38-37 with 117 knockouts and 48 no decisions between 1902 and
1926. Both Johnson and Dempsey refused to fight Langford when they
held the heavyweight title for fear of the consequences, yet he was
ninth on the heavyweight list and not on the pound-for-pound list.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, of course, was the first black to hold the heavyweight
title and that alone would seem to far exceed any accomplishments
of Conn.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Canzoneri, who won the featherweight title at age 19
and championships in two other weight classes? Or, if you would
quarrel with his selection over Conn, what about Ross, who twice
beat Canzoneri and was rated fifth among all-time welterweights and
third among all-time junior welters?
</P>
<P>
   Wilde, a flyweight, is surely someone most people never hear of
any more but the experts had him second behind Canto and Pancho
Villa, who ended Wilde's career. Yet the same panel gave Wilde two
of the four first-place votes in that weight class with the fifth
abstaining. So a majority of the experts thought he was the best
flyweight of all time yet he doesn't make the top 10 over a guy who
wasn't judged best at 175 pounds?
</P>
<P>
   And now we come to Sugar Ray Leonard. Surely he, like all
fighters, should be punished for lifting Ray Robinson's nickname
because once you saw Robinson fight everyone else was tart at best,
but Leonard still won titles in five weight classes from
welterweight to light heavyweight, dominated his era, and defeated
both Duran and Thomas Hearns when they were at or near their best.
He also beat everyone else of his time at 147, which was his best
weight, and managed to con the judges into giving him a close
victory over Hagler when both were past their prime as
middleweights in his last great moment.
</P>
<P>
   To put Duran ahead of Leonard, who defeated Duran in two of
their three meetings when both were the same age defies logic, even
though you could argue Duran was the greatest lightweight of all
time and Leonard was not the greatest at any of his chosen weights
because the real Sugar Ray, was better.
</P>
<P>
   But how does Conn get in ahead of Leonard on the all-time list?
Or ahead of the others already mentioned?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, but his presence there makes for a good fight . . .
which is the goal of the fight game and of Top 10 lists.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A taxing date
</P>
<P>
   Difficult though his night was with Winky Wright, IBF junior
middleweight champion Fernando Vargas is still planning on
defending the title against ex-WBA welterweight champion Ike
Quartey on April 15 in Las Vegas. That deal is done and Quartey
will not take an interim fight even though he hasn't fought since
he was beaten by Oscar De La Hoya in March . . . Pity poor Zab
Judah. A purse bid for a fight with IBF junior welterweight
champion Terron Millett was scheduled for Dec. 8 but had to be
postponed 90 days when it was learned Millett had a broken hand.
Judah does hold the infamous ``interim'' junior welterweight title
(I thought all titles were interim unless your name is Marciano,
who's still waiting for someone to beat him), and is free to defend
it, which he is set to do in February . . . Dan Goossen and America
Presents have signed IBF No. 1 heavyweight David Tua away from Main
Events, marking another defection from the newly revamped company
started by Dan Duva. Word is Tua received a $1 million signing
bonus, although Goossen denied it.

IAFRATE PAINED BY THOUGHTS OF CAREER END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's 33 years old, with crusty, creaky knees that have required
nine operations, and he's less than a year removed from his second
back surgery, but he believes _ even if only whimsically _ that he
could play again in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying this because I think I'm better than anyone
else,'' said one-time Bruins defenseman Al Iafrate, reached last
week at his home in Livonia, Mich. ``But I know that pretty soon I
could go out there and play one game as good or better than most
defensemen who are playing today. Part of the reason I say that is,
there's just a lot of young defensemen out there who don't know the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know, it's the NHL, and you don't go out there for
one game. It's one game, five games, 10 games . . . sure, you can
go out there and be right back in it, but how long's it going to be
before everything falls apart? The question wouldn't be what I
could do. The question would be, how long could I do it for?''
</P>
<P>
   Once one of the most talented, fearsome, hardest-shooting
blueliners in the NHL, the 6-foot-3-inch Iafrate today finds his
passion for the game in the challenges and triumphs his son Max, 5,
and daughter Meg, 9, encounter on the ice. He works on
rehabilitating his back, dabbles in the stock market, and otherwise
lives out life in hockey suburbia, shuttling his kids from one rink
to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max, he's a rocket, a big kid, sort of a Peter Bondra type,''
said the proud Planet, whose upper-body tattoos and avant-garde,
off-the-cuff remarks earned him his out-there-somewhere reputation.
``And Meg, she's like me, back when I was in my prime, like 1989 to
1994, when I was making the All-Star team all the time _ she can
stride, man, she has that leg strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Iafrate's time in Boston was brief. Picked up from Washington in
a swap for Joe Juneau at the March '94 trading deadline, he still
had ample traces of the strength, talent, and raw ferocity that he
displayed in Toronto and Washington spanning some 10 seasons. But
his knees were buckling even before he hit the Hub. His last
hurrah, really, came only weeks later when he led the Bruins to a
Game 7 victory over the Canadiens in the opening round of the '94
playoffs. He was the bouncer, the Garden his saloon, the Habs his
prey. Until last spring's victory over the Hurricanes, that stood
as the last postseason series won by the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it in Boston,'' recalled Iafrate, who never played
again for the Bruins after that '94 playoff season, his knee woes
sidelining him for two full seasons before he was dealt to San
Jose. ``What a bummer, the way it turned out. It seemed great when
I got there, and then it got ugly. But, hey, that's the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's facing retirement, although that specific word won't
come from his lips, and he doesn't otherwise talk about post-career
planning. Regular season and playoffs included, he has 870 games
under his name, 498 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty long time, I guess,'' he said. ``When you're
young and you're fast and strong, you think you can play forever,
especially when you're big. But big guys, in contact sports like
hockey and football, over time you're carrying 40 extra pounds
every stride, every game, and things break down over time. I loved
to play. I felt like I was free, you know? To be healthy, to have
the genetics to be fast, to have the hard shot and all that stuff .
. . when I was 27, pfff, I thought, `I'll play 15 years, easy.'
Then all of a sudden it's my knee, my shoulder, my back. Heck, when
I hit 29, it was like someone had a voodoo doll of me, or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to last season, Iafrate signed a deal with the Hurricanes
that could have paid, with all incentives met, up to $3 million.
But his back kept him from playing and, last April, he needed a
second surgery to clean up a bulging disk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, I'd take 10 more knee operations before I had
one more back operation _ they're tough,'' he said. ``The only
thing that's good about a back operation is that you get instant
relief. My leg was numb, I couldn't control my foot, but they make
that cut and, bang, you're OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll occasionally make the 40-minute drive to the Joe, home of
the Red Wings, to watch an NHL game. He was there recently to see
the 'Canes. If the day ever came that he felt healthy enough, he'd
call up Pete Karmanos, owner of the 'Canes and Iafrate's friend
from amateur hockey days, and ask for one more shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss it a lot,'' said the Planet. ``But I know I did
everything that I possibly could do to get back and play. I wanted
to play. In fact, I probably played more games than I should have,
given my back and knee operations. But I guess it's always in you.
You always think you can still play.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's next? I don't know. I haven't thought of it, maybe
because I haven't come to terms with letting go yet. Maybe I'm
still wandering aimlessly in my head, thinking that I might play
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Neilson rates well
</P>
<P>
   Flyers coach Roger Neilson, recently diagnosed with cancer in
his bone marrow, was expected to begin chemotherapy Wednesday, but
it was delayed until Monday while more tests were taken. Neilson,
65, planned to stay on the job, receiving treatments as an
outpatient, but he will be sidelined for some six weeks when he
undergoes a marrow transplant in late February. Meanwhile, he
continues to ride his mountain bike to Flyers' practice in
Voorhees, N.J., each day and applies large doses of humor to his
medical odyssey at hand. To wit: ``Clarkie (Flyer general manager
Bob Clarke) said I have a different tie every night,'' Neilson was
quoted in the Associated Press. ``I should get a different wig
every night. I don't know if I could go for that or not. You've got
to see what you look like. I may look really good without hair.''
Just one more example of how hockey guys view injury and illness
far more as a nuisance than a hinderance. Look for ex-Sabre wing
Craig Ramsey, now in his second season as a Flyer assistant coach,
to take over the bench in Neilson's absence, projected to be some
15 games . . . Prior to his signing with Dallas on Wednesday,
rumors that same day had the Bruins picking up 33-year-old Kirk
Muller, the former No. 2 draft pick (after Mario Lemieux in '84),
who last year made $2 million with the Florida Panthers. Muller
might help win a few faceoffs, and that's always helpful, but
adding more old guys is not the answer here in the Hub. The idea is
supposed to be to move ahead with a new, energized product with
upside, not to be running a vintage car show on ice . . . The Dec.
24 Hockey News includes an entertaining, two-page spread
highlighting the game's most colorful personalities. Included in
the top 10, three ex-Bruins: Eddie Shack (No. 1), Eddie Shore (No.
3), and Don Cherry (No. 7). Shack, who wore the Black and Gold for
120 games (1967-69), actually developed his lovable personality in
his years with the Leafs prior to joining Boston. Now retired at
age 62, after years of selling Christmas trees and running his own
golf course, Shack eschews suggestions that he had the tools and
talent to be a high-profile NHLer. Shack to Hockey News writer Eric
Duhatschek: ``There's no use even thinking like that, because
there's nothing I want out of life that I don't have.'' . . . A
Gino Odjick (Islanders) crosscheck left Doug Weight with cracked
ribs last week, leaving the Oilers without a sizable chunk of their
offense for the forseeable future. Once again, what point are these
guys trying to make by maiming one another? The sport has enough
inherent danger that they don't have to go out there intending to
injure . . . Montreal forward Brian Savage, recovering from three
broken vertabrae, is expected to make a full recovery, but word
around the Habs is that he won't skate again this season . . . If
the infighting among the thirtysomething Oiler owners doesn't
abate, no one will be surprised if ex-Bruin Glen Sather, the Oilers
boss who structured the one-time dynasty around Wayne Gretzky in
the '80s, just up and walks. The 56-year-old Slats would get his
pick of available president/GM posts . . . How many shorthanded
goals a season are lost, not even attempted, by clubs that simply
fire the puck down the other end of the ice when killing a penalty?
Not only has the trap mentality muted the game's creativity at
5-on-5, it has stopped clubs from even thinking attack when
opportunities present themselves even, yes, when shorthanded. Be
safe. Be boring . . . The Bruins used a sixth-round pick, No. 179
overall, this past June to select goalie Don Choukalos. ``An
absolute steal,'' raves his GM in junior hockey, Brent Parker of
the Regina Pats. ``He's that typical big (6-3) butterfly goalie in
the style of a Patrick Roy _ not that I want to put that kind of
pressure on the kid, even to think of making that kind of
comparison. We're the second-youngest team in the (Western Hockey
League) right now, part of the reason his goals against average is
a little higher (3.50) than you might like. But he's made 27 starts
for us so far, and I've got no doubt he'll be a dominant goalie in
this league next year.'' . . . Belmont Hill's Paul Mara returned to
the Bolts' lineup last week after missing a month-plus with a
broken jaw . . . The Blues picked up free agent Bob Bassen for some
checking grit, knocking ex-Leaf Derek King out of work. The Blues
lost some of their bite when pinball Tyler Nash went to the
sideline with a concussion . . . As of Wednesday night, the
Penguins were 4-0 in the wake of Herb Brooks replacing Kevin
Constantine. Brooks has the Penguins playing the best defensive
game of all _ maintaining possession of the puck, exactly what he
was preaching when he entered the league with the Rangers following
his '80 Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Flying start for Murphy
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't shown a trace of scoring touch yet, but night after
night, 32-year-old Joe Murphy is the Bruins' most energized skater.
I'm just not sure if that's the good news or the bad news . . . The
Canucks, paying Mark Messier $6 million this season, can keep him
for the same price next season or cut him free with a $2 million
buyout. Given how the market for older guys (he'll be 39 on Jan.
18) has collapsed the last six months, Messier might not command $1
million as a free agent. Perhaps next summer's most interesting
salary case: What will unrestricted free agent Brendan Shanahan
bring on the open market? He's at $4 million this season with the
Red Wings. Prior to last summer, he could figure on bumping up to
about $7 million or $8 million. But with the start of a new salary
structure finally taking place _ everywhere but on Broadway _ the
then 31-year-old Shanahan could be faced with a pay cut . . . OK,
it's not exactly novel, but how about plopping Joel Prpic in the
middle of a second power-play unit, just to see if he can use that
6-7 frame of his to bang in a couple? . . . Hard day in hockey last
week when Charles Schulz, not wanting to work with a daily deadline
anymore, announced that he'll pen his last Peanuts cartoon just
after the New Year. The game's always had a friend in Schulz, who
routinely sent Snoopy over the boards for a shift on the frozen
birdbath. Personally, I hope his last panel has Lucy once and for
all keeping the football in place and Charlie Brown kicking one to
infinity and beyond _ and then falling flat on his back . . . The
Blackhawks slapped a 5-2 loss on the Sharks in San Jose Tuesday
night with help from rookie center/forward Kyle Calder. The No. 130
pick in the '97 draft stepped onto the No. 1 line with Alexei
Zhamnov and Tony Amonte and drove in his first career goal. Hmm. A
rookie named Calder. There's got to be some competitive edge in
that . . . Two guys who were listed as healthy scratches last week
who have some interesting upside: Geoff Sanderson (Buffalo) and
Blair Atcheynum (Chicago). In his Whale days, Sanderson had the
shot and speed to make one believe he could be a 40-goal guy for 10
or 12 years (last time was 1993-94). Atcheynum has enough size
(6-2, 210 pounds) to make him interesting for a third or fourth
line . . . Rumors persist that Vancouver is trying to pry netminder
Felix Potvin from the Isles. If it happens, Wrentham's Garth Snow
likely would be Uniondale-bound in the exchange . . . What a night
in the pipes for Calgary's Fred Brathwaite, Calgary's diminutive
backstop, who turned back 49 St. Louis shots Tuesday in a 1-1 tie.
Brathwaite (cheapest No. 1 goalie in the NHL at $400,000) turned
back 10 shots each from Al MacInnis and Chris Pronger, while his
fellow Flamers could muster only 17 shots at the other end . . .
San Jose's Owen Nolan, chosen No. 1 overall by Quebec in 1990, was
named NHL Player of the Week (four goals and two assists in three
games). A sure-shot, can't-miss, got-all-the-tools prospect coming
out of juniors, Nolan now has been named player of the week exactly
twice (previously, April '95). Need more proof that the 18-year-old
amateur draft is like spotting a poet laureat at a junior high
spelling bee? . . . Ex-Bruin first-round pick Kevyn Adams, who
never signed with Boston, is getting yet another shot with the
Maple Leafs . . . Prior to Wednesday night's six-goal explosion in
the first period, en route to an 8-3 trouncing of the Kings, the
Rangers were a mind-numbing 9 for 112 on the power play. That's an
8.03 percent success ratio. It doesn't get much worse than that,
$60 million payroll or no $60 million payroll . . . They're piling
on north of the border. On the heels of Ottawa owner Rod Bryden
threatening to sell his Senators if the Canadian goernment doesn't
throw him millions in tax relief, the Canucks last week reported a
$17 million loss last season, prompting club chairman Stanley
McCammon to say, ``It is simply not reasonable to expect any owner
of any business to continue in such an adverse situation.''
Vancouver's problems in McCammon's view: rocketing salaries, a weak
Canadian buck, and an unattractive tax base. For two years, the
Canucks have lost close to $40 million (Canadian). Look out over
the holidays. If the Canadian government can hoodwink the public
into underwriting these clubs with lottery dough or big tax breaks,
it likely will come while vox populi has its attention fixed on
peace, goodwill, and the wonders and worries of Y2K _ not unlike
slipping a guy out of the penalty box for a backdoor breakaway.

ATHLETES IN NEED OF CHARACTER CHECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some words experience a full-fledged identity crisis when they
find themselves in the pro sports world. ``Character'' is like
that. If you say a colonial home has character, you don't have to
explain yourself. If you say a pro team has character, you're
virtually begging for a three-day panel discussion.
</P>
<P>
   A team with character. Does such a thing exist? If it does, what
does it mean? How far will an owner go to ensure that it remains?
And do fans truly care if their team has an athlete who goes home
and makes other peoples' lives miserable (and sometimes ends those
lives)?
</P>
<P>
   I used to think character was one of the corniest words in
sports, reserved for exaggerated ``Rocky'' and ``Rudy'' storylines.
But after watching the last few months in the NFL, from Steve
Muhammad to Rae Carruth, I think it would be nearly impossible for
anyone to be dismissive of an athlete's personal character, no
matter how interpretive the definition may be.
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless you live in Indianapolis and root for the Colts.
There will be a lot of fuzzy stories about the revived Colts, who
could clinch the AFC East title Sunday. But I don't have an ounce
of respect for the organization nor the people who run it. Not only
are they enablers, they are silent enablers. They could lose their
divisional playoff game by 40 points and it wouldn't come close to
erasing the negative karma they have welcomed into their exclusive
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Muhammad, the Colts defensive back, found tragedy
when his wife, Nichole, died shortly after delivering a stillborn
child. A couple of weeks before his wife's death, Muhammad was
arrested and charged with three counts of misdemeanor battery.
Nichole's 6-year-old son, Eric, was pushed aside when he tried to
protect his pregnant mother from being hit.
</P>
<P>
   Character may be hard to describe, but I would say that a man
who chooses to be physical with his pregnant wife does not have it.
Neither does a team that fails to suspend the offending player for,
at least, half the season.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying Muhammad shouldn't be able to support himself for
making a mistake _ if he is even conscious that he made a mistake _
but there is no way my binoculars should have picked up this last
Sunday at the RCA Dome: a man in a blue ``Muhammad'' jersey, on the
field playing against the Patriots. For some reason, I thought the
Colts would either waive Muhammad or keep him inactive for the rest
of the season. Apparently, they are as oblivious as he was the
night he raised his hands and immediately put three people (his
wife, her son, and the unborn child) in danger.
</P>
<P>
   You know what's sick? Muhammad probably will be the most hated
man in Indiana if he misses the tackle that costs the Colts a
playoff game. His teammates would never forget that and neither
would fans. The community becomes less unified when his personal
life becomes the story.
</P>
<P>
   Character may be too much of an ideal or cliche to be a factor
in the sports world. But the haunting tale of Cherica Adams and
Carruth proves that at least some people, not necessarily athletes,
have it.
</P>
<P>
   By now you have seen the television and newspaper images of a
slight Carruth, escorted by FBI agents. The former Carolina
Panthers receiver is accused of conspiring to murder his
girlfriend, Adams, who died Tuesday. Prosecutors will argue that
Carruth and three accomplices masterminded a drive-by shooting
scheme that eventually resulted in a wounded Adams calling 911,
ironically, from a street that runs off of Rea Road in Charlotte.
Adams was six months pregnant when she was shot four times in the
chest. Her baby boy _ who is believed to be Carruth's _ was
delivered 10 weeks prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the news reports have focused on the potential pathos of
Carruth, who majored in English at the University of Colorado and
spoke of wanting to write novels. There were some _ but not as many
_ stories about the stunningly beautiful Adams, who knew many NBA
and NFL players, modeled, and sold real estate. But one story in
the Charlotte Observer seemed to touch what we mean when we speak
so gratuitously of character.
</P>
<P>
   The night Adams was shot, a 61-year-old man named Farrell
Blalock was in his home reading. He heard four shots and then
noticed that a car _ horn honking and headlights flashing into his
front window _ was moving toward his home. The car, driven by the
injured Adams, was 8 feet from his door. He called 911 and began to
open his front door. His wife told him not to, but he did anyway.
When he got outside, police had arrived to assist Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Blalock told the newspaper that Adams probably drove her black
BMW toward his house because she saw that his lights were on and
that, maybe, he could help. He did, even though it would have been
easy not to. I don't know if Carruth killed his girlfriend, but at
the very least it is safe to say that he did not help her by
initially refusing to speak with anyone and then becoming a
fugitive who was captured in the trunk of a car.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe now we will all hear something different when an athlete
protests, ``I am a regular person, just like you. I have the same
problems that other people have.'' Maybe now we will believe them
when they say their tremendous contracts do not relieve them from
stress and domestic problems; that their fame does not equate to
clear thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Pro athletes always say it's not about the money. They are
right.

BARKLEY DOESN'T NEED RING TO ENTER HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Barkley gave it 15 shots, and he now retires without
ever having played on an NBA championship team. Although some
people seem to feel different, this makes him neither a bad person
nor a failure.
</P>
<P>
   It just means he was unlucky.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors go into the making of an individual champion in a
team sport. The first is skill. You've got to be good enough to
make a professional team. The second, and far more important aspect
for most everyone who has ever played any sport, is luck. Who you
play with and when you play with them matters.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Barkley was a very good basketball player. A strong case
can be made that he is either the fourth- or fifth-best individual
player of the past 15 years, depending on what you think of Karl
Malone. (No one would seriously argue that either one approaches
Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, or Larry Bird). Yet during his long
and distinguished NBA career, he made only one appearance in the
NBA Finals, his Phoenix team losing in six games to Chicago in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, neither Malone nor his buddy and fellow
sure-to-be first-ballot Hall of Famer John Stockton, have won an
NBA title, either. It's not easy, and it's harder now that ever,
given that the overall talent is dispersed among the ridiculous
number of 29 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, it is only in very recent times that people have
made winning a championship the key factor in evaluating the career
of great players. In Ye Olden Days, people seemed to recognize
inherently that it's very hard to win it all, and that the gods
must be with you. Not everyone can be a Bill Russell (11
championships in 13 years) or Yogi Berra (11 World Series titles in
18 seasons as a Yankee) or even a Charles Haley (five Super Bowl
rings). Alfred P. Doolittle had it right. A man does indeed need
``A Little Bit O' Luck'' to be left standing at the end of an
athletic campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some basketball greats who finished up ringless:
</P>
<P>
   Elgin Baylor (14 years), Dave Bing (12 years), Alex English (15
years), Artis Gilmore (12 NBA years), Kevin Johnson (11 years),
Bernard King (16 years), Bob Lanier (11 years), Pete Maravich (10
years), Sidney Moncrief (11 years), Calvin Murphy (10 years), Guy
Rodgers (12 years), Nate Thurmond (14 years), and Buck Williams (17
years).
</P>
<P>
   Baseball offers a long list of Hall of Famers who never played
on a World Series winner:
</P>
<P>
   Luke Appling (20 years), Richie Ashburn (15 years), Earl Averill
(13 years), Ernie Banks (19 years), Jim Bunning (17 years), Rod
Carew (19 years), Ty Cobb (24 years) _ betcha didn't know that _
Nellie Fox (19 years), Gabby Hartnett (20 years), Harry Heilmann
(17 years), Billy Herman (15 years), Harmon Killebrew (22 years),
Chuck Klein (17 years), Napoleon Lajoie (21 years), Bob Lemon (15
years), Ted Lyons (21 years), Heinie Manush (17 years), Juan
Marichal (16 years), Rube Marquard (18 years), Willie McCovey (22
years), Phil Niekro (24 years), Eppa Rixey (21 years), Robin
Roberts (no, not her; the great Phillies-Orioles-Astros-Cubs
righthander, 19 years), Lloyd Waner/Paul Waner (combined 39 years
and 5,611 brotherly base hits), Billy Williams (18 years), Ted
Williams (19 years), Carl Yastrzemski (23 years), and Robin Yount
(19 years). And I may have missed one or two.
</P>
<P>
   In football we don't have to go any further than Dan Marino. And
who in this town doesn't know about Ray Bourque?
</P>
<P>
   Think of the absurdity of evaluating player vs. player on the
basis of championships alone. Do you think, for example, that the
Yankees could have won these past two years if Derek Jeter had been
replaced by either Alex Rodriguez or Nomar Garciaparra? Or how
about this? Hank Bauer was a nice, solid, professional right
fielder for the Yankees of the 1940s and '50s, but he was nowhere
near as feared and respected a hitter as Roy Sievers, whose lot in
life was to do his prime-of-life slugging for the hapless St. Louis
Browns and equally hapless Washington Senators while Bauer was
playing on seven championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   For all but the starriest of superstars, it's all luck. Listen,
if Eddie Yost, a.k.a. ``The Walking Man,'' had been lucky enough to
be with the Yankees, as opposed to the Senators, Tigers, and
Angels, he might be in the Hall of Fame. Exhibit A is K.C. Jones,
who wasn't even as good a player as Al Attles, but who has enjoyed
a near lifetime benefit of an association with Bill Russell. Jones
is in the Basketball Hall of Fame. Suggest Attles for the Hall of
Fame and await the laughter. But Attles was the same player, only
better, since he did everything Jones did while also putting the
ball in the basket.
</P>
<P>
   We've got to abandon this ring mania. Is Steve Kerr a better
player than Charles Barkley because he's got four rings to
Barkley's none? Would you take Charles Barkley or Luc Longley?
Charles Barkley or Dennis Rodman? Charles Barkley or Mario Elie?
They've all got more rings than Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries matter. Bad calls matter. Back up to the Celtics' Game
5 victory over Philadelphia in '81, and if Tiny Archibald doesn't
get a phantom call on a late 3-point play in the Eastern Conference
Finals the Celtics don't win that game and they're out. It's that
capricious.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, who you're with and when you're with them matter
the most. Think of luckless Tom Van Arsdale, a terrific NBA player
for 12 years (14,232 points). Forget about a ring. All he wanted
was to get in the playoffs. He played with horrible Detroit and
Cincinnati teams for 11 years without ever getting into the
playoffs. He was picked up by a Phoenix team coming off a berth in
the Finals for the 1976-77 season. He would be re-united with his
twin brother Dick and there was no way he'd get cheated this time.
Wrong. The 1977-78 season was the only time in a nine-year stretch
the Suns failed to make the playoffs. No NBA player even remotely
as good as Tom Van Arsdale failed to participate in at least one
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just making the playoffs. Winning a championship is
exponentially harder. If you're lucky enough to play with the
incomparable Bill Russell and it's a 14, 12, 10, or even an
eight-team league, and there are as few as two playoff rounds, you
may get a ring (hello there, Bennie Swain). If your misfortune was
to spend your prime years in a league dominated by demigods named
Magic, Larry, and Michael, you don't get one. It doesn't mean you
weren't a magnificent player.
</P>
<P>
   So I ask you: Would you take Charles Barkley or Bennie Swain?

JACKSON PUTS LAKERS ALL ON SAME PAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We missed the NBA champs last year. The San Antonio Spurs never
made it to Boston and the Celtics never made it to Texas. That
won't be the case this season. You'll see the 2000 NBA champions _
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's early, but I've seen enough already, even if the
Lakers have been the out-of-the-box favorites the last few years
and fizzled. Phil Jackson has done what a bunch of others could not
do _ get Shaquille O'Neal to rebound, defend, and block shots _ and
the result is a guy playing the way he should have been playing the
last several years. He has been a certifiable terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' said Bucks general manager Ernie Grunfeld,
``before the year started, if you asked me which player I might
want, I'd have said (Tim) Duncan or maybe (Kevin) Garnett. But now,
it has to be Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers started East this past week with the best record in
the league and won in Atlanta on Thursday with Shaq doing basically
nothing. Kobe Bryant merely stepped up and scored 30. Ho hum. The
game in Boston will be the Lakers' fourth in five nights, so if
you're going to see any warts, that might be the time and place.
</P>
<P>
   But, so far, there haven't been too many. OK, there isn't a
brute at power forward. That might need to be addressed, but
really, does Shaq need anyone the way he's going now? (Anthony
Mason is, as they say, available.) Point guard? In Jackson's
system, you don't need one. Bryant has become Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, the Lakers always were presumed to have
the best talent and the worst chemistry. Utah (twice) and San
Antonio (once) systematically destroyed them in the playoffs,
making them look petty and juvenile in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had to look at the Lakers and see what he saw in Chicago
in 1990 _ a team with a couple of superstars hungry to win but not
knowing how to do it. His arrival and the cachet he instantly
brought with him should have cured the internal mess. But he also
brought with him a game plan: the old triple post (triangle) which
worked so well in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on talented teams with game plans, but they could be
defended,'' Rick Fox said. ``If we lose now, it's because we beat
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And the talent? ``I don't feel we're the most talented team in
the league,'' Fox said. ``But I found out that being on the most
talented team doesn't always mean you're going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Like last year. And the year before that. The Lakers were
outsmarted by the Jazz and Spurs, who were disciplined and driven.
They may still be. But the Lakers are, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, knowing what we're doing has made it easier to
play defense,'' Fox said. ``There are no errant shots. No one is
breaking out. We know where the shot is being taken and when.
There's more structure. There's a lot to be said about coming to
work every day knowing what your day is going to be like and what
is going to be required of you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers made a lot of changes after last season's sweep at
the hands of the Spurs _ a new arena, new uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life as a Laker, each year, is always new,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, it will also be fulfilling.
</P>
<P>
   Home for holidays
</P>
<P>
   It was a great thing Danny Ainge did this past week. But it's
also nice to be able to have the resources to do what he did. There
are thousands of fathers _ not to mention mothers _ who would kill
to have more time with their families, but work somehow manages to
get in the way. But it's also hard to go from something to nothing,
especially for someone as ultracompetitive as Ainge. He'll need
something soon or he'll go crazy . . . Randy Wittman, the Cavs'
first-year coach, said he's discovering that one can get easily
consumed with the job. ``The time involved is so much more than
when you're a player,'' he said. ``That has been the biggest thing
for me _ time management. You can't do everything. You have to
delegate and let people do their jobs. At first, I tried to do
everything and it drove me nuts. You could be here (at the arena)
all day. It took time for me to understand that.'' . . . The
Chicago Bulls went into the weekend as the only team still to have
not scored 100 points in a game. There was speculation last week
that Khalid Reeves might be joining the Bulls to help their
beleagured backcourt (as opposed to helping them win, which is not
in the grand design). He was playing in Greece, but apparently left
the team over a pay dispute. Then again, some of his teammates
thought he was ignoring the plays to run up his stats, a shocking,
shocking charge, if true . . . The Nets had a bit of a good stretch
this past week (before losing in Washington) and a lot of it had to
do with the return of Kerry Kittles. ``His presence has been a
major plus at both ends,'' GM John Nash said. Nash said Jayson
Williams is two weeks away from returning to practice and a month
away from returning to live action. Should that schedule be
correct, it might be worthy to see how Keith Van Horn responds. The
Nets feel that Van Horn's soft play is due in large part to not
having Williams around to protect him and boost him. But even with
the return of Williams, Nash said the club still needs a real post
presence and will have to get one either in the draft or via free
agency. As for the team's hideous (2-15) start, ``I still can't
believe it,'' he said. ``It was a major, major disappointment. It's
hard to win only twice in 17 games. With all the parity, a good
team can have a bad game and you win by default. That really
stunned all of us.'' . . . Brian Hill left Vancouver with the
following legacy: his 31 victories over two-plus seasons makes him
the winningest coach in franchise history. Brian Winters is next
with 25 . . . The Spurs figured things would not change all that
much with the new rules. They feel otherwise now. ``They definitely
hurt us,'' Mario Elie said. ``These guys are so quick that with one
crossover, they're at the hole and if you've got guys spread out,
it's going to be a SportsCenter highlight if you're too late. I
really don't like the new rules. I don't know why they changed
them. For a guy like me, a physical player, it takes away from my
game. I'm 36. I don't think people expect me to slow down guys like
Vince Carter or Grant Hill. It's impossible.'' Avery Johnson
concurs. ``We thought the rules wouldn't really bother us because
we have shot blocking. But our perimeter guys are more physical
players, they are more like post defenders than isolation
defenders. With them not being able to put a forearm on anyone, not
to be able to touch them in any shape, form or fashion, it makes
things a little difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Still no go
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hardaway went through a full practice Friday with the Heat.
He then pronounced himself not quite ready to return to duty. The
Heat have been without their playmaker (jammed knee) for 12 games
(counting Saturday night) and he said Friday, ``It still doesn't
feel right.'' He vowed not to return until it does, always a wise
decision. Miami, meanwhile, won seven of its first eight without
Hardaway (the lone loss coming to the Celtics) but then dropped its
last two on a Western swing _ Hardaway said he had to leave his
house he was so upset watching the losses to Seattle and Golden
State _ and a close one at home Thursday to Milwaukee. ``What's
happening now,'' said coach Pat Riley, ``is that the freshness and
honeymoon of playing without Tim has worn off. Now, the routine of
playing without Tim is getting to us. We miss him, dramatically.''
The Heat, by the way, have two more games left in Miami Arena
before moving into their new digs, American Airlines Arena, for a
Jan. 3 game against Orlando . . . Wishful thinking from Phoenix GM
Bryan Colangelo: ``I'm going to push for realignment. I just wish
we were in another division.'' . . . Leaving Utah to sign in
Houston was a financial risk for Shandon Anderson. It's also turned
out to be an on-the-court disaster; the Jazz seemed to have gotten
their act together while the injury-ravaged Rockets are already
rebuilding. ``You can't foresee everything,'' Anderson said. ``Look
what happened to the Broncos. Look what happened to the Falcons.
You have a contending team, one or two players go down and then
everything becomes a struggle.'' Still, he says he has no regrets.
``I don't expect anyone to understand it,'' he said of his decision
to leave the Jazz. Utah offered him $24 million over five years. He
signed for $20 million less with Houston. ``We always liked
Shandon,'' said Jazz owner Larry Miller. ``But I don't think we
really knew who he was. He's obviously looking for something we
don't have here.'' Anderson said it was pretty simple. ``It was
time for a change,'' he said. ``You have to live your own life. I
was ready to get on a young team.'' Miller said he does regret
letting Anderson go for nothing. Anderson had pressed for a
sign-and-trade, but, as Miller recalled it, ``there were a couple
of players proposed and I didn't even know who they were.'' . . .
The Cavaliers are hopeful that they'll soon get a clearer picture
of Zydrunas Ilgauskas's cloudy future. ``In the month of January,
we'll know, one way or another,'' said GM Jim Paxson of his center,
who has been sidelined all season because of a stress fracture in
his navicular bone. The Cavs have Ilgauskas on one of these techno
marvel machines that stimulates bone growth. The machine needs 12
hours just to recharge, so Ilgauskas can't be on it as much as
they'd like. Still, he's walking, has no cast, and the Cavs are
holding their collective breath. But if the foot is still sore next
month, then season-ending surgery is likely . . . The Cavs, by the
way, are the only Eastern Conference team still to have not played
a Western Conference team on the road. (Milwaukee has played one,
but goes out West this week. The Celtics have played two, but go
out West next week.) The Cavs' first roadie against a Western
Conference foe is not until Jan. 12, when they open a seven-game,
11-day trip in Portland . . . How long before Dallas coach Don
Nelson goes into Bigman.com and puts ``rebounder'' into the search
field? Through their first 24 games, including Thursday's loss to
the Knicks, the Mavs had yet to outrebound an opponent . . . Asked
how he felt about his team last Friday, Sixers president Pat Croce
said, ``I don't know. I haven't seen them yet. This will be the
first time.'' The club Larry Brown and Billy King envisioned
finally suited up for the Bulls game, as Theo Ratliff was able to
go. Either Ratliff, Allen Iverson, or Matt Geiger has been hors de
combat at some point this season and, through 24 games, the club
had 14 different starting lineups. Through it all, the Sixers went
12-12, which, in the East, puts them right in the thick of things.

MAJOR DEAL FOR EVERETT COULD BITE SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the Red Sox were left congratulating themselves, and
deservedly so, for acquiring center fielder Carl Everett from the
Houston Astros, the deal was not completed without one piece of odd
business that had everyone tight-lipped afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Before making the deal, the Sox purchased the contract of minor
league shortstop Adam (no relation) Everett, gave him a $725,000
signing bonus, and a two-year major league deal. Under normal
circumstances, none of that was necessary, which raises the
question of whether the Sox had made promises of dubious legality
to Everett and his agents that they were obligated to keep even
though he would no longer be their property.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox weren't talking about it. Mike Port, the Sox assistant
general manager who handles many of the club's contracts, referred
all questions to Dan Duquette. Club spokesman Kevin Shea, asked for
an explanation from Duquette, called back and said that all he
could say was that the team had purchased Everett's contract from
Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros weren't talking about it. Astros GM Gerry Hunsicker
did not return phone calls on the matter, and assistant GM Tim
Purpura said only Hunsicker could address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   How about the agent, Bob Gilhooly? If Duquette had nothing to
say, Gilhooly said, then he had no comment. All Gilhooly said was
that the two-year deal was ``something we've been working on for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   All this secrecy for a minor league player with two years'
experience in pro ball?
</P>
<P>
   The puzzling aspect of the whole matter is why Everett was given
a guaranteed two-year major league contract. Interestingly,
according to the contracts registered with Major League Baseball,
Everett was given a $1 million bonus to sign as a No. 1 draft pick
in 1998, though published reports set the bonus at $1.725 million.
</P>
<P>
   The $725,000 included in the signing bonus he received this
week, the player said Saturday night, was counted against his
original signing bonus. But why didn't he receive the entire amount
at the time he was drafted by the Sox? It smells of a side deal,
which is illegal by definition (remember Roger Clemens and
Toronto), and leads to speculation that the Sox gave Adam Everett a
two-year major league contract as part of a private agreement
connected with the delay in receiving his entire bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's kind of hard to explain,'' Adam Everett
said by phone Friday night. ``I really don't want to get into the
details.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither, obviously, does anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, he said, he expects to play on the Triple A level
next season.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the Sox and Astros had pretty much hammered
out a deal for Carl Everett last Sunday, but what delayed the
announcement was working out the details of the Adam Everett
contract. The Sox are obligated to pay the bonus, while the Astros
pick up the rest of the contract. Hunsicker was forced to clear out
space on his 40-man roster when he wouldn't have been required to
do so in the absence of the Sox contract signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very odd. Extremely odd,'' said one club executive.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Everett, incidentally, expressed enthusiasm for the deal.
``It's a good opportunity for me,'' he said. ``As you know, the Red
Sox already have an outstanding shortstop.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the only oddity associated with the deal. The Astros
had interest in Korean righthander Sun Woo Kim, only to discover
that Kim had a no-trade clause in his contract. That's unusual for
a minor league player.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett, meanwhile, had yet to make any public statements
about the trade, though there was talk he might be coming to town
Tuesday. His initial reaction apparently fell far short of
jubilation, however. Everett, who had a career year last season
after indifferent results with three other organizations, was very
happy in Houston. How willing will he be to make a long-term
commitment to the Sox? Duquette is expected to open discussions
this week with agent Larry Reynolds on the matter. Just remember:
Pedro Martinez was said to be initially cool to the idea of making
Boston home, until Duquette gave him 75 million reasons to
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   In the hunt
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox remain a front-runner for lefthander Jeff Fassero,
who had dinner in August with Joe Kerrigan, the Sox pitching coach
he considers his mentor, when the Sox were in Texas last season.
Fassero, who had an awful year (5-14, 7.20 ERA) coming off elbow
surgery, nonetheless is attracting a good deal of interest and
isn't likely to sign until the middle of this week. Fassero, like
Chuck Finley, is 37, and won 57 games his previous four seasons
before coming apart last year. The Sox would like him as a starter,
but could also see him pairing with Rheal Cormier as the team's
second lefty in the pen. Reliever Ricky Bottalico, who probably
won't be tendered a contract by the Cardinals this week, also
should expect to count the Sox among his suitors . . . Former Sox
outfielder Darren Bragg is another Cardinal who expects to become a
free agent if the Cardinals nontender him. Bragg, who suffered a
season-ending knee injury last summer, will find a team that covets
his dirty-uniform approach . . . The Sox have had some contact with
Tommy Harper about becoming Jimy Williams's bench coach. Harper, a
highly respected member of Felipe Alou's Expos staff, was one of
Martinez's closest friends in Montreal and would be the type of
wise head who could make Carl Everett's transition to Boston easier
. . . Agent Tony Attanasio, who is representing top Japanese closer
Kazuhiro Sasaki, has no use for Duquette or Ray Poitevint, who
oversees Boston's Asian operation. Attanasio said he sent a
videotape of Sasaki's American workouts to Port but mocked Duquette
to reporters at the winter meetings and said Poitevint ``can't be
trusted.'' Sasaki signed a two-year contract with the Mariners
Saturday. Duquette remained in Southern California after the winter
meetings and was expecting to sign a couple of Asian minor league
prospects . . . Although kid closer Matt Mantei played a big role
in Arizona's drive to the playoffs after being acquired from
Florida, the Marlins appear to have made out quite nicely in the
deal. Not only did the Marlins receive pitchers Vladimir Nunez and
Brad Penny, both of whom could be in the Marlins' rotation in 2000,
but the player to be named was outfielder Abraham Nunez, considered
one of the top prospects in Arizona's system. Nunez, just 19, had
57 extra-base hits for Class A High Desert, including 22 home runs
. . . New Colorado Rockies GM Dan O'Dowd, a party to last week's
four-team deal that landed him third baseman Jeff Cirillo and
lefthander Scott Karl from Milwaukee and righthander Rolando Arrojo
and infielder Aaron Ledesma from Tampa Bay, took a subtle dig at
Dodgers GM Kevin Malone in talking about the revamping of the
Rocks, who have 16 new faces since the season ended. ``There's no
new sheriff in town, not even a deputy,'' O'Dowd said, an allusion
to Malone's declaration about a new sheriff when he took over the
Dodgers a year ago. ``We're just trying to push the train up the
hill a little more every day.'' How much power are the Rockies
giving away in surrendering Vinny Castilla, who went to Tampa Bay,
for Cirillo? Well, Cirillo hit just 15 home runs last season,
matching his career high, but his slugging percentage was .461,
just slightly below Castilla's .478, even though Castilla hit 33
home runs . . . And how about the mixed signals the Dodgers are
sending? They have $105 million pitcher Kevin Brown and $84 million
outfielder Shawn Green, then give up a solid starting pitcher
(Ismael Valdes) with second baseman Eric Young in a salary dump to
the Cubs, who surrendered middling reliever Terry Adams in exchange
. . . The Mets, shot down by Junior Griffey, also talked about a
deal with Toronto in which the Jays would have parted with
lefthander David Wells and outfielder Jose Cruz, in exchange for
righthander Octavio Dotel, outfielder Roger Cedeno, and outfielder
Jay Payton. But it never materialized, and Jays manager Jim Fregosi
didn't sound eager to move Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Bomb squad
</P>
<P>
   After trading for Castilla and signing Greg Vaughn as a free
agent, the Devil Rays now have four hitters whose total home run
production over the last two seasons surpassed any foursome on any
big league team. Castilla, Vaughn, Fred McGriff, and Jose Canseco
hit 305, 23 more than Seattle's current combination of Griffey,
Alex Rodriguez, Edgar Martinez, and John Olerud. ``They're awesome
in the middle of the lineup, I can tell you that,'' said Fregosi.
``Their lineup definitely gives you something to think about.
They're making this into the black-and-blue division now.'' . . .
Besides being a big bat in the middle of the lineup, Vaughn proved
to be quite accomplished in getting his way in Cincinnati last
season. Vaughn was the force behind the lifting of the ``no facial
hair rule'' in Cincinnati. Vaughn was the one who complained the
grass was too high at the Sarasota spring training complex and got
it cut lower. Vaughn was the one who lobbied for the removal of
third-base coach Harry Dunlop. Vaughn also was the one who demanded
that a cappuccino maker and special coffee be packed for every trip
. . . Mike Lowell, who overcame testicular cancer to play third
base for the Marlins last season, will be the recipient of the Tony
Conigliaro Award for courage at the Boston Baseball Writers Dinner
Jan. 13 . . . Wal-Mart major-domo David Glass, weighing a run at
the Kansas City Royals, is apparently considering joining forces
with Hall of Famer George Brett in a bid to buy the ballclub. ``The
easiest thing to do would be to do it with just my family, for us
to do it ourselves,'' Glass said of his proposal to buy the club.
``But I want to make sure I take advantage of every opportunity to
make the Royals better.'' . . . It didn't hurt the Indians that, in
landing free agent Finley, Dick Pole, who was Finley's pitching
coach in Anaheim, was hired for the same job in Cleveland. The
Tribe also scored points by signing close Finley buddy Mark
Langston to a minor league deal . . . Despite rumors of a possible
trade with the Mets, Indians GM John Hart said there are no plans
to trade Manny Ramirez, who is eligible for free agency after the
2000 season. ``We have not discussed Manny with any teams. We are
under no mandate to trade him,'' Hart said. ``He's a big part of
our club. We have been approached by clubs about Manny, but not
found anything that made sense to us. They are all dead deals
now.'' You can give 37-year-old 12-game winners $27 million, like
the Indians did, when it's 373 and counting for the number of
consecutive sellouts at Cleveland's Jacobs Field. The last
non-sellout at The Jake was June 12, 1995 . . . How worried is
Mariners manager Lou Piniella about the potential distraction of
Griffey staying put next season in Seattle, a la Randy Johnson in
his walk year? Not terribly. ``The way I look at it, how can I lose
as a manager if he's back playing center field?'' Piniella said.
``I've always had a good relationship with Junior. He'll go out and
play. He's always done that, and it's always been appreciated.
That's not the concern. The concern is the distraction.'' . . . The
Braves are excited about 19-year-old shortstop Rafael Furcal, who
hasn't played above Class A but has been one of the best players in
the Dominican Winter League. ``I just left a meeting and some of
our guys think that he's real close,'' said Braves manager Bobby
Cox. ``It may be a bit early next year (2000) and all that, to see
him playing every day. But some of the guys like him an awful lot.
They like him as a true shortstop or even maybe quicker as a second
baseman. He can go both ways. But the stuff sounds really good on
him, a true leadoff guy.'' . . . And did you catch the name of the
player selected by the Marlins in Monday's Rule 5 draft? Wynter N.
Phoenix. Selected from the Dodgers, Phoenix is a native of San
Diego . . . And speaking of the cost-cutting Padres, GM Kevin
Towers's job would be a lot easier if he didn't have $6.25 million
committed next season to reliever Randy Myers, who didn't throw a
pitch in 1999. And no, Duquette said, Tom Gordon's contract was not
insured. The $3.75 million that goes to the injured Gordon next
season will be out of the Trust.

   Historic as those Olympic reforms are (and they're by far the
most sweeping ever), the same old faces will belong to the
International Olympic Committee for years, if not decades. The age
limit of 70 applies only to new members; all 102 incumbents get to
stay until they're 80. And the new eight-year term limits are
renewable.
</P>
<P>
   The only Lord of the Rings leaving anytime soon is 79-year-old
patriarch Juan Antonio Samaranch, who'll step down when his term
ends in July 2001. That's when the true measure of the reforms can
be taken since the most controversial ones, like visits to bid
cities, went through only because Samaranch was pushing for them.
</P>

Mario Pescante of Italy, ``but we decided almost unanimously that

   Had the vote been by secret ballot, the IOC might have voted to
keep the visits, which was what caused the whole sordid mess in the
first place. Three dozen members spoke on the issue, most opposing
a ban. But when Samaranch called for a show of hands after more
than two hours of debate with the world media watching on
closed-circuit TV, only 10 still favored visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this is what the media has asked for, and this is
what you've got,'' said Princess Anne of England, who wanted
visits. ``If you think it's going to work, well, fine. I suspect
you're going to find otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC picked its 2006 winter site (Turin, Italy) without
visits, based on information from its site evaluation group. But
none of the bid cities, not even Turin, was happy about it. ``I
think the candidate cities will link arms and come to us and say,
this is really stupid,'' said vice president Richard Pound of
Canada, who opposes visits. ``They'll say, `You've got to come to
see our cities. You can't do it with postcards.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Though the ``new'' IOC will be much more diverse in theory, with
45 of the 115 members coming from international sports federations,
national Olympic committees, and recent athletes, two things won't
change: Everybody still will have what John Hancock chief (and IOC
critic) David D'Alessandro calls ``Olympic DNA,'' and the IOC still
will get to elect them. Which means that the IOC will remain what
it has always been _ self-perpetuating.
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans do some deft lobbying (or arm-twisting), they
could end up with as many as five members on the expanded IOC. With
Anita DeFrantz and James Easton and former volleyball player Bob
Ctvrtlik, who was one of the athletes added last week, the United
States now has three. It could get another two if it can wangle one
of the additional 15 reserved for international sports federation
presidents (Don Porter runs softball) or the 15 for national
Olympic committee presidents (Bill Hybl). Whether the Lords want
the Yanks wielding that much influence, though, is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch didn't get to run the world's most exclusive (and
political) club by being a diplomatic rube. When he read his
opening statement before the House subcommittee that was grilling
him on Olympic corruption in Washington last week, Samaranch spoke
in English. As soon as he was put under oath, Samaranch switched to
Spanish and used a brace of interpreters. The two-way translation
effectively halved the number of questions Samaranch needed to
answer in the three hours he was there.
</P>
<P>
   With far less time to get things in balance (nine months instead
of two years), the Sydney organizers have finally had to admit what
their Salt Lake counterparts did: their sponsor revenue assumptions
are cuckoo. Instead of their original $548 million, the Aussies are
now figuring on $460 million.
</P>
<P>
   Do I hear . . . ?
</P>
<P>
   To cut down on scalping and get cash for the $40 million Olympic
legacy fund they've promised to set up, the Salt Lake organizers
will auction off 10 percent of their top-shelf tickets on the
Internet, where the public will also be able to buy seats at normal
prices. To register for information, check the committee Web site
(www.slc2002.org) . . . Jenny Thompson, the swimmer from Dover,
N.H., who broke one of Mary T. Meagher's two ``unbreakable'' world
butterfly marks, is a finalist for the USOC's SportsWoman of the
Year award, along with soccer player Michelle Akers and tennis
player Serena Williams. Sprinter Maurice Green, cyclist Lance
Armstrong, and tennis player Andre Agassi are the SportsMan
finalists, and the US women's soccer team, US women's softball
team, and cycling's US Postal Service team are finalists for Team
of the Year. Winners will be announced Jan. 8 in Indianapolis . . .
First it was Olympic figure skaters (Katarina Witt and Maria
Butyrskaya) baring all or most for the camera. Now it's soccer
players and gymnasts. The Matildas, Australia's women's squad, did
full frontals for a racy calendar to raise money. And Corina
Ungureanu, a member of Romania's world champion team, posed nude
for her country's edition of Playboy. ``It shows a lack of
decency,'' huffed federation president Nicolae Vieru. ``She
probably did it for the money.'' . . . Two weeks before they leave
for Down Under and playdates with the Aussies, Czechs, and Swedes,
the US women's soccer team still doesn't have a coach. The
federation has been scrambling ever since Tony DiCicco said he was
stepping down last month, and may have to go with assistants Lauren
Gregg and Jay Hoffman as interims.
</P>
<P>
   It's all downhill
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Austrian men are treating the World Cup Alpine ski
circuit as their intramural league. They hold four of the top five
overall places, 11 of the top 18, and eight of 10 in the downhill,
with Hermann Maier running away with the overall title ahead of
teammate Stephan Eberharter. With Croatia's Janica Kostelic down
for the season and maybe more after tearing up a knee last week,
Italy's Isolde Kostner will be fighting Austria's Michaela
Dorfmeister and Renate Goetschl for the women's crown. The top
American so far has been Daron Rahlves, who ranks 10th in the men's
super G . . . Tough road for the US men's team at next week's world
junior ice hockey championships in Sweden. The Yanks, who placed
eighth last time, are drawn with defending medalists Canada and
Slovakia, plus the Czechs and Finns. On the roster are Boston
University goalie Rick DiPietro and defenseman Pat Aufiero, Boston
College defenseman Brooks Orpik, New Hampshire forward Patrick
Foley, Harvard forward Brett Nowak, Northeastern forward Willie
Levesque, Maine defenseman Doug Janik and forward Barrett Heisten,
and UMass-Lowell defenseman Ron Hainsey.
</P>
<P>
   Russians are coming
</P>
<P>
   The Russians will be sending a small army to next month's Grand
Prix figure skating final in Lyon. They qualified nine skaters,
including four women, and will be favored to win three gold medals
with world champions Alexei Yagudin and Butyrskaya and the pair of
Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov. The United States has only two
entrants _ Michelle Kwan and Tim Goebel _ but both should make the
podium . . . Creditable fourth-place showing by the US baseball
team at the recent Intercontinental Cup in Sydney. The squad,
cobbled together from independent minor league teams like the Zion
Pioneerzz and the Albany Diamond Dogs, managed to beat both the
Japanese and South Koreans before losing to the Cubans in the medal
round . . . Yes, proclaiming that you have no Olympic affiliation
whatever does count as ``ambush marketing.'' When the Brighton ski
area near Salt Lake City advertised that it was ``proud host of
ZERO Olympic events'' (unlike rivals Snowbasin, Park City, and Deer
Valley), the US Olympic Committee sent the management a stern
letter telling them to knock it off.

<P>
   It's the great promise of the Internet: For 20 bucks a month and
a local phone line, the world is yours. Plug in, dial up and click
_ you're surfing across continents, fetching information from
faraway capitals, chatting up cyberpals in London, Tokyo, Buenos
Aires . . .
</P>
<P>
   Anywhere but Wickenburg.
</P>
<P>
   In Wickenburg, electronically speaking, you can't get there from
here. Internet access remains a rarity for the town's 5,000
residents. Only two providers offer service and neither has had the
ability to accept new customers for the better part of a year. The
lucky few with accounts often find themselves logging on after
midnight to avoid bad daytime connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 30 miles from a major metropolitan area, so we didn't
give it a thought when we moved here. We just assumed we'd have
Internet access,'' said Ron Long, who settled in Wickenburg in May.
``We're in the process of opening a new business, but we're having
to give it second thoughts. A modern company really can't run
without the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wickenburg, in northwestern Maricopa County, is an extreme
example of how the increasing demand for Internet access can
quickly outpace supply, especially in fast-growing Arizona. Access
providers can't sign up customers if the telephone company hasn't
installed enough phone lines, and the phone company can barely keep
up with basic service needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the mercy of the local telephone company
infrastructure and it's a problem in some areas,'' said Ben
Preusser, director of technical operations for Cyber Trails, which
offers Internet access in some of Arizona's remotest corners.
``We've heard the outcry from Wickenburg. It's the same in Winslow.
To get a dedicated line to the high school there, we had to wait 12
months.'' &QL; 
SERVICE IS EXPENSIVE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Trails has established service in Chinle and Tuba City on
the Navajo Reservation, and the company installed its own
infrastructure to serve areas in the White Mountains, Preusser
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the costs add up if the phone company isn't prepared and as
customers get more savvy about higher connection speeds, the
expenses can climb faster, he said. A so-called T-1 backbone line
that might cost the provider $400 to $600 a month in Phoenix, for
example, can cost $2,000 a month in Pinetop-Lakeside.
</P>
<P>
   Even in metro Phoenix, access providers can't always offer the
level of service requested. Although almost anyone in the three
urban area codes can dial up an Internet account, surfers with a
need for speed may be out of luck if they've moved to newer
neighborhoods on the fringe of the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cox Communications is offering lightning-fast cable
connections in more and more homes, US West is struggling to keep
up with high-speed services like digital subscriber lines, which
require a user to live within three miles of a switching station.
</P>
<P>
   US West spokesman Jim Roof said that only about 30 percent of
Phoenix area customers could purchase high-speed digital service
right now, but the company is investing heavily to expand its
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we hear from customers, probably every third question
is about high-speed Internet capability,'' he said. ``It's a
sizable challenge keeping up with it in a metro area like
Phoenix.'' &QL; 
LONG-DISTANCE CALL AWAY &QL; 
Which brings us back to Wickenburg. Wickenburg's woes lie in its
location. The town hugs the inside border of northwest Maricopa
County, but landed outside its area codes and is a long-distance
call from the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   Other towns like Buckeye and Queen Creek sit nearly as far from
the urban center, but their residents own a 623 or a 480 area code,
which lets them use any of the Phoenix area's Internet providers.
Even Apache Junction, which straddles Maricopa and Pinal counties,
uses a 480.
</P>
<P>
   Wickenburg residents are long-distance even to their closest 520
neighbors in Prescott. Long found that out when he arrived from
Mount Shasta, Calif., an equally remote little town that
nonetheless offered excellent Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked Wickenburg because it's a beautiful place to live,''
he said. ``But our business requires e-mail and technical research
on the Internet. Our long-distance bill is running $300 to $400 a
month and we're not doing any surfing. It's been really
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Two service providers _ FutureOne and Primenet, now known as
Global Center _ set up business in Wickenburg several years ago,
when demand was lower. In the past year, both companies had to stop
taking new customers because they simply ran out of phone line
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   None of the national service providers offer local access
numbers and most, like America Online, charge premium rates to
connect using toll-free numbers. &QL; 
TROUBLE SIGNING ON &QL; 
Roy Reyer works as an e-commerce manager in Wickenburg and runs a
Web-based community directory site. He has an account with one of
the local providers, but has trouble signing on during the day and
more often waits until late at night to do much of his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``A community like Wickenburg is going to be left in the dust,''
he said. ``We're going to suffer economically and educationally.
There are people for example who would love to take classes on the
Internet, but that requires that you log on at a specific date and
time to conference with professors and classmates and you cannot do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for Net-intensive activities like day-trading or
operating a Web-based business _ not gonna happen, Reyer said:
``This is the back roads.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Brooks, executive director of the Wickenburg Chamber of
Commerce, said area business owners worry about what they're
missing without Internet access and the chamber worries about what
new businesses it may be missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses that may want to relocate here ask about it and our
answer has been there is no Internet access at this point,'' she
said. She offers information on buying a Phoenix-based phone line
or using an 800 number, but both options are expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Roof said US West understands the frustrations of Wickenburg
residents, but can't do much to solve the problem right away. Cost
is the biggest issue _ it's just too expensive to install the
needed lines and equipment compared with the demand and the
customer base.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Roof said, the company is in the process of selling its
Wickenburg exchange to Citizens Telecom, which provides phone
service to many rural Arizona communities. US West will allow the
new utility to decide how to invest in phone infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet provider that offers service in nearby Prescott may
be prepared to move into Wickenburg after the first of the year,
but until then, residents and businesses can only wait.
</P>
<P>
   Long said all he seems to do lately is wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who's committed to living outside a metro area learns
to accept some inconveniences,'' he said, ``but this . . . this . .
. I don't think it's severe enough for us not to stay, but it's
enough to stay and pull our hair out.'' &QL;

MAKE OR BREAK TIME FOR PATRIOTS STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The next three Sundays will be make or break time
for more than the members of the New England Patriots and their
coaches. It will be judgment time for the regime of Bobby Grier and
Andy Wasynczuk.
</P>
<P>
   Already looking at an uphill climb just to make the playoffs,
the Patriots' front office denizens are also facing the worst of
scenarios, unless all the evidence that has preceded this stretch
run has been a lie. Now they will have to play all those players
they brought in and all those draft picks who were supposed to
sustain the future.
</P>
<P>
   Now there will be no hiding from the sad truth, because the
truth is they blew it.
</P>
<P>
   Ty Law is definitely out for the rest of the regular season.
Cornerback Steve Israel is limping, as is safety Chris Carter. Left
tackle Bruce Armstrong will play on a sprained knee Sunday against
the Eagles, but for how long is anyone's guess. Kevin Faulk is down
for the count and Ted Johnson is already limping on a bad calf
after only two games, pressed into service by nothing but panic.
</P>
<P>
   What all this means is not only a more difficult time of it
against the Eagles, Bills, and Ravens the next three weekends. It
means players like Tebucky Jones, Tony George, Ed Ellis, Heath
Irwin, Max Lane, Lamont Warren, Kato Serwanga, and others will have
to come through or someone is going to be asking some hard
questions about why they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Same is true of second-year receiver Tony Simmons, who has
caught two passes in the last seven weeks. When the season began,
coach Pete Carroll predicted big things from the former No. 2 draft
choice, yet Vincent Brisby, despite making only 12 catches, has
played more than Simmons. And that's in a pass offense all but
grounded most of the past five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll tried to justify Simmons's disappearance last week by
saying ``there hasn't been any need'' to play him because his other
receivers have been healthy. If Simmons could catch the ball when
he does get open, his services would be needed. But he hasn't and
so there isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, Simmons had a seven-catch day against the
Chiefs, something of a breakthrough game. It turned out to be a
tease. Simmons had critical drops in the games against the Jets and
Dolphins last month, and poorly run routes that were sometimes
difficult to analyze. Since then, he has been conspicuous by his
absence in an offense that is floundering.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Simmons has yet to come close to the potential he
showed at Wisconsin, with a reputation for possessing sprinter's
speed but questionable production. To say there has been no need
for a deep threat who could get open and catch the ball, especially
in the last month, is to defy logic. The problem with Simmons is
not that he's been outplayed by Brisby. The problem is that he
hasn't played consistently enough to stay on the field ahead of him
and that is not the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   But Simmons is not the only problem, he's not even the most
egregious error. Here, in a nutshell, are the four draft picks
acquired for Bill Parcells: Andy Katzenmoyer, Simmons, Sedrick
Shaw, and Damon Denson. Two of those players are already gone, a
third hasn't caught a pass in two weeks, and the other hit the
skids after a fast start and was replaced in the middle by a guy
with one arm and now a bad calf. This does not look like a good
trade to me.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in a nutshell, are the two draft picks acquired for Curtis
Martin: Robert Edwards and Chris Floyd. Edwards's career appears
over after one season and a terrible knee injury, and Floyd appears
on the field about as often as Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vonnie Holliday, taken by the Packers after the
Patriots chose Edwards, flourishes in Green Bay at defensive end
and Martin has rushed for 1,121 yards for the Jets, the
third-highest total in the AFC, carrying the ball 287 times. It is
the fifth straight season Martin has rushed for more than 1,000
yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' personnel people said Martin was damaged goods
when he left, and didn't have many productive years left, according
to what the computer told them. Well, even if he stops right where
he is Sunday, Martin has rushed for more career yards in less than
five full seasons than any back in Patriots history. Just how many
guys will the computers find like that? In Patriot history, the
answer is one and he's playing elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Terry Allen, Faulk, and Warren have combined for
1,032 yards, which means three guys are not as good as one. A year
ago, Martin became one of only six players in NFL history to rush
for 1,000 yards in each of his first four seasons, when he gained
1,287 yards for the Jets. Edwards, the replacement that cost the
Patriots Holliday _ and an improved pass rush _ gained 1,115 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It is sad that Edwards is unlikely to play again, but the fact
is, who's damaged goods now, the back who came into the NFL with a
long injury history (Edwards) or the guy who had four 1,000-yard
seasons for the Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   Since the departure of Parcells and Charley Armey (who now picks
players for the 11-2 St. Louis Rams), the Patriots have had 21
draft picks in the first four rounds. Of those picks, three have
emerged as starters, if you include Katzenmoyer, who was pressed
into action as a rookie because of Johnson's biceps tendon injury.
Three starters on a team that appears unlikely to make the playoffs
without a miracle, and less likely to stay there for long without
another miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 21 picks, four were traded. Of the 17 players
remaining, not one has been an impact player, and that includes
Edwards, who worked hard but looked like a reincarnation of a
plodding Leonard Russell.
</P>
<P>
   But now some of those players will have to play the next few
weeks, with reputations and jobs on the line. As Terry Glenn said
last week, ``If we don't make the playoffs, it'll be real nasty
around here. For those of us who came in four years ago and went to
the Super Bowl, we don't know what it's like not to go to the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   If the young players who have arrived since Grier took control
of the personnel department and Wasynczuk took control of the
salary cap play well enough for the Patriots to reach the
postseason, they will have built a team that has been in steady
decline since Grier's and Wasynczuk's ascendency. Pro football is a
production business and results speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, if the Patriots win all three games and still fail to
make the playoffs, a distinct possibility, Carroll's record will be
29-19, a winning percentage of .604. It would be the highest career
winning percentage of any coach in Patriots history, including the
portly Parcells (34-34, including playoffs).
</P>
<P>
   How do you fire a coach with such a record?
</P>
<P>
   Not easily, but eventually someone has to be held accountable if
players like Jones, Ellis, Carter, George, Simmons, Floyd, Tony
Carter, Brandon Mitchell, and more than a few others do not make an
impact. Owner Bob Kraft must hold someone accountable or his team
will continue to drift downward.
</P>
<P>
   One longtime general manager was asked to assess the biggest
mistake made by the Patriots since the loss of Martin and Parcells.
He agreed to do it in exchange for anonymity. He had two nominees,
one obvious, one not so obvious. The most glaring was the wasted
No. 1 pick on Chris Canty, when soon-to-be All-Pro Sam Madison was
available. ``I don't know three teams that had Canty rated ahead of
Madison,'' he said. ``When they made that pick I was shocked. I
have no idea who came to that conclusion, unless they had a bad
speed time on Canty. We had a fast time on him too, but when we
looked into it, he'd run in track cleats, so we went back and got a
new time. It wasn't very fast. You have to do your homework.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the other major mistake was the decision not to re-sign
free agent center Dave Wohlabaugh, despite the price tag. Cleveland
made him the game's highest-paid center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a guy they could play there for 12 years in
Wohlabaugh,'' he said. ``Pay the SOB and go get a skill player with
the first pick who can help you. They didn't improve their team.
They went lateral. You can't let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have seen Cleveland coming in with all that money
and locked Wohlabaugh up the year before. Once he got into free
agency, there was no way New England could compete if Cleveland
wanted him. They had to see that coming and avoid it. They
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to make another point, comparing the selections of
the tiny Canty one year, to the massive Jones the next, two corners
who could not be more opposite in size, style, and skill. His point
was this: ``Do they have a plan there? Usually teams want a certain
style of corner, a certain type of running back. They have a
formula. What's their formula? I look at what they've done the last
three years and it looks like they've destroyed that team from a
personnel standpoint when they could have really solidified it long
term if they just hit on just a third of all those picks.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a third? How about on one of them? Over the next three
Sundays, many of those picks will have to play and they will either
thrive or be exposed. Jones will get his chance to prove the
skeptics wrong. He'll get the chance to prove he can be an NFL
corner rather than a penalty machine.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely George will get to show what he can do at safety,
and then we will see what the future holds because the future is
not Chris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Same is true at receiver, if Simmons continues to languish on
the bench while the offense continues to languish on the field. The
story will have been told about that choice without a word being
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the running game struggles, we will watch the blocks of an
offensive line that needs to be revamped. The team's brain trust
has selected nine offensive linemen the last four years, seven
since Parcells left. It has netted one starter in Irwin, and a
second, Damien Woody, who was pressed into action because of the
loss of Wohlabaugh. Nine linemen drafted in four years and only one
could beat out an incumbent on a team that can't run to the
refrigerator, and of late seems to have forgotten how to protect
the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the replacements for fullback Sam Gash? Can you
remember the last crushing block on the goal line thrown by Carter
or Floyd? If there aren't many these next three games, someone will
have to answer for that decision, too.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, they should. A lot more coaches get fired in this
league than deserve to get fired. Often, they are scapegoats for
other problems, especially the assistants, who labor in anonymity.
That has been the case in New England for three years now, even
though the bulk of those coaches have done a sound job, especially
on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three Sundays, we'll get a chance to see a little
clearer just what those coaches, including Carroll, really had to
work with. If it's not enough, somebody must answer for it or Bob
Kraft will soon get to preside over the same kind of teams Victor
Kiam, Billy Sullivan, and James B. Orthwein presided over during
most of their time in the owners' box.
</P>
<P>
   Bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   Here's mud in your eye
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is investigating an incident in which Denver cornerback
Dale Carter was caught by a Jaguar video camera spitting in the
direction of Jacksonville tackle Tony Boselli Monday night. Boselli
confirmed the incident, but Carter has denied it, claiming, ``If
anything, he tried to spit on me.'' To that, an angry Boselli
replied, ``That's an absolute lie. That would not happen.''
Apparently, there is no video evidence, but there is a clear
picture of Carter spitting at Boselli as he headed to the sideline.
Friday, the league office in New York received a copy of the tape
at its request and will likely make a ruling early next week. It
was nearly two years ago to the day (Dec. 15, 1997) that Carter's
teammate, Bill Romanowski, was caught by an ABC camera spitting in
the face of 49er wide receiver J.J. Stokes. Romanowski was fined
$7,500 and some commentators tried to put a racial twist to the
issue because Romanowski is white and Stokes is black. Romanowski
even had to stand up at a team meeting and explain himself because
of the shock the incident caused his minority teammates. Now we
have the reverse situation and many players are watching closely to
see if the NFL takes a similar stance with the roles reversed.
Perhaps the best take on the incident, though, came from Boselli's
teammate, tackle Leon Searcy, who said of Carter, ``Maybe he has a
gland problem. I don't know what it is with the Broncos and spit.''
. . . The league fined Romanowski $10,000 for a questionable late
hit on Tony Gonzalez in the same game. It was the second time this
season the league has charged him for hitting Gonzalez late.
Romanowski has become a marked man with officials, and the league
office is watching his behavior . . . Here's one from the
not-learning-from-your-mistakes department. Thanksgiving Day, Glenn
was nearly three hours late for practice, then was fined and
benched for the first quarter of an important game against Buffalo.
Did he learn from this? Well, last Sunday, Glenn missed the final
bus to the RCA Dome in Indianapolis and did not arrive at the
stadium until 11:15 a.m., when he should have been there by 10:35.
Although he was on time for pregame warmups, missing the last bus
violates team policy. Several of Glenn's teammates were irked by
his behavior and irresponsibility and made their feelings known to
management. Some guys just don't get it . . . New England is not
the only place where the coach is being questioned and the approach
is dissected. In Miami last week, Jimmy Johnson's two Super Bowl
rings have not left him immune from doubters as his team fades from
what was once first place in the AFC East. Johnson's record is
35-26 in his four seasons running the Dolphins, a record similar to
Don Shula's 39-25 in his final four years, and people are
questioning whether Johnson's approach will lead Miami back to the
Super Bowl. ``That's tough to answer,'' cornerback Terrell Buckley
said, when asked if the Dolphins were better now than when Johnson
arrived. ``It's tough to make that assessment. We made the playoffs
here two years in a row, right? So I'd like to say we're better
off, but we made the playoffs then (before Johnson), too. So it's
hard to tell.'' Sound familiar? What has happened is a similar
record but a complete role reversal. Under Shula, the offense was
ranked fifth, second, first, and eighth in his last four years,
while the defense was ranked in the top 10 only once. Under
Johnson, the defense has become the strength but the offense is
ranked 22d this year. Under Shula, Miami was not in the top 20 on
offense only once in 26 seasons. Better off or not? They don't know
yet in Miami, even with a defense that led the league in fewest
points allowed a year ago and is fifth in the league this season.
So what is the problem? Same as it is in New England. The Dolphins
can't run the ball across the street. Miami has not had a running
game exceed or even equal the league average per carry since 1984,
and this year _ after drafting three running backs and a No. 1 a
year earlier _ the ground game is gaining 3.2 yards a carry. The
league average is 3.8. The aging team Johnson inherited four years
ago has been replaced by a team that's even older. The average age
of starters in 1995, Shula's last year, was 27.4. Today it's 28.2.
So where are they headed? It has become a familiar question this
month and not just in New England . . . Here's an interesting
juxtaposition. As of this morning, Parcells and Carroll have
identical records with their present teams, but who inherited the
better situation? I rest my case on that score . . . Mike Hollis
hasn't lost his compass. The Jaguars' kicker is the NFL's all-time
leader in field goal accuracy for both the regular season (83.4
percent) and playoffs (93.3) and this season is no exception. He
leads the NFL with a 90.7 accuracy rate (29 of 32). New England's
Adam Vinatieri is at 86 percent (20 of 23). I don't know if this
means anything, but Detroit's Jason Hanson has the longest field
goal per average kick at 39.8 yards on his 24 successful kicks.
Hanson and Denver's Jason Elam have four kicks longer than 50
yards, which says more about kicking at high altitude or in a dome
than it does about anything else . . . Speaking of kickers, how's
this for reversals of fortune? A year ago, Minnesota kicker Gary
Anderson didn't miss a field goal until the one that cost the
Vikings the NFC Championship. This year he's having the worst
season of his 18-year career. Anderson is 17 of 27 and is the only
kicker who has not made a kick beyond 40 yards. Such is the torment
of the kicker who misses with a Super Bowl on the line . . .
Departed Broncos' quarterback Chris Miller had a poignant moment
recently while being interviewed for HBO's ``Real Sports'' by Jim
Lampley. Miller was forced back into retirement because of
persistent concussions this year after having taken a three-year
layoff for the same reason. Asked if he is resistant to the word
concussion, Miller admitted, ``Yeah. I think it's something you
just kind of want to deny. You want to call it a ding because we
feel like a concussion is a major thing.'' When Lampley followed up
and asked if he was in denial, since he has lost some short-term
and long-term memory, and his coach, Mike Shanahan, has told him if
he were his son he would urge him to retire, Miller said, ``No. I'm
not in denial. I'm realistic about the fact. I know I got dinged.
I'll call it a ding. Ding is a lot easier to say than concussion .
. . I've got some decisions to make.'' The first one is to start
admitting he keeps getting knocked out, and if it happens enough it
can lead to something called punch drunkenness in boxing, and it's
not a pretty sight . . . Anyone interested in giving the Drew
Bledsoe-Peyton Manning ``How to Play Quarterback'' video for a
Christmas present can order a copy by calling 877-877-5200 or go on
line to www.nflcoaches.com. The proceeds go to assist ex-NFL
coaches facing financial difficulties who are not eligible for
pension or medical benefits from the league. It's a good video and
a better cause.
</P>
<P>
   Shortsighted investment
</P>
<P>
   When things go bad, sometimes they stay bad. When the Jets
acquired quarterback Rick Mirer for a sixth-round draft choice from
Green Bay, it seemed a small price to pay. But then Mirer had to
play, which was bad enough, but now it turns out he's actually
going to cost the Jets a fourth-round pick because he played too
much, even though he will surely be released at the end of the
season. If not, the Jets have to pay him $3.5 million, which is a
real Y2K problem . . . The Colts need to win two of their last
three games to become the team with the greatest single-season
turnaround in NFL history. If they can beat the Redskins Sunday,
they would tie the 1963 Raiders and 1929 Giants, who both made a
nine-game improvement . . . How good are the St. Louis Rams at the
TWA Dome? They're not only undefeated but have been winning by an
incredible 25.6 points per game at home. But before you bet your
child's college fund on the Rams to win the Super Bowl, consider
this: Those home wins have come over the Browns, Falcons, Saints,
Ravens, 49ers, and Panthers . . . Pity the poor Saints. New Orleans
has now lost 11 of its last 12 games and are the laughingstock of
the league because of their decision to burn their entire draft to
land running back Ricky Williams. But understand this, for all his
injuries and his team's inconsistency, Williams has rushed for 816
yards and still has a shot at 1,000. Unfortunately, because of the
way his contract is written, a 1,000-yard season doesn't get him an
extra nickel . . . Speaking in the converse, do you think the
Redskins wish they'd signed Stephen Davis to a contract extension
instead of looking at a 1,300-yard-and-counting rusher going on the
open market in March?

BLEDSOE MUST NAVIGATE MURKY WATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ He walked around stoically last week, looking
straight ahead, rarely making eye contact. When he walks into a
room, everyone looks at him, and he'll glance back, but he could
have been walking barefoot on glass and there would have been no
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe was ticked off.
</P>
<P>
   Sick of postgame press conferences expounding on the
could-haves, would-haves, and should-haves. Bledsoe is not only
trying to right the offense; he must be wondering about his own
performance. At midseason, he was a legitimate MVP candidate, and
now he is far down on the list of quarterback ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was once the best, but now he's taken a back seat to a
sophomore _ Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   He had beaten the Colts like a drum since 1996, eight straight
wins before last Sunday's crushing 20-15 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe watched the pretty play-action fakes of Manning, his
ability to move away from pressure, and he watched how this young
quarterback was able to get rid of the ball so quickly, avoiding
sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bledsoe rode out on his white horse, beating Buffalo
and Miami with a busted finger, saving the season. The amazing
thing is he's been healthy all season, and is the only quarterback
in the NFL to handle all of his team's passing.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe had to watch the last three games of the 1998 season
from the bench, while the Patriots clinched a playoff berth against
San Francisco, lost the regular-season finale to the Jets, and were
eliminated from the playoffs by Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   He called it the worst moment of his NFL career, feeling so
helpless.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe has so much pent-up anger and frustration that in a game
so meaningful _ with the Patriots' playoff chances hanging in the
balance _ he should have a monster game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Eagles are) going to bring everything at us, and they've
been doing that all year,'' said Bledsoe. ``They've had their own
struggles on offense and so they've been trying to create points
and create field position with their defense. We have to get the
ball out quick and guys have to be open for me at the right time.
They can leave themselves vulnerable and that's when we have to
take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots receivers were sent this message loud and clear: No
matter what the coverage, get open and get open quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will continue with the four- and five-wide receiver
sets and their quick options to Terry Glenn and to the backs. But
Bledsoe is going to take shots down the field Sunday. &UR;  &LR;  He wants to
score a lot of points early, make people forget the Patriots have a
scoring problem, show the NFL that the Patriots will be in it the
rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the locker room knows that we're capable of being
in the playoffs. We can win out, but we can't look past this team.
They're home and they have people who can make plays. We have to
attack them from the start. We can't take anything for granted,''
said Lamont Warren, who figures to have a prominent role in the
offense with rookie running back Kevin Faulk out for the season
with a fractured ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Jefferson, looking down the road, said, ``If we can win
these next three and make the playoffs, we're going to the Super
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   There aren't many fans who seem to see that far down the road.
In fact, most are expecting a dead end.
</P>
<P>
   There are many hurdles and obstacles before that bold statement
can come to fruition. It is still a desperate situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we haven't been winning these games is because we
haven't been scoring enough points,'' said Bledsoe. ``Our defense
is playing fine, but we can't keep putting the pressure on them
every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the pressure is on Bledsoe and he has never been more
determined to right the ship, because if he doesn't, the Patriots
will be shipwrecked and Bledsoe's credentials as one of the best
might be hard aground, as well.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Many of Gov. George W. Bush's allies in New
Hampshire are blaming his Texas-based campaign for early lapses
that they say have left him unnecessarily vulnerable against Sen.
John McCain in the state that holds the first presidential primary
in only six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of aloofness and overconfidence, they say, led
advisers unfamiliar with the peculiarities of New Hampshire's
politics to let Bush adopt a sound-bite style that voters here
disdain, and to forgo the time-honored approach of personal
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   After months of appearing unstoppable elsewhere, Bush has seen
his lead in the New Hampshire polls evaporate, and some surveys
show McCain is continuing to surge. Several of Bush's top advisers
now concede that he could lose the primary on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Bush would still be the clear favorite for the
Republican nomination. He holds a commanding lead in polls in every
other battleground state and sits atop a daunting treasury.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire may no longer be the make-or-break state it once
was for presidential aspirants. Still, no matter what happens, many
Bush supporters in New Hampshire said the campaign should never
have put itself in jeopardy. Their recrimination underscores a
tension _ one that many strategists say was inevitable _ between
the campaign's tightly run high command in Austin, Texas, and its
supporters on the ground in this tiny state.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Stephen E. Merrill of New Hampshire, who ran Bob
Dole's campaign here in 1996 and backs Bush, spoke out for the
first time in an interview about his qualms about the governor's
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign believed it was the front-runner in New
Hampshire,'' said Merrill, who did not seek re-election in 1996.
``There's no such thing as the front-runner in New Hampshire. You
simply become the biggest target. This state demands personal
attention _ and is not easily impressed by either money or poll
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing his belief in Bush himself, Merrill added: ``I love
this guy. He'd make a great president. That's what's so
frustrating. There is no inevitability in any presidential primary.
The great irony is that the candidate understands that. I'm not
sure everybody else does.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of Bush's backers in New Hampshire argued that the
governor's top national advisers did not grasp the idiosyncratic,
even quaint, requirements for stumping in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, they complained that Bush, seeming to take his
lead for granted, did not spend nearly enough time in the state and
passed up early debates with his rivals. When he did venture here,
they said, Bush staged mostly large events where the voters had
little chance to quiz him, a cherished state tradition.
</P>
<P>
   He also took pains not to engage McCain directly, and Bush's
supporters said he did not develop a crisp message early on to
answer the Arizona senator's call for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   And they said he has been slower than Vice President Al Gore in
trying to shed his entourage, as the vice president did when former
Sen. Bill Bradley mounted an unexpectedly vigorous challenge here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they understand New Hampshire; they don't get
it,'' said Jane E. O'Hearn, a state representative from Nashua, in
the south of the state, who endorsed Bush in May. ``I don't think
they are complying with the way New Hampshire has done things. They
are treating every state probably the same way _ it's sound bites
in every state.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Hearn, who is so exasperated she is toying with the idea
of defecting to McCain, added: ``George Bush's sound bites are all
the same. I don't think he's coming across with the depth he needs
to reach the people of New Hampshire. The man is good, he is
sincere, and just needs an opportunity to show that. And I hope the
Bush campaign allows that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Bush operatives here said they were overwhelmed by unex-
pected crowds at the governor's events, which made it more
difficult for him to interact with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Dupont, a former state Senate president from Concord who is a
member of Bush's state steering committee, said it had been a
nightmare trying to set up an appearance in September at the
international speedway here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent two days with Texas Rangers and advance staff for a
two-hour event,'' he said. ``He couldn't ride in a golf cart, had
to have a closed vehicle.'' In the end, Bush had to scrap the event
because of a shooting in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain swooped in with almost no advance planning. ``They
stuck him in a golf cart and drove him down to the infield and he
shook 400 hands,'' Dupont recalled. ``That is part of what the
McCain message has been: throw your jacket over your shoulder and
go ahead and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dupont echoed many Bush backers who had nothing but praise for
how McCain has mounted his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this race started, it was Bush's to lose and McCain was
clearly the underdog,'' he said. ``But when McCain wraps the United
States flag around himself, people want to salute. And he's
deserving of that. He's definitely caught on in New Hampshire. The
Bush campaign certainly has the ability to even this thing up in
New Hampshire and win. But time is running short.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Corrigan, a commissioner in Coos County in northern New
Hampshire who is a town chairman for Bush and has been active in
politics for three decades, said: ``The people from the Concord
office were getting their orders from Texas. They had their methods
set even before they came to New Hampshire. We had strangers coming
in trying to run a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, said many of the
decisions were made jointly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do the mechanical stuff here,'' he said. ``The TV ads are
produced here, but they are carefully vetted there. For all the
volunteer activity on the ground, and decisions about where does
Bush go, they come up with a plan that they discuss with us. What
does Bush say? It's a mutual discussion between them and us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers insist that they are not rattled now that they
are threatened by a potent rival in the Granite State. But their
calm exteriors belie several steps they have taken in recent weeks
to be more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   After saying he would not take part in any debates until
January, Bush participated in three this year, and the first was in
New Hampshire. He has significantly stepped up his travel schedule
to the state. And at events here he now allows far more time for
questions and answers from residents than in most other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the front-runner always has a rough patch in the road
somewhere,'' said Rove. ``And the way to plow your way though is to
stay disciplined and to stay focused _ make alternatives and keep
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove said he was doing other things to become more competitive,
but would not describe them ``because it would be showing our
cards.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory by McCain in New Hampshire could fortify the Arizona
senator's entire operation as the campaign moves into a fast-paced
schedule of contests. And there is always the possibility _ remote
as it may seem _ that a humiliating defeat could unhinge the entire
Bush operation.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush supporters said McCain's rise was inevitable, because
it is political custom for there to be an intense skirmish here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not shocked or stunned or anything like that,'' said Rep.
Charles Bass, R-N.H., one of the Bush campaign's top lieutenants
here. ``Frankly, I don't think Bush is either. I've been pounding
this every time I've been with him: `We're going to be behind and
don't worry about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Todd Harris, the McCain campaign's spokesman in New
Hampshire, said the Bush campaign ought to be worried. ``Their
definitive victory line in the sand keeps getting pulled back
further and further every day,'' he said. ``It used to be, we'll
defeat them here in New Hampshire. Now, they're talking about a
firewall in Michigan.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Joel Maiola, the Bush campaign director in New Hampshire, argued
that McCain's rise had come about because the Arizona senator drew
new support each time one of the other alternatives to Bush dropped
out of the race earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he thought many Bush supporters had publicly
criticized the candidate's operation, Maiola said: ``In New
Hampshire, there's a lot of agendas and a lot of reasons for saying
different things. In New Hampshire, you can never get enough of a
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The most influential New Hamp- shire figure in the campaign is
Sen. Judd Gregg, who installed Maiola, his longtime chief of staff
and campaign manager, to run the statewide drive.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides defended their operation by arguing that McCain is
concentrating his effort in New Hampshire, completely bypassing the
Iowa caucuses a week before and skimping in other states as well.
By contrast, Bush is running a full-fledged national campaign. As
of Saturday, Bush had spent 19 days in New Hampshire this year;
McCain had been here 42 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our object is to compete everywhere and to win everywhere,''
Rove said. ``You can't claim to be a national candidate worthy of
the nomination of the Republican Party if you say you're going to
pick and choose every contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhona Charbonneau, who is chairman of the Bush campaign in
Hillsborough County, said she had been worried that the candidate
did not spend enough time here. ``I don't think they understood New
Hampshire politics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said she had become more confident because the candidate
was coming here more _ and because she was being overwhelmed by
people who wanted to attend a reception for Bush at her house on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be hanging from the ceilings,'' she said.
``I've got 180 people coming to my home, and I've had to turn
people away.''

HEY, CHAN: WINNING, PASSING GO HAND IN HAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat Summerall, my favorite Fox-man, spends the week viewing game
film from around the NFL. The better, Pat says, to back up his TV
comments with fact.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us, obviously, have never considered mixing fact with
opinion, but ...
</P>
<P>
   Summerall turned off his video machine long enough the other day
to discuss a vanishing breed in the NFL. Good offense. Where has it
gone?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week before we do a Sunday game, John \RMadden\S and I
sit down with the two coaches to talk about what their team has to
do to win,'' Summerall said. ``Without exception, the first answer
from every coach is always the same _ be successful running the
football.''
</P>
<P>
   With a raised eyebrow, Summerall added, ``What is this _ a
habit? Coaches always say that, and have for years, but who cares
how you get to the end zone? Throw it, run it, just get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen about offense in the league this season,
you've got to be able to throw it to win. The defensive mindset is
to stop the run. If you can throw it, and you can pass block, you
can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Attention, please, Chan Gailey. Are you hearing this?
</P>
<P>
   The surprising season of the St. Louis Rams backs up the
Summerall opinion. But while the Indy Colts have been just as big a
surprise, the Colts are considered more of a Super Bowl contender
than the Rams. Which goes beyond coming from a tougher division and
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is watch the Colts to know a passing game
doesn't have to be complicated,'' Summerall said. ``They are so
simple in what they do. \RQuarterback\S Peyton Manning, of course,
makes it look easy. He doesn't get sacked because he knows how to
avoid sacks. The offensive line is set up to help him avoid sacks.
It's a simple blocking scheme but so effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those linemen know who to block, and they don't take
penalties. That may sound elementary, but believe me, it's not
happening everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we know. Exactly the opposite occurs locally almost every
week.
</P>
<P>
   Around here, when football pleasantries are exchanged, the
logical subject is Cowboys' defense. And then everyone quickly
moves on to a more lively debate.
</P>
<P>
   Angry words are heard over what the heck Chan Gailey thinks he's
doing with this offense. Do you know yet? Does Gailey?
</P>
<P>
   Weekly Chan-speak goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for that to happen has been the same as waiting on
Christmas. Unfortunately for Gailey, Christmas may arrive first.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the opinion-giver, offensive improvement was noted
against the Eagles, at least in the form of a Gailey philosophy
change with the passing game. Total disagreement, however, was
heard from Gailey, who claims there was no change.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, the final three games, and the playoffs, and the
season, and maybe even Chan's job security, ride on one thing:
</P>
<P>
   Offense.
</P>
<P>
   Popular theory says otherwise. It says defense will have to
carry the Cowboys down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But from the Dept. of
I-read-it-in-the-sports-page-so-it-must-be-true, all hail to Dave
Campo. And not for his Cowboys' defense, but for his sound
reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Campo said this week that he has stripped the walls clean in
the defensive war room at Valley Ranch. There are no more weekly
``goals'' posted for his group, such as holding the opposition to
17 points or less, or placing a ceiling on rushing yards, passing
yards, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Just win the game. That is now the lone goal.
</P>
<P>
   As you know, Campo and the defense have maxed out on
productivity for the season. These people have performed above and
beyond the call of duty. All expectations have been exceeded.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, what's the team record?
</P>
<P>
   A measly 7-and-6 has the Cowboys forced into a win-out-or-else
stretch run. Summerall says he can count six ``impact'' players on
the Campo defense _ Alonzo Spellman, Leon Lett, Deion Sanders,
Darren Woodson, George Teague and Randall Godfrey _ which is above
the league norm.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all that, defense couldn't carry the Cowboys this
season. Just like defense couldn't carry Miami. Tampa Bay is very
hot, and is a defensive exception at the moment. But when the Super
Bowl is won in late January, here's a friendly wager the new champ
will be the team that has the best offense//passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the Cowboys, who are just trying to make
the playoffs. To do so, Gailey will have to get his offense right
before Christmas. Actually, it had better be right today against
the Jets. Hurry, Chan.

<P>
   PARAMUS, N.J. _ Bradley Luberto, a salesman at Ramsey Outdoor,
was helping a family interested in butane camp stoves the other
night when he asked the threshold question: ``Are you going to use
this for camping or indoors?''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Heredia, 17, looked at her parents with a hint of a smile.
``Indoors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Luberto knew immediately what that meant. Y2Kers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the big jugs of water and now we're trying to get the
stove and the lantern,'' Ms. Heredia said. ``We also have canned
food.''
</P>
<P>
   They are members of a new and growing breed of suburban
survivalists readying themselves in the aisles of camping stores,
military surplus shops and hardware stores for whatever the first
moments of Jan. 1 might bring.
</P>
<P>
   Who can blame them? It is now fairly certain that with the
arrival of the year 2000, life will be disrupted _ either by
Armageddon or by the need to reset the clock on the VCR. There is
also the risk the government never talks about: unending phone
calls from friends and relatives searching for scraps of evidence
to prove that the year 2000 problem disrupted life.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the government assurances that most potential
Y2K-related problems have been erased _ or maybe because of them _
fear of a breakdown in the supply of power, water or money, or of
some greater chaos, has taken hold.
</P>
<P>
   That accounts for the upswing in sales of camping gear at Ramsey
Outdoor and of meals ready to eat (or MRE's) at Central Military
Surplus in Pearl River, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one woman who set aside $5,000 for Y2K,'' said Hanna
Rozzo, the owner of Central Military. The woman wanted three cases
of MRE's, a bunch of gas masks, two large water filters, a dozen
butane stoves and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   The thermonuclear shelter dwellers were preparing months ago,
and salespeople remember them fondly. At Ramsey Outdoor, they talk
of the man who feared the new year would bring mass chaos and
wanted a flashlight that would deliver a blinding flash to stun an
approaching anarchist and make him an easier target.
</P>
<P>
   Those people were easy to laugh at in July. But as the moment
approaches, few seem able to completely disregard it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think deep down inside, people are a little scared,'' John
Basilone, a driver for Home Depot in Clifton, said while standing
near a prominent display of portable generators at the store. ``You
have men here who, being men, would never admit it. I think that
women, who in my opinion are more honest anyway, are letting it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove his point, he said his wife was buying water and
canned food and arranging for their extended family to be together
on New Year's Eve. ``Personally, I have a lot of faith,'' Basilone
said. ``I don't think anything's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In some men, the advent of Y2K unleashes the
flintlock-over-the-mantel spirit that once made buffalo and Indians
scarce across the land.
</P>
<P>
   A man purchasing a children's camouflage outfit at Central
Military the other night said: ``My wife is actually buying water.
I have guns. I have bullets. I live near the woods and there are
deer in my backyard. I'm not worried about meat.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people seemed uncomfortable acknowledging concern. Consider
this scene Friday morning at Ramsey Outdoor:
</P>
<P>
   Bystander: ``What do you think will happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Man looking at camping stoves: ``Nothing. You might want to ask
my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Wife: ``I'm not worried about it. He is.''
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, the sale of one camping stove is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to a self-described soccer mom to just come out with
it. ``You don't want to do nothing just in case something
happens,'' Kate Beckelman said. ``You don't want to feel like an
idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   So she is preparing as she would for a blizzard. Buying a few
extra cans of soup and maybe some water. Checking to make sure that
extra blankets are handy. Putting a working flashlight in every
room.
</P>
<P>
   But it is no obsession. She said she was shopping for powerful
flashlights less for Y2K than for K9BM. ``We also have to walk the
dog in the backyard at night,'' she said.

RUTGERS RALLIES AND GIVES STRINGER NO. 600
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ For 27 years, C. Vivian Stringer has been
coaching women's college basketball, regularly taking Cheyney, Iowa
and Rutgers to the national championship tournament. Saturday, she
became only the third women's coach in Division I history to win
600 games.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, at the Louis Brown Athletic Center, her
Scarlet Knights played disorganized one moment and fired up and
slick the next _ just as they have all season. In a game marked by
17 lead changes and eight ties, Rutgers trailed until the last four
minutes. Then Rutgers' top players, Shawnetta Stewart and Tasha
Pointer, led a frenetic defense that broke a good Texas team, and
Rutgers won, 68-64.
</P>
<P>
   At the final buzzer, Stringer was mobbed by her players. They
presented her with a bouquet. They lifted her onto their shoulders.
Not until the players formed lines for the customary handshakes
could Jody Conradt, the Texas coach, reach her longtime friend.
They embraced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her I was happy for her,'' Conradt said. ``I said she
deserved it, but I would have liked to delay it for one more
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The only women's coaches with more victories than Stringer are
Conradt (732 in 30 years) and Pat Summitt of Tennessee (702 in 26
years). So it was no surprise that the 2,877 spectators, including
many of Stringer's players from years past, gave her a standing
ovation and kept standing for a small ceremony. With her sons,
David and Justin, at her side, Stringer was presented with a
commemorative basketball and poster and a proclamation from the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Stringer, 50, was reflective. ``I'm just grateful to have
the opportunity to be in the luckiest profession in the world,''
she said, ``where you can touch so many lives and be able to
translate what happens on the basketball court into the game of
life. In this game, the human spirit prevailed. It was a great win
because of how it was done. This is the point where we want to
start, right here.''
</P>
<P>
   The game had special importance because Rutgers had endured so
many ups and downs in a season in which many people and preseason
polls had predicted the team would reach the Final Four. But after
a lethargic opening loss to North Carolina State, Stringer replaced
most of her starters, including Pointer, the mercurial point guard,
and Stewart, the perimeter bomber. They did not start again until
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This was Rutgers' game to win or lose, and the hustle of those
two stars allowed the Scarlet Knights to prevail. The statistics
reflected their paradoxical performances.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart shot 7 for 20, scored a game-high 23 points and had four
assists and four steals. Pointer shot 2 for 9 and scored eight
points, with four assists and five steals. But the numbers did not
fully reflect Rutgers' defensive fury.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's 3-pointer with 3 minutes 14 seconds left tied the
score at 58-58, and when Rutgers trapped Texas after the inbounds
pass, she stole the ball, was fouled and made two free throws. When
Texas regained the lead on Alisha Sare's 3-pointer, Stewart's layup
put Rutgers ahead for good. Pointer kept the ball away from the
Texas press, and with 15.5 seconds to go she drove to the basket
and banked in a layup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we won symbolizes us,'' Stringer said. ``In the last
minutes, I knew we were not going to be denied.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers is ranked 16th and Texas 25th in the Associated Press
poll of news media. Rutgers improved its record to 5-2 and the
Longhorns, who had won four straight, fell to 7-3. Texas got a huge
game from forward Edwina Brown, the team's only senior, who had 19
points, seven assists and three steals.
</P>
<P>
   Pointer seemed to speak for her teammates when she said of
Stringer, ``She taught us to dream and dream big.'' Stringer said
the dreaming was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I slept in this morning,'' she said. ``I didn't get my second
wake-up call. We can sleep through life. We have to call ourselves.
We don't need anyone else to give us our wake-up call. We have our
wake-up call. This is the way we have to play.''

Rumors of Hakeem's demise exaggerated
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, he has seen Charles Barkley go down with
a career-ending knee injury and watched his once-proud team sink
steadily in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of discouragement, Hakeem Olajuwon feels
determination. Rather than surrendering to the sense of gloom and
looking to rebuild for tomorrow, he still seeks the salvation of a
final Rockets fight for today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the way I want to go out, not the way I want to
end my career,'' Olajuwon said. ``It hurts too much to see us
losing every night and after all that I have been through in 16
years and helped to accomplish with this team, it is not the way I
want people to remember the conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to do is rehabilitate my injury, get back into the
lineup as soon as possible and do anything I can to turn this
around and to play out my contract through next season with the
Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to end my career here in Houston. I cannot picture
myself being anywhere else or wearing any other uniform. This is
where everything has happened and where it should come naturally to
its conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Since undergoing hernia surgery Dec. 1 that has him sidelined
until at least January, Olajuwon has heard all the gossip and rumor
and innuendo coming from within the Rockets organization and from
assorted hangers-on and locker-room leeches, who say he lacks the
fire and the competitiveness that carried the franchise to two NBA
championships and is looking for the easy way out.
</P>
<P>
   He admits he raised the possibility of the Rockets paying off
the last year of his contract ($16 million for 2000-2001) and
making this his final season. But Olajuwon said that came as one
small part of a wide-ranging discussion of the direction of the
franchise last June with team owner Leslie Alexander and came from
a consideration of going out of the NBA at the same time as
Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came into the league in the same year and I thought maybe
it would make good timing if we went out together,'' Olajuwon said.
``Les was talking about bringing Charles back for one year and
making this a kind of last run at another championship and I
suggested the possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   It even went so far as to Olajuwon broaching the subject with
coach Rudy Tomjanovich before the season opener and to have a
representative discuss terms of an early buyout with the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   But that notion was squashed by Olajuwon's injury and the
ensuing catastrophic collapse of Barkley. At first, it all made him
feel sad. Then it made him more determined.
</P>
<P>
   So at halftime of Tuesday's game with the New York Knicks,
Olajuwon met again with Tomjanovich and informed the coach of his
decision to play out his contract, to do everything to help the
Rockets out of their current situation.
</P>
<P>
   Then he talked about the playoffs. This year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' Olajuwon said. ``It is December and we have only
played a little more than 20 games. I have never entered a season
in my career where I didn't think it was possible to compete for a
championship and I have never been in a season where anyone gave up
this early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It disturbs me to hear talk of the future, of next year
already. It sounds like you don't want to compete. I know that to a
lot of people, making the playoffs looks impossible to accomplish.
But isn't that where Clutch City came from originally? Didn't most
people think it was impossible in 1994 and 1995?''
</P>
<P>
   He hears the whispers about his age (37 on Jan. 21) and the talk
that he is not the player he once was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I am getting older, like everyone else in the world,'' he
said. ``But the truth is that before the hernia, this was the first
time in three years that I was feeling pain-free on the court and
able to do all of the things I want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``People saw me playing in those previous years, but didn't
understand the pain I had in my knees that restricted my play. I
have been working with (Olympic long jumper) Frank Rutherford and
my conditioning now is as good as it was in the championship
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before anyone says that I cannot do things, I would like the
opportunity to do them first.''
</P>
<P>
   Fingers are pointed to his losing one-on-one matchup with
Shaquille O'Neal last spring in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me who can stop Shaq right now in the NBA,'' Olajuwon
said. ``Nobody. But you can beat his team with a strategy that
incorporates everyone and I can be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back and look at the tapes of the 1995 Finals when we swept
Orlando. Shaq was just as big and I didn't beat him one-on-one. I
beat him in the flow, in the rhythm, by having Clyde (Drexler)
drive and me there to take a pass when Shaq left me. I just played
basketball in the Orlando series and let the opportunities come to
me. I didn't beat Orlando. We beat Orlando.''
</P>
<P>
   He has heard the talk, on the call-in radio shows and on the
street, that he is satisfied with his two NBA titles and is no
longer willing to work. But look at the record. Olajuwon was voted
third-team All-NBA just last season.
</P>
<P>
   He began his rehabilitation from hernia surgery last Monday, the
first day he was released by team physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has ever had a taste of a championship would know
that the ideal situation is to taste it again,'' Olajuwon said.
``It doesn't make you satisfied. It makes you motivated. Because
nothing else tastes as good.
</P>
<P>
   ``What those people have not looked at is the physical handicaps
I have had to deal with in recent seasons. I did all that I could
with knees that gave me pain and didn't allow the freedom on the
court I would like. But I have also spent more than a year working
to rehabilitate those knees. Would I have done that, put in that
work, if I was already satisfied? What I'm saying is to give me a
chance with those knees and a body that feels good now.''
</P>
<P>
   The knocks have even come from the area of religion, the wild
speculation that because Olajuwon is so devoted to the Islamic
faith, it has made him too much of a pacifist to fight the NBA
wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was deep into Islam when we won two championships,'' he
said. ``It gives you strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you this about Islam. No NBA owner has ever had to
worry about me. Not about me embarrassing the league or the team or
anyone in Houston that I represent. I act professionally. I act
right. And Islam has made me that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Islam has also taught me is to enjoy the present and not
to worry about things that I cannot change. I guess there are those
who say that when we lost the last two years in the first round of
the playoffs and I did not scream or jump up and down, that meant I
didn't care. Well, I have seen guys kick trash cans or make a scene
on the court when they lose. All it does is attract attention to
them. It doesn't mean they care more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we won the first championship in 1994 and the big
celebration was going on out on the floor, I went to the press
table and sat down and watched it all. I wanted to take in the
experience and remember the feeling, and I will always have it with
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the same beliefs in Islam then that I have now. To say
the difference is my religion is ignorance. In fact, according to
Islam, it would be a criminal act for me to take the full amount of
my salary and not give a full effort. If I care so much about
Islam, about God, then that is exactly the thing that would not let
me give up. In that way, I am my own safety check.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon has been talking for more than an hour now, seated at a
table in an upscale restaurant, but moving, twisting, turning,
simulating shots and moves on the court in between bites of fish
and scallops, those chocolate brown eyes dancing with life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to stand in anybody's way,'' he said. ``I don't
want to impose myself on a generation of players that thinks my
time is done. I don't want to stand in the way of coaches or
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after what happened with Charles, after seeing the way the
games have gone, all the losses, I am committed to having this end
the right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm alone, but I think we have players who can win and
I'm not ready to write off the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to play next season and I would like it to come to
an end in Houston. It would be 17 years, all here, the way it
should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might say the fitting end to a Dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm telling you,'' Hakeem Olajuwon said, ``it isn't
over.''

BUSH'S NEW HAMPSHIRE ALLIES SAY HE'S VULNERABLE THERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS ``in Austin'' to last graf of 1st take) 
 (EXCLUSIVE; 4 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 7 p.m. ET EMBARGO
for electronic media.)

 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Many of Gov. George W. Bush's allies in New
Hampshire are blaming his Texas-based campaign for early lapses
that they say have left him unnecessarily vulnerable against Sen.
John McCain in the state that holds the first presidential primary
in only six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of aloofness and overconfidence, they say, led
advisers unfamiliar with the peculiarities of New Hampshire's
politics to let Bush adopt a sound-bite style that voters here
disdain, and to forgo the time-honored approach of personal
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   After months of appearing unstoppable elsewhere, Bush has seen
his lead in the New Hampshire polls evaporate, and some surveys
show McCain is continuing to surge. Several of Bush's top advisers
now concede that he could lose the primary on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Bush would still be the clear favorite for the
Republican nomination. He holds a commanding lead in polls in every
other battleground state and sits atop a daunting treasury.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire may no longer be the make-or-break state it once
was for presidential aspirants. Still, no matter what happens, many
Bush supporters in New Hampshire said the campaign should never
have put itself in jeopardy. Their recrimination underscores a
tension _ one that many strategists say was inevitable _ between
the campaign's tightly run high command in Austin, Texas, and its
supporters on the ground in this tiny state.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Stephen E. Merrill of New Hampshire, who ran Bob
Dole's campaign here in 1996 and backs Bush, spoke out for the
first time in an interview about his qualms about the governor's
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush campaign believed it was the front-runner in New
Hampshire,'' said Merrill, who did not seek re-election in 1996.
``There's no such thing as the front-runner in New Hampshire. You
simply become the biggest target. This state demands personal
attention _ and is not easily impressed by either money or poll
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing his belief in Bush himself, Merrill added: ``I love
this guy. He'd make a great president. That's what's so
frustrating. There is no inevitability in any presidential primary.
The great irony is that the candidate understands that. I'm not
sure everybody else does.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of Bush's backers in New Hampshire argued that the
governor's top national advisers did not grasp the idiosyncratic,
even quaint, requirements for stumping in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, they complained that Bush, seeming to take his
lead for granted, did not spend nearly enough time in the state and
passed up early debates with his rivals. When he did venture here,
they said, Bush staged mostly large events where the voters had
little chance to quiz him, a cherished state tradition.
</P>
<P>
   He also took pains not to engage McCain directly, and Bush's
supporters said he did not develop a crisp message early on to
answer the Arizona senator's call for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   And they said he has been slower than Vice President Al Gore in
trying to shed his entourage, as the vice president did when former
Sen. Bill Bradley mounted an unexpectedly vigorous challenge here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they understand New Hampshire; they don't get
it,'' said Jane E. O'Hearn, a state representative from Nashua, in
the south of the state, who endorsed Bush in May. ``I don't think
they are complying with the way New Hampshire has done things. They
are treating every state probably the same way _ it's sound bites
in every state.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Hearn, who is so exasperated she is toying with the idea
of defecting to McCain, added: ``George Bush's sound bites are all
the same. I don't think he's coming across with the depth he needs
to reach the people of New Hampshire. The man is good, he is
sincere, and just needs an opportunity to show that. And I hope the
Bush campaign allows that to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Bush operatives here said they were overwhelmed by unex-
pected crowds at the governor's events, which made it more
difficult for him to interact with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Dupont, a former state Senate president from Concord who is a
member of Bush's state steering committee, said it had been a
nightmare trying to set up an appearance in September at the
international speedway here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent two days with Texas Rangers and advance staff for a
two-hour event,'' he said. ``He couldn't ride in a golf cart, had
to have a closed vehicle.'' In the end, Bush had to scrap the event
because of a shooting in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain swooped in with almost no advance planning. ``They
stuck him in a golf cart and drove him down to the infield and he
shook 400 hands,'' Dupont recalled. ``That is part of what the
McCain message has been: throw your jacket over your shoulder and
go ahead and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dupont echoed many Bush backers who had nothing but praise for
how McCain has mounted his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this race started, it was Bush's to lose and McCain was
clearly the underdog,'' he said. ``But when McCain wraps the United
States flag around himself, people want to salute. And he's
deserving of that. He's definitely caught on in New Hampshire. The
Bush campaign certainly has the ability to even this thing up in
New Hampshire and win. But time is running short.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Corrigan, a commissioner in Coos County in northern New
Hampshire who is a town chairman for Bush and has been active in
politics for three decades, said: ``The people from the Concord
office were getting their orders from Texas. They had their methods
set even before they came to New Hampshire. We had strangers coming
in trying to run a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, said many of the
decisions were made jointly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do the mechanical stuff here,'' in Austin, he said. ``The
TV ads are produced here, but they are carefully vetted there. For
all the volunteer activity on the ground, and decisions about where
does Bush go, they come up with a plan that they discuss with us.
What does Bush say? It's a mutual discussion between them and us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers insist that they are not rattled now that they
are threatened by a potent rival in the Granite State. But their
calm exteriors belie several steps they have taken in recent weeks
to be more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   After saying he would not take part in any debates until
January, Bush participated in three this year, and the first was in
New Hampshire. He has significantly stepped up his travel schedule
to the state. And at events here he now allows far more time for
questions and answers from residents than in most other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the front-runner always has a rough patch in the road
somewhere,'' said Rove. ``And the way to plow your way though is to
stay disciplined and to stay focused _ make alternatives and keep
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove said he was doing other things to become more competitive,
but would not describe them ``because it would be showing our
cards.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory by McCain in New Hampshire could fortify the Arizona
senator's entire operation as the campaign moves into a fast-paced
schedule of contests. And there is always the possibility _ remote
as it may seem _ that a humiliating defeat could unhinge the entire
Bush operation.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush supporters said McCain's rise was inevitable, because
it is political custom for there to be an intense skirmish here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not shocked or stunned or anything like that,'' said Rep.
Charles Bass, R-N.H., one of the Bush campaign's top lieutenants
here. ``Frankly, I don't think Bush is either. I've been pounding
this every time I've been with him: `We're going to be behind and
don't worry about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Todd Harris, the McCain campaign's spokesman in New
Hampshire, said the Bush campaign ought to be worried. ``Their
definitive victory line in the sand keeps getting pulled back
further and further every day,'' he said. ``It used to be, we'll
defeat them here in New Hampshire. Now, they're talking about a
firewall in Michigan.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Joel Maiola, the Bush campaign director in New Hampshire, argued
that McCain's rise had come about because the Arizona senator drew
new support each time one of the other alternatives to Bush dropped
out of the race earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he thought many Bush supporters had publicly
criticized the candidate's operation, Maiola said: ``In New
Hampshire, there's a lot of agendas and a lot of reasons for saying
different things. In New Hampshire, you can never get enough of a
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   The most influential New Hamp- shire figure in the campaign is
Sen. Judd Gregg, who installed Maiola, his longtime chief of staff
and campaign manager, to run the statewide drive.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides defended their operation by arguing that McCain is
concentrating his effort in New Hampshire, completely bypassing the
Iowa caucuses a week before and skimping in other states as well.
By contrast, Bush is running a full-fledged national campaign. As
of Saturday, Bush had spent 19 days in New Hampshire this year;
McCain had been here 42 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our object is to compete everywhere and to win everywhere,''
Rove said. ``You can't claim to be a national candidate worthy of
the nomination of the Republican Party if you say you're going to
pick and choose every contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhona Charbonneau, who is chairman of the Bush campaign in
Hillsborough County, said she had been worried that the candidate
did not spend enough time here. ``I don't think they understood New
Hampshire politics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said she had become more confident because the candidate
was coming here more _ and because she was being overwhelmed by
people who wanted to attend a reception for Bush at her house on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be hanging from the ceilings,'' she said.
``I've got 180 people coming to my home, and I've had to turn
people away.''

<P>
   Steve May quickens his pace toward his office in the state
House.
</P>
<P>
   He stops a research analyst in the corridor. Why shouldn't
chiroprac tors be allowed to join HMOs? Why can't the state create
a fund for the working poor who make too much to qualify for
AHCCCS?
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst is within earshot. Give me a bill, quick, that
makes House members declare conflicts of interest if they have
business before other representatives.
</P>
<P>
   May slips into his office, dominated by a bust of Abraham
Lincoln. The phone rings. A worker at his herb import store in
Tempe has been caught downloading porn on the company computers.
He's got to be fired, May says.
</P>
<P>
   ``La vida loca,'' May says repeatedly of the dizzying pace.
</P>
<P>
   The crazy life.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly these days, people want to slow down the freshman
legislator and freeze-frame the one issue he feels uncomfortable
about.
</P>
<P>
   May wishes they wouldn't ask. Be cause he's got a lot more to
tell beyond being gay and fighting to save his military career.
</P>
<P>
   It's the one irony, the one conun drum of Steve May: the public
limelight and national prominence he's bathing in stem from a
disclo sure he was loath to make.
</P>
<P>
   He is wary because he wants to be known as a serious legislator,
not the Rosa Parks of gays in the military. He is wary because his
sexual orientation has become a constant qualifier: conservative,
but gay; Re publican, but gay; military officer, but gay; rising
political star, but gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my constituents are tired of hearing about my private
life. I am tired of talking about it,'' May wrote in an e-mail to
The Republic about this profile. ``If my constituents are led to
believe that all I do is talk about my private life or spend all my
time fighting this military policy, they may choose not to vote for
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, I wouldn't vote for myself if that were true.''
</P>
<P>
   May has always sought to safeguard his privacy, even among
family. This, long before a fellow Army reservist complained about
May's public ad mission of being gay, triggering an investigation
that now threatens to drum him out of the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   May's sister, Shannon, a Chinese-studies student at Harvard,
said she was in the dark until four years ago, when she visited his
alma mater, Claremont McKenna College in Cal ifornia, on a
recruiting trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to this party and there were these friends of his
talking about how good he looked at Halloween in drag. I walked
around the campus for five hours that night thinking and trying to
sort all that out,'' Shannon May said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she kept dropping hints to her brother, trying to find
out more details about his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, he was at a party one night with his significant
other and looked at me and said, `He's it,' and then just walked
away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim May, an old-school Mormon, said he was crushed when his son
told him a decade ago that he was gay and wouldn't be going on a
mission for the church. Jim says he prays daily for Steve, who once
taught Sunday school in the faith, to come back to the fold and
receive his ``higher spiritual blessing.'' But he offers one small
caveat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have flaming homosexuals, but Steve is definitely not
that. I've never seen him and his partner touch one another and
display it in public,'' Jim said.
</P>
<P>
   There are detractors, such as Rep. Karen Johnson, who say that
despite Steve May's protestation otherwise, his sexuality is part
of his politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an extremely angry man who knows his lifestyle is wrong
but is doing everything he can to try to validate it,'' said
Johnson, R-Mesa. The two clashed bitterly earlier this year over
proposed legislation that would deny insurance benefits to gay and
unmarried couples. The bill failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking in my office once about it and he said,
`You're attack ing me and my family' and got very angry,'' she
said. ``He said that people like Pat Robertson and others will burn
in hell for what they were doing on that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also said that May ``tries to turn everything into a
homosexual issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed his vote once on the floor because he said he got
an e-mail from his `spouse' wanting him to,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   May's significant other, Paul Quinn, an instructor at Arizona
State Uni versity, said May would have chosen to stay in the closet
had a campaign supporter not outed him three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt me because he felt he had to hide me,'' Quinn said.
``But being gay is a part of him that he can't put aside. At times,
I've thought and wondered whether I or politics come first.''
</P>
<P>
   May has always been somewhat of a political animal, who toiled
in calcu lated fashion to fulfill his ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Classmates in the eighth grade called him ``Mr. President.''
Shannon said her brother carried a copy of the Bill of Rights in
his backpack to junior high and wouldn't hesitate to go with it to
the principal's office when he felt a disadvantaged student was
being hassled.
</P>
<P>
   At Arcadia High School, where he was president of his class for
two years, May led a massive demonstra tion when he was a freshman
in protest of the campus being closed at lunchtime. He later spoke
to the School Board about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   There was the time in college when he got rid of his bed so he
could put a large desk from the ROTC depart ment in his room and
study through out the night. He would throw down a sleeping bag at
times and catch a couple hours of shut eye.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues at the Legislature say he's well-prepared and
doggedly deter mined.
</P>
<P>
   May said he originally had intended to go into the Navy until he
spent two months of boring duty aboard a nuclear submarine. He then
switched to the Army, where he was stationed at Fort Riley, Kan.,
from 1993 until 1995 where he was a nuclear, biologi cal and
chemical defense officer.
</P>
<P>
   The most eventful thing during that time, May said, was having
the misfortune of having a mailbox located next to Oklahoma City
bombing accomplice Terry Nichols, who also had been stationed at
Fort Riley. Because May also had traveled to Oklahoma City, albeit
to help victims of the bombing, he attracted an uncomfortable
amount of interest from FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   After his military time was over and he went on inactive reserve
until being called up last spring, May poured his energy into the
family business, importing stevia, a leaf extract from Paraguay
that has become a popular sweetener in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   That coincided with Steve May's leaving the military. He jumped
in to the private sector with gusto for research and development
and re cently started marketing the herb, which he hopes will
ultimately give artificial sugar products a run for their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have brought that product online in 1997,'' May said.
``But I've got this stupid political habit.''
</P>
<P>
   Political savvy, too. He handicaps his sexual orientation and
figures that about 20 percent of the electorate will outright not
support him. May concentrates on crafting his political message to
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Even his battle with the Army over the ``Don't ask, don't tell''
policy seems more for self-preservation and political image rather
than for gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if there was an office he really wanted, like
president, he would renounce his homosexuality,'' said Air Force
Capt. Rachel Jacobs, May's best friend while growing up in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But even though he is trying to raise $100,000 on his Web site
to pay for his legal fight, May maintains he is not an advocate of
gay rights. Nor does he want his political career to be defined by
such a narrow issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My electoral challenge is to demon strate to my voters that I
am a good legislator _ that I am not fighting the Army, but
fighting for our common political agenda of better schools, lower
taxes, smaller govern ment, more liberty, better health care. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never chosen to make my private life public, but
circumstances gave me no other option. Many politicians would fight
ferociously for this level of attention. I don't want to be
well-known, just well-re spected.''

CLINTON CRITIC BLAMES OTHERS, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic &QL; 
Richard A. Posner has one of the keenest minds in America.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated summa cum laude from Yale and No. 1 in his class at
Harvard Law School. American Lawyer magazine called him ``the most
brilliant judge in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by
Ronald Reagan. Though conservatively in clined, Posner is famously
unpre dictable and holds some unconservative views, such as sup
porting the legalization of mari juana.
</P>
<P>
   Now 60, he's also written 30 books and hundreds of articles. His
influential output has brought com parisons to the great Oliver
Wendell Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read Richard Posner for the same reason I watch Jean-Claude
Van Damme movies,'' said Stephen Presser, a law professor at North
western University. ``In both cases, you get to see the master of a
discipline pulverize his foes.''
</P>
<P>
   He was recently picked to medi ate talks in the Microsoft case.
Antitrust experts say if anyone can get Bill Gates and Janet Reno
to agree, Posner can.
</P>
<P>
   I'm writing about him, however, because of his insight into a
differ ent matter: the impeachment one year ago of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   His book, An Affair of State, is the most lucid that's been
written. Posner delivers a level-headed and withering appraisal of
virtually ev eryone involved.
</P>
<P>
   He faults the U.S. Supreme Court for its ``naive and imprudent''
decision that enabled Paula Jones to proceed with her lawsuit while
Clinton was still in office. He accuses Ken Starr of invading
Clinton's privacy by including too much gratuitous sex in his
report. He scorns ``Clinton haters'' and ``moralistic
conservatives'' who be came apoplectic over the sexual affair.
</P>
<P>
   But Posner comes down hardest on the president. He finds the
evidence ``clear beyond reasonable doubt'' that Clinton obstructed
jus tice by:
</P>
<P>
   1. Perjuring himself repeatedly in his deposition in the Paula
Jones case, in his testimony before the grand jury, and in his
responses to the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   2. Tampering with a witness, Monica Lewinsky, by encouraging her
to give a false affidavit and hide gifts he gave her.
</P>
<P>
   3. Suborning perjury by suggest ing to Lewinsky that she give a
false explanation about why she was transferred from the White
House to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The president's defense infuriated Posner. He described it as
``grounded in quibbling, hairsplit ting, equivocation and brazen
denial of the obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton should have been convicted as well as impeached,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Posner doesn't say, choosing in stead to explain why reasonable
minds would disagree, depending on whether they were ``rigorists''
or ``pragmatists.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people who wanted Clinton convicted, the rigorists, focused
on the rule of law and moral values. In both regards, they felt his
conduct warranted removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Most on the pro-Clinton side were pragmatists and more likely to
place more importance on other factors. These include the impeach
ment's highly partisan nature, weak ening of the presidency in
favor of Congress, and overturning popular will, as reflected in
both the '96 election and the opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Although Posner withholds judg ment, he leans toward the view
that impeachment was warranted and conviction wasn't. He notes that
Clinton could not receive legal justice in the Senate, since nearly
all of the 100 senators were so biased they would been bounced in a
real trial. Their assessment of the facts was at best unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   Posner's powerful intellect doesn't make him right, but I think
he's dead-on. Neither side was com pletely right or wrong; they
placed priority on different values. Yet the public debate, as well
as the one in Congress, was unbending, ugly and often foolish.
</P>
<P>
   He cites ``the recklessness with which many intelligent people,
in cluding academics, took sides pas sionately and dogmatically
before it was possible to know what the facts were, their refusal
to face the facts when they became known, their unwillingness to
concede any merit to points made by opponents, their proneness to
exaggeration, distor tion and oversimplification, and the sheer
unreason demonstrated by so many.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's conduct was bad. The shrill response was no better.
We're lucky things didn't turn out worse.

WORKER KILLED AND SEVERAL SICKENED BY FUMES AT TIMES SQUARE CLUB
</HEADLINE>
  (UPDATES throughout) 
 (jw) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carbon monoxide fumes from a defective heating system
killed a kitchen worker at a popular supper club near Times Square
Saturday and left four others hospitalized, two in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Five rescue workers who helped treat the victims were also
overcome by fumes and three were admitted to hospitals, while two
were treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   An employee who first discovered the unconscious men in the
basement of the restaurant, Laura Belle at 120 W. 43rd St., was
treated at the scene, where 19 emergency vehicles converged
Saturday morning. The police closed off the block, evacuated a
building next door and checked manholes and nearby basements for
further evidence of the gas.
</P>
<P>
   A Fire Department spokesman, Paul Iannizzotto, said that a
faulty heating system had caused carbon monoxide levels to soar in
the basement.
</P>
<P>
   Police detectives, with help from Consolidated Edison and the
city's Department of Buildings, were investigating the cause of the
fumes and the death, said Det Joseph Pentangelo, a police
spokesman. ``No arrests have been made or summonses issued at this
time,'' he said, calling the case active.
</P>
<P>
   But one police official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
that investigators were focusing on whether the workers, who
appeared to be sleeping in the basement with their shoes off and
tablecloths draped over them for blankets, had tampered with an oil
burner, perhaps in an effort to adjust the heat.
</P>
<P>
   The level of carbon monoxide in the basement was extremely high,
said Thomas Galvin, a Fire Department division chief. In some areas
firefighters recorded levels of over 500 parts per million,
compared with a safe level of 35 parts per million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly effects of the carbon monoxide may have been
aggravated by a mixture of cleaning fluids found in the basement _
a noxious blend of ammonia, window cleaner and bleach, Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   As firefighters dragged the five unconscious workers from the
restaurant shortly after 10 a.m., a manager and several workers
from the day shift stood in the faint winter sun and wept. ``I left
here at 2 a.m.,'' said Joanne O'Connor, the club's banquet manager,
who stood surrounded by firefighters and plainclothes police
officers. ``Everything was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant owner, Michael ``Buzzy'' O'Keefee, who also owns
the River Cafe and Water Club, said through a spokesman that all
the workers were legal immigrants, and that to his knowledge they
did not sleep in the building. He said that at the Fire
Department's request, he would not discuss matters being
investigated. The spokesman, Ken Frydman, said that O'Keefee was
cooperating with the investigation and planned to visit the workers
and their families at the hospital Saturday night. ``It's a very
odd and tragic accident,'' Frydman said. ``That staff is like a
family.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-story brick building is owned by the 121 West 42nd
Street Associates. One of the company directors, Robert Z. Brandt,
reached by telephone Saturday night, said that O'Keefee, as the
tenant of the building, was responsible for its upkeep and
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The workers, who began their shifts at 10 p.m. on Friday night,
were still wearing white kitchen uniforms when they were hefted
onto stretchers and raced to waiting ambulances. One worker, Ernest
Freycinet, 53, died of cardiac arrest en route to St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, said a hospital spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The four other workers were transferred from two Manhattan
hospitals to Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, for oxygen
treatment in a hyperbaric chamber, said Nancy I.
McPartlin-Gardella, a hospital spokeswoman. Two of them _ Yeves
Robert Herve, 25, and Siloe Mirlin, who is in his 20s _ were in
critical condition, she said. Two others, Yvon Joseph, 30, and
Victor St. Ives, 43, were in stable condition, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The employees were first discovered shortly after 9:30 a.m.,
when Gary Marcius, a day-shift employee, arrived to lock up the
night club and found the five workers unconscious on the basement
floor, one in a small office. ``I go downstairs, and all of them
lay down,'' Marcius said outside of Laura Belle, his eyes welling
with tears. ``I say, `What is it?' but nobody talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcius said that he then raced upstairs and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   The first ambulance arrived at 10 a.m. and two emergency medical
technicians, along with a police officer, descended into the club,
called for backup and brought out Freycinet, the most seriously
injured, said Iannizzotto of the Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, firefighters with masks arrived and dragged
out the four remaining men.
</P>
<P>
   Those rescue workers first on the scene quickly began to feel
ill. As the ambulance bearing Freycinet sped toward St. Clare's
Hospital and Health Center, the two emergency medical technicians
and the police officer developed headaches and nausea, and pulled
to the curb and radioed for help, Iannizzotto said.
</P>
<P>
   Ambulances arrived and took Freycinet to Roosevelt Hospital,
where he was pronounced dead on arrival. The two emergency workers
were taken to New York-Presbyterian Hospital, where they were hosed
down as a precautionary measure and were in stable condition with
respiratory problems, one of their co-workers said. The Fire
Department did not release their names.
</P>
<P>
   The police officer was taken to St. Clare's Hospital, and was in
stable condition.

DEVILS WIN BATTLE OF BACKUP GOALIES OVER CAPITALS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Two starting goaltenders who played for
the first time this month offered nothing spectacular. Chris
Terreri of the Devils was slightly better than Craig Billington of
the Capitals, however, and helped the Devils to a 5-4 victory over
Washington Saturday night before nearly 7,000 empty seats at
Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Two goals 66 seconds apart early in the third period, by John
Madden and Patrik Elias, the second of the night for each, gave the
Devils their third consecutive victory for the first time this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Lemieux scored the other goal for the Devils, who
improved to 18-10-3.
</P>
<P>
   Terreri posted his first victory of the season on 17 saves and
improved his record to 1-3-0. He allowed two goals to Sergei
Gonchar and one each to Chris Simon and Jeff Halpern. Terreri had
much more protection than Billington, who faced 43 shots and was
often left completely exposed to the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   For the Capitals (12-14-5), who beat the Rangers in overtime a
night earlier, the game was their third on the road in four nights
and ended a two-game winning streak. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Terreri's previous start was Nov. 25, in a loss to Phoenix,
while Billington's previous start was two days later, in a victory
over the Islanders. This was Terreri's fifth appearance of the
season and Billington's sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Billington was greeted with a barrage of shots from the outset.
He faced the first eight shots in the game and 16 before the first
intermission. His glove saves on Petr Sykora in the 10th minute and
Scott Gomez in the last minute of the period were his most
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Terreri had little to do for the first 10 minutes but then
allowed Simon's sixth goal of the season on the first shot he
faced, 10 minutes 11 seconds into the game. Simon started the play
when he took the puck from Sheldon Souray behind Terreri, left it
there and went in front to beat Terreri with a rising shot after a
pass by Adam Oates.
</P>
<P>
   Loss of concentration cost the Devils early in the second
period. They were caught with too many men on the ice 2:26 into the
period, and Washington capitalized 30 seconds later when Gonchar
beat Terreri from the slot with help from Ulf Dahlen's screen.
</P>
<P>
   A good move on the right by Brian Rafalksi and a pass from the
left side by Scott Stevens found Madden in the slot for his fourth
goal of the season, 4:41 into the period, to narrow the gap to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern scored at 12:32 of the second period to give Washington
a 3-1 lead. But two power-play goals, by Elias with 4:19 left and
Lemieux with 2:51 left, tied the score for the Devils, who had a
two-man advantage when Elias scored his third goal of the season.
Lemieux's goal was his ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals retook the lead just eight seconds later, however,
when Gonchar beat Terreri from close range on the right for his
second goal of the night to make it 4-3.  &QL;

EDITORIAL: TAXING ELECTRONIC COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 19:
</P>
<P>
   A congressional commission, due to report early next year, held
inconclusive hearings last week on proposals to tax _ or not tax _
sales conducted over the Internet. The debate is between those like
Sen. John McCain and other prominent Republicans who want to exempt
electronic commerce in whole or in part from sales taxes, and
others like the nation's governors who say that an exemption for
Internet sales would perniciously undermine their ability to
collect taxes. The likely outcome of the commission, as well as in
Congress, is for stalemate. But political stalemate could hand the
governors a big victory courtesy of the courts.
</P>
<P>
   An elementary principle of taxation says that taxes should
distort purchasing decisions as little as possible. It is not the
role of a tax code to determine whether customers shop in stores,
online or by mail order. But standing in the way of this principle
is a Supreme Court decision that prevents states, say New York,
from collecting taxes on sales to New Yorkers by companies located
in California unless the company has a branch office in New York.
That ruling puts in-state stores at a disadvantage and robs state
and local governments of billions in sales tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   So far these problems have been manageable. But the explosive
rise of electronic commerce threatens to turn a leak into a flood.
Efforts to exempt Internet sales entirely would make matters worse
still. Some proposals would even allow in-state stores to avoid
local sales taxes by entering a customer's order over the Internet.
The threat is that local governments would then be forced to cut
back spending or raise taxes on captive audiences. These
countermeasures could prove punishing for low-income families too
poor or unsophisticated to buy home computers for online access.
</P>
<P>
   One plan sponsored by the nation's governors appears naive at
first glance, but it could lead to new court decisions. The
governors envision new software that would make it easy for
Internet-based companies to calculate sales taxes, no matter in
which of 6,500 or so jurisdictions their customers live. The
governors hope that e-commerce companies would then volunteer to
start collecting taxes because the task would no longer be onerous.
It does, indeed, seem fanciful to expect businesses to collect
taxes they do not have to charge. But what starts off voluntary
might not remain so.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court did not say that it would prevent states from
collecting sales taxes from out-of-state companies forever. It
pointed to the fact that at the time of its decision there was no
feasible system for imposing that burden on the out-of-state
businesses. If, as promised, the governors provide e-commerce
companies with software that calculates the right tax no matter
where the buyer lives and sets up an authority to distribute the
money, then the courts might decide that collecting sales taxes no
longer constitutes an excessive burden.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives can carry
on an honorable fight over how much tax Americans should pay. But
there is no principled reason that Congress, under the guise of
promoting electronic commerce, should undermine the ability of
state and local governments to collect taxes. If people want to
shop online, they will do so without any artificial boost from
Congress.

EDITORIAL: THE PROSECUTION OF LINDA TRIPP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 19:
</P>
<P>
   The attempt by a Maryland prosecutor to try Linda Tripp on state
wiretapping charges for secretly tape-recording her telephone
conversations with Monica Lewinsky has revived passions that have
been dormant since President Clinton's impeachment trial. On one
side are those who view the pursuit of Mrs. Tripp as a vindictive
selective prosecution designed to punish her for exposing White
House misconduct. On the other side are those who take a dim view
of her betrayal of the young woman she befriended and of Kenneth
Starr's independent counsel office. They see her current legal
troubles as a matter of poetic justice.
</P>
<P>
   Remove this emotional overlay, however, and the case seems more
mundane _ a valid effort to enforce Maryland's privacy law, which
prohibits recording telephone conversations without the consent of
the person being recorded. Ignoring such a well-publicized
violation would have weakened the statute's deterrent value and
made it harder for the state to justify prosecutions of less
notorious violations in the future. As for accusations of political
revenge, the case was brought by a special state prosecutor,
Stephen Montanarelli, who has a reputation for being nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be determined whether Mrs. Tripp's immunity
agreement with Starr's office leaves room for the state
prosecution. The prosecutor must show that none of his evidence
against her was the result of work by the independent counsel's
office after immunity was granted. That task was made easier last
week when the presiding judge ruled that Mrs. Tripp's immunity
applied only to evidence she gave to federal prosecutors after Feb.
19, 1998, rather than a month earlier. The judge based that
decision on a failure by Starr's office to get a court to ratify
the agreement immediately. The timing of the immunity is one of
several legal issues that will affect the judge's decision on going
to trial. In fairness to Mrs. Tripp, an administrative error by
Starr's office, if there was one, should not be the determining
factor.

NETS OVERCOME LOSSES IN WIN OVER CAVALIERS, 98-74

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The final score does not reflect it, but the New
Jersey Nets overcame plenty of adversity Saturday night in a 98-74
rout of the Cleveland Cavaliers, just the fourth time the Nets have
won in their last 30 games in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The perimeter shooting of Kerry Kittles, Johnny Newman and
Stephon Marbury lifted the Nets to an easy victory even though
forwards Keith Van Horn and Kendall Gill missed much of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn was in foul trouble throughout, scoring just four
points in 13 minutes, and Gill went out with 5 minutes 50 seconds
left in the first quarter with an ankle injury. Both, however,
contributed in a decisive third quarter in which the Nets (7-17)
outscored Cleveland, 27-9.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles and Marbury each scored 18 points and Newman added 17 in
the Nets' biggest margin of victory this season. The Nets have won
five of their last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Kittles did much of his damage from the free-throw line, hitting
8 of 9 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' defensive effort and Cleveland's lackluster play in
the second and third quarters resulted in two decisive runs for the
Nets, with easy transition baskets.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers were scoreless for 4:58 late in the second
quarter, then opened the third quarter without a point for the
first 4:01.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, scoreless in the first half, had his four points at
the outset of the second half before picking up a fifth foul and
going to the bench to stay. Gill had two points in the quarter
before also going to the bench to rest his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Kemp, who had scored 36 points in Cleveland's 111-101 loss
at the Meadowlands on Wednesday night, scored 14 to lead the
Cavaliers (11-12).
</P>
<P>
   Last week Cleveland guard Bob Sura had lamented that his team
should have a much better record. ``Teams are coming out and
punching us in the mouth, and we don't respond,'' he said after
consecutive road losses to the Nets and the Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets took command with a 17-2 run to open the second half.
The Nets' defense forced the Cavaliers into four turnovers in their
first eight possessions while Kittles and Marbury hit their shots
from the perimeter to give the Nets a 63-45 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland scored just nine points in the third quarter as the
Nets opened a 73-52 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets started the game badly. They had just two free throws
by Kittles in their first six possessions. On their other five
possessions, they committed two offensive fouls, twice turned the
ball over on bad passes and had another pass stolen by Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, coming off a 99-86 loss Friday night in Charlotte,
got its running game in gear early to take a 15-12 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets turned the game around midway through the first period,
however, when Newman replaced Gill. Newman sparked an 18-2 run by
the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Newman made a 19-foot jump shot from the right side and a
3-point shot from the left baseline to start the run. Kittles had
consecutive 3-pointers in the spurt that gave the Nets a 30-17
lead.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; NORWOOD &LR;  By Charles Portis. Overlook, $13.95. The author's
first novel follows the picaresque adventures of Norwood Pratt, a
good-hearted ex-marine and folk singer whose cross-country odyssey
takes him through the bowling alleys, roller dromes, chili parlors
and bus stations of 1960s America. In 1966 the reviewer Martin
Levin called this a ``delightfully original'' tale imbued with
``the magic of a fable.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE VICTORS: Eisenhower and His Boys. The Men of World War II &LR; 
By Stephen E. Ambrose. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $16. This
account of the Allied campaign in Europe, which draws heavily from
unit histories and interviews (and five of the author's previous
books), combines the experiences of infantrymen with a portrait of
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's formidable leadership, which echoed
down through the ranks. ``Ambrose is a superb historian,''
Nathaniel Tripp wrote in 1998. ``He has the details and he has the
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; THE SUPREME COMMANDER: The War Years of General Dwight D.
Eisenhower &LR;  (University Press of Mississippi, $20), Ambrose
chronicles the making of a general, creating a portrait of a lucky
and gifted leader who blended great self-assurance with a capacity
to listen to others and learn from them. The result is an
``extraordinarily fascinating book,'' Gordon Harrison wrote in the
Book Review in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE RUM DIARY &LR;  By Hunter Thompson. Scribner, $12. There are no
drugs but lots of sex and booze in the author's first novel,
written in his pre-gonzo days, which chronicles the escapades of a
morose New York journalist in Puerto Rico in the 1950s. Last year
the reviewer David Kelly said Thompson evokes the exuberant world
of San Juan ``with some flair.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PHYSICS OF CHRISTMAS: From the Aerodynamics of Reindeer to
the Thermodynamics of Turkey &LR;  By Roger Highfield. Back Bay/Little,
Brown, $12.95. Why is Rudolph's nose red? Can Christmas trees be
cloned? A British journalist holds forth on a wide range of
yuletide phenomena, including holiday hangovers and the mystery of
the Star of Bethlehem. Last year the reviewer Simon Singh called
this ``a delightful compendium of seasonal science'' filled with
``genuine insights as well as fanciful speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GATES OF EDEN: Stories &LR;  By Ethan Coen. Delta, $12.95. The
writing half of the Coen brothers' moviemaking franchise spins 14
tales about dog castration, Minneapolis mafiosi, deaf private eyes
and the like. It's ``a parallel universe similar to our own _
except it's weirder, funnier and better edited,'' Mark Lindquist
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY FIRST COUSIN ONCE REMOVED: Money, Madness, and the Family of
Robert Lowell &LR;  By Sarah Payne Stuart. HarperPerennial, $13. This
memoir is about a proudly eccentric family of Boston aristocrats,
among them the poet Robert Lowell, for whom stoicism often runs
side by side with mental illness. ``It is a survivor's story, with
so much intelligence, humor and affection ... that even the
monsters it occasionally offers up are appealing,'' Reeve Lindbergh
wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WALK ON WATER: A Memoir &LR; , by Lorian Hemingway
(Harvest/Harcourt, $13), is another survivor's story, in which a
granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway writes of her passion for fishing
and her struggle with alcoholism. ``Eloquent, raw, funny, this
Hemingway has a voice all her own,'' Carol Peace Robins wrote in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JOURNEY TO THE LAND OF THE FLIES: And Other Travels &LR;  By Aldo
Buzzi. Steerforth, $10. In these erudite travel essays, the Italian
author skips from present to past to future in discussing the
cuisine, toilet habits and cultural quirks he has encountered in
places like Moscow, Gorgonzola, London and Jakarta. In 1996 the
reviewer Harlow Robinson called Buzzi a ``well-read and extremely
imaginative'' tour guide and praised his ``bizarre and vivid
scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROAD-SIDE DOG &LR;  By Czeslaw Milosz. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $13.
This collection of poems, anecdotes and cryptic essays by the
Polish writer dwells on themes like memory, aging and the need to
create order out of the chaos of history. It is ``a difficult
pleasure, but it is a pleasure,'' Richard Bernstein wrote in The
Times last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JOHN DOLLAR &LR;  By Marianne Wiggins. Washington Square/Pocket
Books, $14. In 1917, a British schoolteacher is stranded on a
remote Burmese island with her lover and eight girls after a tidal
wave capsizes their boat, leaving them to play out a female version
of ``Lord of the Flies.'' In 1989 the reviewer Michael Gorra called
this a ``provocative novel'' and admired its ``pitiless and
brilliant prose.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STORM TIDE &LR;  By Marge Piercy and Ira Wood. Fawcett/Ballantine,
$12.95. This novel about the political and romantic education of a
failed baseball player in his hometown on Cape Cod is the
collaborative effort of a husband-and-wife team. ``But the book
itself speaks with one powerful voice,'' Ruth Coughlin wrote in
1998.

EDITORIAL: A NEW WAY OF LIVING WITH NATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 19:
</P>
<P>
   A century that will be remembered for material and scientific
progress may also be remembered for something more modest _ as a
moment when mankind, realizing that the earth's resources were not
finite and perhaps seeking expiation for years of predatory
behavior, struck a truce with nature. For the first time since the
dawn of the industrial age there was, at least in the West and
certainly in America, a rough armistice between the forces of
economic growth and the forces of preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The big question on the eve of the next century is whether this
armistice will hold. The earth's 6 billion people will grow to 9
billion by 2050, creating new pressures on natural resources, food
and habitation. There is also the related question of whether what
can loosely be called the environmental ethic, now largely confined
to the industrialized world, can be extended to poorer nations that
believe it is their turn to industrialize.
</P>
<P>
   America, for example, seems to have settled on a policy of
preserving its national forests and adding incrementally to its
protected wilderness. By contrast, countries like Brazil, Malaysia
and Indonesia are chewing up their forests at a ferocious clip.
Similarly, the industrialized West is actively seeking alternatives
to the carbon-based fuels that are contributing to potentially
disruptive changes in the earth's climate. Yet unless the big
developing countries like India and China do likewise, what the
West does will make very little difference.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is worth celebrating the attitudinal changes in this
country that have cast nature, once seen as an unruly force needing
discipline, in a more congenial light. Early in this century, for
example, federal sharpshooters hunted wolves for bounty. Today, the
federal Fish and Wildlife Service is orchestrating the wolf's
revival. Sixty-five years ago the Hoover Dam, rising 70 stories
above the bed of the Colorado River, was hailed as the greatest
engineering feat in U.S. history. Today, dams are increasingly seen
as enemies of the natural order and are actually being dismantled.
Only 30 years ago the Hudson River, once among America's most
majestic waterways, was little more than a 350-mile sewer
stretching from the Adirondacks to Manhattan, choked with untreated
municipal waste, industrial chemicals and agricultural runoff.
Today, the Hudson pulses with life.
</P>
<P>
   Wolves, dams, wilderness, forests, lakes, rivers, estuaries _
all are seen differently now than they were less than 50 years ago.
Of course if reparations were to be made at all, the century now
ending was surely the proper time to make them. For it was not
until the 20th century that we began to develop the technology that
enabled us to destroy nature on a truly grand scale _ the
implacable machinery that in a heartbeat (measured in millennial
time) could foul the air, clear-cut the forests and strip-mine the
oceans.
</P>
<P>
   It was thus fitting that this same century would eventually
produce a citizens' revolt against environmental degradation. This
revolt _ symbolized by the first Earth Day in 1970, and defined by
the creation of an astonishing body of environmental laws _ not
only gave the nation the tools with which to heal itself but
conferred upon ordinary citizens the indispensable right to take
even the government to court if it failed to carry out these laws.
</P>
<P>
   There are many who believe that the technology that got us into
trouble will get us out _ that fuel cells will replace the internal
combustion engine, that microbes will dispose of the waste stream.
But of course technology is neutral. What will matter in the future
is what has always mattered, namely the values and political will
of those at the controls. The truth is, people can accomplish
mighty acts of repair. If they can destroy the Everglades with
levees and canals, as they did in the 1940s, they can help save the
Everglades by replumbing it. If they can decimate the world's
swordfish with factory ships, they can replenish the swordfish by
keeping those ships in port.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies one answer to the environmental pessimists who
believe that the world is past recovery, that the battle to
preserve open spaces and biodiversity is already lost because there
are simply too many people coveting too much land and demanding too
many resources. What they overlook is that we are not at the same
point on the learning curve that we were 70 or even 30 years ago.
Having discovered that we can actually change the way nature
operates, we have also discovered that with this power comes a
sacred obligation to restore what we once nearly ruined.

ODOM BRINGS MAGIC TO CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You watch Lamar Odom zing cross-court outlets and
take long strides to the basket, and yes, you have to admit it.
</P>
<P>
   There's a hint of Magic in his game.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrated Clippers rookie has the same court awareness as
Magic Johnson, the same ability to find open teammates while
staring straight ahead. You watch the 6-foot-10 Odom survey the
floor from the top of the key and you can't help but envision the
6-9 Magic Man, looking for James Worthy on the wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the compliment of a lifetime,'' Odom said. ``He
accomplished so many great things and made a big impact on the
game. To be mentioned with him is a great honor.''
</P>
<P>
   But such a comparison probably isn't good for a fragile
19-year-old _ especially when you play in the same city where
Johnson reigned, and for the team with a chronic inferiority
complex to Johnson's Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the comparison sets up expectations of greatness,
Odom welcomes the added pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure makes you elevate,'' Odom said. ``I like to have
pressure. All good players do. It makes you perform.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers knew they had a special player when Odom went for
30 points and 12 rebounds in his debut against Seattle. He scored
in double figures in each of his first 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   But then he made just 3-of-14 from the floor in scoring eight
points against Indiana last Saturday. Foul trouble held him to
eight again Monday against Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the Clippers wearing road jerseys against their
Staples Center co-tenants on Tuesday, Odom _ and the rest of the
team _ suffered a complete collapse.
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson watching from the second row of the stands, Odom
failed to make a field goal for the first time in his NBA career,
finishing with two points in 22 minutes. The exasperated and
intimidated Clippers scored an NBA-record low 19 points in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Odom knew the Clippers couldn't let that punishing loss linger.
So the next game against Golden State on Friday, he did something
about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors were up five with 1:11 to play when Odom made two
free throws, stole a pass, assisted on a Tyrone Nesby dunk, grabbed
a defensive rebound, scored the go-ahead basket over Donyell
Marshall with 11.9 to play, then knocked away a loose ball as time
expired.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, all that in one minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was spectacular. He put the team on his back,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He elevated his game over everyone else,'' said Keith Closs,
who bear-hugged Odom after the buzzer sounded, just like when Magic
wrapped his arms around Kareem Abdul-Jabbar after his first pro
game.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't Odom's first game. But it wasn't the last one he'll
win in the final seconds, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was on the line, and a play had to be made by
someone,'' Odom said. ``After losing to the Lakers the way we did,
we had to get a win to start over.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom has many of Magic's attributes. All that's missing are the
tall socks and the too-tight shorts.
</P>
<P>
   And one more thing. A supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   Odom has yet to record his first triple-double. He keeps coming
up short in assists, where his career high is seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lamar could make the greatest pass on earth,'' Clippers coach
Chris Ford said, ``but it doesn't count if the other guy doesn't
make the basket. If you haven't noticed, we haven't been making a
lot of shots.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though these are the Clippers, they still benefit from
Odom's presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes everyone around him better,'' Closs said.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't they say that about an oversized point guard from
Michigan State?

SHARPTON ENLISTS AN ALLY: WINNIE MANDELA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   WINNIE HU   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Al Sharpton continued to protest the
decision to transfer the trial of the four white police officers
accused of shooting Amadou Diallo to Albany, and Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela appeared with him Saturday and condemned police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mandela appeared at a two-hour service led by Sharpton at
his headquarters in Harlem. Sharpton pledged to ``recruit an army
of righteous souls that are willing to fight no matter where.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton stood beside Diallo's father, Saikou, and accused the
state appellate court of moving the trial to Albany to ensure that
a white judge and jury would be selected. The court ruled Thursday
that prejudicial publicity had eliminated the chance of the police
officers' getting a fair trial in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton denied that protests by his followers last year had
contributed to excessive media coverage that was cited as a reason
for moving the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never marched after the indictment'' of the officers, he
said. ``We were inside with the family. We didn't march outside the
courthouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mandela, the former wife of Nelson Mandela, the
anti-apartheid hero and first black president of South Africa,
compared police brutality in New York to the oppression of black
South Africans under the system of segregation she fought to
change. She urged people to continue fighting for justice, saying
that ``in South Africa, they used the police to carry out racist,
filthy laws, but out of that was grown a progressive police
force.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Diallo also spoke against holding the trial in Albany,
saying his son had been accepted as a ``child of the Bronx.''
Diallo said he had hoped to see justice done there. ``Amadou
Diallo's life was taken brutally and now his life is going to be
diminished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 people had signed up to go to Albany to attend the
trial as of Saturday afternoon. ``I do believe that if people do
not show up in numbers, then justice will not prevail,'' said Joyce
Oates, 55, a resident of the Soundview section of the Bronx. Ms.
Oates signed a yellow sheet of paper listing those willing to make
the trip. It was headed ``Amadou's Army.''

UCLA KEEPS FANS GUESSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Buckle up, UCLA basketball fans, and keep your
hands inside the compartment at all times. It's going to be another
one of those roller-coaster seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Giddy highs. Stomach-churning lows.
</P>
<P>
   Times so good as to defy our powers of description. Stretches of
incompetence so deep, so profound as to bring the future of the
program into question.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about UCLA under coach Steve Lavin _ or is it
the nature of modern college basketball? _ that makes for a
penthouse/outhouse existence, with precious little in between.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the 1999-2000 Bruins have shown a pronounced bipolar
condition. On successive Saturdays at Pauley Pavilion they were
thrashed by 24th-ranked Gonzaga, 59-43 ... and routed 19th-ranked
DePaul, 76-58.
</P>
<P>
   Which team is the real Bruins?
</P>
<P>
   Both of them, as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Bruins have talent aplenty, both in terms of
individual brilliance and athletic virtuosity. ``Top five, six,
seven talent,'' former UCLA coach Jim Harrick said. Talent enough,
certainly, to defeat nearly any team in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the Bruins have faults aplenty to render them helpless
against any opponent. Particularly patient, seasoned, well-coached
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the context of a single game, the Good Bruins and
the Bad Bruins are on display.
</P>
<P>
   The good Bruins are impressive. A couple of active 7-foot
sophomores in Dan Gadzuric and Jerome Moiso. A fearless freshman
forward, Jason Kapono, who knows you can't make shots without
taking them. A create-a-look wing in Ray Young. A heady point guard
in Earl Watson.
</P>
<P>
   It was that crew that broke open a 30-28 game Saturday with a
23-3 surge. It featured unselfish play, frenetic defense, a trio of
three-pointers by Kapono and 10 points in the paint by the big men.
</P>
<P>
   The bad Bruins, however, are scary. They throw passes into the
stands. They yap at each other. Their fundamentals bring to mind
junior high. They string together more bonehead plays than a
quintet of Neanderthals.
</P>
<P>
   That was the gang that let DePaul lead 26-24 at half despite 38
percent shooting. That nearly drove Pauley Pavilion fans to
distraction by casting off three three-pointers in the final two
minutes pf a 12-point game when a clever team pulls the ball out
and milks the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there are things we need to work on,'' Lavin said.
``We're not a finished product, after five games.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as always, there are off-court issues.
</P>
<P>
   JaRon Rush, the team's No.3 scorer, is sitting out while the
school investigates possible NCAA violations. Billy Knight, a
useful forward, only Saturday regained his eligibility because of
academic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Lavin keeps up his steady patter of positive
thinking. We're getting better. We're learning. We're coming along.
</P>
<P>
   We know from experience, though, that Lavin's Bruins are always
a bit behind the learning curve. Often, their sheer talent pulls
them through. On other occasions, against a Detroit Mercy or a
Gonzaga, they melt down.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line? UCLA probably is good enough to finish in the top
four of the Pac-10, maintain a top-25 ranking and make the NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But UCLA also isn't vaguely steady enough to last long in the
playoffs. Every roller-coaster has a big dip coming any moment.

DUELING FOR CAB, ARMS UP, BUT THIS TIME AT SOTHEBY'S
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like riders trying to flag a taxi on a rainy day,
bidders competed Saturday for the last Checker cab to roam the
streets of New York _ which was auctioned off for $134,500.
</P>
<P>
   The cab, which has traveled 994,050 miles, about 40 times the
circumference of the earth, belonged to its original owner and
driver, Earl Johnson, who retired in July and moved to Montego Bay,
Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview after the sale, Johnson said he
remembered paying about $9,000 for the cab, a 1978 Marathon sedan.
He drove for more than 20 years, carrying, among others, Walter
Cronkite, Muhammad Ali, and two riders from Wall Street to Grand
Central Terminal _ the only passengers who ever cheated him out of
a fare.
</P>
<P>
   He reminisced about the cab that had gone so many miles. ``I do
miss it. I don't know when I will ever get over it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Winsome Fennell of Queens, who attended the
auction, said she remembered riding around Chinatown and Queens in
the cab.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always went to a special car wash to get it cleaned
properly,'' she said of her father, who called the cab Janie, after
an old sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   The Checker Motor Co., which produced the familiar and
distinctive cars that became a symbol of New York, stopped making
the cabs four years after Johnson bought his.
</P>
<P>
   The cab had been expected to sell at Sotheby's auction house for
$20,000 to $30,000, according to the catalog, which described it in
terms that made it sound toothsome: ``traditional New York exterior
yellow livery with checkerboarding.'' And not to be missed:
``interior black Naugahyde in good condition with one small
repaired scratch to upper portion of back seat.'' The cab included
a cellular phone and slightly dented hubcaps.
</P>
<P>
   The bids started at $15,000 and climbed by increments of $5,000,
then $10,000, which were converted on an electronic board to
francs, pounds, marks, Canadian and Hong Kong dollars, euros, yen,
and lira.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gunther, development director of the New-York Historical
Society, quit bidding at $50,000. He had hoped to display the coach
next to the coach George Washington used in his inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   A battle then ensued between a bidder on the phone and a taxi
medallion broker. The final bid from the telephone caller, whose
name Sotheby's did not divulge, was $120,000, plus a $14,500
premium that went to the auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Murstein, 35, dropped out at $110,000, just before the
winning bid. He is the president of Medallion Financial Corp.,
which sells taxi medallions and makes loans to taxi drivers. He had
hoped to use the Checker as both a personal car and a company
vehicle. Murstein said that his grandfather had bought one of the
first taxi medallions sold by the city, for $10, in 1937.
Medallions now sell for about $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxis are just a great part of New York,'' said Murstein, who
drives a Lincoln Navigator and plans to try to buy another Checker
cab from private owners. He has his eye on one with only 700,000
city miles under its belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our first choice,'' he said of the 1978 model. ``This
one had a little bit more sentimentality to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a faltering rock band, the taxi was hired out for weddings
and anniversaries in its twilight years. Saturday, a magnet
announcing ``I am New York'' decorated the dashboard, along with a
small calendar, turned to August.
</P>
<P>
   As she drove the cab to a storage garage, Laura Harden, senior
manager of the Sotheby's car department, headed north on York
Avenue with the on-duty light on. Two men on the corner of East
72nd Street tried to hail it. As often seems the case when the
competition for a cab is intense, Janie passed them by.
