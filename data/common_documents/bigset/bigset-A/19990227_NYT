SELANNE IS CONSISTENT

   ANAHEIM -- Heading into Friday's game, Teemu Selanne had played
231 games with both the Mighty Ducks and Winnipeg Jets. His
production has been amazingly similar.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne scored 147 goals, 306 points and eight hat tricks for
the Jets. He scored 151 goals, 303 points and seven hat tricks in
his first 231 games for Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Pushor, who has missed six games with a bruised left
shoulder, said he's eager to play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling a lot better each day, said Pushor, who was hurt
Feb. 14 in Phoenix. ``It's up to the coaches, I think I'm ready to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of guys aren't 100 percent and they are playing
hard, so it's frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Pushor said he has regained full range of motion and ``it's just
a matter of getting the strength back.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Friday's sellout crowd of 17,174 was the first in 10 games at
the Pond. The Ducks hadn't sold out a game since Jan. 10 when they
played Edmonton. It was only Anaheim's fifth sellout in 30 home
dates this season. Last year the Ducks sold out 25 of 40 games.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   As the season has progressed rookie Johan Davidsson's ice time
had slowly been reduced, especially since the Ted Drury and Jeff
Nielsen began to catch the eye of Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than have Davidsson be scratched or play on the fourth
line, Anaheim opted to send the 23-year old forward to Cincinnati
of the AHL where he's expected to get plenty of playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Davidsson had scored three goals and seven points in 51 games
with the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Davidsson on the Anaheim roster is Mike Leclerc, who
had scored 19 goals and 43 points in Cincinnati before being
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Leclerc, 22, has played in 14 NHL games, scoring one goal and
two points.

 WHITMAN PICKS ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR N.J. STATE SUPREME COURT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Moving swiftly to strengthen her imprint on New
Jersey's highest court, Gov. Christie Whitman Friday nominated
Attorney General Peter G. Verniero, her longtime political ally, to
fill an unexpected vacancy on the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Justice Stewart G. Pollock announced that he would
leave the bench in September, Whitman announced the selection of
Verniero, a loyal confidant who has previously served as her chief
of staff, general counsel and campaign lawyer. To replace Verniero,
she nominated her chief counsel, John Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Both nominations require confirmation by the Legislature, but
neither is expected to face much opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In his two years as Whitman's appointed attorney general,
Verniero has aggressively championed her agenda, including
protecting the sex offender notification statute known as Megan's
Law, and persuading the U. S. Supreme Court that New Jersey was the
rightful owner of part of Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero, 39, was the object of considerable skepticism when he
joined the Whitman administration in 1994, because many Trenton
insiders questioned his relative youth and limited courtroom
experience. But even his former political adversaries acknowledge
that he has been an effective advocate for the governor's causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came here with a lot to learn, and he's learned it,'' said
Harold Hodes, a lobbyist. ``As chief counsel, chief of staff,
attorney general _ three very different jobs _ he's done them all
well. So there's no reason to believe he won't also learn to become
an excellent state Supreme Court Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   But some state legislators complained that Whitman was
nominating a political figure rather than a practicing judge, even
though New Jersey governors of both parties have made similar
appointments in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's most recent appointee to the court, Chief Justice
Deborah Poritz, also served as attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts also said the nomination, Whitman's third
opportunity to select a member of the seven-judge bench, signaled
an attempt to rein in a court with a history of judicial activism.
</P>
<P>
   Two more justices, Alan B. Handler and Daniel J. O'Hern, will
reach the mandatory retirement age of 70 before the governor's term
expires in 2001, and some legal scholars voiced concern that she
would leave office with a far more conservative bench than the one
she inherited.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great danger that this court's tradition will be
undermined,'' said Frank Askin, a professor of law at Rutgers
University. ``Peter Verniero has never demonstrated the qualities
that have distinguished the New Jersey state Supreme Court, namely
a passionate and intellectual commitment to the rights of the
powerless, the poor, or the rights of the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman dismissed suggestions that she was creating a court with
a more restrictive view of its own powers and insisted she would
continue the practice of choosing judicial nominees based on their
qualifications, rather than their ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never sat down and run through a list of litmus test
issues,'' she said. ``There is no conscious effort to make the
court more conservative or liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature will vote on the nomination by June, and,
because both houses are controlled by Republicans, Verniero is
expected to win approval easily.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Appearing at a news conference in the governor's office,
Verniero said he was gratified to be nominated, but he politely
deflected most questions about his beliefs regarding the powers of
the court.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing a case before the court last year, Verniero reminded
the justices that they did not have the power to create law, but he
would not say whether he would take a more expansive view of
judicial powers once he is on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courts often have to interpret statutes, and my only approach
will be to come to each case with an open mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero was born in Montclair and graduated from Drew
University in 1981 and Duke University Law School in 1984. His
involvement in Republican politics dates back to his high school
days, when he wrote a letter to the editor of The New York Times in
1976, arguing that the Republican Party was still alive and well,
despite the Watergate scandal and the re-election defeat of
President Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Richard Zimmer noticed the letter and recruited young
Verniero to work on his campaign. In the decade that followed,
Verniero went on to run the campaigns of several Republican
legislators and rose to the position of executive director of New
Jersey's Republican State Committee. In 1984, he served as a law
clerk to Justice Robert L. Clifford of the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming attorney general, Verniero has assiduously
avoided political events, declining to attend fund-raisers,
inaugural balls or other social engagements that might raise the
appearance of a partisan favoritism or conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Verniero was named the governor's chief of staff
in 1995, Hodes sent him two gifts, a bottle of vanilla flavoring
and a box of Ivory Snow, playful references to Verniero's fierce
loyalty to Whitman and his spotless reputation. Verniero refused to
accept them, saying it would be improper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's squeaky clean,'' Hodes said. ``He's so clean he only
wears white shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   But some New Jersey residents criticize Verniero's response to
lingering allegations that some state troopers routinely pick out
black motorists for tickets and arrests, an illegal practice known
as racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   As attorney general, Verniero has allowed his staff to represent
the troopers in their attempt to appeal a 1996 ruling by a
Gloucester County judge who found that troopers stopped motorists
on the New Jersey Turnpike solely because of their race.

 THE LABOR MOVEMENT'S EAGER RISK-TAKER HITS ANOTHER JACKPOT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Labor leaders are known more for wanting to
protect the status quo than for taking risks. But Andrew Stern,
president of the Service Employees International Union, is a
notorious risk-taker, and that is why his union this week won
labor's biggest organizing drive in 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's penchant for risk also explains why his union is the
nation's fastest-growing and why, labor experts say, he may someday
succeed John J. Sweeney as president of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Making a major bet, the service employees spent 11 years and
more than $1 million on a drive that paid off on Thursday, when
vote-counters announced that 74,000 Los Angeles home-care workers
for the elderly and disabled had chosen to be represented by the
union.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles a decade ago, Stern, then the union's organizing
director, took another major risk, engaging in civil disobedience
that at first backfired. Hoping to gain recognition for 2,000
janitors working in the city's office towers, the union staged
sit-ins and other protests, including a march on a Century City
office complex where the police beat several dozen demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   That violence in response to the service employees' Justice for
Janitors campaign so appalled political and business leaders that
they pressured janitorial companies into settling with the union.
</P>
<P>
   In a movement where many leaders long refused to stick their
necks out to reverse labor's decline, Stern has broken the mold.
And his success is inspiring many workers and slowly getting other
labor leaders to copy his ways, even as some criticize his
confrontational tactics and what they call his top-down style of
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture of the labor movement is it's safer to lose the
old way than to have the courage to try to win in a new way,'' said
Stern, a 48-year-old graduate of the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Stern is a native of West Orange, N.J., who started climbing the
union's ladder after becoming a social worker in Philadelphia in
1972. When he was elected president of the service employees three
years ago _ succeeding Sweeney, who had left to take the helm of
the AFL-CIO _ he vowed to do his utmost to stop labor's long slide
in influence and its share of the work force.
</P>
<P>
   He has changed his own union's direction by devoting 47 percent
of its $80 million budget to organizing new members _ a huge
percentage compared with that of other unions, which on average
spend less than 5 percent on organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, long considered a Sweeney protege, has also been a
leading practitioner of an important strategy: to seek to organize
all the workers in a particular market _ all of Washington's
janitors, for instance. This gives the union bargaining clout and
makes it all but impossible for nonunion contractors to undercut
unionized ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy Stern is one of the smartest labor leaders in the
country,'' said Richard Hurd, a labor relations professor at
Cornell University. ``He has consistently looked into the future
with a strategic focus, and that sets him apart from virtually all
other major labor leaders. A lot of labor leaders try to hold on to
the past and are afraid of taking big risks to change things. But
Andy has been willing to take big risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern's aggressive style and tactics have earned him plenty of
critics. Some other labor leaders, while envious of his organizing
victories, complain privately that he is arrogant in his repeated
boasts that his union is ``leading the way'' (the service
employees' motto). And the confrontational tactics he sometimes
favors, as when he blocked bridges in Washington in organizing
janitors there, have enraged politicians and the public.
</P>
<P>
   Stern says he has to walk both sides of the street, sometimes
embracing cooperation, other times confrontation. Sit-ins, he
maintains, are an appropriate weapon for bringing attention to the
plight of workers when other tactics fail.
</P>
<P>
   Rit Thompson, president of P&AMP;R Enterprises, which employs 2,000
janitors in the Washington area, says the bridge-blocking cost the
union some credibility. But he nonetheless praises Stern as
pragmatic, explaining that Washington employers agreed to recognize
the union and grant raises to the janitors after the union chief
listened at length to management's point of view and accepted some
of its proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy Stern,'' said Tom Balanoff, a longtime service employees
official, ``understands that about 90 percent of interactions with
management is developing relations. The other 10 percent is you
need to be able to squeeze them when the time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some union members complain that Stern runs a top-down union,
that he pushes everyone to back his positions and does not consult
sufficiently before making decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a progressive leader, and that's good, but he doesn't get
much input from the rank and file,'' said Paul Pamias, a doorman in
Manhattan. When Stern spends so much on organizing, ``I don't see a
lot of the rank and file saying, `Let's do this.' It's pretty much
top-down.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to criticism of his tactics, Stern insists that he
runs one of the most democratic of unions and that when he explains
to members the importance of organizing more workers, they
immediately support spending more on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to increase our membership just for the sake
of getting new members,'' Stern said. ``The whole purpose is it
will help us improve the lives of our members.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Stern's has 600,000 health care workers, having expanded its
lead as the nation's largest health care union two years ago when
New York City's biggest union, 1199, the National Health and Human
Service Employees Union, merged into the service employees.
</P>
<P>
   To follow up on this week's organizing victory in Los Angeles,
he and his 500 staff organizers plan to pursue several ambitious
drives at once: 80,000 more home care workers in California, 5,000
in New York state, 35,000 workers at Catholic Healthcare West, a
West Coast chain of hospitals, and more than 15,000 workers at
Genesis Health Ventures, a chain with 319 nursing homes. And on
Monday, the 1.3-million-member union will announce a major push to
unionize thousands of doctors around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some months, Stern spends as much energy cleaning up his union
as expanding it. He has placed two large Chicago locals and two big
New York locals into trusteeship. Earlier this month he forced out
Gus Bevona, the president of one of those New York locals, a large
janitors' union, who had arranged a $450,000 salary for himself and
a marble-lined penthouse at union headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing some longtime leaders living so royally, Stern has begun
to advocate term limits for union officials, a position detested by
most labor leaders. While the labor movement's 11th commandment may
be that ``thou shalt not criticize other union officials,'' Stern
says term limits are needed because it is hard to remove entrenched
leaders democratically and because some leaders lose touch with the
rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad that people sometimes think being a union leader is a
right or an inheritance,'' Stern said. ``When you're a union
leader, it's really a challenge to remember that you're the voice
of the members and not some kind of powerful figure in your own
right. I say at a lot of staff meetings that people who clean
toilets pay our salaries to try to improve their lives, and when
you forget that, you forget everything.''

MCCAIN MAKES PLAY FOR HISPANICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Sen. John McCain made a bold pitch for Latino votes
in California on Friday, vowing to end the ``politics of division''
and campaign for the vote of every American, ``no matter where you
came from.''
</P>
<P>
   The move was a slap at the state party's right wing, and it sent
a clear message that McCain will fight Texas Gov. George W. Bush
for the political center of the GOP field.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the names of Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt as
well as Ronald Reagan, McCain told the delegates that he
understands Latino issues, and will aggressively court their votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won re-election last November with the support of 55 percent
of Hispanic voters in Arizona,'' McCain said. ``I am proud of that.
But I am not satisfied with that number. I want all their votes.
Their support is my honor. They believe in me, and I believe in
them. I want their help to build a better country.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's remarks came in a speech Friday night to the California
Republican Convention, where delegates are still reeling from a
political whipping in November that was attributed in part to the
dramatic flight of Hispanic voters from the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was McCain's first significant political address in a
state that is rich in delegates to the GOP nominating convention
next year and boasts an early primary election on March 7, 2000.
The opportunity to make a mark in California also attracted
candidates Dan Quayle of Arizona, Lamar Alexander, Gary Bauer,
Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes and Bob Smith.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech came just days after California Gov. Pete Wilson
announced he would not run for president. Wilson was resented by
many Hispanics for pushing anti-immigration measures and proposals
that would eliminate bilingual education. Wilson pulled out less
than a month after 25 members of the California Assembly wrote an
open letter urging Bush to enter the race.
</P>
<P>
   The California GOP is facing an identity crisis, as moderates
are making a strong push to wrest control of the party hierarchy
from conservatives. Many feel the party's conservative emphasis on
abortion, homosexuality and immigration is driving away too many
voters who would ordinarily vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The state GOP has lost 11 percent of its statewide registration
since 1992. And while Democratic registration is also down
slightly, that party carried the last two presidential elections in
the state and dominated the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Latino voter registration is increasing dramatically in
California and other Sun Belt states, including Arizona and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   McCain argued that the Republican message would appeal strongly
to Latino voters if divisive issues are avoided.
</P>
<P>
   There is strong support in the Hispanic community for many
conservative issues, he said, from school vouchers and the
anti-abortion movement to national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party that best rewards hard work,'' McCain
declared. ``We are the party that supports small businesses. We are
the party that wants to make parochial education more affordable
for more Americans. We are the party of smaller government. These
are the central principles of the Republican message, but they are
too often drowned out by the politics of division. We're a better
country than that. And we're a better party than that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain closed the speech by telling the story of Roy Benavidez,
the son of a Texas sharecropper, once taunted as a ``dumb
Mexican,'' who grew up to be a decorated Green Beret in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer to live in a bigger place. I prefer to live in a
growing America, as proud of its variety as it is of the ideals
that unite us,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, both McCain and Vice President Al Gore received
awards for their support of bilingual education from the mainstream
Latino organization, the League of United Latin American Citizens,
and he has won more than 50 percent of the Hispanic vote in Arizona
in his past two elections. That puts McCain in a competitive
position for the increasingly important Hispanic vote in California
and helps him defuse what is widely seen as a Bush advantage.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, McCain is also scheduled to receive an award in
Washington from the National Council of La Raza, an organization
that was founded in 1968 and has evolved into a major Latino think
tank and pressure group.
</P>
<P>
   In his campaigns for governor, Bush, who is expected to form an
exploratory committee for president next month, has stressed that
the GOP be inclusive. He aggressively pursued Hispanic voters,
closing some of his television commercials speaking lines in fluent
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   McCain acknowledged Bush and another unannounced candidate,
Elizabeth Dole, in his speech. He promised not to attack Bush, Dole
or any other GOP candidate with negative ads. He said that Bush,
Dole, John Kasich and Quayle were his friends before the campaign,
and that he hopes they will be friends when the campaign is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not engage in personal attacks and the politics of
division. I will not stoop to negative campaigning against fellow
Republicans. I will not run negative attack advertising. I give you
my word on it,'' McCain said. ``Scorched earth Republican primaries
will lead directly to an Al Gore presidency.'' &QL;

MINIMED TEST DEVICE GAINS OK FROM PANEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A government panel has recommended approval of a
blood glucose monitoring system developed by MiniMed Inc. but said
the company must conduct further tests on the product.
</P>
<P>
   The panel of experts unanimously but conditionally recommended
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approve the product, the
first to provide continuous testing of diabetics' blood sugar
levels. The device would make unnecessary the finger pricks
diabetics must now conduct up to three times per day to draw blood
for testing. The FDA is not bound by the panel's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   According to analyst Sam Chang at investment bank Volpe Brown
Whelan, the FDA panel quibbled with the patient population on which
MiniMed tested the device. Chang said the panel asked MiniMed to
test more minorities and Type II diabetics, because the bulk of the
previous subjects were white, Type I sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   Chang said it was unclear whether MiniMed must conduct the tests
before or concurrently with sales of the product.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the FDA does give MiniMed the nod, it will be for use of
the glucose sensor only in a physician office setting. A consumer
device is likely two to three years away, Chang said. ``MiniMed
will use this apparatus as a kind of stepping stone to
later-generation devices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company was all smiles Friday after its meeting with
the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very good news,'' said spokesman Pete Escallier. ``It's
very common for a new product like this to come out with some
conditions. But we've been waiting for this a long time and are
looking forward to implementing our plan.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the FDA panel recommendation came after the close of
trading Friday. MiniMed shares closed down $3 to $85.25, after
falling as low as $79.125 in midday trading. Volume was 419,000
shares, more than four times the 30-day daily average volume.

   INGLEWOOD _ As it always is, the latest installment of the Bill
Bertka era was a short one. But the longtime Lakers assistant
needed just one game to put himself into the NBA record books.
</P>
<P>
   In coaching the Lakers' 115-100 victory over the Clippers on
Thursday, the 71-year-old Bertka became the oldest person to coach
a game in league history, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.
Orlando Magic head coach Chuck Daly, 68, had held the record.
</P>
<P>
   Bertka, who has worked in relative obscurity as a 26-year
assistant coach in the NBA, was pleased with his record for the
ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad. I'll take it!'' a surprised Bertka said after a
hearty laugh.
</P>
<P>
   And if that's his legacy?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   A Lakers assistant coach for 18 years, the personable Bertka
also concluded, for now, his head coaching career with a .667
winning percentage (2-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bertka contends his record should include the other 10 or so
games in which he's subbed as a head coach _ usually when a coach
was sick or ejected _ but the team counts only the three games in
which there was a temporary vacancy, i.e. after someone was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they say 2-1, I guess that's a pretty good
percentage,'' Bertka said. ``I wasn't very good in math.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning serious, Bertka said that although he's never wanted to
be a head coach, he cherished the chance to do it for one night _
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always look at it like it might be my last,'' he said, ``so
it becomes a special moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Kobe Bryant was hampered by back spasms Thursday
night and said he was recovering before Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't bend down,'' Bryant said. ``It's still a little
sore, but I can bend down, move and cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Clippers notes: The Clippers played without two of their big men
Friday, as forward Maurice Taylor nursed a sprained right knee and
Keith Closs nursed an apparent attitude problem.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was injured in the third quarter of Thursday's game
against the Lakers, and is day to day. An MRI performed Friday
morning was negative. Closs did not attend the game, because of
what the team called ``conduct detrimental to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   All things Worm: With Dennis Rodman in Lakers gear and Scottie
Pippen in Houston Rockets pinstripes, the third piece of the
Chicago Bulls triad will reportedly be in-house Sunday too. Michael
Jordan is rumored to be attending as a guest of Jack Nicholson. NBA
commissioner David Stern could also be in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman inherited Nick Van Exel's old locker next to Travis
Knight's, which pushed rookie Ruben Patterson to the other side of
the room. But don't read anything into it _ the staff provided
Rodman with that slot because it was the furthest from other media
focal points, namely the lockers of Shaquille O'Neal, Eddie Jones
and Kobe Bryant, and would create less of a traffic jam.

CALIFORNIANS WAITING TO HEAR BUSH, DOLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The name Bush or Dole has appeared on every GOP
presidential ticket since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   As the state holds its Republican party convention this weekend
in Sacramento, many California Republicans are reluctant to endorse
anyone else until George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole decide whether
to get in the race.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizonans John McCain and Dan Quayle are here anyway,
joining a slew of other contenders who are trying to get a jump in
the Golden State, the nation's largest electoral prize.
</P>
<P>
   Both McCain and Quayle won prime-time slots to address the
delegates, and each will use the time to begin the process of
building campaign networks to compete in California's potentially
decisive March 7, 2000, primary.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, both men are toiling in the long shadows of
Bush and Dole, who aren't even attending the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that everything is on hold until the first tier _
meaning Bush and Dole _ decide where they are going to go and what
they are going to do. Even those right-wing Republicans that you
generally hear from haven't been very vocal,'' says Sherry Bebitch
Jeffe, a senior associate at the School of Politics and Economics
at Claremont Graduate School.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's meaningless. Everything is fluid, and everything is
waiting on Bush and, to a lesser extent, Dole.''
</P>
<P>
   California Republicans are still reeling from the 1998
elections, in which Democrats swept statewide offices, winning back
the governor's mansion. The party hasn't won Ronald Reagan's home
state in a presidential election since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of discontent in the party came last month, when 25
members of the California Assembly wrote an open letter to Bush,
urging him to run for president. The move in part torpedoed a
presidential bid by former Gov. Pete Wilson, who announced earlier
this week that he will not run.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say that leaves an opening not only for Bush and
Dole but for McCain and Quayle as well. Most candidates are making
a push in California this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, no candidates showed up for the state party meetings.
That was largely because the primary was held in June _ long after
the race was decided. The early date makes it the prize of the
campaign in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   McCain in particular has been very candid about wanting to do
well in California. He's made the state a top priority, and has
been popping up all over the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst who appears frequently on
California radio and television stations, said McCain staffers
called her after she applied for media credentials for the
convention this week. They told her McCain would be available for
one-on-one interviews.
</P>
<P>
   And she saw him at a Christmas party in Orange County at the
home of a politico who helped put Reagan in the governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him by accident a couple of times, and I think it's
quite interesting,'' she said. ``He's really aggressive. . . . His
people are taking it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The main thing McCain needs to do is meet people and begin to
explain his positions on issues, Bebitch Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has a lot of name recognition work to do out here. He
might be attractive to the base because of this war-hero record,''
Bebitch Jeffe said. ``The perception is he's not hard-right. That
would make him somewhat attractive to moderates. But I don't think
anybody really knows what his stands on issues are.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, on the other hand, is more of a known commodity. And by
basing his campaign in Phoenix, he's making a statement that
California will be a key state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be a player because he has name recognition,'' Bebitch
Jeffe said. ``I don't think he has much in terms of organization,
and we have yet to see what he can do in terms of fund-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Hodson, director of the Center for California Studies at
California State University, Sacramento, dismisses Quayle's
candidacy, arguing he wasn't a strong candidate on the ticket
either in 1988 or 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Quayle's chances are about as good in California as
they are nationally, which means, in my opinion, not very good,''
Hodson said. One of the problems for Quayle, Hodson said, is the
crowded field. He has lots of competition for votes from the
conservative wing of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of whether California Republicans look at Dan
Quayle as a formidable candidate, and I think the conclusion would
be no.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, Hodson said, ``is intriguing.'' As an Arizonan, he's
far enough away from California to be ``exotic,'' but close enough
to understand Californian and Western issues, Hodson said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that President Bush rarely set foot in the state
after winning the 1988 election, and that Californians resented him
for it. President Clinton has been attuned to that, making more
than 50 trips to the state since he was first elected. Vice
President Al Gore has also spent a lot of time in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Hodson said many California Republicans realize the party needs
to moderate its image to target the state's growing minority
population. Latinos, in particular, are a growing force in the
state politically, winning more political offices at all levels of
government.
</P>
<P>
   California Latinos have become more politically active in the
wake of initiatives on immigration and bilingual education, which
were led by conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   That has alienated Hispanics from voting Republican, despite the
fact that many Latinos agree with the party's conservative social
and economic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Hodson points to the contrast between recent gubernatorial
campaign ads from Wilson and Bush: Wilson's 1994 ad featured
Hispanics flooding across the border; Bush spoke fluent Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Republican that comes into California _ a Pat Buchanan _
who starts talking about we have to have one language, one culture,
one faith, they're going to get chopped up into little pieces,''
Hodson said. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thirty years ago, Erba Food Products was struggling
to get by, making kosher specialties in a tiny 2,000-square-foot
factory within earshot of Yankee Stadium, and its prospects looked
as limited as its main market, New York's dwindling population of
observant German Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Erba is booming. In its 75,000-square-foot plant in the
Canarsie district of Brooklyn, the company's 100-odd employees pack
kosher products from wines to soups to salsas and barbecue sauces,
half for the New York area and half for beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Erba's success is no fluke. Other kinds of manufacturers have
been fleeing cities like New York for decades, chasing lower costs,
lower taxes, lighter regulation and ample elbow room in the suburbs
or the Sun Belt. But in one industrial niche, specialty foods,
urban cores have been incubators for entrepreneurial companies.
With their trend-setting, culturally diverse populations, the
cities help such companies thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to change something, you need to be close to a
large market, so you can understand the potential,'' said William
Max Bauer, Erba's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed lately by the immigration of observant Jews and a renewal
of many secular Jews' interest in cultural traditions, New York
remains the country's largest market for kosher food. But it is
also home to dozens of other ethnic and cultural niche markets.
Specialty food makers of all kinds employ more than 20,000 people
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the growth in the food market, particularly for newer
companies, is in more expensive products. Cities like San
Francisco, Los Angeles and New York, with large populations of
sophisticated consumers, have nurtured luxury baked-goods companies
known as artisan bakeries.
</P>
<P>
   One such business, the Tom Cat Bakery of New York, supplies
bread to more than 400 restaurants in Manhattan. It sees a growing
national market for artisan bakeries' products, but says an urban
home is a vital launching pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a market that values the taste,'' said Noel Comess,
Tom Cat's president. Formerly a chef at the Quilted Giraffe
restaurant, Comess now oversees 140 workers at a sprawling plant in
Queens, just across the East River from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taste that goes out the door here has a big market in New
York,'' he said. ``People here will pay for a better bread, just
like they'll pay for a finer bottle of wine.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of the most successful specialty foods come from city
neighborhoods. Tower Isles Frozen Foods produces Jamaican meat pies
in Brooklyn. Started in the 1960s by two immigrants from Jamaica,
Earl and Beryl Levi, Tower Isles has flourished, first with the
growth of New York's English-speaking Caribbean population, and
later as their products caught on with other New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Another important advantage of big old cities is their marketing
channels. Tower Isles began by selling through a network of small
groceries owned by Jamaican immigrants, and later branched out to
New York's ubiquitous pizzerias. Such tactics require independent
and ethnic stores, and don't work as well in places dominated by
chains, said Grover Nichols, Tower Isles' production and sales
manager. ``It's hard to get your product sold through McDonald's,''
Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar stories are heard around the country. Large-scale
immigration from Southeast Asia has turned Houston, better known
for its ribs and Tex-Mex cuisine, into a major production center
for egg rolls, fortune cookies and Vietnamese specialties.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles Asian immigration has played a big role. Scores
of companies making breads, pastries, tofu and noodles have cropped
up to serve California's growing Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese,
Cambodian and Filipino communities.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the action in the Los Angeles area is in Mexican
foods, exemplified by new companies like El Burrito and growth
spurts by longer-established companies like Juanita's Mexican
Foods. Begun as a fish processor in the 1940s, Juanita's switched
to making menudo, a traditional Mexican tripe soup, and later added
sauces and other soups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market was here,'' said George de la Torre, Juanita's
president and the son of its founder. ``Los Angeles is the biggest
Mexican city in the world after Mexico City. You couldn't find a
better place for selling Mexican food.'' It has also made a good
base for expansion: A decade ago, five-sixths of Juanita's sales
came from California, but today 40 percent of the company's $30
million in annual sales are in out-of-state markets like Phoenix,
Denver and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Erba, too, has built a wide-ranging business on its local base.
Much of the company's sales growth now is overseas, not only in
Israel but also in France, Belgium and Britain, where both Jewish
and Muslim consumers buy its products. ``We started noticing that
Muslims in New York were shopping in the kosher markets and kosher
aisles of supermarkets,'' Bauer said. ``So when we went abroad, we
found Muslims there to buy our product. We knew from New York what
works.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration wants to issue new
standards to protect workers against the sprains, strains, aches
and pains caused by repetitive motions of all types, from punching
a computer keyboard to ripping the guts from carcasses in a beef
slaughterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But the rules will not take effect until late next year at the
earliest. So what should workers do in the meantime if they have
aching backs, crippled fingers, sore wrists or other problems
caused by activities on the job?
</P>
<P>
   Labor union officials and management lawyers agree on the
answers, up to a point. They also agree that just by publicizing
the risks of occupational injuries known as musculoskeletal
disorders, the Labor Department has strengthened the hand of
employees, making it harder for employers to deny the hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of a proposed regulation spawns a new level of
interest and activity long before the regulation has the force of
law,'' said Jeffrey S. Klein, a New York lawyer who advises
companies. ``It will encourage employers to look into this issue
and find out what they should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein said employees should report workplace injuries and
ailments to their supervisors or to their human resources
departments. ``The company becomes aware of a problem only if
people communicate about it,'' said Klein, a member of the labor
relations committee of the United States Chamber of Commerce.
``Specifics are critical to an employer's ability to analyze and
respond to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret M. Seminario, director of occupational safety and
health for the AFL-CIO, agreed that employees should generally
report their symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But caution may be required, she said. ``There may be a cost to
pay for bringing these problems to the employer's attention,'' Ms.
Seminario said. ``The employer may retaliate against the
employee.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers display about as wide a range of responses to
ergonomic issues today as they did to complaints of sexual
harassment 15 years ago. Many employers tend to minimize workers'
complaints, finding the symptoms vague and the evidence of causes
murky. But other companies have worked closely with employees to
redesign jobs and reduce injuries and disability costs.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the Labor Department would require thousands of
companies to duplicate the practices developed by employers like
Perdue Farms and Fieldcrest Cannon, the textile manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Nowell, director of occupational safety and health for
the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, offers
different advice to workers depending on whether they belong to a
union. ``If you're in a union shop, go to your supervisor, get
medical care in or outside the plant,'' she said. ``Talk to the
shop steward. But in a nonunion plant, you can sometimes be fired
for telling a supervisor that you're hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal law prohibits employers from dismissing workers because
they file complaints about conditions that might cause injuries,
but Labor Department officials acknowledge it is often difficult
for workers to take advantage of protections.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Frumin, health and safety director at the Union of
Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, said ``In most
states, it's not against the law to fire or discipline workers
simply because they've reported an injury.'' Therefore, he said,
workers should ask a question before speaking up: ``What happened
to the last people who reported an injury in your workplace?''
</P>
<P>
   Frumin said workers with occupational injuries need to ``plan a
strategy'' and should consider taking these steps:
</P>
<P>
   - Report the injury to your employer.
</P>
<P>
   - Make sure the employer records it in the log of injuries and
illnesses required by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration. Workers have a right to inspect the log; employers
must post it each February.
</P>
<P>
   - Request an evaluation of your job and work station or
equipment to identify hazards that may have contributed to your
disorder. It may be useful to have other employees take part.
</P>
<P>
   - Ask the employer to correct any hazards found. The injured
employee or others with similar problems should take part in
efforts to redesign the job or work station.
</P>
<P>
   - If you go to a doctor, make sure he knows the problem may be
work-related. It may help to provide him with photographs or a
video showing the nature of your work.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has blocked the Labor Department from issuing
ergonomics standards, but the restriction has expired. The U. S.
Chamber of Commerce says the new proposal would tighten what it
calls the ``regulatory chokehold'' on employers.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph A. Dear, the assistant secretary of Labor in charge of
OSHA from late 1993 to early 1997, said employer groups had opposed
ergonomics standards more strenuously than many other OSHA rules.
``They see ergonomics standards as threatening management's ability
to control the production process,'' Dear said. ``They fear that
the government will make them slow down the production line.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear and his successor, Charles N. Jeffress, said companies that
redesign jobs to address workers' concerns often find that injury
rates decline while productivity and employee morale increase. The
government has yet to issue a detailed estimate of how much it
would cost employers to comply with the proposed rules.

 AN OCEAN OF LITTLE FISH WORTH SWALLOWING 
</HEADLINE>
  (For Release Sunday, Feb. 28) (DW) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Insurance is like broccoli. It's good for you, but many people
find it bland.
</P>
<P>
   Still, lots of savvy investors are piling insurance company
stocks into their portfolios as the number of companies peddling
the stuff shrinks. Last year was a record for insurance company
mergers, according to Securities Data, a Newark, N.J., research
firm, with more than $100 billion of transactions completed
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   According to the experts, that trend is almost certain to
continue. Michael Frinquelli, a partner at Renaissance Fund
Advisors, a New York investment fund that focuses on companies that
stand to benefit from consolidation in the industry, took time last
week to look at the dealing, and at who might be next.
</P>
<P>
   Q: People justify banking mergers by saying there are too many
banks. Are there too many insurance companies?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. There are roughly 7,000 licenses to sell one form or
another of insurance in this country. About half of these licensees
are active, operating companies. But the economics favor the
biggest companies.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take auto insurance as an example. Five companies control
60 percent of the business. Then you have another 2,000 or so that
are fighting for the other 40 percent. Slowly but inevitably the
rest has been going to the top five, largely because auto insurance
is a business of scale, and the big companies have lower expense
ratios. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Cost-cutting is a mantra that is recited by managements in
many industries. Why is it so important in insurance?
</P>
<P>
   A. In property and casualty insurance, the business is simply
not growing. The absence of inflation has reduced the need for
insurance. When home values go up, you are insuring the value of
the house. But when that stops happening, the cost of insurance, or
total premiums being brought in, is not going to go up. From the
mid-1960's to the mid-1980's premiums grew about 9 percent a year.
In the 1990's, it has been about 3 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   In life insurance, the important thing is how do you sell the
product. Years ago, life insurance was sold through captive agents.
But now, life insurance is as much about selling a retirement
savings vehicle as it is death protection. With the aging of the
country, there is more interest in saving for retirement than
protecting the family.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, that means you are competing with mutual funds as
much as other insurance companies. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: If banks have their way, they will be able to sell insurance,
too. If Congress goes along, what sort of impact will that have on
the industry?
</P>
<P>
   A: The proposed changes in bank legislation have more to do with
life insurance than property and casualty insurance. If the
legislation ever gets through Congress, there will be major events
in the life insurance business in the year 2000 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   I think banks will fall all over themselves to buy life
insurance companies. But I don't think they will be interested in
property and casualty companies, because it isn't a very attractive
business.
</P>
<P>
   In property and casualty, you have to be willing to say no. And
if you say no to someone on auto insurance, for example, then you
might lose other business.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many more acquisitions will there be? And which companies
have developed the best acquisition strategies?
</P>
<P>
   A: There may be another dozen combinations among the big
companies. But there are a whole slew of smaller companies just
waiting to get picked off. There are literally hundreds of those
that will be acquired over the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   As far as who is being smart about what they are buying, two
Bermuda-based companies, Exel and Ace Ltd., have come up with good
acquisition strategies that add to earnings immediately and add to
their distribution or product platforms either in the United States
or globally. Shares of both companies trade here.
</P>
<P>
   American International Group hasn't done much by way of
acquisitions, but what they have done is brilliant. Their purchase
of SunAmerica was expensive, but it gave them a door into the
retirement savings business in the States. But because they are
global, it allows them to introduce SunAmerica's products to the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there other companies that you expect will be active
acquirers?
</P>
<P>
   A: The other two I would mention are All-State and Hartford
Financial Services. To date, AllState has done nothing in the
acquisition area, and Hartford relatively little. But we keep
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How about targets in the insurance brokerage or reinsurance
businesses?
</P>
<P>
   A: Aon is a pure insurance brokerage play. Marsh &AMP; McLennan has
Putnam Investments, so it does more than just brokerage. But
reinsurance would be a lovely business for banks to get into:
Everest Re is the most obvious candidate left.

<P>
   All three telephones in the apartment office of Cedric Kushner,
the boxing promoter, were ringing off the hook one morning last
week. A crisis had arisen: One of Kushner's fighters was thinking
of backing out of a bout because his mother had become convinced
that demons were intent on attacking her son through
air-conditioning vents. Executives at HBO, the cable network that
was supposed to broadcast the match, were in a high state of
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   But Kushner remained calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a boxer doesn't fight, what am I going to do? Jump out of a
window?'' he asked as he coolly took another sip of Tab.``There
will always be other bouts.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be if you are Cedric Kushner. Kushner promoted 57
fights last year in the United States and Europe, a huge number by
the standards of the industry. Although he doesn't represent
household names like Evander Holyfield or Oscar De La Hoya, he
boasts 8 world champions in his stable of 55 fighters. Few can
match him for sheer tenacity. Kushner says he never turns off his
cell phone because it's always business hours somewhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made some money with good talent, but mostly with
volume,'' said Kushner, who is 49. ``I believe that volume will
lead me to the opportunity to sign the next Evander Holyfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he is setting his sights much higher than that. He
wants nothing less than to restore boxing _ now a scandal-tainted
sport dominated by a handful of flamboyant promoters _ to its glory
days. The crux of his strategy is simple: Win over more fans. He
has created a television program of boxing matches called
``Heavyweight Explosion'' that is broadcast twice a month on
satellite and cable TV, including the MSG Network. He is also
organizing 10 boxing shows for the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner has hired Park Avenue Productions of New York to find
corporate sponsors for his bouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone in the sports marketing and advertising
business can ignore this sport anymore, especially when you look at
a major conglomerate like Time Warner and the major investment that
they have made in the sport,'' said Robert Crawford, Park Avenue
Productions' vice president for sports and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Kushner, a South African grocer's son, dropped out of school in
the sixth grade and came to this country at the age of 21 with no
clear idea of what to do with himself. He worked as a Ferris wheel
operator on the Jersey Shore and as a pool cleaner at a Miami hotel
before finding a niche in rock-and-roll in the late 1970s and early
'80s, promoting concerts by groups like Styx and Fleetwood Mac. He
got hooked on boxing, he said, when he signed his first fighter,
``Irish'' Teddy Mann, who actually was Polish. Kushner won't say
how much he is now worth, but he has offices and homes in Manhattan
and the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as co-promoter of a fight next Saturday in Atlantic City
between David Reid, the only American boxer to win a gold medal in
the 1996 Olympic Games, and Lou Savarese, he is nipping at the
heels of the big boys. He has no illusions about his competition _
``You'd better sharpen your teeth with barbed wire to compete with
the likes of guys like Bob Arum and Don King,'' he says. But he
isn't intimidated by them, either.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Arum, the president of Top Rank Boxing Inc.; King,
the owner of Don King Productions, and the Duva family, the owners
of Main Events, dominate an industry that is governed neither by a
league nor a commission and that is only loosely regulated by state
commissions. With annual revenues of just $500 million, it pales
next to sports like baseball and basketball. But there are
big-money events, like the planned heavyweight fight in Madison
Square Garden between Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, a bout that could
generate $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Kushner's biggest draws are Shane Mosley, the
International Boxing Federation lightweight champion, and Shannon
Briggs and Savarese, a pair of New York area heavyweight
contenders. But he has the inside track at promoting Prince Naseem
Hamed, the flamboyant featherweight from Sheffield, England, who
wows crowds with his gyrating dances to the ring and his front flip
over the top rope.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Kushner comes across as an outsider in the
rough-and-tumble world of American boxing. His measured speech
makes him sound almost like a diplomat. But that doesn't bother
him. ``I'm involved with boxing,'' he said, ``but that doesn't mean
I should be walking around with a Q-tip behind my ear, not being
able to put three words together without cursing.''

WHAT THE CHEFS LIKE, GARDENERS LIKE, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass., Ore., N.M.)  (For release Sunday, Feb. 28) 
(mk) 
 By ROBERT KOURIK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seed catalogs are brimming with new and scrumptious vegetables:
the intense burgundy-red New Red Fire lettuce; Early Moonbeam
watermelon, with a lemon-yellow flesh; the curled red-purple leaves
of the Red Ursa kale, and delicate half-inch Red Currant tomatoes,
to be eaten like grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these distinctive vegetables are entering seed catalogs
in a new way _ from consumer demand driven by what creative chefs
around the country are serving to adventurous diners. Gardeners
tired of the same old flavors or types of vegetables can choose
from many new tastes and selections. A decade ago, most Americans
had never heard of the nutty-flavored arugula, red radicchios, the
mild Asian green mizuna, savory mesclun or Hopi Blue corn. All of
them have found their ways into retail seed packets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to 10 years ago,'' said Renee Shepherd, the owner of
Renee's Garden Seeds in Felton, Calif., ``many new seeds came only
from seed producers and breeders and were displayed at yearly
tours'' given for garden writers and editors and industry
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   This meant that seed companies offered mostly hybrids that they
had tested in various parts of the country and developed by
commercial breeders or the U.S. Agriculture Department.
</P>
<P>
   In the last dozen years or so, premium vegetables, both hybrids
and heirlooms, have entered the seed business in a process starting
with small farmers' offering unusual crops, often organic, to
chefs. When the public becomes excited by the intriguing flavors,
other restaurants, specialty produce distributors and farmers'
markets pick up on the new vegetables, and some of them end up in
the retail seed trade for the entire country to savor. The process
generally takes from four to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   An example is a mesclun salad mixture developed in the mid-1980s
by several individuals, including Doug Gosling when he was the head
gardener for the Farallones Institute Rural Center, a nonprofit
environmental center in Occidental, Calif. Mesclun salad mixtures,
which can now be purchased in farmers' markets and many
supermarkets, probably originated in France and Italy and can
include such greens as arugula, special green- and red-leafed
lettuces, colorful kales, mizuna, wild greens and slightly bitter
chicories and radicchios. The greens are cut quite short, often
less than four inches tall, prewashed, mixed together and sold as a
ready-to-eat salad.
</P>
<P>
   Gosling's mix of 30 or more organically grown varieties of
greens, herbs and edible flowers (an American enhancement) was
selling at wholesale to New York chefs for $15 a pound by 1983.
Now, many seed companies offer packets of simple mesclun salad
mixes (aka cut-and-come-again salads), as well as packets of the
individual ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shepherd attributes the interest in exotic, unusual and
heirloom vegetables to many factors: ``America as a nation does not
have a single dominant food culture; the increase of ethnic groups
in America; the interest Americans have in travel; the availability
of new flavors in restaurants, and the interest Americans now have
in bringing vegetables to the center of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   The farmer-to-restaurant-to-seed-packet process can be speeded
up by tastings attended by specialty growers and chefs, all of whom
have an interest in new vegetables. For example, for six years, an
event called the Sonoma County Chefs' Tasting helped to introduce
chefs from across the country to the unusual produce that farmers
were growing. At the event, growers displayed their specialty
produce, restaurants showed off trend-setting uses of little-known
crops, and chefs spotted new delights for experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Such attempts to link farmers with chefs are sprouting up
nationwide. This year, as in the last two years, the Eastern Native
Seed Conservancy in Great Barrington, Mass., is sponsoring tastings
of nearly 200 varieties of heirloom tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners and chefs can have a direct effect on what seeds are
being offered. ``Consumers and chefs complained so much about the
poor taste of typical oregano, seed companies finally offered
Origanum vulgare heracleoticum for a true Greek oregano,'' said
Rose Marie Nichols McGee, an owner of Nichols Garden Nursery, in
Albany, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   She also gave the example of fresh leaf cilantro (Coriandrum
sativum). Mexican and Chinese restaurants started asking for the
herb, but it would bolt to seed too quickly. The growers talked
with seedsmen about the problem. Seeds were collected from various
parts of the world, and some seeds were found not to bolt so
quickly. They were made available to the growers, and the
restaurants got their cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   All of this feedback from gardeners, farmers and chefs has
generated some tasteful choices from seed companies, like
rich-flavored black Russian tomatoes; frisee, a mild, finely cut
green; flavored basils; red Russian kale; unusual Chinese
eggplants, and golden beets.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Predictions include tomatillos; Cape gooseberries,
sweeter relatives of tomatillos; tomatoes that have great flavor
when ripe but are still green, like Green Stripe and Green Grape,
and mashua, a nasturtium with edible flowers and pale-yellow,
peppery tubers.
</P>
<P>
   And garlic. In Occidental, Calif., Chester Aaron grows more than
80 garlic varieties. Seeds of Change, a mail-order company in Santa
Fe, N.M., is growing 10 of them, including Creole Red, Asian
Tempest and, from the former Soviet republic of Georgia, Purple
Glazer, all for sale starting in April for delivery in fall.

ARIZONA BIBLE WEEK DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By HAL MATTERN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Gov. Jane Hull, declaring that she wants to bring
Arizona residents together, not divide them, said Friday that she
would no longer issue proclamations for Bible Week.
</P>
<P>
   It was just such a proclamation by Hull in November that sparked
an outcry from non-Christian groups and resulted in a lawsuit
against the state by the Arizona Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's decision is likely to put an end to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to issue a proclamation that says that I'm going
to acknowledge . . . Bible Week,'' Hull told ``The Republic.'' ``I
want to bring people together. I don't want to divide them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was certainly, in my mind, no desire to offend any
religious group. I think this is one of those things I'd like to
see resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull's comments surprised ACLU officials because in November,
after the lawsuit was filed in federal court on behalf of three
citizens, she vowed to fight the case vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's change of position was praised Friday by Eleanor
Eisenberg, executive director of the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful,'' Eisenberg said. ``I'm very gratified
that the governor was concerned enough about the proclamation being
divisive that she decided against doing it in the future. It
probably means we can withdraw the lawsuit because that's the
relief we were looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue, however, probably won't go away quite yet. A similar
lawsuit by the ACLU also is pending against Gilbert Mayor Cynthia
Dunham, who also issued a Bible Week proclamation in November.
</P>
<P>
   Gary McCaleb of the American Center for Law and Justice, who is
defending Dunham, said, ``there are negotiations'' under way aimed
at settling the suit, but he wouldn't comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Dunham was out of town Friday and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Bible Week proclamations caused an uproar last fall that
lasted weeks, with opponents saying they violated the
constitutional separation of church and state. Others complained
that the proclamations indicated government support of a particular
religious belief.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Roslyn Silver agreed and issued temporary
injunctions against both proclamations.
</P>
<P>
   The state argued that its proclamation recognized the Bible as
only a cultural and historical document, not primarily as a
religious book. Hull also noted at the time that she routinely
issues proclamations on a variety of topics, some of them involving
religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   But Eisenberg said the state's Bible Week proclamation differed
from others because it ``included a suggestion that people read the
Bible for spiritual guidance. It came pretty darn close to the
government suggesting to us what to read.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's proclamation called the Bible ``the foundational
document of the Judeo-Christian principles upon which our nation
was conceived,'' and ``a constant course of moral and spiritual
guidance for Americans.'' It said National Bible Week has ``helped
to strengthen spiritual understanding throughout our nation by
encouraging personal reading of the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   The wording was provided by the New York-based National Bible
Association, which every year requests every governor and every
mayor to proclaim the week. The association has declared Bible Week
every year since 1941 to garner publicity. Last year, 26 states and
more than 400 cities had proclaimed Bible Week.
</P>
<P>
   Hull said that, although she won't issue any more such
proclamations, she would have no problem ``recognizing individual
good works done by any religious group.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not give up the ability to issue proclamations because
I think they are important to the groups who request them.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg said the ACLU would have to look at the types of
proclamations Hull was referring to, but would have less of a
problem with the state ``recognizing an event without promoting it,
or without making suggestions about following a certain spiritual
path.'' &QL;

THE MODEL TYPES DISCOVER THE CATSKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday Feb. 28)  
(rk) 
 By SUSAN M. KIRSCHBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sean Nutley, a Manhattanite who organizes parties for
Wipe magazine and for Cesar Galindo, a designer, thought he had
found his personal Shangri-La in the Hudson River Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Every weekend for the last two years, Nutley has shed the
leather pants and orange Jean Paul Gaultier shirts he favors in the
city and has put on Levi's and a sweater to tend his garden at a
second home in Stone Ridge, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Then one Saturday night, he was having dinner at the Bear Cafe,
a streamside restaurant with a big fireplace _ very Woodstock, the
town just up the road. In walked Donovan Leitch, the lower
Manhattan scene-maker, along with Kirsty Hume, Amber Valletta and
other supermodels, all puffing fiercely on cigarettes. They stuck
out like a Fendi clutch bag at the farmers' market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's social pollution!'' Nutley exclaimed, recalling the night
last fall that he first realized his upstate hideaway might be
changing, and not for the better in his view. ``I deal with models
and stylists every day, and I'd rather just leave them in the
city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The maple-covered hillsides, cornfields and rural byways of
Ulster County, on the west side of the Hudson about 100 miles north
of New York, have long attracted weekenders from the city, mainly
those who pride themselves on wanting nothing to do with the social
fish bowl of the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   But recently a flashier crowd has been arriving, bringing new
tastes and status symbols that do not always sit right with more
low-key residents. Range Rovers have become an expected rather than
a rare sight. Falafel stands, taco shops and jazz bars have opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've noticed women wearing lipstick, heels and lots of
black,'' Nutley said. ``That's a definite danger sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Leitch, who has posed with Kate Moss for Calvin Klein and sings
with his band, Nancy Boy, at fashion parties, and Ms. Hume, his
wife, a Victoria's Secret model, gave up their city digs to
relocate full time in Woodstock. They are the latest in a wave of
weekenders and transplants from the worlds of fashion and style to
buy property in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Others include Angela Lindvall, a model; Camilla Nickerson, a
senior fashion editor at Vogue; Alexis Borges, a booker at Next
models, and Henri Kessler, a club owner turned film producer.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin West, who chronicles the fashion fabulous for Women's Wear
Daily and W magazine, said, ``Upstate New York is now the place
where the bellwether of the pack goes.'' He recalled a cocktail
party in the Hamptons last summer at which Ulster County was a hot
topic. ``It's cheap right now to buy a farmhouse, and the trickle
has begun,'' he said. ``In two years, it will be a flood.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone Ridge Liquors changed its name to Stone Ridge Wine and
Spirits under a new owner and started selling Jade Mountain Les
Jumeaux from California for $30 a bottle. Emmanuel's Marketplace
now offers 100 cheeses from Europe, pheasant sausages, organic
produce and Greek olives from a barrel. ``In January, we put in a
lobster tank,'' said Jim Phillips, the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Leitch, 31, a son of Donovan, the '60s folk rocker, plans to
concentrate on writing music while his wife, who resembles a
Botticelli angel, explores painting and paganism. ``I won't be
occupying my normal bar stool at Don Hill's anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once a fixture in gossip columns and Manhattan clubs, dubbed an
``It Boy'' in the mid-'90s, Leitch added: ``I was totally immersed
in the whole scene five years ago. But going out is not my No. 1
priority now.''
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the move to his three-bedroom house last
Thanksgiving, he led a New Age drum circle in the woods with 10
pals, including Ione Skye, his sister who is an actress, and Shalom
Harlow, a former host of ``House of Style'' on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Nicholls, a real estate broker who sold Leitch and Ms.
Hume their home, said she had chauffeured around other fashion
industry people looking for property, though she would not identify
them. ``All I know is that I've worked with lots of beautiful women
recently,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the Hamptons or Connecticut, real estate values
are a relative bargain: modest farmhouses sell in the $200,000
range. Weekenders prefer rural homes with privacy and historic
character, but full-time residents prefer houses in town. Special
touches like chicken coops and fireplaces are prized. The average
price of a house bought by weekenders has risen 10 percent in the
last two years, to about $160,000, said Harris Safier, a real
estate broker who owns Westwood Metes &AMP; Bounds, which has three
offices in Ulster County.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Woodstock, a town long associated with unreconstructed
hippies, the most desirable communities include Olive, High Falls,
Stone Ridge (known for its 18th-century Dutch grit-stone houses)
and the region northwest of Woodstock in Greene County, which
includes the ski areas at Hunter and Windham.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nickerson of Vogue and her husband, Neville Wakefield, a
writer, recently built a black slant-roofed house reminiscent of a
chicken coop in West Kill, in Greene County, with sweeping views of
the Catskills. Their guest house is a tepee with heated rocks for
warmth. Their architect, Ross Anderson, also designed Isaac
Mizrahi's apartment and the Bumble and Bumble hair salon in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a 40-minute round trip to get a pint of milk, and the
hills and dales are a protection from the more touristy areas like
Windham,'' Ms. Nickerson said. ``I want it to remain private, a
real retreat, not like the Hamptons, which is a hideous
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But the desire to keep their neck of the woods undiscovered
didn't prevent the couple from displaying the house in a six-page
spread in the January Vogue, in which Ms. Nickerson was pictured
(from behind, in a bikini bottom) taking an outdoor shower.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Nickerson, many of the fashion folk who have found
their way to the area say they have no desire to import a
Hamptons-style social whirl, in which the same players who party
together in Manhattan continue the fun on the weekend. ``We don't
like the Hamptons,'' Leitch said. ``You see the same people from
New York, even those you really don't want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, habits can be hard to break. Leitch said he hoped to
hold ``dress-up nights'' for friends in Woodstock, similar to the
ones he has had in New York, like the recent Bowery Bar party where
guests came in retro ski wear.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Nickerson's friends and house guests, Daryl Kerrigan,
the fashion designer, contends that the region is already too
crowded with the fabulous set. ``In Ulster County, you see people
from New York,'' she said. ``I've run into people at the farmers'
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kerrigan spends weekends at a her house in Wayne County,
Pa., where all she sees is dairy cows and the occasional bald eagle
soaring above the Delaware River.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from Ms. Nickerson and Wakefield's house, Tony Goldman,
who owns the Tiffany Hotel in Miami Beach and the SoHo Kitchen and
Bar on Greene Street in Manhattan, has bought 27 buildings along
Main Street of tiny Maplecrest and is developing the Sugar Maple
Resort.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman envisions a kind of arts camp for grown-ups, with studio
spaces just five minutes from the Hunter Mountain ski area. ``It's
designed to be neither a social scene nor an art scene, but rather
a creative environment to energize people spiritually and
mentally,'' he said. He hopes to open in the summer of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, too, rejects Hamptons style. ``The scene in the
Hamptons is a traffic jam,'' he said. ``There they want to see and
be seen as power players. The people upstate are more comfortable
with themselves.''

   As taxes and property values creep up (the average single-family
home in Ulster rose from $146,543 in 1997 to $152,231 last year,
according the county's Board of Realtors), there is some resentment
of newcomers by longtime residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a concern about how their children won't be able to
remain,'' said Safier, the real estate broker, who has lived in the
county for 22 years. ``There's always some of this conflict with
some of the dyed-in-the-wool locals, people whose families have
been here for generations. Some of them work for the county or
town. However, there are a lot of carpenters and tradespeople who
benefit from the weekend residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Lori Childers, publisher of The Blue Stone Press, a newspaper
that covers High Falls, Stone Ridge, Accord, Rosendale and other
hamlets, said: ``The local population is very diverse and is not
easily split into weekenders, transplants and locals, even though
sometimes when people are angry they throw around these words as
though they meant something definitive. I see many weekenders
trying to find a way to live here as their primary residence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be tensions in a changing and growing
community,'' she said. ``Everyone lives here because they love it.
This brings even the most different types of people together.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas, Mark Baker, a New York night-life promoter who
meditates occasionally at a Tibetan Buddhist monastery, Karma
Triyana Dharmachakra, near Woodstock, visited Henri Kessler's
five-bedroom, five-fireplace farmhouse in Malden-on-Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler, who in the 1980s held court with hard-partying authors
Jay McInerney and Bret Easton Ellis as a club promoter for Area and
Danceteria, bought his property, called Shatamuck, in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm up there, I'm into fixing my house, boating and
taking pilot's lessons,'' said Kessler, the producer of an
independent film, ``Slam,'' which won prizes at the Sundance and
Cannes film festivals last year. ``You can all get together or
never see anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   He sometimes spends weekend afternoons with friends who live
nearby, Dr. Darwin Bushman, a psychiatrist, and his wife, Rika
Okamoto, a principal dancer with the Martha Graham company who is
cast in the title role of Steven Spielberg's forthcoming ``Memoirs
of a Geisha.''
</P>
<P>
   Bushman said he used to live a hedonistic existence and was once
a fixture at Flowers, the model-y restaurant in New York where
Baker was a host.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dated models and led a vacuous life,'' Bushman said. ``But
after years of going out for six hours with nothing to say, I
started to attend arts events in search of a woman of culture and
substance.'' That is how he met Ms. Okamoto.
</P>
<P>
   His renouncing of his once-vacuous life may not have come a
moment too soon. Now, the models are coming to Ulster County. Baker
said he knows about 15 who have bought in the area in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   And Nutley, the party organizer, said: ``I've seen them walking
on the street and speaking their language. They use catch phrases
like `fabulous,' `darling' and `fierce.' Now, I'd rather not talk
to anyone.'' &QL;

<P>
   &UR; TAX SPECIAL  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TAX-POLICY (Washington) _ While the political fight this year
and probably into the 2000 elections will center on _ tax cuts
versus saving Social Security _ there is also a growing focus on
another, older and more fundamental issue. Should tax policy focus
simply on raising the revenue needed to pay for the activities of
government? Or can the tax code be used as an effective instrument
to address the nation's social and economic ills? By Richard W.
Stevenson. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   TAX-SPOUSE (Undated) _ Until recently, proving that an
individual was truly innocent _ that he or she had no knowledge of
the violations of the tax laws and did not benefit from the money
kept from the government _ was virtually impossible. A new law that
took effect in July, however, makes innocent-spouse status easier
to claim. By Michelle Leder. (Moved).
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   TAX-FILING (Undated) _ So eager is the IRS to have us file by
computer that its World Wide Web site (www.irs.ustreas.gov)
provides links to private companies offering electronic filing
services. Only about a quarter of all tax returns will be
electronically filed this year. By Neil Genzlinger. (Moved).

<P>
   TAX-GAIN (Undated) _ Keeping records of stock purchases and
sales and completing the tax forms to report capital gains and
losses is tricky enough for the average investor. But for day
traders, who spend their days flipping stocks, and for a growing
army of other investors who trade often, lured by the bull market
and the ease of trading on line, compliance with tax reporting
rules creates a mountain of paperwork each year. By Carole Gould.

<P>
   GLOBAL-FINANCE (Washington) _ Some analysts say what the world
financial system needs isn't a new design, but better wiring, in
the form of greater communication among market players, governments
and oversight agencies _ if not security guards with PhDs in
international economics. And over the last few months, a plethora
of small-bore fixes have been proposed, everthing from ``exit
taxes'' to make investors think twice about bailing out of troubled
markets to ``early warning systems'' to make them think twice about
the stability of the country where they are parking their money. By
David E. Sanger. (Moved).

STANLEY DANCE, 88, JAZZ CRITIC AND EXPERT ON DUKE ELLINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Dance, a jazz critic, Ellington specialist and record
producer, died on Tuesday at the Remington Club in Rancho Bernardo,
Calif. He was 88 and lived in Vista, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Dance is perhaps best known as a member of Duke Ellington's
close-knit group of friends, and for nearly 70 years was one of
Ellington's main interpreters. They met in 1933 at an Ellington
concert in London, forming a friendship that lasted until
Ellington's death in 1974. Dance delivered the eulogy at
Ellington's funeral at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
</P>
<P>
   During Ellington's trips to England, he was a regular guest in
the Dance family home in Braintree, outside London. Dance met his
wife, Helen, at the office of Ellington's agent, Irving Mills.
After moving to the United States in 1959, Dance traveled regularly
with Ellington, wrote numerous sets of liner notes and essays about
the music and helped Ellington with his autobiography, ``Music Is
My Mistress.''
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the British Army during World War II, Dance
began producing records. In 1958 Felsted records sent him to the
United States to record for it, and he took back sessions that
included dates by Coleman Hawkins, Earl Hines and others. Over the
years he produced record dates for English Columbia, French RCA and
Black Lion records, often with members of the Duke Ellington
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to the United States, he began writing concise,
well-argued essays and reviews for The New York Herald Tribune,
Saturday Review, Jazz Review, Downbeat and other publications. He
also began writing a series of books for Scribners that included
``The World of Swing,'' ``The World of Duke Ellington,'' ``The
World of Count Basie'' and ``The World of Earl Hines,'' along with
biographies of Charlie Barnett and Ellington. He won a Grammy for
his 1963 liner notes for the recording ``The Ellington Era''
(Columbia).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by their children,
Theresa Dance-Bennink of Omemee, Ontario; Rupert Dance of
Hopkinton, N.H.; Francis Dance of Woodbury, Conn., and Maria
Lindley of Carlsbad, Calif.

HONG KONG COURT SAYS RULING WASN'T INTENDED TO CHALLENGE CHINA'S
AUTHORITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 1st. sentence in lede. No other changes.)  (rk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Bending to intense political pressure, Hong Kong's
highest court said Friday that it had not meant to challenge the
authority of the Chinese government in a recent ruling on
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary statement, which came in response to a Hong
Kong government request for ``clarification,'' may heal the most
serious rift with the Chinese authorities since this former British
colony reverted to Chinese rule 20 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But it drew blistering criticism from lawyers and democracy
advocates, who said the court's statement was a surrender that
boded ill for the future of a vigorous and independent legal system
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal ran afoul of Beijing last
month when it ruled that children born in the mainland who have at
least one parent living in Hong Kong have the right to residency
here. Chinese officials said the decision, which superseded Chinese
laws, was a mistake and ``should be rectified.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the court did not alter its ruling Friday, it
reaffirmed that the National People's Congress, China's supreme
legislative body, had authority over Hong Kong. ``The court accepts
that it cannot question that authority,'' said the chief justice,
Andrew Li, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, said the statement
would ``enable all parties concerned to come to a fuller
understanding of the original judgment.'' He added that the court's
clarification demonstrated that ``our system of rule of law is
complete and intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Tung did not say whether he thought the statement would satisfy
Beijing, which did not immediately issue a reaction.
</P>
<P>
   If China overturned the decision, lawyers here said it would
create a constitutional crisis. Under the agreement between Britain
and China _ known as ``one country, two systems'' _ Hong Kong is
supposed to be a semiautonomous region within China with its own
legal system.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Final Appeal tested that proposition by asserting
that China could not pass laws contradicting Hong Kong's
constitution, the Basic Law. The law guarantees residency to
mainland children of Hong Kong parents. But after the handover,
Beijing dissolved the Hong Kong legislature and replaced it with an
appointed body that passed laws making it much tougher for mainland
Chinese to move to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision the court struck down those laws, throwing the
doors open to tens of thousands of mainland Chinese. Even as legal
scholars from Hong Kong and China debate the ruling, hundreds of
mainland residents have poured in to assert their right to live
here.
</P>
<P>
   Several Hong Kong legal experts said the court's ruling needed
no clarification. And some said the statement Friday was little
more than an oath of allegiance to Hong Kong's new sovereign,
dragged out of the court by a government anxious to resolve this
dispute before Beijing forced its hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole process was damaging to the dignity of the court,''
said Margaret Ng, a lawyer and member of the legislature, which now
once again has some elected representatives. ``We are going to pay
a very heavy price in our certainty about the judicial process.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yash Ghai, an expert in constitutional law at the University of
Hong Kong, said he was comforted that the court had not retreated
from its ruling. But he said the Hong Kong government had put the
court in an awkward position, since judges almost never clarify
rulings unless it is in the context of a subsequent case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem that the government has any understanding or
appreciation of the rule of law,'' Ghai said. ``They seem more
willing to deal with China in a political manner and by making
concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   People who attended the hearing Friday said that in presenting
their motion for a clarification, Hong Kong government lawyers said
they understood the decision. But they explained that ``people in
other quarters'' did not understand it, which is why they sought a
clarification.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very fact that the judges agreed to explain themselves is
bad,'' said Martin Lee, a prominent advocate of democracy. ``They
are perceived as having succumbed to political pressure from
Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   But some political analysts said the Hong Kong government had
made a cold calculation: if Beijing were to change the ruling
itself, it would send a worse signal than if the matter were
thrashed out at home. If Hong Kong did not act, Beijing could also
rewrite the Basic Law to narrow the authority of its courts.

KINGS HOLD OFF CHICAGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ With no warning, Hurricane Tim blew into the Windy
City on Friday night, explaining tersely that he was in town to
work, and reacting defiantly when a reporter jokingly asked if a
coaching change was on his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys have a deathwatch,'' Kings president Tim Leiweke said
following the team's crucial 2-1 victory Friday night over the
Chicago Blackhawks before a United Center crowd of 18,364. ``We
don't. We're very patient. Our coaches are going to finish the
year. Our players now know their damn careers are on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Affecting his most strident us-against-the-world stance, Leiweke
also promised that those very players would lift the Kings into a
playoff run that quite possibly would extend into May. About the
only thing he didn't promise was a Stanley Cup, which would require
the Kings to play into June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody will look at themselves in the mirror at the end of
the season,'' Leiweke said. ``You have a deathwatch. We don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain his appearance in Chicago, Leiweke would only
say: ``We had business.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the Kings, and they were fortunate this segment of their
business trip didn't end in disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   They were outplayed the entire night by a Blackhawks team making
its home debut under interim coach Lorne Molleken, but the Kings
survived to record their eighth straight win over Chicago (17-36-8)
and improved to 2-1-1 on their season-long six-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   The victory allowed the Kings (23-32-5) to remain three points
out of a playoff berth with 22 games remaining. The fifth game of
the trip is Sunday afternoon against the Dallas Stars, who are
9-0-6 in the last 15 meetings between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we got the win, and I'll take it,'' coach Larry Robinson
said. ``But I wouldn't like to play that way against Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   The heroes Friday for the Kings were Donald Audette and Rob
Blake, who gave the Kings a 2-0 lead through two periods, and
goalie Jamie Storr, who made 33 saves, including a stop with his
right shoulder on a Todd White penalty shot.
</P>
<P>
   White was awarded the shot when Yanic Perreault was ruled to
have closed his hand on the puck in the crease 1:58 into the third
period, a call strongly disputed by the Kings. Storr made the save
look easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to the top of the circle, and he was showing he wanted
to try a poke check,'' White said. ``He made a great move by not
biting on my fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Storr said: ``I wanted to challenge him.... How many times do
you see a guy take a penalty shot and the goalie stays back in the
net and they score? You've got to create something.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third penalty shot against the Kings this season, the
first against Storr _ and the first that didn't result in a goal.
</P>
<P>
   But the Blackhawks scored 1:11 later, when Steve Duchesne failed
to check ex-King Ed Olczyk, who was left free to Storr's right to
poke in a short cross-ice pass from Tony Amonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a defenseman's job,'' Robinson said, referring to
Duchesne. ``He's got to get position, especially in a big game.
He's got to be a little stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings did just enough to win, and the Blackhawks did just
enough to lose. Chicago was hapless during six minutes on the power
play in the first period, and the Kings converted on two of their
few scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   Blake and Audette, who scored on a power play, have goals in
consecutive games. Wednesday, they produced the third-period goals
that created the opportunity for Luc Robitaille to score the
game-winner in overtime at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's performance by the Kings wasn't nearly as impressive.
But the result of the latest biggest game of the year was the
important part.
</P>

   ``Every game we play is the biggest game of the year,'' Blake
said. ``We got ourselves in this position. We can't take any days
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Leiweke: ``I'm pretty happy with these guys. They showed
some character the last two games.''

HALF OF PONY EXPRESS REACHES PINNACLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a year it's been for the ``other member'' of the Pony
Express.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Eric Dickerson's done all right for himself with his
selection to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but let's talk about
his counterpart in the SMU Mustangs backfield, Craig James.
</P>
<P>
   James had a pretty nice career in the NFL, too, as a running
back for the New England Patriots. He didn't leave it all on the
field, though, rushing through his second career, the sports
broadcasting business, much as he did Southwest Conference
defensive lines in his college days.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old Plano resident crossed into another end zone
recently when CBS picked him to join its ``NFL Today'' studio show
as an analyst for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``For what I've tried to accomplish in broadcasting, it's the
pinnacle,'' James said the other day from his home.
</P>
<P>
   When CBS gave him the good word, James recalled, ``I kind of
went like, `Wow!' It really was a sense of relief because I'd
gotten what I'd wanted. Now, it's up to me to perfect what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   James and former NFL head coach Jerry Glanville will try to
breathe some life into a show that was comatose from the get-go
last season. TV newcomers George Seifert, Brent Jones and Marcus
Allen were overwhelmed by the demands of the pregame program.
Savaged by critics, the threesome was obviously overmatched by
their competitors at Fox, led by Terry Bradshaw.
</P>
<P>
   James is sympathetic toward his ``NFL Today'' predecessors. He
remembers what it was like for him when he took over KRLD radio's
nightly sports talk show in 1991, one of his early gigs in
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first big job, two hours live, with me carrying
it,'' James recalled. ``That little light went on and I spoke for
30 seconds _ and I had no wind! I was scared to death. If I'd had
to go on \RTV\S before tens of millions of people \Rlike rookies
Seifert, Jones and Allen\S . . . I just don't know. Thank God I
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   James learned his role the old-fashioned way: He grew into it
through a succession of local sports broadcasting jobs. He worked
as a color analyst on SMU football after his NFL days, was host to]
a weekly Cowboys show and served as anchor on Channel 4 sports.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he expanded a part-time college football role at ESPN
to full-time status, giving him national exposure. He moved to CBS
two years later, setting up last year's late-season NFL studio
fill-in role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the commitment once I got into the business that I
wouldn't just do games,'' James said. ``I wanted to learn the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, working in all phases of broadcasting, including sales,
production and marketing. He learned much in these areas as
executive producer of ``The Michael Irvin Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If people say I look comfortable up there, that's why,'' he
said. ``Because I know what everybody's trying to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   James has developed a reputation as a straight-talker on the air
in a business populated by speak-no-evil types.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bold enough to speak my mind,'' he explained. ``I don't
straddle the fence. That may be good or bad, but it's an opinion. I
hope that on Monday morning people are talking about something I
said on Sunday. Not that I'm trying to stir the pot. ... I want to
beat them to the thought.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his style, James summarizes, ``I really feel like a guy
in a group of guys sitting at home watching the game. Of course, I
have the privilege of having a microphone. But I can share their
sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   James insists that his new, high profile won't alter his style
or attitude. He isn't worried about his Fox competitors, either.
Playing golf last week with Bradshaw, James told his new opponent,
``I'm coming after that Fox money.''
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, though . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect them,'' James said. ``I watched their show and I
enjoy them. But they've got their team and we've go ours. I'm not
worried. As a player, if I worried too much about the Jets or
Dolphins or whoever we were playing that week, I couldn't do my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his running-back days, James said he has only fond
thoughts of Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still very close to Eric,'' James said. ``I'm going to try
like heck to get to Canton \Rfor the Hall of Fame induction
ceremony\S. He is really a genuine, likable person. He's been
misunderstood, and I think he recognizes why.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, James jokes, ``If he were really a good guy, he'd
loan me a few thousand yards \Rto pad my NFL stats\S. I mean, when
we were 18, I carried him.'' nn

PROS AND CONS OF PREDETERMINED SITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the next week, the NCAA will gather the bids to determine
which sites to use for the first and second rounds of the women's
NCAA Tournament. This is the way it has been done since the
tournament began in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   However, the NCAA is considering going to predetermined sites
beginning next year for the first two rounds, much the same way it
does for the regionals and Final Four and in the men's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to go through the management council, the board of
directors and the economic committee before it's approved,'' said
Tricia Burke, vice president of the NCAA women's basketball
championships. ``The final vote would be in August.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the 16 schools selected to play host to a first-round
site have approximately five days to prepare for the event. If the
proposal to use predetermined sites is approved, a city and
university would have one year to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   The process would be similar to the regional bid process _
schools submit their proposals, covering facilities, hotels and
other amenities, and are awarded the games approximately one year
before the tournament begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think it's a good concept; whether it's the right time
or not it's hard to know,'' Burke said. ``With such large parties,
it would make it easier for traveling and allow for better
planning. It would also allow us to try to get into larger markets
with larger fan bases.''
</P>
<P>
   The downside is smaller, successful programs with good fan bases
such as Stephen F. Austin might find it difficult to play host to
first-round games. Nacogdoches has a population of 33,500 and has
less hotel space than an Austin or Springfield, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter whether I like it or not, it's coming,'' SFA
coach Royce Chadwick said. ``I would hate to see them not look at
fan base as a criterion. I know we can fill our place up for
tournament games; we have before. Whereas if you have tournament
games in a major metropolitan area, they might not fill it.''
</P>
<P>
   With this system, for example, Texas could be named a host, but
its team could play its first-round games at the University of
Virginia, or Duke or some other predetermined site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general thought is that it provides a better chance for
everyone in the tournament to play at a neutral site,'' Chadwick
said. ``When you are playing on a neutral floor you would like it
to be as even as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's tournament went through a similar growth in the 1980s
and perhaps this step is inevitable.
LSU HOOP DREAMS
</P>
<P>
   Katrina Hibbert steps to the foul line and tries to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana State is tied with Tennessee 70-70 with seconds left
and Hibbert is at the line for a one-and-one.
</P>
<P>
   That's a dream, though. After all, who could possibly expect the
Lady Tigers to be tied with then top-ranked Tennessee late in the
game?
</P>
<P>
   Hibbert did, and so did her teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was consuming my thoughts all the time,'' Hibbert
said. ``During practice, we would joke about being tied and being
at the line with the game on the line. But we were just kidding
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee wasn't laughing Sunday when Hibbert's three-point play
with 11.7 seconds remaining put LSU ahead for good in a 72-69
victory. The loss snapped Tennessee's 31-game conference winning
streak. The Lady Vols had not lost a regular-season conference game
since Feb. 24, 1997, when LSU defeated them, 83-78.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a confidence lift for our whole team,'' said
Hibbert, who scored a team-high 18 points and handed out eight
assists. ``We didn't even get to shake their hands after the game
because people started running all over the court.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Hibbert was besieged with media requests and
phone calls from well-wishers. It's quite a different experience
than the Australian expected when she arrived in Baton Rouge more
than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here I never really knew the whole tradition of
Tennessee,'' Hibbert said. ``I didn't realize how big they were or
how good this conference is.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonder if she knows now?
</P>
<P>
   PACKING THE PIT
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 9,700 tickets have been sold for New Mexico's game
tomorrow against Utah. If the Lobos (20-5, 11-2 Western Athletic
Conference) defeat the Utes, it will clinch a tie for first place
in the Pacific Division for UNM's first regular-season title.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the program lost all-time leading scorer Abby
Garchek from last season's NCAA Tournament team, this season's 20
victories are all the more remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   A big crowd at UNM's ``Pit'' for a women's basketball game is
not.
</P>
<P>
   Through 13 home games this season, the Lobos women have drawn
82,419 fans, an average of 6,340, which ranks 10th among NCAA
Division I schools. With the two games this week closing out the
regular season, New Mexico also is on track to become only the
sixth women's basketball team to go over 100,000 in attendance this
season.
</P>
<P>
   This season, attendance is up by an average of 1,330 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a combination of being successful last year and
finding new fans, and then this year being successful again,''
coach Don Flanagan said. He has led UNM to three consecutive
winning seasons, including a school-record 26 victories last season
when the Lobos won the Western Athletic Conference tournament. ``We
don't want to be a one-time phenom. We want to be consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   ALL-AMERICA TIME
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if these names appear on first-team
All-America lists:
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Canty, Alabama: The best player you've never heard of
averages 20 points and 7.3 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie White-McCarty, Purdue: She will leave West Lafayette
as the program's second all-time leading scorer and maybe with a
national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Chamique Holdsclaw, Tennessee: Arguably the game's most dominant
player since Sheryl Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Hammon, Colorado State: The quintessential gym rat ... and
shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Dalma Ivanyi, Florida International: Because she plays for a
small program in a relatively obscure conference, she probably
won't make it on as many lists as Memphis guard Tamika Whitmore or
Tennessee's Tamika Catchings, but she leads the nation in assists.
</P>
<P>
   Coach of the year: Bonnie Henrickson, Virginia Tech. Unless you
scoured the Top 25 every week you wouldn't know the No. 9 Hokies
(25-1) are having their best season ever.
MOVE OVER, MJ
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of players and coaches have been inducted into the
Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., but only 14 players
have had their lockers enshrined. Achieving that is a separate
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan's is there. And now, so is Rebecca Lobo's and
Swoopes'.
</P>
<P>
   The gold medalists and NCAA champions will both have their
lockers dedicated at the Hall of Fame today.
GAMES TO WATCH
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow
</P>
<P>
   SEC Tournament title game, 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky and Ole Miss desperately need strong finishes and an
appearance by either one of the three in this game probably pushes
them into the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Monday
</P>
<P>
   ACC tournament title game, 7 p.m. Don't be stunned if top-seed
Duke ``isn't/ here.
</P>
<P>
   Big Ten tournament title game, 6:30 p.m. No. 1 Purdue has little
to gain and is primed for an upset here before the real tournament
begins.

RECORD FIELD EXPECTED DESPITE CELEBRITY SNOW-IN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLES CLINES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Some of the celebrity luster of today's
Cowtown Marathon races was lost yesterday when four-time world
cross country champion Lynn Jennings was unable to get a flight out
of snowed-in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings was scheduled to run in the women's 10K. But officials
are still expecting a record field.
</P>
<P>
   Entries for the marathon, marathon relays, 10K and 5K had
reached 11,519 early yesterday. The marathon saw an increase over
recent years with 734 entries; the 10K has 4,989, and the 5K 5,263.
Last year, 1,300 registered on race day, which boosted the count to
a record 13,905.
</P>
<P>
   Weather usually is a factor for race-day registration, and
forecasts call for no rain and temperatures in the 50s at race
time.
</P>
<P>
   The women's 10K will still have Jody Hawkins of Blooming Grove,
last year's Avon National 10K winner and winner of the recent
Austin Half Marathon. Hawkins will be wearing bib number 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity runners in the men's 5K include former Olympian and
two-time world cross country champion Craig Virgin and former
Southwest Conference 5,000-meter indoor champion Paul Stoneham of
Fort Worth. Virgin will be wearing No. 15001, and Stoneham will
wear 2002.

RANGERS' RODRIGUEZ SHOWS UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Catcher Ivan Rodriguez acknowledged what
Rangers management questioned _ his leadership qualities _ after
the seven-time All-Star reported to camp eight days late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself a leader,'' Rodriguez said yesterday
afternoon upon his arrival to the Rangers' Charlotte County Stadium
complex. ``I consider myself just another player who's got a job to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers do not share his view.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Rangers rewarded Rodriguez with a five-year
contract extension through the 2002 season worth $42 million and
place greater expectations upon a:
</P>
<P>
   27-year-old catcher with 71/2 years of major-league service;
</P>
<P>
   player earning $8 million this season;
</P>
<P>
   seven-time All-Star;
</P>
<P>
   seven-time Gold Glove Award recipient;
</P>
<P>
   four-time .300 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like for him to be a leader,'' Rangers general manager
Doug Melvin said, ``but that's his choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez expressed being ``upset'' and ``a little bit down''
after learning of comments about his tardiness attributed to
Rangers owner Tom Hicks, president Tom Schieffer and Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they've been saying those things,'' Rodriguez
said. ``They know what I've been doing. I've talked to the manager
\RJohnny Oates\S three or four times already. Now, I don't know if
Doug Melvin or Tom Hicks knows what I've been doing, but Johnny
Oates knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez remained in Puerto Rico to finish closing on a home he
purchased for his father and completing plans for his youth
baseball academy, which is scheduled to begin operations in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, I've spent eight years in this organization,''
Rodriguez said. ``Do they remember the seven years that I reported
a week early?''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also took offense to Melvin's comparison to Hall of
Fame catcher Johnny Bench. Melvin wondered how often Bench reported
to camp late.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to make the Hall of Fame by getting here two
weeks early,'' Rodriguez countered.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin's response: ``Well, I guess it's just a matter of who's
upset more then: him with me for the Hall of Fame comment or me
with him for not being here on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Responsibility and accountability remain the heart of the matter
from the Rangers' view.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boss was asking me a lot of questions that I had to answer
for Pudge that I couldn't answer at times,'' Melvin said. ``I can't
change my stance that I'm disappointed that he wasn't in camp.
We've gone out and spent a lot of money for a winning team.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez downplayed his responsibility to teammates, all of
whom reported on time except for right fielder Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't be mad because I'm one week late,'' Rodriguez said.
``They've got to do what they've got to do. I'll do what I've got
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rodriguez ruffled some feathers, Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard whispers that some guys are upset,'' Melvin said,
``but they're not going to stand up and say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin, who did not speak to Rodriguez yesterday, could not
answer whether the two would talk privately about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows where my office is,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Would Melvin initiate a discussion?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't anticipate I'll do that,'' Melvin said, ``and I know
where he is _ as of today.''

ROLE PLAYERS SHINE IN HULL-LESS OUTING
</HEADLINE>

By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Who needs Brett Hull, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' role players filled the hole last night left by a
hamstring injury to Hull as the Stars outgunned a dangerous
Pittsburgh Penguins' team, 6-4, before the 25th consecutive sellout
crowd of 16,928 at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   With Hull and his team-leading 26 goals expected to be out of
the lineup two to three weeks, the Stars picked it up at every
level and came at the Penguins in waves. Dave Reid stepped up to
the second line and contributed a goal and an assist. Pat Verbeek
had a goal and two assists and the third line of Tony Hrkac, Mike
Keane and Grant Marshall chipped in the game-winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, every line contributed to a hard forechecking
performance, allowing the Stars to get 35 shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's who we are and that's who we've been,'' Verbeek said.
``This is no different than before. We had key guys out last year
and we did the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   This, however, is the first extended streak in the 1998-99
season in which the Stars have had to deal with injuries _ Hull,
Darryl Sydor and Brian Skrudland are out of the lineup. But Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said the bad breaks could actually turn into
golden opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, long haul, it's good for us,'' Hitchcock said. Hull
``has forced us to look in the mirror offensively, and we've got to
have contributions throughout the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars got just that from the opening puck drop as Verbeek,
fresh off an early scrum with Penguins goalie Tom Barrasso, whipped
in a slap shot from the right wing for a 1-0 lead at the 7:23 mark.
The Stars were all over the Penguins early and tallied 19 shots in
the first period alone, but the Stars trailed after 20 minutes when
the Penguins received a breakaway goal from Martin Straka and a
deflection goal off of a Stars' defenseman among their five
first-period shots.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 2-1, the Stars came out invigorated in the second
period and seized the lead. Jamie Langenbrunner blasted in a slap
shot from the right side at the 58-second mark and Sergei Zubov
played pinball with a shot from the wing off a Penguins defenseman
to make it 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Then the race was on. Reid made it 4-2 when he picked up a
rebound goal off a Joe Nieuwendyk shot at the 9:50 mark, but the
Penguins again answered with goals from Straka and Kip Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars appeared to be losing momentum with the 4-4 tie, but
didn't back down. Marshall forced a turnover at his own blue line
and pushed the puck forward to Keane. Keane passed back to Marshall
and Marshall then went cross-ice to set up Hrkac for the
game-winner, the first point for Hrkac in the past 10 games. Mike
Modano then added an empty-netter after Stars goalie Ed Belfour
held off a furious flurry from the Penguins, including a Jaromir
Jagr swipe at what appeared to be a certain game-tying goal with
6:10 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the list of clutch plays stretched to Belfour,
Derian Hatcher, Guy Carbonneau, Richard Matvichuk, Shawn Chambers,
Craig Ludwig and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   But most noticeable was the offensive push on a night that
Hitchcock said beforehand the Stars might have to win 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a player playing as good as Hull was, it's easy
to just let someone else do it,'' Hitchcock said of his role
players falling into an offensive lull in the past two weeks. ``But
everybody is going to have to contribute because you never know
when you're going to be the hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the Stars had 19 of them.

MAVERICKS SNOOZE THROUGH ROAD LOSS

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ To sum up just how boring last night's game
between the Mavericks and Utah Jazz was, one fan was stretched out
asleep over three chairs behind the Dallas bench at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   It drew laughter from the Mavericks, who also were asleep at the
wheel. The Mavericks never woke up, losing, 80-65, before a sellout
crowd of 19,911 at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Mavericks' fourth game in five days, and their
second in two nights. And once it was clear the Jazz was going to
maintain its 20-something lead for the balance of the game,
Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson decided to rest most of
his regulars.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the Mavericks will be playing their third game in
as many nights when they host the Sacramento Kings at 7 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a game that I thought we had to be careful of,'' Nelson
said. ``I don't want to burn up all of the starters and then not
have anything left for tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I used this as a game to hope that our reserves could keep
it close, and have a chance to insert the starters back in. But
when that didn't happen, I made the decision that I'm just going to
let the reserves play it out and hope that they can get a good feel
to their game.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting shooting guard Michael Finley played just 12 minutes
and was 1-of-3 from the field and finished with two points. Shawn
Bradley, who played collegiately at Brigham Young University in
nearby Provo, only played 11 minutes and collected two points,
three fouls and four rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Starting point guard Steve Nash put in nine minutes of work and
finished with two points on 1-of-2 shooting. And starting power
forward A.C. Green played seven minutes and scored four points.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' starters combined to score only 15 points and
went 6-of-18 from the field. Rookie Dirk Nowitzki, starting in
place of the injured Cedric Ceballos, led the Mavericks starters
with five points and played a game-high 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was somewhat disappointed because he had about three
dozen members of his family and friends at the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people made some long drives to come up here and support
me,'' Bradley said. ``But they'll love me whether I played or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos is out six to eight weeks after fracturing his right
wrist Thursday night on a flagrant foul by Denver's Loren Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   Garbage time came very early last night. With Karl Malone (13
points, 10 rebounds) bulling his way inside, and Bryon Russell (17
points) bombing away from the outside, Utah built a 52-34 lead at
the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz lead got as high as 26 (68-42) in the third quarter.
The Mavericks (4-10) converted only 2-of-15 shots in the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks are 0-18 all-time at the Delta Center, and have
lost their past 23 games in Salt Lake City. They shot 29.4 percent
from the floor and were outrebounded, 53-41.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pack led the Mavericks with a game-high 18 points, and
Samaki Walker had 11 points and eight rebounds in 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Finley called the game ``weird,'' but added that he understands
why Nelson did what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``His philosophy basically was to pretty much save the guys that
were getting major minutes for \Rtonight\S, being that we have to
compete in a back-to-back-to-back,'' Finley said. ``So I
understand.''

MARINE PILOT DENIES NEGLIGENCE IN COLLISION WITH CABLES THAT LED TO
20 DEATHS
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS grafs 5 &AMP; 7 to add info. on schedule for court martial.)   (fe) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. _ In the elongated instant that Capt. Richard
J. Ashby saw the gondola cables in the path of his Marine jet, it
was too late to change course enough to miss, yet the collision
still seemed an eternity away, he testified on Friday at his
court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden there's this cable, basically,'' he said.
Approaching the cables at more than 800 feet a second was, Ashby
said, ``like you turned around real quick and somebody threw a
baseball at your head.'' He said he thought he was about to die.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, 20 other people died after the Marine Corps jet,
hurtling at 600 miles an hour on a training mission, sliced through
a pair of cables and sent the gondola plunging more than 300 feet
to the floor of a valley near Cavalese in the Italian Alps. The
accident infuriated many Italians and for a time frayed relations
between the United States and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., was on the stand for almost
five hours in his first testimony about the accident, which
occurred on Feb. 3, 1998. Talking to the jury that will decide
whether he was criminally negligent and could sentence him to 200
years in prison, he was by turns combative, tearful, frank and
profane.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony, which began and ended Friday, came near the end
of a court-martial that has followed an uneven course, with the
prosecution pointing out that the crew was flying the EA-6B Prowler
faster than the rules allowed, hitting a cable at 360 feet above
the ground while ostensibly trying to maintain an attitude of 1,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has argued that there were deficiencies in training
and numerous communications failings within the Marine Corps and
between the Marines and Air Force, which was supposed to provide
information for the Marine squadrons rotating through Aviano Air
Base, Italy. In addition, it maintains the Defense Department's
National Imagery and Mapping Agency supplied a chart that did not
show the 30-year-old cableway.
</P>
<P>
   The defense is expected to wrap up its case on Monday, and the
judge, Lt. Col. Robert Nunley, has said the case could go to the
jury by next Wednesday. If convicted, Ashby could get 10 years in
prison for each of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Enduring a hard-driving cross-examination Friday afternoon, the
pilot asserted that he had followed the rules as he understood them
and never intended to violate speed or altitude restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Captain Ashby, this is not a case about intent; it's a case
about negligence,'' retorted one of the prosecutors, Maj. Daniel J.
Daugherty. ``Were you simply negligent, Captain Ashby, or were you
recklessly negligent, doing something you weren't qualified to do,
putting your aircraft into a 2,400 foot-per-minute descent and
flying as low as you could and as fast as you could?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither, sir,'' Ashby replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people died because you did that,'' Daugherty said. But
the judge ruled that the last statement was not a question and told
the eight Marine officers who make up the jury to disregard it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Prowlers are electronic warfare planes and carry no weapons
except for missiles that blow up radar installations on the ground.
Pilots are taught to fly low to evade radar detection and fast so
that if they have to climb rapidly, they can trade speed for
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Ashby described the crash itself. ``I thought, this
wire is going to go through the canopy, and I thought, the flash
before my eyes, we're dead, that's what I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he tried to push the plane's nose down and to squat down
in his seat _ impossible since he was strapped it _ so the cable
would not slice through the canopy and hit him in the head. It was
too late to have much effect, but he said, ``it seemed like it
lasted forever to me, timewise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of braced for this big crash,'' he said, but
``basically nothing happened at that point.'' The impact, he said,
bringing a palm down unto the railing around the witness box,
``there's a thump like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until hours later, at a military hospital where he
and the three other crew members had been taken, that he knew
anyone had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, after we finished our checkups, getting our blood
pulled, as we finished, they put us in this central waiting room in
the hospital,'' he said. ``When they turned the TV off, that's when
I got kind of, really worried. I mean I was already worried; that's
when I became aware there was probably something more to this they
don't want us to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby's civilian lawyer, Frank Spinner, asked him how he reacted
when the squadron commander, Col. Richard Muegge, told the crew
what had happened. The pilot's answer was not audible as his voice
broke with emotion. (Muegge was later relieved of command because
of lapses in connection with the accident.)
</P>
<P>
   At other times, Ashby sparred vigorously with Daugherty. ``I'm
accepting responsibility, sir,'' the captain said. But he added,
``There's a difference between responsibility and criminal
responsibly, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine going to jail, can you?'' Daugherty said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I can't,'' Ashby responded.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Daugherty said Ashby should have been ready
for uncharted cables because he was based at Whidbey Island, a
naval base in Washington, and flew in the Cascade mountains, where
loggers often set up cables that are not on charts.
</P>
<P>
   And he goaded Ashby about why the pilot had not seen a church in
the valley where he was supposed to make a turn. Daugherty asked if
the map makers did not put churches on the chart for navigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why they mark them, sir; I'd rather have them
mark the cableway than the church,''the accused pilot replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby also described rocking his plane's wings as he entered the
valley, to get a view of the river below. That would have the
effect of confusing his radar altimeter, according to defense
witnesses. The radar altimeter looks straight down from the plane's
belly and measures the distance to the ground; it never sounded an
alarm that the plane was too low, crew members have testified. But
it could be confused if the plane dipped one wing and the belly
pointed to a distant mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty pointed out that while the crew believed the minimum
altitude allowed was 1,000 feet, investigators found a document in
the cockpit showing it was 2,000. But Ashby asserted that he and
his navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, had planned the flight from
information in a folder that they were told had all the relevant
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We flew it professionally, we briefed it professionally, and
we did it to the best of our abilities,'' he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer is to be tried separately on similar charges. Charges
have been dropped against two other captains, who were in the rear
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby also described having flown the training route once
before, during a previous six-month deployment to Aviano, where the
Prowler squadrons provided electronic jamming over Bosnia. On the
earlier occasion, he said, he had found himself cornered by
mountains and clouds; moving too slowly to climb, he was saved only
because the valley was large enough for him to turn the jet around.
</P>
<P>
   On the same flight, his jet came upon a parasailer. ``All of a
sudden to the right and above me I could see the whites of his
eyes,'' he said. Ashby said he turned the plane to an open path and
looked at his navigator in dismay and relief after the near miss.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby said that he and other crew members had been careful to
warn the rest of the squadron about the presence of parasailers in
the area; there was no such warning about the cables, he said.

HE'S GOT NEW ROUTINE DOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ There's Pacific Standard Time. And there's Dennis
Time.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, we're all on Dennis Time.
</P>
<P>
   6:05 p.m.: New Laker Dennis Rodman shows up late for his first
day of work. Or early, depending on how you set your watch.
</P>
<P>
   Players are supposed to be in the locker room at 6 for a 7:35
game. But a team official, adopting the lenient ``Dennis is
Dennis'' tone set by Lakers owner Jerry Buss in the middle of the
contract talk, says he thought Rodman might pull an old stunt by
blowing in at 7 and throwing on his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   6:10: Rodman crosses the locker room so quickly, ducking into
the back room containing the exercise equipment, that some of the
reporters here to chronicle his debut miss this historic moment.
</P>
<P>
   A photographer who got a good look at him in the tunnel from the
street offers a description: Rodman was modestly attired in a dull
green wool hat, T-shirt, baggy pants and sensible shoes. OK, we
made up the part about the sensible shoes.
</P>
<P>
   He drove a white Corvette and was accompanied by bodyguards
named Wendell Williams and Kelly Davis.
</P>
<P>
   6:15: It's noted that Rodman has been assigned the locker-room
cubicle that belonged to recent Lakers bad boy Nick Van Exel.
Significance? It's closest to the back door.
</P>
<P>
   6:15{: It's noted that Rodman's uniform, hanging on a hook,
bears a purple No. 73.
</P>
<P>
   73? Because he's won !ital!seven straight rebounding titles and
!ital!three straight championship rings. And because if you turn it
around you get his age. Anyway, that's what he said the other day
between curses and boo-hoos.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman is believed to be the first Laker to wear a
non-traditional number since George Mikan was No. 99. End of
Rodman-Mikan comparison.
</P>
<P>
   6:20: Shaquille O'Neal, lacing up his sneakers three cubicles
down the row from Rodman's, on being teammates with a former enemy:
``He does his thing. I do my thing. I'm not going to go out with
him at night or nothin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the nightclubs might not be big enough for the both of
them.
</P>
<P>
   6:25: Reporters outnumber players 2-1 in the small locker room.
All find amusement in the efforts of Kurt Rambis, named the Lakers'
head coach earlier in the evening, to choose the right socks. Match
the shoes? Match the slacks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta match the pants,'' Eddie Jones decrees. Rambis had
matched the shoes.
</P>
<P>
   So there's the first change from the Del Harris era.
Coach-player fashion banter.
</P>
<P>
   6:30: In case reporters on the Rodman beat didn't pick up on
this, those pre-game one-on-one interviews we'd all been hoping for
will not materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will never see him in the locker room,'' Lakers publicist
John Black says. ``I guarantee it.'' He means during press visiting
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Post-game interviews should not be expected either. But Rodman
has indicated he's willing to talk to reporters if they're willing
to trail him from the locker room to the tunnel. A Chicago writer
describes scenes like those from the Bulls days as ``moving
scrums.''
</P>
<P>
   6:35: Shaq, who has been on a stationary bike in the back,
emerges dripping with sweat. Looking around the locker room, he
asks a group of writers, ``Dennis here yet?''
</P>
<P>
   Shaq grins. Actually Dennis is in the back, doing ``lat work,''
the PR man says.
</P>
<P>
   7:15: Rodman, in middle of a parade of Lakers, takes the court
for final warmups. Fans, half-filling the Forum, have trouble
picking him out because his hair is a sedate purple, green and
gray.
</P>
<P>
   One of those might be his natural color. Who can remember?
</P>
<P>
   7:38: The ``Star Spangled Banner'' is performed by an unplugged
group called Dakota Moon. Rodman is the Laker who's swaying to the
beat.
</P>
<P>
   7:40: Ten photographers surround Rodman as trainer Gary Vitti
tapes his wrists.
</P>
<P>
   7:44: The game begins with Rodman on the bench between
straight-laced Derek Fisher and Sean Rooks. Rodman is the Laker
who's taking his shoes off.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a protest, as it was in his San Antonio days. He's
putting on ankle wraps.
</P>
<P>
   7:47: The scoreboard video screen shows Rodman on the bench.
Fans erupt. Rodman shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   7:54: The moment we've been waiting the whole month for: ``For
the Lakers, No. 73 ...'' Standing ovation as Rodman strips off his
warmups _ that's all this time _ and enters the game.
</P>
<P>
   7:55: Rodman's immediate impact is all positive: On the first
Lakers possession with him on the floor, he keeps alive a rebound
that O'Neal grabs and puts back; on the next, he grabs a rebound
and passes to O'Neal for a layup and an 18-11 lead.
</P>
<P>
   8:15: Rodman ends his first, six-minute stint with one rebound,
one assist, one missed shot, two fouls and the Lakers lead in
energy. Of course, he's had six weeks longer than the rest of them
to store it up.
</P>
<P>
   8:16: The air goes out of the crowd and the team, which messes
up two fast breaks.
</P>
<P>
   8:17: Fans in the rafters start a ``We want Rodman'' chant.
</P>
<P>
   8:50: Halftime: Lakers 49-35.
</P>
<P>
   9:20: Rodman, having started the second half, goes out after
grabbing his sixth rebound in 16 minutes of action to tie O'Neal
and Travis Knight for the team high late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   9:21: ``We want Rodman'' again.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they do. They don't have a moving scrum in their
immediate future. &QL;

KNICKS CANNOT KEEP UP WITH THE RESTED CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The magic potion the Knicks have been using to combat
the frantic National Basketball Association schedule as well as the
league's young and athletic teams was diluted by weariness Friday
night at the Fleet Center.
</P>
<P>
   The sapped Knicks, taking on the form of drooping, day-old party
balloons, had nothing left after their dramatic overtime victory
over Minnesota just a night earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Only vaguely familiar, they practically crawled to get through
the fourth quarter against a fresh Boston Celtics team. The Knicks
mustered a franchise-low 9 points for a fourth quarter since the
inception of the shot clock and made themselves easy victims for
the Celtics, who put them away, 94-80, to end the Knicks' four-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation for this one was simple. But Coach Jeff Van
Gundy did not appear after the game to explain the obvious: this
team had nothing left in reserve. Instead, Van Gundy was with team
doctors because of a stomach flu that left him patrolling the
sideline with chills and sweats.
 &UR; el2 &LR;  Van Gundy is expected to continue on with the team to Detroit
_ the Knicks play the Pistons on Sunday afternoon _ but on Friday
night the assistant coach Don Chaney was assigned the task of
discussing a game in which the Knicks were outrebounded, 46-38, and
turned the ball over a season-high 22 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overtime game we had took its toll on us,'' Chaney said.
``The Celtics were the wrong team to play against after that
overtime game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics press and cause chaos by Coach Rick Pitino's design.
You need energy and snap decisions to combat that. Those qualities
just were not there Friday the way they were against the
Timberwolves. The crispness of Charlie Ward was replaced by a
six-turnover effort. The energy of Patrick Ewing, who scored 17
points on a 7-of-15 performance, withered in the end. And there was
no need for a big-time game-winner from Allan Houston (20 points)
because the Knicks were down by 18 midway through a miserable
fourth quarter, during which they shot 3 of 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 9 points,'' Ewing said. ``We were just too drained to
make it up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's no way to keep up with Boston's prized rookie, Paul
Pierce (24 points), or their budding superstar Antoine Walker (24
points) or the driving Kenny Anderson (16 points). For the second
night in a row, the Knicks' league-best defense was threatened and
challenged. This time, they were not up to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no excuse for us tonight,'' Ewing said. ``They
outhustled us, and outplayed us. They dominated on the boards.
Being tired is no excuse. I was tired, but we have to find a way to
suck it up and win.''
</P>
<P>
   But how do you suck up pain? Larry Johnson was just a fragment
of the player who scored 22 points a night earlier. The nagging
tendinitis in his knee made him almost immobile on the court as he
scored 3 points on a 1-of-5 shooting effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel too good tonight,'' Johnson said. ``It just
didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was frozen, as was the Knicks' celebrated defense. This
has become a pattern for the Knicks when they hit the road. They
allowed Orlando 93 points, Cleveland 98 and now the Celtics 94.
</P>
<P>
   Not one person could be singled out for the Knicks' problems
Friday night. But although Houston hit 6 of 12 shots, his lethargy
on defense was especially noticeable. Often he seemed to have gum
on his shoes as the perimeter-shooting Pierce, who was 5 of 11 from
3-point range, lined up beyond the arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just shoot it when I'm open,'' Pierce said. ``I was sort of
feeling it, and I said, `What the hey, shoot it.' We just wanted to
speed up the tempo. If we wore them down in the third and fourth
quarter, we'd win.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan worked. For most of the night, the Knicks were just
trying to counter every Celtic run with one of their own until they
hit the wall in a dreadful fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ugly and pathetic,'' Chris Childs said. ``We were
outplayed, outquicked, outworked. A loss. Is that enough?''
</P>
<P>
   More than enough.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   There were wounded Knicks all around the locker room after the
game, with CHARLIE WARD the most visibly injured. He took a poke in
the eye from Boston's ANTOINE WALKER two minutes into the fourth
quarter. It resulted in a swollen, blood-shot right eye for Ward.
He had an ice pack on it after the game, but said he expected to
play in Detroit on Sunday. ... Coach JEFF VAN GUNDY had a strong
opinion concerning the sarcastic remark by Minnesota point guard
STEPHON MARBURY about Ward. After Ward scored 18 points and handed
out 13 assists against the Timberwolves in the Knicks' overtime
victory Thursday night, Marbury said: ``If he can play like that
every night, you all won't need a point guard. But what are the
chances?'' In defense of Ward, Van Gundy called Marbury's comment
``a cheap shot.'' Ward said he did not care what Marbury's opinion
was. ... The Celtics were without guard RON MERCER (ankle). ...
MARCUS CAMBY may never live down his actions at UMass as far as the
Boston crowd is concerned. Camby, whose entanglement with agents
while he was in college led to National Collegiate Athletic
Association sanctions, was booed mightily by the Fleet Center
crowd. Camby responded to the ill will well, though. He finished
with six blocked shots. &QL;

GRETZKY OUT WITH INJURY: RANGERS WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After struggling in pain for most of the season,
Wayne Gretzky finally could play no longer.
</P>
<P>
   Since joining the Rangers in 1996, Gretzky had never missed a
game, but Friday night he watched his teammates defeat the Phoenix
Coyotes, 3-0, from a luxury box high above the ice at Madison
Square Garden. The Great One has a bulging disk in his neck that
will sideline him for at least two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, who had played in 223 consecutive games, had been
treating the injury to a cervical disk with aspirin and heat for
months. But after a magnetic resonance imaging test on Wednesday,
it was decided that complete rest was the best solution.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers moved up Manny Malhotra and Marc Savard into
prominent roles and brought up 21-year-old Christian Dube to fill
Gretzky's spot on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the next generation for the Rangers, it passed the
first test, with help on both ends from veterans like John MacLean,
Adam Graves, Brian Leetch and Mike Richter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Malhotra scored the first goal and MacLean scored twice, then
left the game in the hands of the defense. Lacking Gretzky's
glitter, the Rangers put together a complete effort that has been a
rarity this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We addressed the loss of Wayne,'' Rangers Coach John Muckler
said. ``It's a major loss. We talked about what we had to do to
compensate. People had to step up. We asked for overachievers and
we had some tonight.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Malhotra scored his seventh goal of the season when he took a
perfect lead pass from Niklas Sundstrom and broke in alone on
Phoenix goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, slipping a backhand around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really good just to be able to know that I was going to
be in the game regularly,'' Malhotra said. ``I tried not to look at
it as a pressure situation. Obviously, I want to be able to perform
well to prove to coach that I was able to take that spot whenever a
situation like this would arise. I was happy to get out there and
get the bugs out early.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adam Graves added: ``I thought that we got contributions from
everyone and the key goal was the first scored by Manny, and it
couldn't happen to a better guy. You look through the lines and I
thought you couldn't pick one guy that didn't have a good game for
us. For us to be successful, that's what we need.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MacLean made the score 2-0 thanks to the work of Graves, who
carried the puck the length of the ice, moving from left to right.
His shot was stopped, but both Coyote defensemen chased him, and
after he recovered the puck behind the net, he found MacLean, who
scored with 18 seconds to play in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean scored again on a power play at 2 minutes 43 seconds of
the second period, deflecting in a wrist shot from the left point
by Leetch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the lead in hand early, the Rangers turned to a more
concentrated defensive effort. Richter played flawlessly in net,
and Leetch and Ulf Samuelsson repeatedly frustrated the Coyotes'
scoring attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that everybody dug down a little deeper, took less
chances,'' said Richter, who had 25 saves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Gretzky came at a time when the Rangers could hardly
afford another injury. They are already without Todd Harvey, Jeff
Beukeboom and Peter Popovic, and have begun a three-game homestand
that will also include games against Philadelphia and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in uncomfortable pain right now where I couldn't play if I
wanted to,'' Gretzky said before the game. ``I tried to play as
hard as I could and for as long as I could. Finally, I couldn't
play any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been periodically complaining of tremendous stiffness in
my neck and some light pain in my back over the last three or four
months.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Gretzky and the Rangers' president, Neil Smith,
team physicians said surgery would not be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something further, surgery or further complications, are not
even an issue at this time,'' Smith said. After 10 days of complete
rest, Smith said, Gretzky will be re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the injury would influence his decision to return next
year, Gretzky insisted, ``No, no, I'm a young 38.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gretzky, it was a disappointing end to his consecutive-game
streak. ``It was nice, because I worked hard and I prepared hard in
the summertime to be ready,'' Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've loved playing here. How can you not get excited to come
to this rink and play in this situation? Every night was fun for
me. Obviously, there have been some tough times, a couple times
that I was injured. I don't think I continued to play because of
the streak. I continued to play because I felt like if I could
freeze it, I could still play and contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I'm disappointed and I'm still a little bit sore,
but I'm not by any means panicking and not overly nervous about the
situation. Back in '92, I went through a real serious situation
with my thoracic disk. That was a much more serious situation and I
was able to come back. I expect to be hopefully up and skating in
three or four weeks and playing for this hockey team.'' &QL;

LAKERS WIN WITH RODMAN, RAMBIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Years hence, historians will no doubt debate whose
era this was. There will be the staunch Rambis camp and the equally
stubborn Rodman camp, each clinging to its own interpretation of
events and hairstyle trends.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night, as the Lakers unveiled a new coach and a new
power forward, the only debate was over how many dozen points would
comprise the Lakers' margin of rout over the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   And a 99-83 victory seemed like a good enough start for both
head coach Kurt Rambis and Designated Worm, Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever's era it is, the Lakers are 1-0 in it.
</P>
<P>
   In punishing their soon-to-be arena roommates for the second
straight night, the Lakers continued a steady counterturn out of
the three-game tailspin that got coach Del Harris fired two days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And the Clippers? The Chris Ford-Michael Olowokandi era is
heading for its own brand of notoriety, having lost 11 straight to
begin the season. The Clippers are six losses away from matching
Miami's 1988 record for worst start to a season.
</P>
<P>
   A week of chaos at last came to a close for the Lakers. They
introduced Rodman on Wednesday, Rambis 2{ hours before game time,
and had a double-digit lead 10{ minutes into the game, with the
17,505 in attendance already hoarse from pregame introductions.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis' impact will take time to evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's? Easy. The Lakers won by 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   In Rodman's first 17 minutes of play, the Lakers outscored the
the Clippers by 19. He finished with 11 rebounds, six assists and
zero points on two loudly cheered field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he was much the same Rodman that helped the Chicago
Bulls to their last three NBA championships, looking every bit as
tenacious as he did in Game 6 of the Finals _ his most recent game
_ last June.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout, the reported offseason of partying, his lack of a
team to practice with the last six weeks, none of it seemed to
affect Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   The hair, by the way, was a muddy mix of browns and blacks and
possibly some purple and yellow, maybe a bit of blue ... well, it
was hard to tell. In transition, as Rodman put it.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant led the Lakers' non-rebounding category, scoring a
game-high 22 points. Shaquille O'Neal added 19.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Rodman had wrapped his arms around a single loose
ball, he was earning high marks from his new team. To start with,
he learned the playbook in less than an hour. And by the time he
joined his first shootaround, Rodman was giving teammates pointers
on defending the pick-and-roll.
</P>
<P>
   And oh yeah, he plays a little defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings to the game a defensive and rebounding addition that
we welcome,'' assistant coach Bill Bertka said. And then he gave
the Worm perhaps the highest praise one can give a new Laker: a
comparison to the legends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's another aspect he brings to the team that I like,''
Bertka said. ``I think back to when Wilt (Chamberlain) came to the
team, I think back to when Kareem came to the Lakers. They brought
a mental toughness and a professionalism to the franchise, that
professionalism and that toughness is infectious. Dennis loves to
play basketball, and I think that for our team is going to be a
very helpful aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman wasted little time showing his hustle, and the Lakers
wasted no time in capitalizing on it.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Rod-man'' chants came with 6:11 left in the first quarter,
and Rambis obliged nine seconds later, the Worm greeted by a
standing ovation as he replaced Travis Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty seconds later, O'Neal dunked after an offensive
possession that was saved when Rodman grabbed a loose ball.
Thirty-six seconds after that, Rodman grabbed a Bryant miss and fed
O'Neal for a layup and 3-point play.

RAMBO IS NO JOKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The new Lakers era was ushered in with laughter
Friday. The encouraging thing was it came a solid 60 minutes
!ital!before!off! the first Dennis Rodman sighting of the night.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Mitch Kupchak walked into a room in the Forum
and solemnly introduced Kurt Rambis as Del Harris' replacement.
Nobody uttered a word in the next second so Rambis piped up. ``No
applause?'' he deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   It was a joke that asserted that his promotion was not.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, humor comes in handy when you look as unassuming as
Clark Kent and are surrounded by Supermen. The truth is, Rambis can
poke fun at himself but his egg-on-his-face guise belies a
hard-boiled center.
</P>
<P>
   In his four-plus seasons as an assistant on Harris' staff, no
one escaped Rambis' wrath, not even superstar center Shaquille
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   That's significant because opposing power forwards apparently
aren't the only ones apt to tiptoe around the 7-foot-1 manchild.
Harris handled O'Neal like a Fabrege egg and look where it got him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I do something bad,'' O'Neal said, ``I expect to be
cussed out, not talked to in a politically correct way.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of political correctness, the race card regrettably was
raised by some almost as soon as Rambis' promotion was made
official to explain why the deck was stacked against the Lakers
assistant who lost out on the job. It's true, Larry Drew is
African-American. As for the rest of it, ``race had absolutely
nothing to do with this decision,'' Kupchak asserted (Drew, for his
part, let his class show through by interrupting Rambis' press
conference to offer his congratulations).
</P>
<P>
   To be conversant in Lakers' history is to be inclined to believe
Kupchak. When head coach Mike Dunleavy left the Lakers for
Milwaukee after the 1992 season, one of his assistants, Randy
Pfund, was named to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Pfund won favor for his fealty, having spurned a head-coaching
offer from the Sacramento Kings and an assistant's job under his
old boss, Pat Riley, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Rambis, 40, recently had dismissed coaching overtures
from the Kings and the Clippers. At the first opportunity, the
Lakers front office returned his loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak even tried to give Rambis a little extra breathing room
by stating that the Lakers absolutely, positively won't enter into
conversations with any other coaching candidates.
</P>
<P>
   At least until the season's end.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that a head-coaching position in the NBA is about as
secure as an unlocked car on an L.A. street. There are a couple
other salient reasons to wonder whether the Lakers have done Rambis
a good or bad turn.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to read the fine print on the pretty
purple-and-gold package to know all the ingredients are all there
for a meltdown: sky-high expectations, a slow start, a shortened
season and an unseasoned head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the best situation to be working under,'' Rambis
readily admitted.
</P>
<P>
   But _ and on the first day of a new job, there's always one of
those _ ``I relish a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if not for his penchant for hurdling obstacles, Rambis'
NBA career would have been shorter than Rodman's attention span. He
made a star-studded Lakers team in 1981-82 as an unheralded free
agent and was a fixture there for the next six seasons, providing
hustle, defense, rebounding and toughness. To his opponents, he was
Kurt Rambo.
</P>
<P>
   ``His role was to rough people up and I hated him because he did
his role too well,'' said O'Neal, who played against Rambis as a
rookie. ``You don't know much about him, you see his long hair and
those ugly-ass glasses and you think he's one of those beach cats.
He had a lot of heart, though.''
</P>
<P>
   On the way to winning four NBA championships with the Lakers,
Rambis was learning a lot that he'll be able to draw on these next
few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always helped my teammates to play hard,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   The task before him now is to get his players to hustle on both
ends of the court. Somehow Rambis has got to find a way to convince
them that a solid defensive effort is the key to starting the
fast-break offense that trips the lights in Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to keep re-emphasizing all the things we've
been trying to accomplish for years now,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis' way of reminding his players of their shortcomings is as
subtle as the man himself. He doesn't scream at people, he shames
them into shaping up. Pity the poor guard, for example, who
persists in putting up 3-pointers down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt has a tendency, if you continually make a mistake, of
making you feel bad,'' said guard Kobe Bryant. ``He has the ability
to be a friend of yours. At the same time, he's not worried about
getting on your bad side.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's the players who should be worried about getting on
Rambis' bad side. As far as changes go, that's a good start.

   ANAHEIM -- The Mighty Ducks are No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Not in the NHL standings, of course. But when it comes to the
power play no team is better than Anaheim, which defeated San Jose
3-1 in the third period before 17,174 at the Pond on the strength
of two more power play goals.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long and physical game that featured a Brian Marchment
cross-check on Steve Rucchin in the first three minutes of play,
after the NHL's favorite villain had run over Teemu Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Anaheim's special teams that were the difference as
they have been so many times this year.
</P>
<P>
   While Rucchin and Selanne scored on the power play to give the
Ducks 63 power play goals in 60 games, Anaheim easily killed off a
four-minute penalty in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's big chance came just six seconds after Rucchin scored
his 22nd goal of the year at 11:35, re-directing Fredrik Olausson's
pass. The Sharks, however, could manage only one harmless 60-footer
on their power play.
</P>
<P>
   A Ducks' victory would move them one game over .500 (26-25-9),
keep them in fifth place, three points ahead of St. Louis, and move
them seven points ahead of seventh-place San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks were on the verge of falling to 0-4-2 since winning
four consecutive games on their recent 10-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   A Anaheim win would be its ninth of the month -- a new club
record -- and give them 18 points in February -- tying the record
for points in a month.
</P>
<P>
   But the game certainly wasn't an easy one. Rucchin had his bell
rung when he was high-sticked by Marchment after coming to the aid
of Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin, who broke his nose on Feb. 17 against Edmonton,
finished the first period, but played only two shifts in the second
period before retiring for the night.
</P>
<P>
   The game was played at break-neck paace in the opening period
with both teams more than willing to throw their weight around as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks took a 1-0 lead when Olausson slipped down from the
right point and fired a hard pass into the slot that Rucchin
deflected past San Jose goalie Mike Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   The energy expended in the first 20 minutes seemed to take its
toll on the Ducks in the second period, especially after Vernon
stacked his pads and stopped Jeff Nielsen's shot on a two-on-break
with Paul Kariya less than two minutes into the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks took control of the game and got the got the tying on
their third excellent scoring chance. Alex Korolyuk picked up his
seventh goal of the year at 5:52 when he fought off Pavel Trnka and
converted Mike Ricci's centering pass.
</P>
<P>
   But San Jose's Magnus Ragnarsson then made the mistake of
holding Kariya's stick and giving the Ducks another power play
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim swarmed all around the Sharks net. Vernon kept the Ducks
at bay from almost two minutes, but Selanne and Kariya combined to
the give them a 2-1 lead at 10:21. Selanne, while skating
backwards, deflected Kariya's point shot into Vernon's pads, picked
up the rebound and scored his 33rd goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks appeared to have tied the game less than two minutes
later when Joe Murphy shoved a rebound past Guy Hebert, but the
goal was waved off when it was ruled that Patrick Marleau's skate
was in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding off that good break and the momentum change provided by
the power play, Anaheim took a 3-1 lead at 15:40.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne took the puck away from Ragnarsson and put a cross-ice
pass on the stick of Travis Green, who beat Vernon with a perfect
shot into the right corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Cullen nearly gave the Ducks a 4-1 lead 19 seconds later,
but his shot bounced off the left post.

CRUSADING SCIENTIST GLENN SEABORG DIES  &HT;      
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ Glenn Seaborg, the prodigiously talented
co-discoverer of plutonium, tireless advocate of nuclear arms
control, policy adviser to nine presidents, and longtime faculty
leader at the University of California at Berkeley, died Thursday
night at his home in Lafayette after a long illness. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Felled by a stroke last August in New York, where he was being
honored by the American Chemical Society, Seaborg was flown back to
the Bay Area and hospitalized in Berkeley. But when hope for his
recovery failed last Tuesday, he was brought home to Lafayette
where he lived with his wife of more than 56 years, Helen Griggs
Seaborg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Seaborg was a true giant of the 20th century, a legend in
the annals of scientific discovery,'' said Charles Shank, director
of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory where Seaborg had worked for
almost his entire career. ``For his service to science, to
education and to our nation, we honor Dr. Seaborg's distinguished
lifetime and will forever treasure his contributions to our
institutions and to our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Few scientists in this century have played as significant a role
in the issues of war and peace as Seaborg. With his deep, resonant
voice and towering frame _ he was 6 feet 3 inches tall _ Seaborg
was a familiar figure for decades around the globe, from Berkeley
and Washington to Moscow and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Theodore Seaborg was born on April 19, 1912, in Ishpeming,
Mich., where he learned to speak Swedish from his immigrant mother
before he spoke English. When the family moved to Southgate in
Southern California, the young, impoverished Seaborg went to high
school in Watts, worked his way through UCLA and graduated with a
degree in chemistry in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved physics foremost,'' he recalled much later with a
typical wry grin, ``but I studied chemistry because chemists could
find jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The young chemist went to Berkeley as a graduate student and
quickly found himself in competition with his fellow students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, surrounded by dazzlingly bright students,'' he recalled,
``I was uncertain I could make the grade. But taking heart in
Edison's dictum that genius is 99 percent perspiration, I
discovered a pedestrian secret of success. I could work harder than
most of them.''
</P>
<P>
   He could also form strong friendships with scientists like
Ernest O. Lawrence and J. Robert Oppenheimer, and after
successfully completing advanced research in nuclear chemistry at
the Berkeley radiation lab, he received his doctorate there in
1937.
</P>
<P>
   Seaborg's work on radioactive isotopes won him his first fame.
In 1940, he and physicist Edwin McMillan discovered plutonium,
which earned the two Berkeley researchers the Nobel Prize in
Chemistry in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   With World War II under way, Seaborg joined the secret Manhattan
Project to develop the atomic bomb. He served at the University of
Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory, where he led the team
developing chemical processes for large-scale plutonium production.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is most famous for his role in discovering the
explosive ingredient of atomic weapons, Seaborg opposed the use of
the bomb against Japan as World War II neared its end. Joining in a
report by other Manhattan Project scientists, he urged that the
weapon first be exploded in a ``barren'' desert or on an
uninhabited island. The scientists had hoped that the demonstration
of the bomb's horrific potential for death and devastation _
witnessed by U.N. representatives _ would persuade the Japanese to
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   But the scientists' appeal was ignored and on Aug. 9, 1945, a
U.S. B-29 bomber dropped a plutonium-fueled bomb on Nagasaki,
destroying the city and killing an estimated 70,000 Japanese
civilians _ and effectively ending the war.
</P>
<P>
   Seaborg was to continue his concerns over the buildup of atomic
weapons for the rest of his life, even though he felt forced by the
Cold War to support development of the hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   In his tireless efforts to stem the nuclear arms race during the
1950s, he played a major background role in U.S. negotiations with
the Soviets that resulted in the breakthrough limited nuclear test
ban treaty of 1963. It barred nuclear weapons testing in the
atmosphere, underwater and in outer space. Seaborg was in the
delegation to Moscow for the treaty signing.
</P>
<P>
   Later he became a powerful advocate for what became the 1996
comprehensive treaty to end all nuclear weapons tests everywhere _
a treaty now signed, but not yet ratified, by the Russian
Federation and the United States, and by 150 other nations of whom
eight have already ratified it.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Seaborg returned to Berkeley to become a
professor of chemistry in 1946. An avid football fan since his
youth, he also became the Berkeley faculty representative to the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   He was named chancellor of the Berkeley campus in 1958. Besides
supervising academic activities, he reveled in his support of every
team the school could field: basketball, baseball, water polo and,
of course, football (Cal played in the 1959 Rose Bowl with Seaborg
cheering the team on).
</P>
<P>
   Those were also years of scientific breakthroughs for Seaborg
and his colleagues as they discovered a host of hitherto unknown
``transuranic'' elements heavier than uranium. Those new elements,
far beyond uranium in the periodic table of the elements, added an
entire new series of ``actinides'' to the table and revised forever
the classic table first devised in 1869 by the Russian chemist
Dmitri Mendeleev.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their radioactivity, several of the transuranic
elements are now widely used in medicine, while an isotope of
plutonium itself provides the power and heat for many
interplanetary spacecraft, including the Cassini mission now on its
way to Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 16 known transuranic elements that Seaborg identified
has been named seaborgium, while others, like berkelium,
californium, fermium and nielsborium are named for places and
people associated with nuclear discoveries. Altogether, Seaborg and
his colleagues discovered 10 of the transuranics, of which
plutonium was the first.
</P>
<P>
   But even earlier in his career, he and colleagues John J.
Livingood, Emilio Segre and Margaret Melhase discovered eight
radioactive isotopes of more common elements, including iodine-131
and cobalt-60, that are crucial in the diagnosis and treatment of
cancer and other diseases. In recollections written later, Seaborg
noted that the iodine isotope was used successfully in treating
thyroid disorders in his own mother as well as in former President
George Bush and Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud of my work that has proven to be such a benefit to
society,'' he wrote of the medical applications of his discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Seaborg's energy and interests in important
causes never seemed to flag.
</P>
<P>
   He served many American presidents in many capacities. He began
by becoming a member of presidential advisory committees on atomic
energy and on science in the Truman and Eisenhower administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in January of 1961, Seaborg received a phone call from
President John F. Kennedy asking him to take the chairmanship of
the Atomic Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I would think it through,'' Seaborg recalled saying,
and Kennedy replied, ``Take your time. I'll call you tomorrow
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaborg agreed to a two-year term but stayed for 101/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Berkeley in 1971 to become university professor
of chemistry, a distinguished title that made him in effect a
professor at all UC campuses. He also became associate director at
large of what is now the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a
post he retained until his death.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had left Washington, presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy
Carter, Ronald Reagan and Bush all frequently called on Seaborg for
advice on issues involving science, education and nuclear policy.
</P>
<P>
   But although he advised Reagan, Seaborg was outspoken in his
opposition to Reagan's ``Star Wars'' program for space-based
anti-ballistic missile weaponry. He expressed his opinions about
the ``surreal nature'' of the Reagan administration in published
letters to newspapers as well as in the Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Needless secrecy generated by exaggerated national security
policies _ especially in the Reagan years _ was another of
Seaborg's sources of outrage. During his years as chairman of the
Atomic Energy Commission _ whose functions were later assumed by
the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission _
Seaborg detailed all his work in his daily journal but was
scrupulous in having every entry reviewed and cleared. When he left
the AEC in 1971 his journals were officially declassified, and he
carried them home.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, however, security agents came to Seaborg's
home in Lafayette in what he called an ``arbitrary and capricious''
effort to ``sanitize'' his personal papers. In an episode he called
``utterly ridiculous,'' the censors blotted out words, paragraphs
and entire documents that had already been declassified, Seaborg
wrote in an angry account in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of education reform was another of Seaborg's
compelling interests. In 1959, as a member of President Dwight
Eisenhower's Science Advisory Committee, he stated that ``basic
research and the education of scientists go best together as
inseparable functions of universities.''
</P>
<P>
   Much earlier, at a public ceremony in a Chattanooga, Tenn., high
school, Seaborg was talking of his scientific discoveries and the
importance of education with local students. With great pleasure he
wrote in his journal that night: ``A high school student asked me,
`When you were doing that work, did you know you were going to make
that discovery?' When I said `No,' he responded with, `Oh, you mean
you were just piddling around?' I then replied, `I guess that's
about the best definition of science yet.'''
</P>
<P>
   To encourage the best in science education, Seaborg helped found
the Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley 30 years ago. The hall is
located high on the hill above what is now the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory but was known simply as the Radiation Lab when
he was working on plutonium there at the age of 28. The hall is at
once a science museum with varied programs for school children and
a world-renowned training facility for science teachers. Seaborg
served as the hall's director from 1982 to 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Although Seaborg's relations with Reagan were strained at best,
he did serve on the President's National Commission on Excellence
in Education and helped word the widely quoted conclusion of its
final 1983 report, called ``A Nation at Risk.'' The conclusion
declared:
</P>
<P>
   ``If an unfriendly power had attempted to impose on America the
mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well
have viewed it as an act of war. As it stands, we have allowed this
to happen to ourselves. We have even squandered the gains in
achievement made in the wake of the Sputnik challenge. Moreover, we
have dismantled essential support systems which helped make those
gains possible. We have, in effect, been committing an act of
unthinking, unilateral educational disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaborg was there when the report was presented to Reagan. Years
later, the Berkeley advocate for education reform recalled, sadly:
``We succeeded in drawing almost unprecedented attention from
educators, parents, public and press. (but) Incidentally, President
Reagan used the occasion to advocate voluntary prayer in schools,
and tuition tax credits, and abolishing the Department of Education
... ''
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, Seaborg chaired the California Department of
Education's Academic Standards Commission whose final report called
for rigorous performance standards for students through high
school. The report was approved unanimously by the state Board of
Education, although its science standards have been assailed by
many of the nation's leading scientists who claim it unduly
emphasizes rote learning rather than ``inquiry-based'' science
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the report was issued last October, however, Seaborg
was too ill to defend it.
</P>
<P>
   During his long career, Seaborg received eight honorary degrees
and served as president of both the American Association for the
Advancement of Science and the American Chemical Society.
</P>
<P>
   The Seaborgs were married in 1942 and had six children. Seaborg
is survived by his wife, by their sons David of Walnut Creek, John
Eric of Free Union, Va., and Stephen of La Mesa, Calif.; and by
their daughters, Dianne Seaborg of Lafayette and Lynn Seaborg Cobb
of Grand Junction, Colo. Their first child, Peter Glenn Seaborg,
died in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

NEWS ANALYSIS:   GUATEMALAN COMMISSION'S REPORT IS SEARING
INDICTMENT ON MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to correct coding.)  (rk) 
 By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The language was harsh, the country's emotional, cathartic
response even stronger. A nine-volume report issued by a truth
commission on Thursday that blamed the Guatemalan military for the
deaths of nearly 200,000 people in their 36-year civil war
surprised nearly everyone with the bluntness and severity of its
judgments and recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   For the human rights advocates and victims' relatives who had
long feared an official whitewash, that was a most gratifying
result.
</P>
<P>
   But for the high command of the Guatemalan military and their
civilian allies, who had for years sought to gut and impede the
commission and its work, the outcome was ominous, a shock that
weakens their political standing and leaves them open to
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Especially important was the commission's conclusion that from
1981 to 1983, ``agents of the state committed acts of genocide
against groups of the Mayan people.''
</P>
<P>
   The destruction of more than 400 Indian villages at that time
and the slaughter of their inhabitants, the commission also
determined, ``came about with the knowledge, or by order, of the
highest military authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a finding provides an avenue to file criminal charges
against top military and other government officials who thought
that they would escape prosecution, thanks to an amnesty that the
Guatemalan Congress approved in December 1996. That measure,
condemned by human rights groups, forbids the prosecution of anyone
who committed political offenses in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Genocide, however, was a crime that does not fall under the
amnesty, because it is not considered a political offense. As the
commission report put it, ``the aggressive, racist and extremely
cruel nature'' of the military's depredations in the countryside
``resulted in the extermination of defenseless Mayan communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The most egregious offender, the report makes clear without
condemning him by name, was Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, who as head of
the government from March 1982 to mid-1983 pursued a scorched-earth
policy.
</P>
<P>
   After the British detained Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile in the
fall, calls in Guatemala for Rios Montt to be held accountable for
his administration's actions mounted, even though he is apparently
protected by amnesties approved in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the truth commission, formally the Commission
for Historical Clarification, was intended to be ineffectual. The
only way that the military would agree to its establishment at all,
back in 1994 during negotiations on the topic, was on the condition
that the final report not name or blame specific individuals for
violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
   But when the commission began operations in 1997, just after the
signing of the comprehensive peace settlement that ended the war,
the government, which still had military officers in place as
advisers to President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen and running the
intelligence service, provided virtually no financial support. In a
further effort to make the commission ineffectual, its
investigators were initially told that they had six months to
prepare their report.
</P>
<P>
   But donations from foreign sources, primarily the U.S. Agency
for International Development, allowed the commission and its
German director, Christian Tomuschat, to open regional offices and
cast a much wider net. The huge volume of material gathered enabled
investigators, much to the annoyance of the military, to extend the
mandate for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   It is still too early to tell how Guatemala as a society will
respond to the judgments, some of which had never been uttered in
public before.
</P>
<P>
   This is a presidential election year, and the issues are certain
to be debated on the campaign trail, undoubtedly to the discomfort
of Rios Montt's Guatemalan Republican Front, which narrowly lost
the presidency in a runoff four years ago and thinks that its
chances this time are just as good.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 amnesty and peace agreement do permit individuals to
bring charges against military officers or guerrilla leaders whom
they believe committed murder, rape, torture and other abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Though the commission report cannot be used to lodge such
accusations, human rights and religious groups have been compiling
dossiers on the most notorious of the more than 600 massacres for
which the military is blamed, and they are widely expected to act
soon.
</P>
<P>
   But progress on emblematic human rights cases, like the massacre
of a Mayan community at Xaman in 1995 and the murder of a
well-known anthropologist, Myrna Mack, who was investigating
genocide by the military, has been painfully slow.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial system has been criticized by human rights groups
and the United Nations as corrupt and inefficient, and judges have
been reluctant in the past to take on such cases.

RODMAN HAS NEW ROUTINE DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ There's Pacific Standard Time. And there's Dennis
Time.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, we're all on Dennis Time.
</P>
<P>
   6:05 p.m.: New Laker Dennis Rodman shows up late for his first
day of work. Or early, depending on how you set your watch.
</P>
<P>
   Players are supposed to be in the locker room at 6 for a 7:35
game. But a team official, adopting the lenient ``Dennis is
Dennis'' tone set by Lakers owner Jerry Buss in the middle of the
contract talk, says he thought Rodman might pull an old stunt by
blowing in at 7 and throwing on his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   6:10: Rodman crosses the locker room so quickly, ducking into
the back room containing the exercise equipment, that some of the
reporters here to chronicle his debut miss this historic moment.
</P>
<P>
   A photographer who got a good look at him in the tunnel from the
street offers a description: Rodman was modestly attired in a dull
green wool hat, T-shirt, baggy pants and sensible shoes. OK, we
made up the part about the sensible shoes.
</P>
<P>
   He drove a white Corvette and was accompanied by bodyguards
named Wendell Williams and Kelly Davis.
</P>
<P>
   6:15: It's noted that Rodman has been assigned the locker-room
cubicle that belonged to recent Lakers bad boy Nick Van Exel.
Significance? It's closest to the back door.
</P>
<P>
   6:15{: It's noted that Rodman's uniform, hanging on a hook,
bears a purple No. 73.
</P>
<P>
   73? Because he's won !ital!seven straight rebounding titles and
!ital!three straight championship rings. And because if you turn it
around you get his age. Anyway, that's what he said the other day
between curses and boo-hoos.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman is believed to be the first Laker to wear a
non-traditional number since George Mikan was No. 99. End of
Rodman-Mikan comparison.
</P>
<P>
   6:20: Shaquille O'Neal, lacing up his sneakers three cubicles
down the row from Rodman's, on being teammates with a former enemy:
``He does his thing. I do my thing. I'm not going to go out with
him at night or nothin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the nightclubs might not be big enough for the both of
them.
</P>
<P>
   6:25: Reporters outnumber players 2-1 in the small locker room.
All find amusement in the efforts of Kurt Rambis, named the Lakers'
head coach earlier in the evening, to choose the right socks. Match
the shoes? Match the slacks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta match the pants,'' Eddie Jones decrees. Rambis had
matched the shoes.
</P>
<P>
   So there's the first change from the Del Harris era.
Coach-player fashion banter.
</P>
<P>
   6:30: In case reporters on the Rodman beat didn't pick up on
this, those pre-game one-on-one interviews we'd all been hoping for
will not materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will never see him in the locker room,'' Lakers publicist
John Black says. ``I guarantee it.'' He means during press visiting
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Post-game interviews should not be expected either. But Rodman
has indicated he's willing to talk to reporters if they're willing
to trail him from the locker room to the tunnel. A Chicago writer
describes scenes like those from the Bulls days as ``moving
scrums.''
</P>
<P>
   7:15: Rodman, in middle of a parade of Lakers, takes the court
for final warmups. Fans, half-filling the Forum, have trouble
picking him out because his hair is a sedate purple, green and
gray.
</P>
<P>
   One of those might be his natural color. Who can remember?
</P>
<P>
   7:38: The ``Star Spangled Banner'' is performed by an unplugged
group called Dakota Moon. Rodman is the Laker who's swaying to the
beat.
</P>
<P>
   7:40: Ten photographers surround Rodman as trainer Gary Vitti
tapes his wrists.
</P>
<P>
   7:44: The game begins with Rodman on the bench between
straight-laced Derek Fisher and Sean Rooks. Rodman is the Laker
who's taking his shoes off.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a protest, as it was in his San Antonio days. He's
putting on ankle wraps.
</P>
<P>
   7:47: The scoreboard video screen shows Rodman on the bench.
Fans erupt. Rodman shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   7:54: The moment we've been waiting the whole month for: ``For
the Lakers, No. 73 ...'' Standing ovation as Rodman strips off his
warmups _ that's all this time _ and enters the game.
</P>
<P>
   7:55: Rodman's immediate impact is all positive: On the first
Lakers possession with him on the floor, he keeps alive a rebound
that O'Neal grabs and puts back; on the next, he grabs a rebound
and passes to O'Neal for a layup and an 18-11 lead.
</P>
<P>
   8:15: Rodman ends his first six-minute stint with one rebound,
one assist, one missed shot, two fouls and the Lakers lead in
energy. Of course, he's had six weeks longer than the rest of them
to store it up.
</P>
<P>
   8:16: The air goes out of the crowd and the team, which messes
up back-to-back fast breaks.
</P>
<P>
   8:17: Fans in the rafters start a ``We want Rodman'' chant.
</P>
<P>
   8:50: Halftime: Lakers 49-35.
</P>
<P>
   9:20: Rodman, having started the second half, goes out after
grabbing his sixth rebound in 16 minutes of action to tie O'Neal
and Travis Knight for the team high late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   9:21: ``We want Rodman'' again.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they do. They don't have a moving scrum in their
immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   10:02: Game: Lakers, 99-83; Rodman, 0 points, six assists (tying
for team high), 11 rebounds (leading the team) in 26 minutes. He
walks shirtless off the court trailed by minicams.
</P>
<P>
   10:18: Great, huh? ``So far,'' says Derek Harper, veteran
realist. ``Just wait, though.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   GUATAMALA-WAR-REPORT (Undated) _ The language was harsh, the
country's emotional, cathartic response even stronger. A
nine-volume report issued by a truth commission on Thursday that
blamed the Guatemalan military for the deaths of nearly 200,000
people in their 36-year civil war surprised nearly everyone with
the bluntness and severity of its judgments and recommendations. By

system of church-basement soup kitchens and food pantries. Over
nearly two decades, that network has expanded to serve more than $1
billion worth of food each year to 20 million Americans. But now,
as changes in welfare policy push many people away from the public
dole, private charity is lagging ever further behind in its efforts

this century been a symbiotic New York celebration. The police got
to show off their cunning in nabbing bad guys. The press got
close-up pictures, often in time for deadlines. The public got to
put a face on fear. No one lost, unless the perpetrator turned out
to be innocent. This was the sticking point that on Thursday caused
a federal judge to single out one particularly obnoxious perp walk
as an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. By Blaine Harden. With

brought to this country from Iran in 1978, when he was a few months
old. His father had been a bureaucrat in the Shah's intelligence
agency, so the family fled after the Islamic revolution. The
parents, two older children and Cyrus were given political asylum
in the United States. Last fall agents of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service went to Cyrus' place of work and took him
away. The reason was that a 1996 law, the Illegal Immigration Act,
defined his drug offense as an ``aggravated felony'' despite the
low sentence, and made him deportable. If Cyrus is deported to
Iran, he is likely to be arrested and tortured. By Anthony Lewis.

JORDAN'S IMPACT RAISES AUTHOR'S SENSE OF DESPAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What if Michael Jordan had succeeded at baseball?
</P>
<P>
   The landscape of two sports would have changed, not to mention a
chunk of the culture.
</P>
<P>
   In hoops alone in this corner of the world, the Sonics would
have been the 1996 NBA champions, George Karl would still be coach
here, the Mariners and Seahawks would struggle in the Sonic shadow,
Nike might still be flying high, Dennis Rodman would have washed
out of the league instead of joining the Sonics' biggest nemesis,
and perhaps the NBA lockout would have been averted, or at least
shortened, without the influence of the cabal led by Jordan and
agent David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, David Halberstam would have an unfinished
manuscript on his desk, because ``Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan
and the World He Made'' wouldn't be nearly as good a story with
Jordan shagging flies in spring training for the White Sox, talking
about how happy he was that Randy Johnson stayed in the National
League.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan failed at baseball. In returning to basketball and
succeeding so preposterously with three more championships and
recognition as the world's most familiar human, he became the face
of American pop culture and the template with which to measure a
disturbing transformation of society.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan even became less predatory. A better teammate, of all
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . When he failed at baseball,'' Halberstam wrote, ``he had
for the first time realized what it was for a player struggling
against his limits _ for he had known no limits before, certainly
no limits to his individual performances.''
</P>
<P>
   But Halberstam went well beyond the limits of a sports saga,
which was expected from the nation's pre-eminent
journalist/historian. His affection for pro basketball, established
20 years ago when he wrote ``Breaks of the Game,'' about a season
with the Portland Trail Blazers, didn't keep him from conveying his
despair over what has happened to the NBA and the
entertainment-driven society that fostered the industry's tawdry
hucksterism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if the architects of the modern game did not
entirely believe that its new fans, unlike those who attended the
old Chicago Stadium, found the game adequately entertaining,'' and
so embellished events ``by music boomed out ever more loudly, more
and more idiotic games played on the Jumbotron or on the floor . .
. mini-bike races between toddlers, acrobats firing T-shirts into
the crowd . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Familiar, Sonic fans?
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch this week during the Seattle stop of his national
book tour, Halberstam lamented the American lust for entertainment
and the celebrity adoration that drives it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A celebrity who actually achieves something is rare,'' he
said. ``Heroism now is cinematic and artificial. Fame today comes
from notoriety, not achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you say it started with O.J. Simpson, or goes all the
way back to Patty Hearst, it's a significant force. Since the
impeachment trial ended, what has been the biggest national story?
Whether Hillary Clinton will run for the Senate from New York:
Maybe she will, maybe she won't . . . but there's really nothing
there but our fascination with her celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   In spending a season around the Bulls, Halberstam found two
extremes for his point: Jordan and Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was the classic achiever whose overarching skills and
relentlessness created success and wealth, which begat more success
and wealth, which spread to many individuals and endorsers who
associated with him and the Bulls. Rodman, on the other hand, was
simply a good basketball player who came up with a shtick, in part
due to his hook-ups with the master re-inventor, Madonna, that had
no real worth or substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really doesn't know what he thinks,'' Halberstam said.
``Rodman's inability to control himself is extremely dangerous. He
thinks he's in charge, but he can't stop the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``By his final season with the Bulls, it was much harder to keep
him in sync. He was carried away by his own cult.''
</P>
<P>
   While the book is an exhaustive, entertaining chronicle of
Jordan and his impacts, it isn't the ultimate story of Jordan
because it lacks intimacy, which is a little surprising for so
comprehensive a work. The author was denied a promised one-on-one
interview, and there is only a paragraph devoted to Jordan's wife
and children.
</P>
<P>
   But Halberstam does get his arms around the changes in the NBA,
and by extension the culture that embraced the league so intensely,
by weaving wonderful portraits and anecdotes of many people and
issues that traced the arc of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   As a family snapshot, the sports world comes off more than a
little dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is an entertainment society good? Well, as someone born on the
other size of this DMZ, I don't regard it as a plus,'' said
Halberstam, 64. ``The genie is too far out of the bottle now, but
there is some possibility we're in a phase, and we will get beyond
it.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as the interest remains in Rodman's hair and Hillary's
daydreams, the phase richly deserves fat-guy basketball and
scorned-woman politics.

L.A. WARMS TO RODMAN GEEK SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It won't be long until he is in Las Vegas,
but Friday night Dennis Rodman was gamboling at the Forum, creating
problems for the Los Angeles Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, next month, perhaps even tomorrow, the Los Angeles
Lakers might be wondering why they signed him, when Rodman is AWOL.
</P>
<P>
   For one evening at least, he was the purple-and-golden boy,
praised by the Dennis disciples, of which there are many in this
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. likes people who are unique, who have style and are
controversial,'' said Robert Shapiro, a member of O.J. Simpson's
legal team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fits all of the criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Another courtsider, actress Cathy Lee Crosby, supported the
signing by commenting on the machismo shown by the Lakers' owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Buss has more (guts) than anybody I know,'' she said.
``He lives life the way he wants to live it. Things were like,
stale. He had to take chances. So he cracked it wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   And this is what's inside, a power forward who grabs headlines
and rebounds, a zero in some circles, hero in others. All will
agree that Dennis Rodman is unusual, and that's what kind of night
it was.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman did not score but was effective in other areas _ pulling
down 11 rebounds and distributing six assists. Several were
touchdown passes from baseline to baseline, finding open teammates
for layins. Rodman could not be located for post-game comments, but
that didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks in jibberish and it's laced with profanity,'' said
one reporter familiar with the man.
</P>
<P>
   The game between the cross-town rivals was not as captivating as
the antics of the cross-dresser. Everyone wanted a glimpse of the
man _ to know when he arrived and how he appeared.
</P>
<P>
   His hair color was conservative for him _ black with blond
splotches, a fingerpainting in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Electra, Rodman's wife, was at his news conference on
Tuesday, a Beverly Hills event that kicked off geek week in which
Rodman discussed the topic of fondling along with his projected
status as a Laker.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room before the game, Rodman never appeared while
the reporters lurked. But Shaquille O'Neal was there, trying on his
new size 22s while fielding questions about Kurt Rambis, who went
from interim coach to maximum madness. The former Laker player is
now the permanent Laker coach, for awhile anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated him,'' Shaq said of Rambis, the player. ``I thought he
was a dirty player. I remember his ugly glasses, the long hair ...
Clark Kent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's locker remained vacant. It sits at the end of a row,
three removed from O'Neal's. Unassuming Travis Knight sits right
next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be a bad role model for Travis,'' said Kobe Bryant,
laughing. ``Travis is a clean-cut Connecticut Husky.''
</P>
<P>
   A clean cut to Rodman is a precise tattoo if there is any room
left on that billboard body of his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Dennis here yet?'' O'Neal asked an hour before tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he was told by Laker spokesman John Black. Rodman was busy
in the back, lifting weights. A FOX crew took video footage of his
empty locker, shooting Rodman's new jersey hanging on the rack.
</P>
<P>
   As reporters left the locker room, fans shuffled in but never
filled the Forum. Rodman can be fashionably late here.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes before gametime, the moment arrived. The
anticipation was about to end. Layup drills were about to begin. In
came Rodman, confidently trotting like always. He was greeted with
cheers and shot layups while fans stood, trying to get a view of
the newest Laker.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes into the game, fans grew anxious, wanting their
first legitimate Rodman sighting. They chanted his name, and Rambis
obliged, inserting Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place will go wild as soon as he is introduced,'' Shapiro
predicted, and he was right.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman produced. In the first 30 seconds, he tapped a loose ball
to O'Neal for a layin. In the next 30 seconds, he pulled down an
offensive rebound and dished to O'Neal for a three-point play. In
one minute, the Laker lead went from 13-11 to 18-11.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Rodman left the floor as fans reached down from
the stands, hoping for acknowledgment or, better yet, his jersey.
But Electra got that and clutched it during an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of funny at first,'' she said. ``I'm so used to
seeing him as a Bull. He's happy to be playing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about something else, presumably a private subject,
Electra said: ``We don't talk about basketball very much. ... Every
time we're in Vegas, he runs around the hotel room naked.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman is a fascinating freak who elicits emotions, good and
bad. There is no gray area with Rodman _ his world is black and
white and turquoise and forest green. In other words, he will be
comfortable here.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A.,'' said Shapiro, ``is the place for Dennis Rodman.''

LAKERS WIN WITH RODMAN, RAMBIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Years hence, historians will no doubt debate whose
era this was. There will be the staunch Rambis camp and the equally
stubborn Rodman camp, each clinging to its own interpretation of
events and hairstyle trends.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night, as the Lakers unveiled a new coach and a new
power forward, the only debate was over how many dozen points would
comprise the Lakers' margin of rout over the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   And though the Lakers squandered a chunk of a 29-point lead, the
99-83 victory seemed like a good enough start for both head coach
Kurt Rambis and Designated Worm, Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever's era it is, the Lakers are 1-0 in it. And enjoying the
ride so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun. If you mix just playing the game, and then playing
with Dennis, and having Rambis in there as your coach, what more
can you ask for?'' said Kobe Bryant, who scored a game-high 22
points.
</P>
<P>
   In punishing their soon-to-be arena roommates for the second
straight night, the Lakers continued a steady counterturn out of
the three-game tailspin that got coach Del Harris fired two days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And the Clippers? The Chris Ford-Michael Olowokandi era is
heading for its own brand of notoriety, having lost 11 straight to
begin the season. The Clippers are six losses away from matching
Miami's 1988 record for worst start to a season.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Lakers, a week of chaos came to a merciful close.
They introduced Rodman on Wednesday, Rambis before the game Friday,
then unveiled both to a frenzied 17,505 at the Forum. The house was
nearly hoarse by the end of pregame introductions and certainly
sore in the throat after drowning out Rodman's intro late in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis' impact will take time to evaluate. Rodman's? Easy. The
Lakers won by 16 points. In Rodman's first 17 minutes of play, the
Lakers outscored the Clippers by 19.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with 11 rebounds, six assists, one steal and zero
points on two loudly cheered field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy that hasn't touched a basketball in nine months,
that's pretty good,'' Rodman said. ``I felt a little shy at the
beginning because I didn't want to mess up, but when I stepped on
the court it all just came back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The hair, by the way, was a muddy mix of browns and blacks and
possibly some purple and yellow, maybe a bit of blue... well, it
was hard to tell. In transition, as Rodman put it.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he was much the same Rodman that helped the Chicago
Bulls to their last three NBA championships, looking every bit as
tenacious as he did in Game 6 of the Finals _ his most recent game
_ last June. The lockout, the reported offseason of partying, his
lack of a team to practice with the last six weeks, none of it
seemed to affect Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eveready Bunny,'' Rambis said, and the folks who make the
Energizer battery will have to forgive him. ``That's what he does.
As the game wears on he just keeps getting better and better. I
asked him how much he wanted to play. He said, `Yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Rodman had wrapped his arms around a single loose
ball, he was earning high marks from his new team. By the time he
joined his first shootaround, Rodman was giving teammates pointers
on defending the pick-and-roll.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Bill Bertka might have given the Worm the
highest praise one can give a new Laker: a comparison to the
legends.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's another aspect he brings to the team that I like,''
Bertka said. ``I think back to when Wilt (Chamberlain) came to the
team, I think back to when Kareem came to the Lakers. They brought
a mental toughness and a professionalism to the franchise, that
professionalism and that toughness is infectious. Dennis loves to
play basketball, and I think that for our team is going to be a
very helpful aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman wasted little time showing his hustle. He entered midway
through the first quarter and promptly saved a couple possessions
and recorded his first assist and rebound.
</P>
<P>
   And helped Rambis record his first win. And the new Lakers boss
promptly responded with a coach-like reality check.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great,'' Rambis said, ``but we've got a tough schedule
coming up. I had to remind the players that this is not an
indication that everything is OK with us. ... We've still got a lot
of work to do.''

<P>
   ANAHEIM -- The Mighty Ducks are No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Not in the NHL standings, of course. But when it comes to the
power play no team is better than Anaheim, which defeated San Jose
3-1 Friday night on the strength of its league-leading 62nd and
63rd power play goals.
</P>
<P>
   But Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg still thinks the best is yet
to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are still finding more confidence as the season
goes along,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The long and physical game played before 17,174 at the Pond
featured a Bryan Marchment cross-check on Steve Rucchin in the
first three minutes of play, after the NHL's favorite villain had
run over Teemu Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Anaheim's special teams that were the difference as
they have been so many times this year.
</P>
<P>
   While Rucchin and Selanne scored on the power play, Anaheim
easily killed off a four-minute penalty in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's big chance came just six seconds after Rucchin scored
his 22nd goal of the year at 11:35. The Sharks, however, could
manage only one harmless 60-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell (somebody) how important it is to have a
good power play and penalty killing at this time of year,'' said
Selanne, who extended his point-scoring streak to 12 games with a
goal and two assists. ``These games are like playoff games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks' victory moved them one game over .500 (26-25-9), kept
them in fifth place -- three points ahead of St. Louis. It also
moved them seven points ahead of seventh-place San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks (20-26-4) are 0-4-2 since winning four consecutive
games on their recent 10-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's ninth win of the month was a new club record and give
the Ducks 18 points in February -- tying the record for points in a
month.
</P>
<P>
   But the victory certainly wasn't an easy one. Rucchin had his
bell rung when he was high-sticked by Marchment after coming to the
aid of Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin, who broke his nose on Feb. 17 against Edmonton,
finished the first period, but played only two shifts in the second
period before retiring for the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ruch is a warrior,'' said Selanne. ``He told us he doesn't
look pretty right now, but he'll do what he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg, however, insisted that Rucchin did not leave the game
because of the hit, but rather that the Anaheim center was
suffering from the flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the flu,'' said Hartsburg angrily. ``He feels awful and
couldn't finish the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensity and hitting was playoff-like most of the night --
especially in the first period when neither team would back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't mind it,'' said Hartsburg. ``We have some guys who
thrive on it. The intensity was a good sign tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks took a 1-0 lead when Fredrik Olausson slipped down
from the right point and fired a hard pass into the slot that
Rucchin deflected past San Jose goalie Mike Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks took control of the game early in the second and got
the got the tying from Alex Korolyuk at 5:52 on their third
excellent scoring chance.
</P>
<P>
   But San Jose's Magnus Ragnarsson then made the mistake of
holding Paul Kariya's stick, giving the Ducks another power play
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon kept the Ducks at bay for almost two minutes, but Selanne
and Kariya combined to the give Anaheim a 2-1 lead at 10:21.
Selanne, while skating backwards, deflected Kariya's point shot
into Vernon's pads, picked up the rebound and scored his 33rd goal
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks appeared to have tied the game less than two minutes
later when Joe Murphy shoved a rebound past Guy Hebert, but the
goal was waved off when it was ruled that Patrick Marleau's skate
was in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding off that good break and the momentum change provided by
the power play, Anaheim took a 3-1 lead on Travis Green's 11th goal
of the season at 15:40.

SONICS REBOUND TO DEFEAT SPURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Sonics still have a ways to go, but Friday night
the team at least made its offensive low point look like an
aberration.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after forward Vin Baker made just one basket and the
Sonics shot a season-low 34.2 percent, they rebounded with a 92-82
victory over the San Antonio Spurs at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   The victory snapped a two-game losing streak and vindicated a
repulsive 99-81 loss Wednesday at San Antonio (6-7). It was just
the second win for the Sonics (8-4) in six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're back on the roller coaster in the NBA,'' Sonics coach
Paul Westphal said. ``They thumped us, and we came back and thumped
them. We're still not shooting 50 percent, which I'd like to see
one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite shooting 42 percent, the Sonics executed better
offensively and pinned down the Spurs defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors were a big part of a decisive third quarter. The
Sonics went on a 30-18 run in that period to distance themselves
from the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton was again the catalyst, scoring 14 of his game-high
23 points in the third. He made all five shots he attempted, which
included three 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's three-point play with 57 seconds left put the Sonics
ahead 74-59 and seemed to knock out the already dazed Spurs. The
Sonics also forced San Antonio to turn the ball over 10 times in
the third, which resulted in easy, fastbreak scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Four Sonics scored in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't miss everything you put up, at least I hope not,''
Sonics guard Hersey Hawkins said. ``And in that third quarter, we
got into a groove defensively and offensively. When you put the
ball in the hoop, it makes all the difference in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio committed 19 turnovers, and suffered through
35-percent shooting for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you have turnovers like that, people are playing good
`D' so I think they did a real good job defensively,'' Spurs coach
Gregg Popovich said. ``They stepped it up a notch and it showed.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was a reversal of fortune for both teams in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Sonics stifled the Spurs' Twin Towers _ David
Robinson and Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were dominated Wednesday when those two combined for
47 points and 30 rebounds in the teams' first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Duncan managed 22 points, but Robinson was held to
10 points on 2-for-9 shooting. Overall, the Sonics did a better
containing the post. They were quicker with double teams, crowding
Duncan and Robinson as soon as they touched the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to limit his touches and put a body on him
because he roamed around a lot in San Antonio,'' Sonics center
Olden Polynice said. ``I was intent on not letting that happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker came out determined as well. After shooting 1-for-7 in the
first meeting, Baker showed signs of slipping out of his funk and
into a groove.
</P>
<P>
   He started the game by making three of his first six shots.
Baker even made consecutive free throws for the first time this
season after missing his first two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take anything at this point,'' said Baker, who finished
with 16 points on 7-for-19 shooting. ``The one thing I was happy
about is,, once I made my two, I wanted to get back to the line. I
haven't felt like that in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that Baker's only problem at the start was his
aggressiveness. He picked up his third foul with 9:13 left in the
second quarter and went to the bench with eight points and four
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody picked it up a little bit,'' said Sonic Dale Ellis,
who started his second straight game at shooting guard. `` . . .
Gary shot the ball well. We did a better job of executing our
offense and got good shots. We really wanted to beat this team.''
</P>
<P>
   TIP-INS: Rookie Vladimir Stepania made his second straight
appearance, finishing with four points and three rebounds in six
minutes. The 6-foot-11 forward/center played in just five games
before Friday night. . . . Baker, who was poked in his left eye
during Wednesday's loss to the Spurs, did not wear protective
goggles. He wore goggles during Thursday's practice, although his
blurred vision has since subsided. . . . Forward Billy Owens has
recovered from his broken left pinky and will practice Sunday for
the first time.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Ronald Reagan and Congress joined
forces in the mid-1980s to overhaul the nation's income tax code,
the political circumstances were similar to the situation now:
divided government (then there was a Republican president and
Senate and a Democratic House), a lame-duck president, an
ideological gulf separating the parties, little public consensus
about the proper legislative course and no particular crisis that
required the president and Congress to take immediate action.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was adopted anyway. Tax rates
were cut almost in half. Popular deductions were scrapped. Tax
shelters were abolished. The taxes of virtually every person and
business in America were affected by the new law.
</P>
<P>
   The experience is relevant today because the monumental tax
measure was the only law enacted in the last generation that
approaches the sweeping scope of the Social Security legislation
President Clinton and Congress are considering.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the lessons from the odyssey of the tax law
that politicians who are now working on the Social Security system
might consider:
</P>
<P>
   Real Bipartisanship Is More Than Just Talk.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, the genial Republican patriarch, and Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the bare-knuckle brawler from the Chicago
Democratic machine, had little in common and no use for one another
personally. But they shared the conviction that the tax system was
out of whack and needed revision.
</P>
<P>
   The evening that Reagan announced his tax plan in a nationally
televised speech, Rostenkowski, then chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, went on the air to praise the president and urge
viewers to ``write Rosty'' if they agreed. Not once in the 18
months between then and the day the measure was signed into law did
either man publicly criticize the other.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, when the tax measure seemed to unravel totally,
it was put back together again, outside the public eye, by a small
group consisting of the president's agent, Richard Darman, and
seven senators _ four Republicans and three Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the bad blood and mistrust may be insurmountable, even
though President Clinton and Republican leaders have proclaimed
their fealty to bipartisanship almost every day since the
impeachment trial ended.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are already accusing the White House of dishonest
accounting practices. Clinton supporters have been quick to charge
the Republicans with wanting to jeopardize retirement benefits by
giving tax cuts to the wealthy. Badly burned every time they have
touched Social Security in the past, Republican congressional
leaders worry that the president would rather have a campaign issue
than a law.
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, called the White House recently to ask to see the
president one-on-one to talk about Social Security, he was told the
time was not ripe.
</P>
<P>
   Political Leadership Can Mean Wheeling and Dealing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, at the outset of the tax debate, Reagan transferred
James Baker and Darman, the two most talented political maestros on
the White House staff, to the Treasury Department, made them
secretary and deputy secretary and put them in charge of the drive
for tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   Darman developed what he called ``the principle of binary
choice.'' If a few key politicians had a personal stake, he
reasoned, and if the rank and file in Congress were given only ``a
binary choice between tax reform and no tax reform,'' a sweeping
tax bill could pass against all odds.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what happened. Over and over between early 1985
and late 1986, when the most thorough revision of the tax code in
at least 40 years was enacted, the legislation itself was
essentially dead. But each time it was revived because central
figures like Reagan, Rostenkowski and Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,
and Bob Packwood, R-Ore., were personally committed and because
other lawmakers had no alternative but to vote for whatever measure
was before them at the time or to kill altogether the idea of
changing the tax system.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Rostenkowski was in total command. On the morning
of the House vote, he was on the telephone in his committee's
library calling lawmakers and lining up their votes. He promised,
for instance, special tax breaks for a stadium in Cleveland, a
parking garage in Memphis, a convention center in Miami and dozens
of other projects. ``Politics is an imperfect process,'' he
explained at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Today, no one in the Clinton administration has nearly the
political skill and influence in Congress that Baker and Darman
had. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has not taken a leading role
on Social Security, and in any event, he may leave his post by this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the iron-fisted rule and conspicuous logrolling for
which Rostenkowski was famous is out of fashion. It makes for
cleaner g, but legislative accomplishment is harder.
</P>
<P>
   If Goals Are Agreed Upon, The Details Can Be Worked Out
</P>
<P>
   The individual pieces of the tax law that was eventually enacted
bore little relationship to what Reagan proposed or, for that
matter, what came out of Rostenkowski's committee. The tax brackets
were different. Investors lost their tax break on capital gains.
Deductions of state and local income taxes were permitted, but
those for medical expenses were restricted. Real estate tax
shelters were ended. On balance, taxes on businesses went up, and
those on families went down.
</P>
<P>
   Brutal battles were fought over such details. But the basic
goals were never in dispute: lower tax rates, fewer deductions, no
change in the amount of revenue raised, no shift in the relative
tax burden on the rich and the middle class. At issue was who the
winners and losers would be within that framework.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Social Security, both sides agree on the basic
goal: sufficient money must be found to provide an acceptable
standard of living to baby boomers when they retire. But so far,
neither Clinton nor the Republicans who control Congress have
conceded that reaching that goal will result in losers as well as
winners. Some workers will pay higher taxes; some retirees will get
reduced benefits.
</P>
<P>
   So the debate so far has been over details like whether
income-tax revenues should be used to pay retirement benefits and
who should control payroll taxes invested in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Those are important questions. But even if they are resolved,
the basic goal will remain elusive.

televised speech, Rostenkowski, then chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, went on the air to praise the president and urge
viewers to ``write Rosty'' if they agreed. Not once in the 18
months between then and the day the measure was signed into law did
either man publicly criticize the other.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, when the tax measure seemed to unravel totally,
it was put back together again, outside the public eye, by a small
group consisting of the president's agent, Richard Darman, and
seven senators _ four Republicans and three Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the bad blood and mistrust may be insurmountable, even
though President Clinton and Republican leaders have proclaimed
their fealty to bipartisanship almost every day since the
impeachment trial ended.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are already accusing the White House of dishonest
accounting practices. Clinton supporters have been quick to charge
the Republicans with wanting to jeopardize retirement benefits by
giving tax cuts to the wealthy. Badly burned every time they have
touched Social Security in the past, Republican congressional
leaders worry that the president would rather have a campaign issue
than a law.
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, called the White House recently to ask to see the
president one-on-one to talk about Social Security, he was told the
time was not ripe.
</P>
<P>
   Political Leadership Can Mean Wheeling and Dealing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, at the outset of the tax debate, Reagan transferred
James Baker and Darman, the two most talented political maestros on
the White House staff, to the Treasury Department, made them
secretary and deputy secretary and put them in charge of the drive
for tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   Darman developed what he called ``the principle of binary
choice.'' If a few key politicians had a personal stake, he
reasoned, and if the rank and file in Congress were given only ``a
binary choice between tax reform and no tax reform,'' a sweeping
tax bill could pass against all odds.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what happened. Over and over between early 1985
and late 1986, when the most thorough revision of the tax code in
at least 40 years was enacted, the legislation itself was
essentially dead. But each time it was revived because central
figures like Reagan, Rostenkowski and Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,
and Bob Packwood, R-Ore., were personally committed and because
other lawmakers had no alternative but to vote for whatever measure
was before them at the time or to kill altogether the idea of
changing the tax system.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Rostenkowski was in total command. On the morning
of the House vote, he was on the telephone in his committee's
library calling lawmakers and lining up their votes. He promised,
for instance, special tax breaks for a stadium in Cleveland, a
parking garage in Memphis, a convention center in Miami and dozens
of other projects. ``Politics is an imperfect process,'' he
explained at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Today, no one in the Clinton administration has nearly the
political skill and influence in Congress that Baker and Darman
had. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has not taken a leading role
on Social Security, and in any event, he may leave his post by this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the iron-fisted rule and conspicuous logrolling for
which Rostenkowski was famous is out of fashion. It makes for
cleaner g, but legislative accomplishment is harder.
</P>
<P>
   If Goals Are Agreed Upon, The Details Can Be Worked Out
</P>
<P>
   The individual pieces of the tax law that was eventually enacted
bore little relationship to what Reagan proposed or, for that
matter, what came out of Rostenkowski's committee. The tax brackets
were different. Investors lost their tax break on capital gains.
Deductions of state and local income taxes were permitted, but
those for medical expenses were restricted. Real estate tax
shelters were ended. On balance, taxes on businesses went up, and
those on families went down.
</P>
<P>
   Brutal battles were fought over such details. But the basic
goals were never in dispute: lower tax rates, fewer deductions, no
change in the amount of revenue raised, no shift in the relative
tax burden on the rich and the middle class. At issue was who the
winners and losers would be within that framework.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Social Security, both sides agree on the basic
goal: sufficient money must be found to provide an acceptable
standard of living to baby boomers when they retire. But so far,
neither Clinton nor the Republicans who control Congress have
conceded that reaching that goal will result in losers as well as
winners. Some workers will pay higher taxes; some retirees will get
reduced benefits.
</P>
<P>
   So the debate so far has been over details like whether
income-tax revenues should be used to pay retirement benefits and
who should control payroll taxes invested in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Those are important questions. But even if they are resolved,
the basic goal will remain elusive.

   ``Holly stays conservative,'' reads the Charles Schwab ad
featuring real customers and their stock portfolios. ``Howard makes
a move.''
</P>
<P>
   So what if Holly, identified as a part-time teacher who also
teaches investing to her daughter's fifth-grade class, shows
$6,560.71 in her account and Howard shows $2,438,665.95? They are
both in the game, both part of a profound transformation in
American life _ the way the aspirations, fears and machinations of
the world of finance, once the province of the wealthy few, have
become indelibly interwoven into mainstream culture.
</P>
<P>
   As Washington's noisy sideshow fades, millions of Americans are
refocusing on the thing that most defines their lives, the upward
and downward ticks of interest rates, the gyrations of their mutual
funds, the achingly palpable lure and temptations of wealth. What
this is doing to the country _ from money to values _ is one of the
most intriguing questions about American life at the century's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed is not a new thing,'' said Roger Shinn, a professor
emeritus of social ethics at the Union Theological Seminary in New
York City, who has also taught business ethics at New York
University. ``But I think the present situation is different in
many respects. Money is less tangible. It used to be property or
gold. Now it's a blip on your computer screen. It appears and
disappears. It becomes more a way to keep score, more a game in its
own right, the way athletes compete with each other to make the
most millions, when each additional million can't possibly matter
to the way they live.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, true wealth for most Americans seemed as distant
as Bombay.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a stroll through any bookstore gives a crash course on what
they want, whether it is ``Simple Abundance'' or ``More Than
Enough'' or ``How to Retire Rich.'' They know that ``It Takes
Money, Honey.'' They want to be ``The Millionaire Next Door.'' They
read Money and, to be safe, Smart Money, too.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of wealth is as old as the Bible. And from the robber
barons of the 19th century to the Wall Street tycoons of the 1980s,
striking it rich has been part of the American myth. But, in at
least four ways, money is woven into the fabric of daily life today
in a way it never was in the past:
</P>
<P>
   First is the aging of 78 million baby boomers, whose needs,
wants and fears dominate American culture. Faced with looming
financial needs for their children's college and their own
retirement, many find themselves confronting the kind of saving and
investment they had neglected.
</P>
<P>
   Second is the relentless march of the bull market, which has
made millions wealthy and millions more think they should be.
</P>
<P>
   Third is the credit revolution, with more tempting cards
arriving in the mail every day, which has made it possible for
people without money to spend and live like the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth is the way marketing suffuses the culture from the
toy-of-the-moment on Saturday-morning cartoons to the disparate
images of seniors as either on-the-go consumers or near invalids.
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans, of course, the goal is getting by, not
getting rich. Robert H. Frank, a Cornell University economist and
author of ``Luxury Fever'' (The Free Press, 1999), says half of the
respondents in a recent survey reported life savings of less than
$3,000 and another 40 percent said it would be ``a big problem'' if
they had to deal with an unexpected bill for $1,000. Meanwhile,
more than 35 million Americans, or 13.3 percent, live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But almost half of American households now own stock either
directly or through pension or retirement plans, compared to less
than a third at the beginning of the decade and less than 1 in 10
in the 1960s. This comes at a time when a hot stock like Dell
Computer can rise by 4,200 percent in three years and then lose
nearly 20 percent of its value in four days as it did in February,
making the riches and risks of the market gut-wrenchingly
immediate.
</P>
<P>
   Before the current bull market, who could have imagined that
newsstands would feature a gaggle of glossy magazines with cover
articles trumpeting one or another Ultimate Mutual Fund Guide, as
if the subject has the sex appeal of supermodels in bikinis on
Polynesian beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The new crop of financial books blends the language of money
with the spirit of the human potential movement. ``I have come to
think that money is very much like a person,'' writes Suze Orman in
``The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom'' (Crown Publishers, 1997),
``and it will respond when you treat it as a cherished friend _
never fearing it, pushing it away, pretending it doesn't exist or
turning away from its needs, never clutching it so hard that it
hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Millionaire Next Door,'' by Thomas J. Stanley and William
D. Danko (Longstreet Press, 1996), has been on the best-seller list
since January 1997, with its comforting message that the rich are
just like the rest of us, only cheaper.

   ``The spiritual aspect of personal finance, learning to control

temptations to spend. As a result, nearly 20 percent of American
households have more debt than assets. When real estate is factored
out, the bottom 40 percent of Americans have more debt than assets.
</P>
<P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Brian Dennehy took on the role of Willy Loman,
the tragic hero of Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman,'' he
wanted some new insight into the psychological makeup of a
character that has been played thousands of times, and by some of
the greatest actors of the century.
</P>
<P>
   So Robert Falls, the director of the new Broadway production,
sent the script to two psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both said the same thing,'' Falls recalled. ``They said
that Willy was manic-depressive, with hallucinatory aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be as simple as that? Willy Loman, a manic-depressive.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the play's debut in 1949, critics and academics have
debated the symbolism of Miller's salesman: He is a stand-in for
the long-suffering common man; a suicidal victim of the capitalist
machine; nothing more than a man undone by his own ignorance and
womanizing.
</P>
<P>
   But what if he is none of these? What if he is really just a man
struggling with a psychiatric condition that was poorly understood
at the time the play was written?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's definitely people out there saying, `I wonder
what would have happened if Willy got some Ritalin, and maybe got
some counseling to get into another line of work,''' said Peter
Kramer, a psychiatrist and the author of ``Listening to Prozac.''
</P>
<P>
   Playwright Wendy Wasserstein said such an analysis could be
applied to many great dramatic characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why you'd limit it to Willy,'' she said. ``Heck,
why don't you get Electra and Lear in there and get them some
family counseling?''
</P>
<P>
   It has always been true that the sensibilities of an era color
the perception of works of art.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes the science of a later era suggests a new
explanation for a central conflict in a work of literature, raising
questions about the author's intention and speculation about
whether the author's contribution is diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Falls, who is also the artistic director of the Goodman Theater
in Chicago, says that such speculation misses the point.
</P>

   ``I think that every work of art is filtered through the lens of
people looking at it, and through whatever the timely issues are of
the moment,'' he said. ``The great works are the works that
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``Death of Salesman'' has survived, having been produced and
adapted around the world almost continuously for the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Theater artists, a famously sensitive breed, have always been
susceptible to psychological and intellectual trends. Freud was a
heavy influence in the development of acting in the early part of
this century, informing classic performances like Laurence
Olivier's interpretation of Oedipus during the 1940's.
</P>
<P>
   In more recent years, experimental troupes like the Wooster
Group in Manhattan have deconstructed Chekhov and Eugene O'Neill to
within an inch of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of the shift in conflict from the social to the
psychological are rife in Falls' production of ``Death of a
Salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the image _ created by designer Jo Mielziner in 1949 _
of Willy's Brooklyn home wedged between apartment buildings.
Today's set floats in and out of moody lighting described by Ben
Brantley of The New York Times as having ``a sense of engulfing
night that evokes William Styron's notion of emotional depression
as `darkness visible.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And while purists may grumble, reinterpreting the conflict seems
to have struck a chord with today's audiences. The production has
received some of the season's best reviews, with many critics
saying it took Miller's flawed hero off a cold ideological plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death of a Salesman'' isn't the only classic getting a
reinterpretation this season.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the playwright Jon Robin Baitz has written a new
translation of Henrik Ibsen's ``Hedda Gabler,'' considered a
feminist forerunner, that attempts to clarify her psychological
motivations for her behavior. It will star Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing Willy Loman through a prism of psychiatry, Falls said,
is something of an oversimplification. But he acknowledged that the
psychological approach has paid benefits. ``I actually think
audiences take it more personally,'' Falls said. ``The
socio-political stuff is definitely there, but it's hard to direct
metaphor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer, the psychiatrist, says there may be an unintended result
of making Willy Loman's malady personal rather than societal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What looked like Everyman struggling with Everyman's
challenges now only looks like a particular man with a particular
problem,'' Kramer said. ``Instead of the audience saying, `That's
what happens to human beings when their history is laid bare,' I
can imagine them saying, `That's what happens when people with a
propensity for late life attention deficit disorder reach that
age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I'm advocating a clinical lens,'' he concluded.
``I just think it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wasserstein disagrees. ``Plays are still about conflict,
still about families, about pain, and still about highs and lows,''
she said. ``Even if the audience is imagining different highs and
lows, as long as there's pain out there, it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was certainly mindful of the psychological core of the
play: His original title was ``The Inside of His Head.'' But he has
his own ideas about the diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willy Loman is not a depressive,'' Miller said last week. ``He
is weighed down by life. There are social reasons for why he is
where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose if the audience were reacting in a clinical way,
they would stand back and say, `The guy needs a pill,''' he said.
``But I hear people weeping. I don't think that could have happened
if people were looking at it as a clinical experience.''

 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Brian Dennehy took on the role of Willy Loman,
the tragic hero of Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman,'' he
wanted some new insight into the psychological makeup of a
character that has been played thousands of times, and by some of
the greatest actors of the century.
</P>
<P>
   So Robert Falls, the director of the new Broadway production,
sent the script to two psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both said the same thing,'' Falls recalled. ``They said
that Willy was manic-depressive, with hallucinatory aspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be as simple as that? Willy Loman, a manic-depressive.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the play's debut in 1949, critics and academics have
debated the symbolism of Miller's salesman: He is a stand-in for
the long-suffering common man; a suicidal victim of the capitalist
machine; nothing more than a man undone by his own ignorance and
womanizing.
</P>
<P>
   But what if he is none of these? What if he is really just a man
struggling with a psychiatric condition that was poorly understood
at the time the play was written?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's definitely people out there saying, `I wonder
what would have happened if Willy got some Ritalin, and maybe got
some counseling to get into another line of work,''' said Peter
Kramer, a psychiatrist and the author of ``Listening to Prozac.''
</P>
<P>
   Playwright Wendy Wasserstein said such an analysis could be
applied to many great dramatic characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why you'd limit it to Willy,'' she said. ``Heck,
why don't you get Electra and Lear in there and get them some
family counseling?''
</P>
<P>
   It has always been true that the sensibilities of an era color
the perception of works of art.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes the science of a later era suggests a new
explanation for a central conflict in a work of literature, raising
questions about the author's intention and speculation about
whether the author's contribution is diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Falls, who is also the artistic director of the Goodman Theater
in Chicago, says that such speculation misses the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that every work of art is filtered through the lens of
people looking at it, and through whatever the timely issues are of
the moment,'' he said. ``The great works are the works that
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``Death of Salesman'' has survived, having been produced and
adapted around the world almost continuously for the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Theater artists, a famously sensitive breed, have always been
susceptible to psychological and intellectual trends. Freud was a
heavy influence in the development of acting in the early part of
this century, informing classic performances like Laurence
Olivier's interpretation of Oedipus during the 1940's.

<P>
   Perhaps only in New Orleans could the dead be a special interest
group. Their influence was recently illustrated when the City
Council passed an ordinance requiring antiques dealers and auction
houses to report to the police within 24 hours any cemetery
artifacts that come their way. The law is a response to thieves
plundering the historic ``cities of the dead'' and selling caches
of marble angels and blessed mothers to local antiquarians.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested were several well-respected antiques
dealers who, police say, knowingly purchased ornaments stolen from
the graves and may even have placed orders, as if history were an a
la carte menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pawnbrokers have always had reporting requirements,'' said
Louise Fergusson, executive director of Save Our Cemeteries, the
most venerable of the city's three cemetery preservation groups.
``Now that antiques dealers are dealing in stolen artifacts they
are going to have to deal with the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of historic family tombs, most of them from the
19th century, robbed in broad daylight has raised the profile of
those dedicated to preserving cemeteries and protecting the dead.
Their worst enemies may be decorators and antiques dealers pushing
the necro-politan look for the garden, the more mouldering the
statuary the better.
</P>
<P>
   The look was in full flower in New York last week at the
Gramercy Garden Antiques Show, where several weeping angels _ one
with an $875 price tag _ were spotted amid the rusting garden
benches and freshly spritzed topiary. And that may just be the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theft is not limited to architectural objects, gates and
statuary,'' said Katie Karrick, a historian in Lyndhurst, Ohio, who
publishes Tomb With a View, a newsletter for cemetery enthusiasts
(http://members.aol.com/TombView/twav.html). ``My latest pet peeve
is the use of metal detectors on grave sites to find lost or
intentionally placed coins, jewelry and other objects.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Karrick works as a historian at the Wade Memorial Chapel in
Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland. The chapel is famous for its
Tiffany lamps, pews and mosaics. Five years ago, two bronze statues
from the 1920s were stolen and have yet to be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, Save Our Cemeteries recently completed a
digitized tomb-by-tomb data base for Lafayette Cemetery No. 1, one
of the most alluring and storied of the city's 31 cemeteries.
Neglect remains a problem, particularly at St. Louis Cemetery No. 1
and No. 2 on the fringes of the French Quarter, where street crime
deters many families from regularly visiting ancestral tombs.
</P>
<P>
   The mobility of families and churches has taken a toll. ``We are
trying to locate families who have some relationship to the
deceased and who will take an interest in restoring the tombs,''
said Michael Boudreaux, director of the New Orleans Archdiocesan
cemeteries, which include the St. Louis cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, where graveyards have long been plagued by
thieves, those who own or curate historic cemeteries are breaking
their silence, alerting antique buyers to tell-tale funerary
motifs: winged hourglasses (the swiftness of time), garlands
(victory in death), willows (mourning), scythes (Father Time) and
leaning tree trunks (short interrupted life).
</P>
<P>
   Groups like the New England Cemetery Association, based at
Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston, encourage families to photograph
and document tombs. The private Art Loss Register, based in New
York City, tracks stolen artwork for a fee and played a major role
in retrieving a $50,000 fountain stolen from a Missouri cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida and Texas, state agencies are surveying rural
cemeteries, including plots of the poor simply marked by river
rocks or seashells. ``Families move, local memory becomes fuzzy and
the next thing you know the lot is for sale,'' said Jim Miller, the
Florida state archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
   In rural Georgia and elsewhere in the South, the tradition of
placing pottery on graves has made black burial grounds especially
vulnerable to theft as the collectors' market for Southern folk
pottery flourishes. These fragile, out of the way places, often
unmarked except for depressions in the earth, have become
``incentives for illegal activity,'' said Dr. John Burrison, a
curator at the Atlanta History Center.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the ``death care industry,'' as it is known, are
finding creative ways to attract people, in keeping with the
prevailing wisdom that ``neglect begets neglect,'' as Ms. Winslow
put it. Lovers of bass can now go fishing at Michigan Memorial Park
in Huron Township, Mich. Others can enter contests like the one at
Lake View where the prize was a four-star dinner for two at the
James A. Garfield monument serenaded by the Ohio Chamber Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   But the boldest idea may be at the historic Congressional
Cemetery in southwest Washington, where $100-a-year memberships for
dogs have turned the 1807 cemetery into a 32-acre dog run that
``provides us with people in the cemetery all day long,'' said
Susan Olsen, a board member of the Association for the Preservation
of Historic Congressional Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Within the antiques world, laws that require dealers to report
suspicious statuary are likely to remain controversial. ``If there
are a billion tchotchkes in the world, only a fraction of them have
been stolen,'' said John Sare, an attorney with Milbank Tweed
Hadley &AMP; McCloy in New York, who represents museums and collectors.
``So it makes more sense to register thefts than objects.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now the most secure cemetery artifact may well be Bird
Girl, the bronze funerary cover girl of John Berendt's ``Midnight
in the Garden of Good and Evil'' (Random House, 1994), who for
generations watched over the Trosdal family at the Bonaventure
Cemetery in Savannah, Ga. An instant celebrity, the statue was
removed for safe-keeping by descendants and now resides at the
Telfair Museum of Art, where attendance has doubled since her
arrival.

<P>
   A woman suffering from breast cancer asks for a bone marrow
transplant. Her health plan says no. A paraplegic needs a special
wheelchair to achieve adequate mobility. The plan says no.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely a week goes by without a health maintenance organization
getting hammered in the press or in court for denying payment for
the care of a gravely ill patient. Clearly, the anecdotal evidence
suggests, the scandal of managed care is rampant denial of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But guess again. The media, courts and consumer advocates are
overlooking a problem that is precisely the opposite of the one
everybody's complaining about. That problem is too many medical
treatments rather than too few.
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons _ fears of consumer backlash,
legislative intervention or large jury awards _ managed-care plans
appear to be denying little care, notwithstanding all the
well-publicized horror stories and growing complaints as HMOs
become commonplace in American society.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the cost savings that HMOs have already achieved
are in jeopardy. Managed care also is not meeting its stated goal
of improving the quality of treatment by second-guessing physicians
who fail to follow the best medical practices.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at figures on care denial that New York and other
states are just beginning to collect. While incomplete and
problematic, they suggest that there have been few denials over the
objections of enrollees or their doctors, raising the question of
whether the persistent reports of callous behavior by HMOs provide
a distorted picture.
</P>
<P>
   For example, New York for the first time in 1997 required health
plans to report each time patients or their physicians appealed a
plan's denial of reimbursement for a physician-approved treatment.
The plans reported a small number of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford Health Plans, covering more than a million New
Yorkers in managed care, reported fewer than 1.5 appeals for every
1,000 enrollees. The six largest managed-care plans in the state
averaged about 2.5 appeals per 1,000 patients.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, the HMOs denied coverage for specialists not part of the
plan's network of physicians; treatments deemed unnecessary for a
patient's recovery, and procedures that the plan deemed
experimental _ lacking scientific evidence of safety or
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   A similar picture emerges from reports in other states. New
Jersey and Connecticut, for example, keep track of appeals that are
not resolved by the internal procedures of managed-care plans _ a
smaller category than that reported for New York. For 1998, New
Jersey reported 69 such appeals from about 2.5 million enrollees in
managed care. Connecticut reported 39 appeals from about a million
enrollees. Appeals are rare even in managed-care plans serving
Medicare, despite the fact that appeals are automatic once the
enrollee has exhausted the plan's internal review. Managed-care
patients in general win between a quarter to a third of their
appeals to federal and state authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Could there be too  &UR; few &LR;  denials? Don't snicker. A presidential
commission recently concluded that excessive procedures _
procedures that lack scientific justification _ could account for
as much as 30 percent of the nation's medical bills. Surgeons
perform mastectomies rather than breast-preserving surgery on
Medicare patients 35 times more often in some parts of the country
than in others, for no apparent medical reason. Roughly a quarter
of the surgeries to implant tubes in children's ears are
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   There is, says Professor Alain Enthoven of Stanford University,
an ``urgent need for managed care to second-guess decisions by
physicians to subject patients to needlessly risky surgery and
needlessly costly tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics dismiss the self-reported New York data as unverified
and unreliable. It is true that plans use different definitions of
appeals and other grievances. Nor did some of the plans submit
internally consistent or complete reports.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not entirely clear how to interpret the low number of
reported appeals. Most enrollees are healthy and present no
occasion to deny care. Many denials never get appealed because
patients give up easily or are unaware of legal options.
</P>
<P>
   But before dismissing the data, take a close look at Empire Blue
Cross and Blue Shield of New York. It reported twice as many
appeals, about 38 per 1,000 patients, as any other plan, and about
15 times as many appeals as the largest plans. Upon re-examination,
Empire has determined that it exaggerated the actual number because
its accounting system tossed in non-medical complaints like
protests of premium increases. When corrected, Empire says, its
reported appeals will plummet. But is even its exaggerated estimate
_ 7,300 appeals for about 200,000 patients _ an excessive figure?
</P>
<P>
   A number of medical directors of large health plans say in
private that fear of consumer and legal backlash has scared them
from denying reimbursement even when they are convinced the
treatment is ill advised. Dr. Gordon Norman of PacifiCare of
California, a large managed-care plan, points to another problem:
``Doctors often prefer to bend to the wishes of patients, agreeing
to request diagnostic tests or procedures that they may not feel
are truly necessary.'' The doctors put the onus on the health plan
to deny their requests, leaving them ``in good graces with their
patients, but making the plan look like the bad guy.''

<P>
   A woman suffering from breast cancer asks for a bone marrow
transplant. Her health plan says no. A paraplegic needs a special
wheelchair to achieve adequate mobility. The plan says no.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely a week goes by without a health maintenance organization
getting hammered in the press or in court for denying payment for
the care of a gravely ill patient. Clearly, the anecdotal evidence
suggests, the scandal of managed care is rampant denial of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But guess again. The media, courts and consumer advocates are
overlooking a problem that is precisely the opposite of the one
everybody's complaining about. That problem is too many medical
treatments rather than too few.
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons _ fears of consumer backlash,
legislative intervention or large jury awards _ managed-care plans
appear to be denying little care, notwithstanding all the
well-publicized horror stories and growing complaints as HMOs
become commonplace in American society.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the cost savings that HMOs have already achieved
are in jeopardy. Managed care also is not meeting its stated goal
of improving the quality of treatment by second-guessing physicians
who fail to follow the best medical practices.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at figures on care denial that New York and other
states are just beginning to collect. While incomplete and
problematic, they suggest that there have been few denials over the
objections of enrollees or their doctors, raising the question of
whether the persistent reports of callous behavior by HMOs provide
a distorted picture.
</P>
<P>
   For example, New York for the first time in 1997 required health
plans to report each time patients or their physicians appealed a
plan's denial of reimbursement for a physician-approved treatment.

   Aetna U.S. Healthcare identifies another way health plans keep
the number of denials and appeals low. Dr. Arthur Leibowitz,
Aetna's medical director, calls it a ``sentinel'' effect, by which
his staff keeps physicians well informed about Aetna's standards.
Critics might call this bullying physicians to cut costs. That is
no doubt part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   But Leibowitz defends Aetna's practices by pointing to a side of
managed care that the public rarely sees. It is the side that
focuses on raising quality. It often tells doctors to do more, not
less.
</P>
<P>
   Besides pointing out ways doctors do too much, research also
exposes ways they do too little. Physicians often fail to prescribe
life-saving beta-blockers for heart attack victims or proper
inhalers for asthma patients. Aetna issues reports to its doctors
tracing how their care stacks up against their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Empire made available short accounts of appeals for the first
eight months of 1998. The names of the patients were stricken,
though Empire contacted a random sample of the patients to ask
whether they would take follow-up phone calls from a reporter. The
picture that emerges is murky.
</P>
<P>
   Empire refers appeals about experimental treatments like bone
marrow transplants to outside panels of independent experts. That
has virtually eliminated contentious legal challenges of this type
of denial, raising the possibility that external review might blunt
some of the consumer backlash over managed care. But Empire's other
denials trigger a tug-of-war between a plan that tries to control
costs and supervise care, and patients who demand the freedom to
get the care they want.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Empire's cases lie in a gray zone. Empire tells of
financially strapped patients who skip paying premiums, then get
hit with crushing medical bills. Employers switch health insurers,
forcing employees to switch to Empire's doctors _ a traumatic
experience for many chronically ill patients. One parent refused to
take her child, who suffered from speech and other development
problems, to a doctor who had once screamed at her, triggering
nightmares. Empire agreed to let the child see any other doctor in
the same medical office, but the parent balked. In another case, a
patient insisted on seeing a physical therapist who, she decided
for unspecified reasons, was uniquely qualified to treat her back
problems. Empire overturns about 30 percent of its initial denials,
often after physicians produce better evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The point is not that managed care does not make callous medical
decisions and aggravate patients. Even if appeals are infrequent,
complaints to state officials about managed care are rising, though
some of the trend can be explained by rising enrollment in
managed-care plans, and many of the complaints involve nuisances
like not answering the phone quickly or paying claims on time.
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care plans sometimes deny care when they should not, and
sometimes pay for care when they should not. Both mistakes pose
dangers. Enthoven offers a caution. ``The country risks making a
terrible mistake if it overreacts and treats every denial as an
assault on patients,'' he said. ``Denials are a necessary feature
of a well-run plan.''

   These haven't been the best of times for Monica L. Tripp of
Columbus, Ga. ``It's been an awful year _ I now hate telling people
my name,'' said Ms. Tripp, who happens to have a 7-year-old
daughter named Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monica S. Lewinsky and her loyal friend Linda L. Tripp
became household names, Monica Tripp, 33, a 911 dispatcher, has had
to endure a constant barrage of crank calls, sophomoric jokes,
sexual innuendo and brazen leers. ``Even my co-workers give me
flak, always asking, `Where's your blue dress?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many a Monica and a lot of Lewinskys have been accidental
victims of a scandal that has produced few heroes. ``Monica
Lewinsky has actually cost me money,'' complained Marisa Lewinsky _
no relation _ a psychology student from Florida. To thwart obscene
phone callers, Ms. Lewinsky now subscribes to caller ID. ``Not a
week goes by without someone making a crude comment,'' added Ms.
Lewinsky. ``People have even told my boyfriend: `Hey, you're set.
You must get a lot of oral sex.' The first joke was funny. It gets
old fast.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Monica Barrett, 38, a paralegal in Wisconsin,
doesn't own a dry-cleaning business. (Wacky Monica jokesters will
often ask about this.) ``I used to answer the phone at my law firm:
`Hello, this is Monica speaking. How may I help you?''' Ms. Barrett
said. ``Nearly every time I did that, I'd receive some sarcastic
comment, mainly from men. They don't realize that what they're
saying is hurtful and demeaning. I mean, I'm not Monica Lewinsky.
We just share a first name.''
</P>
<P>
   Pre-scandal, the moniker Monica enjoyed a pristine, even pious
standing, having been long associated with St. Monica, the devout,
overbearing mother of St. Augustine. The New Dictionary of Baby
Names concludes, rather arbitrarily, that the name Monica evokes a
``frighteningly healthy, pig-tailed girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. ``Giving a Monica'' and ``the full Monica'' have
become part of the vernacular, stigmatizing, perhaps permanently, a
perfectly upstanding name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect a moratorium on baby Monicas for the next 30 years,''
said Anne Bernays, co-author of ``The Language of Names.'' The
numbers seem to back her up. In 1997, Monica was the 73rd most
popular girl's name; it had fallen to 97th place a year later,
according to the Social Security Administration. Still, Ms. Bernays
offered encouraging words: ``Hold your heads up high, Monicas.
Anyone, even Adolfs, can transcend a name.''
</P>
<P>
   Why all the gibes at Monicas' expense? ``The name makes all
sorts of lights go on in the head,'' explained Steven Stroessner, a
social scientist at Barnard College. According to Stroessner, the
Lewinsky scandal lurks in the memory, poised to erupt whenever
discipline flags. ``We have so many associations about Monica that
you almost can't help but have thoughts activated,'' he said.
``Whether we blurt them out or not is another matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean L. Cohen, a professor of politics at Columbia University
and author of a forthcoming book on sex and the law, judges
anti-Monica outbursts as aggressive, sexist behavior. ``Sexual
jokes and comments are rarely good, chummy fun,'' argued Ms. Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional gender roles have been destabilized,'' she
added. ``The real Monica couldn't be cast as innocent victim or
evil seductress. She was an agent of her own sexuality. That makes
men uncomfortable. How do they deal with that uneasiness? They
can't attack Monica Lewinsky, so they express their discomfort by
putting down some random Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat the problem, two lawyers in Milwaukee _ neither named
Monica _ recently founded Monicas With Attitude, a
consciousness-raising group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women named Monica will band together,'' declared its mission
statement, ``celebrate their names in a positive way and develop
activities that will preserve and promote the good reputation that
so many earlier Monicas have enjoyed.'' The organization's latest
campaign: a boycott of ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,'' which it
accuses of misogynistic Monica-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   Some Lewinsky namesakes have devised their own strategies for
coping with wisecracks. Marisa Lewinsky smiles broadly before
revealing her name to strangers. ``It disarms people, makes them
less prone to be rude,'' she said. Since taking her husband's last
name when she married five months ago, the former Monika Lewinska,
a 24-year-old from Poland, has cut her grief in half.
</P>
<P>
   Not one Monica interviewed for this article has seriously
contemplated changing her name legally. Monica Monica, an
ophthalmologist from New Orleans, is running for the Republican
nomination in the upcoming special election to fill the House seat
of Rep. Bob Livingston, the speaker-designate who resigned, a
casualty of the Lewinsky scandal. Ms. Monica considers her double
moniker an asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the campaign trail it has evoked curiosity and attention,''
she noted. ``It's a wonderful way to open doors. There are many
Monicas, from Monica Seles to Monica, the singer, to Monica, the
character on `Friends,' who love the name. If a negative perception
exists, we are going to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the scandal lingering on life support, some Monicas expect
the unwanted attention to die down. ``In a few months,'' mused one
Monica from New Jersey, ``Monica won't be a thought in people's
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it. Charles (call me Chuck) Manson, a
customer-service representative at a New York computer company,
still endures frequent taunting, even though his namesake-nightmare
began 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell people my name, then follow it up with, `No
relation,' or, `I've never killed anyone,''' he said. ``Monicas are
going to have a tough time. It helps that my namesake was a
murderer. That usually scares the hell out of people.''

you almost can't help but have thoughts activated,'' he said.
``Whether we blurt them out or not is another matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean L. Cohen, a professor of politics at Columbia University
and author of a forthcoming book on sex and the law, judges
anti-Monica outbursts as aggressive, sexist behavior. ``Sexual
jokes and comments are rarely good, chummy fun,'' argued Ms. Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional gender roles have been destabilized,'' she
added. ``The real Monica couldn't be cast as innocent victim or
evil seductress. She was an agent of her own sexuality. That makes
men uncomfortable. How do they deal with that uneasiness? They
can't attack Monica Lewinsky, so they express their discomfort by
putting down some random Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat the problem, two lawyers in Milwaukee _ neither named
Monica _ recently founded Monicas With Attitude, a
consciousness-raising group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women named Monica will band together,'' declared its mission
statement, ``celebrate their names in a positive way and develop
activities that will preserve and promote the good reputation that
so many earlier Monicas have enjoyed.'' The organization's latest
campaign: a boycott of ``The Tonight Show With Jay Leno,'' which it
accuses of misogynistic Monica-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   Some Lewinsky namesakes have devised their own strategies for
coping with wisecracks. Marisa Lewinsky smiles broadly before
revealing her name to strangers. ``It disarms people, makes them
less prone to be rude,'' she said. Since taking her husband's last
name when she married five months ago, the former Monika Lewinska,
a 24-year-old from Poland, has cut her grief in half.
</P>
<P>
   Not one Monica interviewed for this article has seriously
contemplated changing her name legally. Monica Monica, an
ophthalmologist from New Orleans, is running for the Republican
nomination in the upcoming special election to fill the House seat
of Rep. Bob Livingston, the speaker-designate who resigned, a
casualty of the Lewinsky scandal. Ms. Monica considers her double
moniker an asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the campaign trail it has evoked curiosity and attention,''
she noted. ``It's a wonderful way to open doors. There are many
Monicas, from Monica Seles to Monica, the singer, to Monica, the
character on `Friends,' who love the name. If a negative perception
exists, we are going to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   With the scandal lingering on life support, some Monicas expect
the unwanted attention to die down. ``In a few months,'' mused one
Monica from New Jersey, ``Monica won't be a thought in people's
minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it. Charles (call me Chuck) Manson, a
customer-service representative at a New York computer company,
still endures frequent taunting, even though his namesake-nightmare
began 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell people my name, then follow it up with, `No
relation,' or, `I've never killed anyone,''' he said. ``Monicas are
going to have a tough time. It helps that my namesake was a
murderer. That usually scares the hell out of people.''

   WASHINGTON _ Mercifully, the impeachment vote was at hand,
acquittal was already a certainty, and that new thing with
feathers, ``closure,'' seemed a cheery possibility for the nation.
Yet in the final hours of the Senate's trial of President Clinton,
Republicans were still proposing more subjects for investigation.
Rumors of presidential tape recordings were gravely cited along
with an 11th-hour affidavit from a reporter allowed to intrude
Pirandello-like into the story. ``We don't want any grassy-knoll
theories or dangling questions left in case someone like Oliver
Stone ever tries to make a movie about this,'' a ranking Republican
staffer explained straight-faced in announcing fresh kindling for
the 13-month-long conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it be set in Oliver Stone's Amerika or the Marx
Brothers' Freedonia, the very idea of remilking the mass
entertainment aspect of the &QL; 
debilitating Clinton-Lewinsky-Starr saga seemed the year's ultimate
obscenity. For, as the Senate prepared to vote, a
stake-in-the-heart ending of the thing was at hand by all the
Constitution's sacred writ and the public's smoldering
indifference.
</P>
<P>
   But no. Less than two weeks after his acquittal, Clinton once
more has had to gingerly decline elaboration on his latest flat
denial of a Jane Doe story of sexual allegation flaring up from the
oily residue of his impeachment struggle.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, scandal escapists should be warned that juicy bits
from Monica Lewinsky's oath-free television interview with Barbara
Walters _ a prelude to The Book _ have already been strategically
leaked to stoke viewership for this week's next episode of a story
most people claim to be sick of.
</P>
<P>
   And, lest justice not be endlessly served, ground rules are
being negotiated for a new investigation, this time of the fairness
of the investigation of the president's investigator, Kenneth
Starr. And, of course, Starr will have an extra year's jurisdiction
to investigate Clinton, private citizen, once he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never ends,'' exults Matt Drudge, the Internet
scandalmonger who served up the Lewinsky story and led America to
its groaning board feast upon sex and mendacity. ``I did hope the
Senate would keep Clinton: I needed the hits.''
</P>
<P>
   And here we all are looking for something fresh and wholesome.
President Clinton's Arbor Day speech, perhaps, or a regained perch
on that bridge to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Webster Hubbell's next fraud trial by Starr's Whitewater
_ remember Whitewater? _ prosecutors begins in late spring. And
Hillary Rodham Clinton may be called as a witness, just when she's
somehow tempted by the idea of electoral office in her own right as
her husband's career slowly closes out. Closure? No, the story goes
forward, by limp and squiggle. When all else fails, there's always
nostalgia on CNBC and Fox-TV with nether-night reruns of the
flinching Betty Currie footage, the beret rope-line tableau and,
evermore, the wagging finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would it take to make it end?'' Mark Russell, the
capital's resident political humorist, asks of the scandal story.
``Saddam Hussein at Camp David. Or  &UR; John &LR;  Doe No. 5. Fifteen
percent unemployment by the Easter recess? Jane Doe Nos. 5 through
26 on `20-20.''' Russell pauses, as if at wit's end about it all.
``How about at the Academy Awards, Elia Kazan names Charlton Heston
as a communist?''
</P>
<P>
   But it becomes harder to laugh at the story that wraps around
itself, at ``this daily mud-slide into the nation's living rooms,''
as House Democratic Whip David Bonior described it last fall. He
failed to defeat impeachment, but he left a ringing question: ``Do
we really want two more years of Monica Lewinsky? Two more years of
Linda Tripp?'' That now seems an existential question. (Political
comedian Al Franken comments, ``I think the next phase of the story
will be articles like yours.'')
</P>
<P>
   For sheer durability, the story is beginning to resemble a toxic
waste dump of fetid ingredients and methane energies. The news
media cannot afford not to see the story through. The president's
enemies, naturally, stand ready to continue feeding the pile. And
then there are the sorry deposits offered by Clinton himself, whose
search for historic legacy seems increasingly overwhelmed by vapors
from the past.
</P>
<P>
   Gamboling in the unsensational agenda of yore, House Democratic
Leader Dick Gephardt was fairly trilling his way last week through
a masterful riff on the looming Social Security issue when he was
suddenly asked, ``What's your reaction to the Juanita Broaddrick
allegations?'' A heartfelt sigh was his purest reaction to the Jane
Doe No. 5 story about the emergence of apparently unprovable rape
charges against Clinton. ``Boy, the frustration I sense out there
among people about continuing all of this dialogue is palpable,''
Gephardt began, patiently observing what the nation now well knows,
that the legal system has ``all kinds of mechanisms'' for dealing
with this latest tangent in the unending story.
</P>
<P>
   Optimists should note that House Republicans, the main force
behind impeachment, are reported scandal weary. ``There's a death
rattle from a few people still calling my office, the kind who
think the Clintons killed Vince Foster,'' said Rep. Peter King,
R-N.Y., who was inundated with critics' complaints two months ago
when he opposed impeachment. ``But there was silence _ not even a
hint about the impeachment _ at this week's Republican
conference,'' he related approvingly. ``The specter's out there.
But there's a feeling that maybe if we don't talk about it, it
won't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers find the body politic scarred with media needle
tracks. ``It really is like a narcotic,'' says Bill Kovach, curator
of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University.
``You can't just go cold turkey if you're all-Monica,
all-the-time.'' He finds the latest twist, the long-rumored rape
allegation, troublesome because it reached mainline newspapers
after the acquittal when the staunchly anti-Clinton Wall Street
Journal editorial page provided an outlet. Such a polemical spark
could muddy traditional journalism, Kovach worries.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, one of the president's defenders from
impeachment, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., sees progress in the
Jane Doe postscript. ``If Jane Doe 5 emerged a year ago, there
would have been far wider acceptance,'' he says. ``The Lewinsky
experience has made the media more careful and people more
skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe more inured, in the view of Mark Shields, a political
analyst whose normal spirit of relishing knockabout politics is
notably absent from this story that will not die. ``I think this
thing is going to be with us,'' he estimates, wary as a character
in those movies about the hockey-mask fiend. ``Maybe not in the
sense of the consciousness of the country, of people talking about
it. But it will manifest itself in what we look for in a potential
president the next time _ someone with  &UR; no surprises &LR; .''

COMMENTARY: CHOKING ON LUST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ There was a splashy premiere in Westwood with
flashbulbs popping, fans screaming and stars preening. The movie is
called ``Cruel Intentions.'' It is not the Linda Tripp story. It is
yet another screen adaptation of ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' the
Choderlos de Laclos novel about sexual manipulation and betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   The twist this time is that it's a teen movie. The diabolical
seducers are not jaded French aristocrats but jaded Manhatan
teen-agers who go to a tony prep school. Buffy the Vampire Slayer,
nee Sarah Michelle Gellar, steps into the cultivated ice-queen role
once played by Glenn Close. Valmont is a spoiled rich boy who goes
to a shrink and drives a vintage 1956 Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   As though the original French story of deflowering on a bet were
not racy enough, the makers of ``Cruel Intentions'' have their
fresh-faced teens indulging in cocaine and pot, as well as lesbian
and homosexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   We're a long way from Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland here, or
even ``Beverly Hills 90210.'' Once this R-rated movie might have
scandalized Mom and Dad. But in a society that is saturated with
sex, the threshold of shock keeps dropping.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. races against L.A. to see which capital can be more
outrageously unexpurgated.
</P>
<P>
   In the Washington version of ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses,'' two
cynical middle-aged women, Linda Tripp and Lucianne Goldberg,
manipulated and betrayed Monica Lewinsky. The Republicans tried to
paint Monica as an innocent child, turned into damaged goods by
President Valmont, but she was miscast.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much innocence to be found anywhere. Everybody is
peddling flesh.
</P>
<P>
   The February cover of ``Esquire'' is indistinguishable from
``Playboy,'' with Pamela Anderson embodying ``The Triumph of
Cleavage Culture.'' The magazine ponders whether breasts might be
``a symbol of the new culture of falseness that pervades the
corridors of power.''
</P>
<P>
   The new macho men's magazine Maxim offers a how-to feature
headlined ``Any Woman, Any Time'' (one tip: ``Pick up women with a
sock puppet!''). Magazines for young women now all ape sultry,
man-trapping ``Cosmopolitan,'' with stories like ``Hot New Reason
to Have Sex (as if you needed one)'' in Jane and ``Get a Better
Body for Sex'' in Marie Claire. In her new magazine, Talk, Tina
Brown will have a section devoted to ``thoughtful'' essays on sex.
</P>
<P>
   In movies, there's ``8mm'' about a private detective, played by
Nicholas Cage, investigating the death of a young victim of the
underground world of snuff films, sadomasochism and bondage. It is
about a social issue, not soft porn, Cage told Premiere: ``It's a
cautionary tale of what can happen if you don't keep an eye on your
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. Times reports that Fox TV has a prototype for a comedy
show called ``Action,'' about a movie producer who plays with a
prostitute, pops pills and uses foul language.
</P>
<P>
   Cable news and talk shows are obsessed with sex. They tried to
wedge in Jon Benet Ramsey during a post-impeachment lull that saw
ratings plummet, but they clearly were thrilled to see Jane Doe No.
5 wash up. The Washington Post says advertising rates for Barbara
Walters' Monica interview were quadrupled to $800,000 for a
30-second spot.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Bill Clinton's scandal did not shock America is
because it was coherent with the culture. The president merely
attached the Oval Office to the rest of the country, and brought it
down to the level of all the less revered venues where people are
thinking and talking about sex all the time _ to such an extent
that sex is not sexy any more.
</P>
<P>
   When everyone is trying to be sexy, the only way to make a
splash is not to be sexy. Which brings us to Al Gore and Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, while excited teen-agers hooted in the
balcony at ``Cruel Intentions,'' Democrats gathered at the home of
Barry Diller for a reception for Bradley, co-hosted by Disney chief
Michael Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   Most other Hollywood big shots are pushing the vice president.
As much as they love Bill Clinton, they say they they are looking
forward to a White House that would be more ``Pleasantville'' than
``Peyton Place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With Gore you get the best of Clinton without the
distractions,'' said one top director.
</P>
<P>
   When Hollywood urges Washington to be less entertaining and
sexy, you know things have gone seriously awry.

COMMENTARY: STARING AT HATRED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How deep is the hatred?
</P>
<P>
   After being sentenced to death in Jasper, Texas, last week, John
William King was asked if he had anything to say to the relatives
of his victim, James Byrd Jr., a 49-year-old black man who was
chained to a pickup truck and dragged along a country road until
his body literally was torn apart.
</P>
<P>
   King, a 24-year-old white supremacist, did have something to
say. Grinning, he assured all within earshot that Byrd's grieving
survivors were welcome to perform a sex act on him.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans would like to believe that the attack on Byrd was
an aberration, that it was so far over the top, so sick and
inhumane, that it should not be viewed as representative of a much
larger societal problem. The reasoning is more or less as follows:
The vast majority of Americans were repelled by the murder, arrests
were made quickly, and the legal steps toward the ultimate societal
sanction already are being taken. Let's move on.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude presupposes that race hatred and other forms of
prejudice and intolerance in America are not nearly as deep or as
dangerous as the attack on Byrd might suggest.
</P>
<P>
   A long litany of tragedies tells us otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old college student in Wyoming, died
last fall after he was kidnapped, robbed, tied to a fence, beaten
in the head with a .357 Magnum, tortured with cigarettes, taunted
as he wept and begged for his life, and finally left alone and
helpless in near-freezing temperatures. Authorities said he was
murdered, at least in part, because he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report from the Southern Poverty Law Center in
Montgomery, Ala., which tracks hate crimes and hate groups across
the country, is filled with other horrible examples that occurred
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the report said, a dark-haired young woman named
Amy Robinson was abducted in Fort Worth, Texas, and murdered by two
white men who used her for target practice. They were reported to
have burst out laughing when she died. The original plan, according
to one of the men, was ``to go out and shoot black folks.'' Ms.
Robinson was chosen because the men thought she was biracial. They
were mistaken. Ms. Robinson was, in fact, white.
</P>
<P>
   In October in Buffalo, N.Y., a group of black teen-agers
attacked a 41-year-old white man, Gary Trzaska, as he was walking
to his car. Trzaska, who was gay, was beaten and stomped to death.
Witnesses said they saw the teen-agers jumping high in the air so
they could land on Trzaska's head with both feet. They said the
boys appeared gleeful.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring a group of whites ``armed with brass knuckles and
chanting `white power''' attacked Lance Cpl. Carlos Colbert, a
21-year-old black Marine, as he left a party in San Diego, Calif.
As many as 30 men joined in the assault. Colbert was not killed,
but his neck was broken. He is paralyzed from the neck down.
</P>
<P>
   Last May a racially charged exchange in a bar led to the murder
of Mark Dale Butts, a 35-year-old white man. He was beaten to death
in a cemetery in Victor, Colo., by a group of black men and
teen-agers. A shovel was used in the attack. Authorities said Butts
was beaten so hard the handle of the shovel eventually broke.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Dees, the chief trial counsel of the Law Center, said he
is surprised by what appears to be the increasing frequency and
viciousness of such attacks. They are being committed by whites and
blacks, he said. Much of the hatred is fueled by the growing number
of organized hate groups and the proliferation of Internet sites
devoted to racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia and other forms of
intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to turn away from a crime as grotesque as the murder
of James Byrd in Jasper, Tex., is understandable. Once justice is
done, what's the point of wallowing in the hideousness of the
crime?
</P>
<P>
   But there is a need to understand the rage and the frustrations
and the impulses that lead so many to mayhem in the name of some
warped sense of superiority, or inadequacy, or fear, or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Dragging someone to his death behind a truck may be unusual. But
torturing, maiming and killing people because they fit a certain
despised profile is an everyday occurrence. We can hardly stop it
if we're not even willing to look at it.

   WASHINGTON _ President Richard M. Nixon was a man obsessed.
Ample illumination of this comes in new transcripts of tapes
secretly recorded in the White House between 1971 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The following bits of conversation, previously withheld from the
public on grounds of national security, show Nixon and his aides
trying to directly implicate the late President John F. Kennedy in
the November 1963 assassination of South Vietnamese President Ngo
Dihn Diem.
</P>
<P>
   With that killing, South Vietnam's weak civilian leadership died
and ``U.S. policy in Vietnam plunged into the unknown,'' in the
words of the authors of the Pentagon Papers, the secret government
history of the Vietnam war published by The New York Times in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Nixon discussed how to pin the murder on the man who
defeated him for the presidency in 1960, in a vote that Nixon
always considered a stolen election.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not even the president was able to compel the
national-security bureaucracy to declassify secrets. The public
record available today shows that while U.S. officials, including
Kennedy, approved of the military coup in which Diem was
assassinated, they did not directly order his death.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes were released last week by the National Archives, and
transcripts of them were prepared by the privately financed Nixon
Presidential library in Yorba Linda, Calif.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton said last year that a
Palestinian state was ``very important'' to Middle East peace, and
it seemed like a monumental political gaffe. Many Jewish groups
reacted with alarm. And her husband's administration, which has
never endorsed the idea, swiftly disowned her comments.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 10 months, Mrs. Clinton's words are back on the front
pages of New York City's Jewish newspapers, thanks to the first
lady's announcement that she is thinking about running for the U.S.
Senate from New York next year.
</P>
<P>
   One of her potential Republican rivals, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
has stoked the controversy, asserting that Mrs. Clinton's remarks
were ``a very big mistake.'' And analysts are already predicting
that the first lady's position on Palestinian statehood will hurt
her among Jewish voters, about 12 percent of the state's
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not necessarily so. A Palestinian state is not the same
hot-button issue it was 10, or even 5 years ago, when endorsing the
concept was akin in some peoples' minds to endorsing terrorism,
many political analysts and Jewish leaders say.

   ``The Palestinian state is no longer the taboo subject it once
was,'' said Thomas Smerling, Washington director of the Israel
Policy Forum, an American Jewish group that supports the peace
process. ``At a time when you have a Likud prime minister
negotiating with the Chairman of the PLO over the size of an
eventual Palestinian entity, the idea of a Palestinian state no
longer seems as alarming as it once did.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Jewish leaders say that since Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization recognized each other's legitimacy in 1993,
a growing number of Jews in America and Israel have come to accept
that some sort of Palestinian state will be the likely outcome of a
negotiated peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Several polls of American Jews conducted over the past three
years support that notion. A 1998 poll commissioned by the Middle
East Quarterly found that 64 percent of American Jews supported the
statement, ``The Palestinians should have their own country.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if most American Jews believe a Palestinian state is
desirable, or inevitable, Mrs. Clinton's statement could still
cause her grief in a New York campaign. Many Jews were troubled not
so much by the wording of Mrs. Clinton's remarks as by their
timing. From Washington, she spoke up in the middle of sensitive
peace talks between Israel and Palestinians. To many, weighing in
at that moment seemed a crass attempt to push the talks toward a
conclusion favoring the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Jews viewed her statement as supporting a unilateral
declaration of statehood by the Palestinians, or at least granting
Arafat a license to do it,'' said Abraham Foxman, national director
of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, referring to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   But Foxman also acknowledged that ``the overwhelming number of
Jews would be supportive'' of a Palestinian state if it were the
result of a negotiated settlement. ``It's Israel's peace,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that she is serious about becoming a candidate, Mrs.
Clinton has been trying to repair any damage from her remarks.
Meeting with rabbis last week in Washington, she said she supported
both the peace process and a Palestinian state. ``They are not
mutually exclusive of one another,'' her spokeswoman, Marsha Berry,
said. After the meeting, Rabbi Jay Kornsgold of New Jersey told the
newspaper Jewish Week, ``This may impress a lot of Jews in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   If supporting a Palestinian state is no longer the third rail of
Jewish-American politics, what might Giuliani or other Republicans
gain from keeping the issue alive?
</P>
<P>
   A significant number of Jews continue to oppose a Palestinian
state. But they tend to be conservatives who vote Republican
anyway. It is more likely that Giuliani was using the Palestinian
issue as a symbol for broader themes, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Raising questions about Mrs. Clinton's remarks is a way of
raising doubts about her support for Israel, said Kieran Mahoney, a
Republican consultant from New York. It also is another way of
labeling her a liberal ideologue, said Ester Fuchs, a
political-science professor at Barnard College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supporting a Palestinian state used to be the peacenik
position, an extreme left-wing position,'' she said. ``And that's
what Giuliani has to do: Paint his opponent into a left-wing
corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani says he has simply taken the same position as the
President, who is very popular among Jews. But in helping to keep
the issue alive, he risks a backlash, some analysts contend. Last
year, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato accused his challenger, Rep. Charles
Schumer, who is Jewish, of missing votes on important Jewish
issues. D'Amato lost the race and saw his share of the Jewish vote
decline from past elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the mayor has the pulse of American Jewish
opinion on this issue,'' said Seymour Reich, a past chairman of the
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and
a supporter of the peace process.

   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton said last year that a
Palestinian state was ``very important'' to Middle East peace, and
it seemed like a monumental political gaffe. Many Jewish groups
reacted with alarm. And her husband's administration, which has
never endorsed the idea, swiftly disowned her comments.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 10 months, Mrs. Clinton's words are back on the front
pages of New York City's Jewish newspapers, thanks to the first
lady's announcement that she is thinking about running for the U.S.
Senate from New York next year.
</P>
<P>
   One of her potential Republican rivals, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
has stoked the controversy, asserting that Mrs. Clinton's remarks
were ``a very big mistake.'' And analysts are already predicting
that the first lady's position on Palestinian statehood will hurt
her among Jewish voters, about 12 percent of the state's
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not necessarily so. A Palestinian state is not the same
hot-button issue it was 10, or even 5 years ago, when endorsing the
concept was akin in some peoples' minds to endorsing terrorism,
many political analysts and Jewish leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian state is no longer the taboo subject it once

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The recent capture of Kurdish guerrilla
leader Abdullah Ocalan has focused new attention on the war he has
waged against the Turkish army for 14 years. In recruiting fighters
and supporters, Ocalan has fed on the resentment many Kurds feel
for what they consider the government's unjust discrimination
against them. But he could never have built such a potent force
without great amounts of help from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why Ocalan found foreign supporters for
his bloody rebellion against Turkish rule, and why Turkey has
resisted his rebellion so fiercely. Some are to be found in
history, others in psychology, and still others in geopolitics.
</P>
<P>
   Lurking behind them all, however, is water.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade until last October, Ocalan lived
semi-clandestinely in Syria, and the Syrian government gave him
money, arms and political cover. Iraq also helped him, allowing him
to build bases along the Iraqi-Turkish border. Neither Syria nor
Iraq were embracing his cause out of any love for Kurds; on the
contrary, governments in both countries have fiercely repressed
their own Kurdish populations.
</P>
<P>
   But Syria and Iraq want water from rivers that spring from
Turkish soil. Turkey has given them what it considers ample amounts
of water, but rejects what it calls their ``unacceptable claims.''
They have supported Ocalan's fighters as a way of applying pressure
on Turkey to give them more water.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers created the ``Fertile Crescent''
where some of the first civilizations emerged. Today they are
immensely important resources, politically as well as
geographically. Through a system of dams in its southeastern
provinces, Turkey controls their flow and is determined not to give
up its control. That is one important reason that Turkish leaders
have so resolutely refused to grant any autonomy to the Kurdish
region, which straddles both rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Few if any countries understand the growing importance of water
as fully as Turkey does. In one of the world's largest public works
undertakings, Turkey is spending $32 billion for the huge Southeast
Anatolia Project, a complex of 22 dams and 19 hydroelectric plants.
Its centerpiece, the Ataturk Dam on the Euphrates River, is already
completed. In the reservoir that has built up behind the dam,
sailing and swimming competitions are being held on a spot where
for centuries there was little more than desert.
</P>
<P>
   When the project is completed, perhaps in the next decade, it is
expected to increase the amount of irrigated land in Turkey by 40
percent and provide one-fourth of the country's electric power
needs. Planners hope this can improve the standard of living of 6
million of Turkey's poorest people, most of them Kurds, and thus
undercut the appeal of revolutionary separatism. It will also
deprive Syria and Iraq of resources those countries believe they
need _ resources that Turkey fears might ultimately be used in
anti-Turkish causes.
</P>
<P>
   The region of Turkey where Kurds predominate is more or less the
same region covered by the Southeast Anatolia Project, encompassing
an area about the size of Austria. Giving that region autonomy by
placing it under Kurdish self-rule could weaken the central
government's control over the water resource that it recognizes as
a keystone of its future power.
</P>
<P>
   In other ways also, Turkish leaders are using their water as a
tool of foreign as well as domestic policy. Among their most
ambitious new projects is one to build a 50-mile undersea pipeline
to carry water from Turkey to the parched Turkish enclave on
northern Cyprus. The pipeline will carry more water than northern
Cyprus can use, and foreign mediators like Richard Holbrooke,
deeply frustrated by their inability to break the political
deadlock on Cyprus, are hoping that the excess water can be sold to
the ethnic Greek republic on the southern part of the island as a
way of promoting peace.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that Turkish President Suleyman Demirel is a
water engineer by profession and entered public life as director of
the State Waterworks Administration. His background and that of his
classmate in engineering school, the late President Turgut Ozal,
have done much to make Turkey so water conscious. Both men
vigorously supported the Southeast Anatolia Project in the 1980s
even though Western countries, including the United States, refused
to provide loans or credits for it because they did not want to
alienate Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important developments in the Middle East in the
last 20 years has been the emergence of a strong partnership
between Turkey and Israel. Both countries have much to gain from
it; for Israel water is among the greatest potential benefits.
Israel is thirsting for water, and Turkey is overflowing with it.
Intensive studies are now under way to see whether tankers,
pipelines or other means can be used to send Turkey's water to its
new Israeli friends.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, the basis for the Turkey-Israel partnership
was laid when Demirel headed the Turkish government and another
water engineer, Yitzhak Rabin, was in power in Israel. ``If we
solve every other problem in the Middle East but do not
satisfactorily resolve the water problem, our region will
explode,'' Rabin once said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Middle Eastern leaders have agreed. The late King Hussein
of Jordan asserted that conflicts over water ``could drive nations
of the region to war.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey may be the world's most water-conscious country, and the
Middle East the region where water issues are most urgent. But
competition for water, and for the power that control of water
represents, is intensifying from Africa and Central Asia to Los
Angeles and the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's population of 5.9 billion will double in the next
40 to 90 years,'' former Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., has written in a
new book titled ``Tapped Out'' that examines global water problems.
``Our water supply, however, is constant,'' he wrote, as ``per
capita water consumption is rising twice as fast as the world's
population. You do not have to be an Einstein to understand that we
are headed toward a potential calamity.''
</P>
<P>
   Countries that control water are likely to be the big winners of
the future. Turkey is among them. Its policies have for years been
shaped by a desire to use water to achieve political aims, and the
policies are beginning to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water has been used as a means of pressure, for example the
Syrians sponsoring Kurdish separatism because they want more
water,'' said Ishak Alaton, a visionary Turkish businessman whose
company has won the contract to build the water pipeline to Cyprus
and is conducting a feasibility study for a pipeline to Israel.
``It can also be used for peace, as we are hoping in Cyprus. You
can't overstate its importance. I firmly believe that just as the
20th century was the century of oil, the 21st century will be the
century of water.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing a painful budget squeeze, Congress seems all
but certain to increase the spending limits that have been a
crucial component of fiscal discipline for the last decade, members
of both parties say.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prospect of huge surpluses over the next decade,
Congress is still operating under spending caps that tightly limit
how much money can be allocated to the military and most domestic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Because the caps will be far tighter for the budget year
starting on Oct. 1 than they have ever been before _ and because
both parties support spending increases for the Pentagon and for
education, among other things _ Republicans and Democrats say there
is no realistic way to avoid shattering the caps or resetting them
at higher levels.
</P>
<P>
   But both parties are reluctant to publicly admit that reality,
fearing that they will be tagged as fiscally irresponsible just as
the nation is shifting to an era of opportunities, created by
rapidly mounting federal surpluses, from one of crippling budget
deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caps have been a good thing because we haven't had to
start each year debating how much to spend, only how to divide it
up,'' said Martha Phillips, executive director of the Concord
Coalition, a fiscal watchdog group. ``If we go back to fighting
over how much to spend, and people are saying that we have $4.8
trillion in surpluses, this could really get out of hand. If you
don't have the caps it just makes it harder for politicians to do
the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering over the spending caps comes as Congress
prepares to begin work in earnest on a budget for next year. The
budget committees that draw up broad spending guidelines and the
appropriations committees that set spending levels for specific
programs are facing unyielding arithmetic that leaves them unable
to keep current programs fully financed, much less add anything
new, if the current limits are kept in place.
</P>
<P>
   The caps for the coming budget year limit discretionary spending
_ the one-third of the federal budget that includes all annually
appropriated programs, from the Pentagon to Head Start _ to $536
billion. The rest of the budget is made up of mandatory spending on
programs like Social Security and Medicare that are nonnegotiable
obligations, plus interest payments on the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   Just to keep programs running at their current levels by
increasing financing only to account for inflation would put
discretionary spending next year at $581 billion, or $45 billion
over the limit, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   If financing were frozen at current dollar levels _ a cut, once
inflation is taken into account _ spending would amount to $562
billion, or $26 billion over the limit, the budget office said.
Even under the most optimistic scenario, stripping out all programs
financed last year by one-time emergency spending and freezing
spending for all other discretionary programs at current dollar
levels, spending would be $546 billion, or $10 billion over the
caps.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are already pushing for new spending. The Senate
passed a bill last week, by a 91-8 vote, giving sweeping pay and
pension increases to the military. The legislation would cost $1.6
billion next year and $55 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and the Senate plan to consider further increases
in military spending, perhaps as much as $20 billion a year. Some
Republicans are calling for sweeping increases in federal spending
on education, a cause long favored by Democrats. And a whole host
of other issues, from aid to farmers to paying for the census and
improving security at embassies abroad, are likely to draw varying
degrees of bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   ``My party is committed to spending restraint,'' said a senior
Republican aide involved in the appropriations process. ``But
trying to build restraint into a system that is crying out for
additional spending is very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   For all practical purposes, the caps were broken by Congress and
the Clinton administration in the budget they agreed to last fall
for the current fiscal year. But they managed to remain within the
spending limits on a technical basis by resorting to a variety of
gimmicks, including labeling nearly $20 billion as emergency
spending that is not subject to the caps.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The spending caps were first used informally in the late 1980s
and were written into law as part of the deficit reduction package
in 1990 under which President Bush agreed to a tax increase. The
caps were updated in the 1997 bipartisan agreement to balance the
budget within five years.
</P>
<P>
   The caps will bite particularly deeply next year because the
1997 budget deal postponed most of the fiscal pain for the last
three years of the plan, meaning, in effect, that the promises of
fiscal rectitude made two years ago are now coming due. The pain is
being exacerbated because the gimmicks agreed to last fall pushed
some of this year's spending onto next year's books.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is also considering proposals to loosen another device
intended to promote fiscal rectitude, known as the ``pay as you
go'' rules. Those rules require that tax cuts be financed only by
offsetting tax increases or by reductions in mandatory spending.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans want to change those rules so that projected
surpluses can be used to pay for tax cuts. Some Republicans have
also discussed changing the rules to allow reductions in
discretionary spending to be used to pay for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But the main focus in Congress now is on the spending caps.
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has been canvassing Republicans
and some Democrats about whether the caps will have to be broken
and, if so, whether it can be done without a partisan fight. Sen.
Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, said he favored keeping
the current caps in place.
</P>
<P>
   The chairmen of the budget committees in both chambers, Sen.
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, are working on
plans to stay within the caps by cutting spending in some areas
even as they propose increases for the Pentagon and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kasich would strongly prefer to adhere to the caps,'' said
Terry Holt, a spokesman for the House Budget Committee. ``If it can
be done, if there is any possible way to do it, we are going to try
and get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   But the chairmen of the appropriations committees in both
chambers, Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, and Rep. C.W. ``Bill'' Young,
R-Fla., have made clear that it will be all but impossible for them
to operate within the caps. And some Republicans admit that it will
be difficult to solve the problems through deep spending cuts, in
part because their own party has little stomach for the political
battle it would entail.
</P>
<P>
   The budget proposal that President Clinton sent Congress earlier
this month managed to propose a host of new programs and stay
within the caps only by employing what Republicans called budgetary
smoke and mirrors. An analysis by the Senate Budget Committee's
Republican staff found that Clinton's budget would exceed the
spending caps by $17.8 billion next year once what they described
as legerdemain was stripped out.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking or increasing the caps would effectively mean dipping
into the budget surplus, which the Congressional Budget Office has
estimated at $107 billion for the current fiscal year and $131
billion for next year.
</P>
<P>
   But in both cases, the entire surplus comes from excess payroll
taxes that are earmarked for Social Security. Factoring out Social
Security, the government will run a deficit of $19 billion this
year and $7 billion next year, according to the budget office.
Members of both parties are increasingly reluctant to dip into
Social Security's money to pay for spending programs, although they
did so freely for most of the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed using about 11 percent of the projected
surpluses over the next 15 years, or about $500 billion, for
increased domestic and military spending _ but only after Congress
and the administration agree on a plan to assure Social Security's
long-term solvency.

   CRACK-LEGACY-I (Victorville, Calif.) _ Every 20 seconds, someone
in the United States is arrested for a drug violation, and every
week, on average, a new jail or prison is built to lock up more
people in what has become the world's largest penal system. It was
not always so. Ten years ago, half as many people were arrested for
drug crimes, and the nation's incarceration rate was closer to
those of other democracies. But in the 1980s the United States was
shaken by crack cocaine, and the criminal justice system has never
been the same. Crack prompted the nation to rewrite its drug laws,
lock up a record number of people, and shift money from schools to
prisons. It transformed police work, hospitals, parental rights,
courts. More than anything, crack changed the makeup of American
prisons. Nearly twice as many whites use crack as blacks, according
to national surveys, but as the war on drugs focused on poor city
neighborhoods, blacks went to prison at a rate far surpassing
whites. (First of two parts.) By Timothy Egan.

book publishers intent on protecting the mystery of their

   MICROSOFT-TRIAL (Undated) _ For Microsoft's witnesses at its

witnesses have come to fear facing Boies, the Justice Department's
trial lawyer, in the government's sweeping antitrust case against
the Microsoft Corp. Time after time, he has caught Microsoft
witnesses off-guard as the words from their mouths on the stand
contradict the statements in internal Microsoft documents and often
their own e-mail. Yet as both sides have now presented their main
evidence, with the last of Microsoft's 12 witnesses having finished

SPORTS COLUMN: A TENSE MATCH-PLAY SEMINAR FOR PROS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ It's how most golfers decide who wins or
loses a few dollars. It's called match play, with the accent on
match because it's more pressure than play.
</P>
<P>
   It's scored hole by hole, meaning you can win, say, 2 and 1
because you're two holes ahead with only one hole remaining, as
opposed to stroke play or medal play, meaning a round, say, of par
72 over 18 holes.
</P>
<P>
   But match play is used so seldom in pro tournaments worldwide
that the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship here has been
a seminar for the pros in this unfamiliar format where anything can
happen. And did.
</P>
<P>
   It's a format more physically draining than the usual weekly
72-hole event, but the pros consider it even more mentally
draining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we have to move somebody who is 300 pounds or
run the 40 in 4.4,'' said Steve Pate before Friday's semifinal
matches. ``But if you stay mentally strong enough, you can get
through the physical part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods discovered that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I feel great, but mentally, I'm pretty tired,''
the world's No. 1-ranked player said upon losing to Jeff Maggert, 2
and 1, after defeating Stewart Cink, 2 and 1, in Friday's double
round. ``I put everything I had into both matches and there just
wasn't enough, I guess, in the afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the first four rounds at the La Costa Resort and Spa, the
match-play format also drained this year's first of three World
Golf Championship events of the top 23 players in the world
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   So Maggert opposed Pate and Andrew Magee dueled John Huston in
Saturday's 18-hole semifinals; the survivors qualified for Sunday's
36-hole title match with $1 million to the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel tired while I'm out there because I have so much
adrenaline in my system,'' Woods said early in the week. ``I know
what I have to do, so I focus on that. But as as soon as it is
over, then you feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as any duffer feels it after losing even a $2 bet. But for
the pros, this first of three World Golf Championship events this
year has been a seminar in match-play philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your strategy on a hole is really determined by what your
opponent is doing,'' Nick Price said after ousting Frankie Minoza
of the Philippines, 4 and 3, in the first round. ``We had a perfect
example on the fifth hole where my drive finished in the first cut
of rough and he drove it in the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit a great shot just short of the green. I pulled my
second shot into the bunker, then hit it up 10 feet and missed the
putt. He had a 5-footer to make, but he missed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like I was going to win the hole off the tee shot,
then it looked even, then he looked like he was going to win it,
but he missed the putt. That is something you have to deal with all
the time. Normally in match play, someone who is a steady player
always seems to do well. Doesn't get too emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, whether you're up or down in the match, don't
get up or down emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole game has always been based on four rounds and
consistency and keeping your cool, playing through your bad
patches,'' Price said. ``But here you can't play through your bad
patches. Here you might lose three or four holes and you are
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Price was down when he lost to Maggert, 1 up, with a
bogey on the 18th hole in the second round. Mano a mano seldom
occurs in golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the tennis tour that well,'' Phil Mickelson said
after eliminating Lee Janzen, 2 and 1, in the second round, ``but I
think it would be very difficult to have good friends in tennis
because it is such a win-or-lose situation. Lee and I are great
friends and yet, to be put in this situation, it's difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weekly 72-hole PGA Tour events, dozens of pros can feel
they played well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it's more cutthroat,'' Mickelson said. ``It is either you
win or you lose. So because we are not used to that, it's difficult
for some of the players to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Match Play began, David Duval sounded as if he
had trouble dealing with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked so hard to get accustomed to using 72 holes to win
a golf tournament, and that takes some adjustment; at least it did
for me,'' the No. 2-ranked player said. ``And now you're facing a
week where you don't have that and you could get beaten very
easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval was one under par through 17 holes in Thursday's second
round but lost, 2 and 1, to Bill Glasson, who was three under.
</P>
<P>
   Another element of match play is the conceded putt, which never
occurs in stroke play because every golfer's ball must be holed
out. But not every short putt is conceded, not even for a halved
hole. Even with a 5-up lead on the 13th green, Craig Stadler didn't
concede Colin Montgomerie's 3-foot putt for a halve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last thing you want to do,'' Stadler said, ``is give it to him
and he birdies the last five. There is no love lost in match
play.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's 36-hole final, all but one of the world's top 64
golfers will have lost in what has amounted to a match-play
seminar.

   LONDON _ Most dramas have their sub-plots, and the talks that
stalled last week over Yugoslavia's torn province of Kosovo were no
exception. While the big theme was war and peace in the Balkans, a
lesser-noted coda was the complicated bond between Prime Minister
Tony Blair's Britain and continental Europe that, just weeks ago,
promised a new hope of containing conflagration on the continent's
doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, of course, has always been an ambivalent European,
seeking to mold the continent's affairs _ often from the sidelines
_ even as it holds onto a special relationship with Washington that
long predates European integration.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this dual vision seems seeded with conflict.
But the course of the Kosovo talks may, in fact, have validated
Blair's desire to keep his options open as he tries to make the
case that Britain is a major player.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of the negotiations on Kosovo until March 15 was
first of all a severe blow to the prestige of U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, who placed her influence on the line for
three straight days in a vain attempt to emulate the U.S.
diplomatic success at Dayton, Ohio, that ended the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   But her very presence at the negotiations _ and the use of the
threat of U.S.-led NATO bombing to get the talks started _
illuminated another reality. Once again, the Americans had taken a
leading role in the negotiations because Europeans, acting by
themselves, could not do it on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever envisioned such talks without the Americans, but
their dominant role at the end was not in the original script,
certainly not as seen from here.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations began under the joint sponsorship of France and
Britain _ the two countries that would provide the bulk of a
NATO-led ground force (along with U.S. Russian and other troops) to
police a peace settlement. The French and British readiness to
commit those forces was seen here as a token not just of Europe's
frustration at past U.S. diplomatic high-handedness in the Balkans,
but also of a desire to make a new start after the tragic blunders
of the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we are seeing a greater effort by the Europeans to
see that they get it right and do not leave it all to the
Americans,'' Charles Grant, director of the Center for European
Reform, a research group regarded as close to Blair's New Labor
government, said as the talks got under way. That in itself was a
departure from the earlier days of European embroilment in the
breakup of Yugoslavia, when Germany was singled out for its
diplomatic clumsiness and Dutch troops under the United Nations
flag stood by at the massacre at Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   More important, this new sense of joint European endeavor was
being ignited just weeks after 11 European nations (including
France, but not Britain) launched their single currency, the euro.
This accomplishment had challenged Britain to rethink its
relationships to the Continent.
</P>

   Only last week, Blair nudged his country closer to eventual
adoption of the euro by setting out a tentative schedule for
joining. But he hedged his plan with so many economic and political
caveats that, even if Britons do overcome their aversion to
abandoning the cherished pound, their country almost certainly
would be the last of the four hold-outs to enter the euro-zone.
</P>
<P>
   The broader implications of that hesitancy had long been
apparent to Blair. As the advent of the new currency approached, he
sensed that Britain might wind up on the sidelines. But he had an
alternative strategy: to emphasize Britain's military and
diplomatic leadership, building on what Britain sees as a
privileged position in Washington that enhances its ability to mold
Europe's destiny.
</P>
<P>
   That was one element in the decision to offer a new European
initiative in the Balkans. When Blair traveled to the French town
of St. Malo late last year to meet Lionel Jospin, his French
counterpart, he was ``frustrated that the Americans were running
the show on Kosovo and the Europeans were not,'' said Grant. The
result was the so-called ``St. Malo initiative'' _ an effort to
forge a common European defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   But now, a French diplomat remarked the other day, it seems that
the initiative's first tests came a little too soon. Not only did
the Americans turn out to have played a larger role than
anticipated in the Kosovo talks, but Britain made it abundantly
clear that its European commitment was intended to complement, not
replace, the time-tested ties to Washington that some British
critics depict as a slavish readiness to do Uncle Sam's bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Alone among its supposed European partners, Britain sent its
warplanes to bomb Iraq last December, while the rest of Europe _
France in particular _ looked on disapprovingly. And while Blair
and Jospin foresaw the creation of a pan-European defense industry
as part of their initiative, two of Britain's biggest defense
contractors went their own way last month, announcing a merger that
left potential French and German suitors smarting.
</P>
<P>
   As ever, Britain seems to be carving out its own role _ European
by trade and geography, but not in its soul, an island only 22
miles from France that feels closer in strategic and economic
philosophy to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fundamental political and historical differences in
the perception of security'' separating Britain and its European
partners, said Col. Terence Taylor of the International Institute
for Strategic Studies. ``And because of these fundamental
differences, Britain can stand with the United States where others
cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after last month's British defense merger, Josef Joffe,
a German newspaper columnist in Munich, remarked that the deal
``will keep Britain going as a global player, which in some
respects is more important than being a European power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe is doing well on economic integration, but it will not
be a strategic partner for some time to come,'' he said.

   LONDON _ Most dramas have their sub-plots, and the talks that
stalled last week over Yugoslavia's torn province of Kosovo were no
exception. While the big theme was war and peace in the Balkans, a
lesser-noted coda was the complicated bond between Prime Minister
Tony Blair's Britain and continental Europe that, just weeks ago,
promised a new hope of containing conflagration on the continent's
doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, of course, has always been an ambivalent European,
seeking to mold the continent's affairs _ often from the sidelines
_ even as it holds onto a special relationship with Washington that
long predates European integration.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this dual vision seems seeded with conflict.
But the course of the Kosovo talks may, in fact, have validated
Blair's desire to keep his options open as he tries to make the
case that Britain is a major player.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of the negotiations on Kosovo until March 15 was
first of all a severe blow to the prestige of U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, who placed her influence on the line for
three straight days in a vain attempt to emulate the U.S.
diplomatic success at Dayton, Ohio, that ended the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   But her very presence at the negotiations _ and the use of the
threat of U.S.-led NATO bombing to get the talks started _
illuminated another reality. Once again, the Americans had taken a
leading role in the negotiations because Europeans, acting by
themselves, could not do it on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever envisioned such talks without the Americans, but
their dominant role at the end was not in the original script,
certainly not as seen from here.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations began under the joint sponsorship of France and
Britain _ the two countries that would provide the bulk of a
NATO-led ground force (along with U.S. Russian and other troops) to
police a peace settlement. The French and British readiness to
commit those forces was seen here as a token not just of Europe's
frustration at past U.S. diplomatic high-handedness in the Balkans,
but also of a desire to make a new start after the tragic blunders
of the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we are seeing a greater effort by the Europeans to
see that they get it right and do not leave it all to the
Americans,'' Charles Grant, director of the Center for European
Reform, a research group regarded as close to Blair's New Labor
government, said as the talks got under way. That in itself was a
departure from the earlier days of European embroilment in the
breakup of Yugoslavia, when Germany was singled out for its
diplomatic clumsiness and Dutch troops under the United Nations
flag stood by at the massacre at Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   More important, this new sense of joint European endeavor was
being ignited just weeks after 11 European nations (including
France, but not Britain) launched their single currency, the euro.
This accomplishment had challenged Britain to rethink its
relationships to the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, Blair nudged his country closer to eventual
adoption of the euro by setting out a tentative schedule for
joining. But he hedged his plan with so many economic and political
caveats that, even if Britons do overcome their aversion to
abandoning the cherished pound, their country almost certainly

   PARIS _ With Serbian troops apparently disregarding a NATO
ultimatum to stop fighting in Kosovo and withdraw from the southern
Serbian province or face air attacks, the allies could face the
gravest test of their credibility since they forced a settlement of
the war in Bosnia more than three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, the allies have been insisting since last spring
that they would not stand by and watch, as they did for years in
Bosnia, while Serbian forces committed atrocities against
civilians. Yet not even the threat of 400 bombers, including
B-52's, has been able to get the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, to agree to accept a force of 28,000 international
peacekeepers for Kosovo as part of a settlement that would provide
autonomy for the province.
</P>
<P>
   With the threats aimed primarily against the Serbs, the military
leaders of the ethnic Albanians who are fighting for independence
for the province, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian, defied
warnings from the Clinton administration and its European allies
that bombing would only go ahead if the Serbian side was clearly
the main obstacle to an accord.
</P>
<P>
   Threat may have turned to bluster last Tuesday after the peace
talks in Rambouillet castle on the outskirts of Paris broke off
with only half-agreement by the Albanian side.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the alliance's secretary general in Brussels,
Javier Solana, still has the authority the allies gave him on Jan.
28 to launch devastating attacks against Serbian forces. If the
Serbs now launch large-scale attacks that produce numerous Albanian
victims, Solana could come under heavy pressure from Washington to
give the order.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the European allies would clearly support military
action now looks more doubtful than it did a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the credibility of the allied threat the only ambiguity.
``Everyone agrees that peacekeepers should be neither a substitute
for the Kosovo Liberation Army nor an occupying force for the
benefit of the Serbs,'' a senior French diplomat said, but the
allies would be taking on a difficult balancing act on an unsteady
tightrope if they went in.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the NATO peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, in Kosovo allied
soldiers, and others including Russian troops who would be expected
to go in with them, would be operating on the territory of a
foreign country, Serbia, that does not want them there.
</P>
<P>
   And though most of the two million ethnic Albanians do want
alliance troops in Kosovo, among the first things the peacekeepers
would have to do is to fan out throughout the province and oversee
the disarmament and disbanding of the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
main rebel force.
</P>
<P>
   The independence for which they are fighting is not an objective
the peacekeeping force supports. In effect, the force would take
over responsibility for the internal security of the province from
the Serbian authorities who abolished its autonomy 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the Serbian side, the peacekeepers would be expected to
oversee the withdrawal of more than 15,000 Serbian military units,
and about that many special police troops, from the province.
</P>
<P>
   During the Rambouillet talks, however, the Serbs used the time
to build up their forces in the area, moving some 4,500 heavily
armored troops along the border with Kosovo. The rebels, too, took
advantage of this time to regroup and rearm.
</P>
<P>
   The draft accord, officials say, provides for 2,500 Serbian
troops to patrol Kosovo's border with Albania during the three
years the peacekeepers would be in the province, which will remain
formally a part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the end of those three years, the peacekeepers would _
what, withdraw?
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to play for time,'' a French strategist said in
explaining the plan recently. The hope seems to be that in three
years Serbia's leader, Milosevic, who has vowed to keep Kosovo a
part of Serbia forever, may be gone and more reasonable voices will
be in power.
</P>
<P>
   The hope seems far-fetched. Serbs have considered Kosovo sacred
ground since Prince Lazar lost the Battle of Kosovo Field to the
Turks in 1389.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, what the alliance proposes to take on is the task of
trying to reconcile the Albanians in Kosovo with the harsh reality
of continuing Serbian sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians in Kosovo expect the alliance to protect them from
the Serbs, but the danger is that in time the Albanians could come
to see the peacekeepers as de facto surrogates for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   And at the end of the three-year period, there is no guarantee
that the ethnic Albanian population would get the independence that
many there seek.
</P>
<P>
   It took 60,000 NATO soldiers _ led by about 20,000 Americans and
an American general _ going into Bosnia in December 1995 to carry
out a peace accord signed by Milosevic and leaders of the Croatian
and Bosnian Muslim sides in that conflict.
</P>
<P>
   All the parties were exhausted after years of fighting; the
Serbs had begun losing their war with the Croats and even to lose
some ground they had taken earlier from the Bosnian Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo there is no such exhaustion, and there will be no such
American force. This time the 4,000 Americans who would go into
Kosovo would be under the orders of a British force commander,
though he would report to Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the American
supreme allied commander in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   For the alliance, this would be a new situation, one reflecting,
finally, the European desire to take strategic responsibility for
the security of Europe's own backyard in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The West decided last month that it would not tolerate war over
the issue of independence for Kosovo. But it may yet have to make
war with Serbia to get it to accept autonomy. Even then, it may
have to tolerate leaving peacekeepers in Kosovo for so long that
they outstay their welcome, if the Albanian population sees no hope
of eventual independence.

<P>
   VICTORVILLE, Calif. _ Every 20 seconds, someone in the United
States is arrested for a drug violation. Every week, on average, a
new jail or prison is built to lock up more people in the world's
largest penal system.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always so. Ten years ago, half as many people were
arrested for drug crimes, and the nation's incarceration rate was
closer to those of other democracies. But in the 1980s crack
cocaine scared the country, and the criminal justice system has
never been the same.
</P>
<P>
   Crack poisoned many communities. Dealers turned neighborhoods
into drug markets. As heavily armed gangs fought over turf, murder
rates shot up. Authorities warned that crack was instantly
addictive and spreading rapidly, and predicted that a generation of
crack babies would bear the drug's imprint. It looked like a
nightmare with no end.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the havoc wreaked by crack, the worst fears were not
realized. Crack appealed mainly to hard-core drug users. The number
of crack users began falling not long after surveys began counting
them. A decade later, the violence of the crack trade has burned
out, and murder rates have plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Yet crack left its mark, in ways that few people anticipated.
Crack prompted the nation to rewrite its drug laws, lock up a
record number of people and shift money from schools to prisons. It
transformed police work, hospitals, parental rights, courts.
</P>
<P>
   Crack also changed the racial makeup of U.S. prisons. More
whites than blacks use crack, according to surveys, but as the war
on drugs focused on poor city neighborhoods, blacks went to prison
at a far higher rate. In California, five black men are behind bars
for each one in a state university.
</P>
<P>
   But the harsh laws responding to crack have not reduced overall
drug use. And now the ceaseless march of new drug offenders and the
mounting costs of prisons are moving some of the people charged
with enforcing the punitive laws to question the assumptions behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a failed social policy and it has to be
re-evaluated,'' said Barry McCaffrey, the four-star general who
heads the National Drug Control Policy Office. ``Otherwise, we're
going to bankrupt ourselves. Because we can't incarcerate our way
out of this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter-million Americans in prison for drug
offenses could be better dealt with in treatment programs, he said,
saving up to $5 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985 the nation's jail and prison population has grown 130
percent, and it will soon pass 2 million, even as crime rates
continue a six-year decline. No country has more people behind
bars, and only one, Russia, has a higher incarceration rate,
according to the Sentencing Project, which tracks prison rates.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the increase is a national get-tough mood that has
produced longer sentences for all criminals and the end of parole
in many states. Polls show that most Americans favor lengthy terms
for violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest single factor is the systematic jailing
of drug offenders. In the first 10 years after Congress toughened
drug laws in response to crack, the number of people imprisoned for
drugs grew more than 400 percent, nearly twice the growth rate for
violent criminals. More people are behind bars for drug offenses in
the United States _ about 400,000 _ than are in prison for all
crimes in England, France, Germany and Japan combined.
</P>
<P>
   Crack's legacy can be seen in nearly every corner of the land,
even in the Mojave Desert, where the newest federal prison is
rising at the dusty edge of Victorville. In an age of government
downsizing, the federal corrections budget has grown more than
tenfold in a decade, to nearly $4 billion, yet prisons are so
stuffed with drug offenders that this one will be at capacity
almost from the day it opens.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts argue what might seem obvious: that high
incarceration rates deserve the credit for falling crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting people in prison has been the single most important
thing we've done to reduce crime,'' Dr. James Q. Wilson, the
political scientist whose ideas have influenced police departments
for a generation, has written.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the police and prosecutors say locking up thousands
of drug offenders was a major factor in the city's turning the
corner on crime. ``What plays havoc with a neighborhood are the
low-level dealers,'' said Bridget Brennan, the Special Narcotics
Prosecutor for New York. ``When they take over a street or a stoop,
everyone else is terrified. When you put those people in jail, it
gives the community a sense that order has been restored.''
</P>
<P>
   What the prison boom has not done, however, is reduce illicit
drug use, national surveys show. Far fewer Americans use illegal
drugs now than in the peak years of the 1970s. But almost all of
the drop occurred before crack cocaine or the laws passed in
response to it.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, for
1997, estimated that about 14 million people had used an illegal
drug in the last month, a number barely changed since 1988. Of
those, 600,000 had smoked crack within a month, unchanged since
1988. But during that time, imprisonment rates soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened across the board is that police started going
after small-time street dealers and users,'' said Dr. Steven
Belenko, a criminologist at the National Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Crack never became a mainstream drug, but the fear of it changed
perception and laws for virtually all illicit drugs, according to
Belenko and others who have studied the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crack probably had more impact on the entire criminal justice
system than it had on the communities and the drug users,'' said
Dr. Franklin Zimring, director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute
at the University of California School of Law. ``This secondary
impact, on police and prisons, may end up being more negative than
anything associated with the drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Among governors, teachers, criminologists and police chiefs,
there is vigorous debate over how the drug laws enacted at the
height of the crack panic have transformed the nation. But in
Congress, which enacted the laws without a single hearing, there is
nothing. For crack has left one other major legacy: The policy
discussion in Washington on prisons and drugs has been frozen for
more than a decade.

<P>
   The Evidence
</P>
<P>
   As Crime Rate Falls, More Prisons Are Built
</P>
<P>
   The little towns tucked into the folds of the Appalachian
Mountains in Schuylkill County, Pa., are a world removed from the
city streets where crack cocaine was a media obsession in the
mid-1980s. But the legacy of crack is all around.
</P>
<P>
   A first-year teacher there can expect to make $18,500 a year,
the state-mandated minimum. A prison-guard trainee is paid $22,300.
The job of watching over the drug offenders and others who are
filling three new state prisons in the region is coveted.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania might not seem the kind of place where prisons and
jails would be booming. The state has an aging population. Crime
has never been a particularly big problem; among the states,
Pennsylvania has ranked near the bottom. But every year for the
last 14 years, Pennsylvania has added at least one prison, and the
corrections budget has soared to more than $1 billion a year, a
fivefold increase over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, not long before President George Bush spoke to the
nation about the war on drugs while holding up a bag of crack,
Pennsylvania radically changed its drug laws, establishing
mandatory minimum sentences for people caught with illicit drugs.
No time off for first-time offenders. No community service. No
treatment for addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania was following the lead of Congress, which had set
the nation on a course of strict incarceration for drug users with
laws enacted in 1986 and 1988. Ten years later, its inmate
population had grown 225 percent, to 35,600. Pennsylvania spends an
average of $20,000 a year for each one, about the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican, has no plans to change the
incarceration policy. ``Every public expenditure comes with a
choice,'' said his spokesman, Tim Reeves. ``We defend the choices
we've made.''
</P>
<P>
   The crime rate might not be so low if the state had not locked
up so many drug offenders, Reeves said. ``What would the rate be if
those guys were not in jail?'' he said. ``Think about the cost to
the community, the wasted lives and violent crime.''
</P>
<P>
   But in building a penal system in which three of every 10 new
prisoners are serving time for drugs, according to the Pennsylvania
Sentencing Commission, which tracks prison rates for the state,
Pennsylvania, like most states, has not reduced illegal drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody believes it has turned out to be an
effective policy,'' said David Sweet, a Harrisburg lawyer who
headed a special commission that examined the state's prison
growth. ``It appeared to us that we were using a very expensive way
to provide secure housing for people who probably don't belong in
prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julia Glover Hall, a criminologist at Drexel University and
president of the Pennsylvania Prison Society, which Benjamin
Franklin established to monitor prisons and jails, said: ``It's a
stupid game we're playing. We're locking up all these nonviolent
offenders, pouring money down a rat hole.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I've been a crime victim. I'm not soft on
criminals. But we have to look at the bottom line of what we're
doing. There was this powerful scare in the crack years, and all
across the country we passed these Draconian laws. Now we're
starting to see how much it has cost the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania is typical of what has happened across the country.
California is spending nearly $4 billion a year to operate the
nation's largest prison system. As the state added 21 prisons since
1984 _ and only one university campus _ violent criminals fell to
42 percent of the prison population in 1997, from 57 percent, while
drug inmates grew to 27 percent, from 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders have debated whether the building boom was at
the expense of their budget's other big discretionary item, higher
education. Many politicians said the state would try to fully
finance both. But the numbers tell another story.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on prisons has grown 60 percent over a decade, and pay
for prison guards has more than doubled. For higher education,
there was virtually no growth, and salaries in the state university
system stagnated, falling behind other states. A prison guard now
makes about $51,000 a year, while a first-year professor in
California's once-vaunted university system is paid $41,000.
</P>
<P>
   As the prison budget swelled, California raised tuition to make
up the university financing gap. Over the last 10 years, as the
state's population grew by 5 million people, state university
enrollment fell by 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in priorities, documented in a number of studies, has
become a major issue since a new governor, Gray Davis, and a new
Legislature took office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our buildings are literally falling apart and we've
lost 1,500 full-time faculty members,'' said Jeri Bledsoe, general
manager of the California Faculty Association. ``You bet there's
been a price to pay for our prison boom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Convicted
</P>
<P>
   $40 Worth of Cocaine Brings a Life Sentence
</P>
<P>
   The biggest legacy of crack is out of sight, behind the concrete
and steel of prisons. Addicts, couriers, girlfriends of dealers,
people tempted by the lure of a quick buck, mostly poor blacks _
these are the dominant profiles of the people jailed since prisons
started filling with drug criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the maximum-security unit at the state prison for women
in Topeka, Kan., Gloria Van Winkle is in the sixth year of a life
term for possessing $40 worth of cocaine. A mother of two and a
drug addict, she had two convictions for cocaine possession when a
convicted thief told undercover agents she was smoking crack and
they set up a sting.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas has all but forgotten about Ms. Van Winkle. Asked about
her case, the state Sentencing Commission said no one was doing
life for drug possession. ``Only murderers get life sentences in
Kansas,'' said its executive director, Barbara Tombs.
</P>
<P>
   On further review, Ms. Tombs found that, yes, for a brief period
in the early '90s, a person convicted of three drug offenses could
get life. That law was changed. Ms. Van Winkle's sentence was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't laugh anymore, I can't cry _ it's just a slow rage
that makes me numb,'' Ms. Van Winkle said. Her sentence offers an
eventual chance of parole, but for now, she lives for visits from
her children, ages 10 and 6, and wonders what they will grow up to
be like with her behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her concern is shared by many others: Three-fourths of the
54,000 women jailed for drug crimes have children.
</P>
<P>
   The police and prosecutors said Ms. Van Winkle should have been
aware of the possibility of a life sentence. They said she was
chosen because they thought she might lead them to dealers, but no
follow-up arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Van Winkle's case is rare but not unique. Because of
three-strikes laws and other changes made in the last decade,
people in several other states are serving life sentences for drug
possession. More typical among women convicted of drug offenses are
5- and 10-year mandatory terms.
</P>
<P>
   Tonya Drake, a mother of four, had no criminal record or history
of drug use when she was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison
for mailing a package that contained crack cocaine. She says a
friend paid her $44 to mail the package, which she did not know
contained drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Drake admits what she did was wrong. ``But the time does not
fit the crime,'' she said in a prison interview. ``You lock me up
for 10 years. While I'm here, my father dies, my children grow up,
it cost thousands of dollars to keep me behind bars.''
</P>
<P>
   The children are having considerable trouble growing up with
their mother in prison, said Ms. Drake's sister, Williet Mitchell.
``Tonya was taken away from the kids at a time when everybody
needed her,'' Ms. Mitchell said. ``Now the kids are screwed up.
They're angry and bitter that she was forced to leave them.''
</P>
<P>
   When the children see their mother in the prison visiting room,
Ms. Drake tries to explain what brought her there. ``I tell my kids
I did something wrong, that it was a mistake,'' she said. ``But it
was my first and only mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, Louie Cordell, a 55-year-old father of nine with no
prior convictions, is finishing a mandatory five-year federal
sentence for growing 141 marijuana plants.
</P>
<P>
   Cordell was sent to prison under the 1986 law that set mandatory
five- and 10-year sentences for the possession or sale of small
amounts of crack. For marijuana, the law set a mandatory sentence
of five years for possession of 100 plants, whether they were
seedlings or 6 feet tall. That provision has since been changed to
go by weight.
</P>
<P>
   The law punished Cordell, but it hit his family just as hard. He
worked seasonally at a sawmill in a poor county in southeastern
Kentucky and was growing the marijuana to help make ends meet, said
his wife, Shirley.
</P>
<P>
   Since Cordell went to prison, a son gave up plans to attend
college on a scholarship, in order to help support the family, and
the Cordells have been on and off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to describe what's happened to us except to say
that it's been bad in all ways,'' Mrs. Cordell said. ``Louie was
here providing for us and then they took him away. I expected him
to get some time for what he did, but not five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana was never mentioned in the floor speeches in Congress
when the drug laws were rewritten in 1986, but the new penalties
for crack were accompanied by harsher sentences for most drugs. Ten
years later, more people were sentenced under the federal system
for marijuana than for any other drug.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of harsh penalties argue that locking up the Louie
Cordells of the world has a deterrent effect and say convictions
reduce other crimes associated with drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana arrests set a record in 1997 _ 695,200, nearly 90
percent of which were for simple possession. And marijuana remains,
by far, the most popular illegal drug: 18 million Americans used
marijuana at least once in 1997, according to the National
Household Survey. And some 71 million, 33 percent of those over age
12, have used marijuana at some time.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about deterrence, the federal prosecutor in Cordell's
case, David Marye, said marijuana cultivation does not seem to have
diminished in rural Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been prosecuting cases, state and federal, for 21 years,
and we have so many people who keep doing what Louie Cordell was
doing that it makes you wonder if we'll ever stop them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cities
</P>
<P>
   Racial Implications of the Crack Laws
</P>
<P>
   One of every 20 Americans born this year will serve time in
prison, according to a Justice Department study. For blacks, the
projection is one in four. By 1996, 8.3 percent of black men age 25
to 29 were inmates, compared with 0.8 percent of white men that
age.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of going to prison used to be more even. But the
criminal justice system's special treatment of crack cocaine
dramatically threw off the balance, according to reports by the
Sentencing Commission and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   For people convicted of a crack offense, the world of justice is
unlike any other. Crack is simply cocaine processed so that it can
be smoked. But federal law equates 5 grams of crack with 500 grams
of powder cocaine, a 1-to-100 ratio that no other country
recognizes. Possessing 5 grams of crack is a felony with an
automatic five-year prison term, while 5 grams of the same drug in
powder form is a misdemeanor likely to carry no jail time.
</P>
<P>
   One consequence of the disparity is that kingpins at the top of
a drug network who sell pounds of powder cocaine for processing
often serve less time than street-level dealers who sell grams of
crack.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great victims of the drug war is that our sense of
penal proportion has been thrown out,'' said Zimring, of the
University of California School of Law. ``Now we have a fairness
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a law aimed at one type of drug use has been
applied most often against one type of user _ urban blacks.
</P>
<P>
   A higher percentage of blacks use crack cocaine than whites or
Hispanic people. But in absolute numbers, twice as many whites as
blacks use crack, and three times as many whites as blacks use
powder cocaine, the national household survey shows.
</P>
<P>
   As the war on drugs set up special penalties on crack, however,
law enforcement focused on the highly visible, often violent crack
trade in city neighborhoods, rather than the larger traffic in
cocaine going on behind closed doors across the country. The
result: Nearly 90 percent of the people locked up for crack under
federal drug laws are black, McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   In state prisons, blacks make up nearly 60 percent of the people
serving time on drug offenses, according to Justice Department
figures, though they are only 12 percent of the general population
and 15 percent of regular drug users.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we got into this fix because of racism,''
McCaffrey said. ``The impact of crack on the African-American
community was devastating. And that's where enforcement has been
concentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   The racial disparity would disappear if the law treated the
powder and crack forms of cocaine equally, said Dr. Douglas
McDonald, a senior scientist at Abt Associates, a social policy
research group in Cambridge, Mass., who testified before Congress.
If enforcement were evenly applied, more whites than blacks would
go to prison, he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So for many blacks the legacy of crack is not just the violence
and high prison rates that have hit so many communities, but a
heightened sense that the law does not treat them fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have so many people who feel hopeless, who feel that it is
extremely unfair that so many low-level offenders are going to jail
for such a long time,'' said Mattie Compton, a black community
leader in Fort Worth, Texas, who is deputy chief assistant U.S.
attorney for the civil division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're going to lose people in poor neighborhoods, but
when you see people who are prospects for future leaders going away
to jail for so long, you wonder if we really are a community under
siege,'' Ms. Compton said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the legacy of crack in the Roxbury district of
Boston, where he works with drug addicts at a community health
center, Seward Hunter said: ``If you're African-American, you
expect to be targeted by the police and you expect to be stopped
and searched.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in Congress say there is no racial intent behind the
disparity between crack and powder. Crack is punished more severely
because of the harm it does and because of the violent crimes
associated with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should forget that crack traffickers deal in death, and
that they do so to the most vulnerable among us, the residents of
our inner cities,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., chairman of
the House Subcommittee on Crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Change
</P>
<P>
   Crack Makes News; Congress Responds
</P>
<P>
   How Congress came to write a law that allows a person caught
with 400 grams of powder cocaine, worth some $40,000, to do less
than a year in jail, while a person holding the same amount of
cocaine in crack form will spend 10 years in prison, is a mystery
to people who have tried to research the statutory intent.
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer who was instrumental in rewriting the drug laws in
1986 and 1988 says it came about through whim and attempts by
politicians to one-up each other as crack seized headlines just
before elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a level of hysteria that led to a total breakdown of
the legislative process,'' said the lawyer, Eric Sterling, who as a
lead lawyer on the House Judiciary Committee wrote the laws that
established long mandatory terms for several drugs. Since leaving
the Judiciary Committee in 1989, Sterling has worked to overturn
the laws as president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1986, crack was just starting to be labeled as
an epidemic when a college basketball star, Len Bias, died of a
drug overdose, reportedly crack cocaine. Speaker Tip O'Neill, whose
hometown team, the Boston Celtics, had drafted Bias, ordered an
overhaul of federal drug laws. The death of Bias was invoked in
Congress 11 times.
</P>
<P>
   The law, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, passed the House with
only 16 dissenting votes. Despite complaints by some senators that
no one had studied the bill, it sailed through the Senate and
President Ronald Reagan signed it before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, court testimony revealed that Bias had died of an
overdose of powder cocaine, not crack. But by then crack had its
special status in state and federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Crack was singled out for good reason, according to Edwin Meese,
the attorney general in the mid-1980s and now the Ronald Reagan
Distinguished Fellow of Public Policy at the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative research organization in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crack cocaine was the scourge of the inner city,'' he said.
``The reason laws were changed was to protect the inner city.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Congress passed another overhaul of drug laws just
before the election, singling out crack as the only drug to carry a
mandatory five-year prison term for possession.
</P>
<P>
   That year, a Gallup poll found that 62 percent of Americans
surveyed agreed that to curb drug use they ``would be willing to
give up some freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Crack was on the cover of news magazines, dominated television
and newspaper coverage, and was labeled ``America's drug of
choice,'' by NBC. The New York Times reported that crack was
spreading to the suburbs. William Bennett, the drug czar for 18
months under President Bush, said it might soon invade every home
in America. Crack was compared to the bubonic plague and called
``the most addictive drug known to man'' in Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   Today, few of the revisionist experts on drug laws dispute
crack's link to violence and gangs. ``It was a nightmare,''
McCaffrey said. ``It was World War III.''
</P>
<P>
   But crack was never America's drug of choice _ it did not come
close. At the height of concern in the late 1980s, the National
Household Survey on Drugs estimated that less than one-half of 1
percent of the population over age 12 used crack once a month,
while 10 percent used marijuana. And three out of four high school
seniors who tried crack did not continue to use it, according to a
national survey of students by the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Both surveys have flaws, underestimating inner-city users and
high school dropouts. But even after the findings for high use in
certain urban areas are adjusted, crack was never the epidemic it
was held up to be.
</P>
<P>
   The media attention was so hyperbolic that the Drug Enforcement
Administration was compelled to correct the record. ``Crack is
currently the subject of considerable media attention,'' the agency
said in 1986. ``The result has been a distortion of the public
perception of the extent of crack use as compared to the use of
other drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although crack was labeled the world's most addictive drug, 10
years of national surveys have shown that most people who try crack
do not continue to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its intense but short-lived effect, crack does tend
to make its users ``psychologically dependent,'' reported a Justice
Department study. But numerous studies have shown that crack, like
the powder form of cocaine, may be less physically addictive than
alcohol or tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The Pyramid
</P>
<P>
   Lower-Level Dealers Feel the Sting of Laws
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders said harsh sentencing laws were intended to
deter use of the most dangerous drugs, with crack at the top of the
list. Failing that, they said, the laws would at least go after
drug kingpins. But statistics show a different pattern among people
sentenced to prison for drugs since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Of the people jailed by the federal government for crack
offenses, only 5 percent were considered high-level dealers,
according to a study by the Sentencing Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current policy focuses law-enforcement efforts on the
lowest level of the distribution line, the street-level dealer,''
the commission's vice chairman, Michael Gelacak, wrote. ``Unless we
ignore all evidence to the contrary, the current policy has little
or no impact upon the drug abuse problem. The jails are full.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the crack laws say the numbers are explained by
the pyramid structure of drug operations; by nature they have few
people at the top, lots of people at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   But those at the top are often dealing powder cocaine, with its
vastly different penalties. And they are in a position to become
informers, the only real hope of beating a mandatory prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Had Tonya Drake, the woman serving 10 years for mailing a
package, been able to supply what the law labels ``substantial
assistance'' _ information on a high-level dealer _ she might have
reduced her sentence. The 1980s drug laws leave discretion in the
hands of prosecutors to encourage people to ``snitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Drake identified the man who gave her the package, but he
was never found. The prosecutor decided her assistance was not
substantial. The fixed sentences have infuriated judges, who say
they feel their role has been reduced to that of rubber stamps for
prosecutors, while their courts are clogged with low- to
medium-level drug offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're dealing with first-time offenders, you should have
some discretion,'' said Lawrence Irving, a former federal judge
from San Diego. ``I had cases where I was forced to give more jail
time for low-level offenders than for the kingpins. It made no
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 case in Chicago, Marvin Aspen, a U.S. District Court
judge, labeled his sentencings ``a farce'' as he sent the lowest
and ``least culpable'' member of a big crack operation to prison
for longer than a supplier at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Boguille, the 20-year-old mother of a baby girl, was
sentenced to 10 years for occasionally counting money for her
boyfriend, a crack dealer. L.C. Godfrey, one of the ring's
wholesale suppliers of cocaine, who was deemed helpful to
prosecutors, received nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer of the U.S. Supreme Court said recently
that federal judges should regain some of the discretion they once
had. Five years ago, Chief Justice William Rehnquist made similar
points in condemning the mandatory minimum sentences established by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of federal judges, most of them former prosecutors, have
taken a strong stand against mandatory minimum drug sentences. For
these judges, the most significant legacy of crack is a legal
system that has left them as little more than spectators in their
own courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Aftermath
</P>
<P>
   The Penalties Outlive Fear of an Epidemic
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey says he came to the drug debate with an open mind but
has become convinced that current policies, with the primary
emphasis on imprisonment, are failing. ``The current system is bad
drug policy and bad law enforcement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On cost alone, arresting, prosecuting and locking up all drug
criminals at the price of about $35 billion a year is not
effective, he said. He now favors long sentences for dealers and
treatment for low-level users.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Rand Corp. concluded that mandatory jail terms
are the least cost-effective way of reducing cocaine consumption.
For violent crimes, long sentences keep criminals off the street,
it reported, but for drug crimes, ``a jailed supplier is often
replaced by another supplier.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug treatment also has a low success rate; among regular users
of cocaine who undergo treatment, only one in eight stops. But even
that would achieve a greater reduction in cocaine use _ at a
fraction of the cost _ than prison, the Rand study stated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We misread a lot what was going on in the 1980s, in that we
thought crack use was going to grow and take over society,'' said
Dr. Jonathan Caulkins, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University,
who conducted the study. ``The real tragedy is that now that it's
clear that crack was not the epidemic it was supposed to be, we
still have these laws.''
</P>
<P>
   But few authorities on crime expect the laws to change, no
matter how full the prisons become. ``For politicians, the drug
debate is driven by the three R's _ retribution, revenge,
retaliation _ and that leads to the fourth R, re-election,'' said
Dr. James Alan Fox, dean of the college of criminal justice at
Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the Clinton administration announced a plan to cut
drug use in half by 2007. After years of reduced federal financing
for drug rehabilitation, it would increase money for treating
addicts.
</P>
<P>
   The war metaphor has been dropped by the White House, and by
some in Congress as well. But the emphasis on long mandatory prison
terms and locking up small-time dealers remains the main strategy
for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is crucial, given our continuing struggle in the
war on drugs, that we send an unwavering and unambiguous message to
all Americans, and our children in particular, that the sale of
illegal drugs is dangerous, wrong and will not be tolerated,'' said
Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., a member of the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham has introduced a bill that would establish much longer
sentences for people convicted of powder cocaine offenses, making
them closer to crack.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that bill would do is lock up a bigger batch of small
fry,'' said Julie Stewart, a former member of the conservative Cato
Institute, who founded Families Against Mandatory Minimums after
her brother was sent to prison on a marijuana conviction. The group
has 37,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   But with polls showing that most Americans favor long prison
terms for drug trafficking, attempts to persuade Congress to
reconsider the laws have gone nowhere. Sentiment has remained the
same for nearly a decade, dating to a time when some politicians
predicted that the United States could be drug-free by the year
2000. Nobody makes such a prediction these days.

AN INDUSTRY IS BORN: MONICA LEWINSKY INC. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Israel, France, Great Britain, Australia, Germany, Italy)  (mk) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it Monica Inc. From the New York base of this sprawling
global concern, sales are still being tallied for its complete line
of pay-for-angst products.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore and Israeli television stations have made investments
and await shrink-wrapped, tamper-proof videotapes of a 50-minute
interview with Monica Lewinsky, which will be delivered by special
couriers only to registered recipients.
</P>
<P>
   French television has scornfully passed up the opportunity for a
video confessional, but the magazine Paris Match has bought first
serial rights to publish an excerpt from Ms. Lewinsky's coming book
of woe, ``Monica's Story'' (St. Martin's Press, $24.95), which
comes with a bonus interview with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Publications like the British gossip magazine Hello have paid
for vivid color photo spreads of Ms. Lewinsky that include a
pensive portrait of her, nestled on a striped, overstuffed sofa
with downcast eyes, a basket of yarn below her, knitting.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing knit-and-purl about the furious pace of
business swirling about Ms. Lewinsky, whose advisers have even
considered an Internet chat site about her that would seek
advertising. As the dates approach this week for ABC's two-hour
interview and publication of the book about her travails, other
related deals are still being counted.
</P>
<P>
   For investors in this venture, though, the critical question
remains: Just how keen is consumer demand for more Monica?
</P>
<P>
   The new book, written by the biographer of Diana, Princess of
Wales, Andrew Morton, with the cooperation of Ms. Lewinsky,
portrays her as a troubled young woman and a pawn of Washington
power struggles.
</P>
<P>
   But with its coming publication, Ms. Lewinsky moves now to the
center of competing financial interests _ television networks
anxious to promote exclusive interviews, book publishers intent on
protecting the mystery of their information until publication, and
a retinue of handlers concerned with financial security and shaping
an image.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far her expanding group of advisers have devised a
double-barreled campaign to promote Ms. Lewinsky's interests here
and in foreign countries. On the home front, the vision is a
stately ``less is more'' civilian version of a Rose Garden strategy
that will present Ms. Lewinsky to potential readers through two
interviews _ with the ABC correspondent Barbara Walters on
``20/20'' on Wednesday, and with Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Eschewing the traditional American book-tour circuit of
autograph signings and chain-store appearances, Ms. Lewinsky will
leave it to the book's author, Morton, to stand in for her. And for
a simple reason: He is able to speak _ and raise criticism about
the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr _ without the restrictions
her immunity agreement imposes on her.
</P>
<P>
   Once she shows her passport, though, Ms. Lewinsky will switch to
the more grinding role of celebrity promoter. She is not expected
to be as aloof in countries where many major publications have paid
a price for rights to publish excerpts of her book and, by standard
practice, are entitled to interviews with her.
</P>
<P>
   The divergent strategies may present some delicate problems for
the American publisher, St. Martin's Press. To attract a large core
of readers, particularly women, it must shape a sympathetic image
of Ms. Lewinsky, guarding against appearances that she is unduly
profiting from the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, overseas is rich with opportunity: Foreign
news publications generally pay higher prices for serial rights,
but Ms. Lewinsky's handlers believe the book will require more
promotional activity.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews, for instance, are already planned with some buyers
like Paris Match, The Daily Mirror in London, New Age in Australia
and Corrier della Serra in Italy. In Germany, the newspaper Bild
has excerpt and interview rights; the speculation in publishing
circles is that the paper and its sister publishing company,
Ullstein, paid as much as $200,000 for them.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, where Michael O'Mara Books is publishing ``Monica's
Story'' on Friday, Ms. Lewinsky will make nearly a dozen
appearances in large cities, visiting local book shops, signing
autographs and participating in radio interviews. She has already
been photographed for the British fashion magazine, Marie Claire,
which is planning on using the material for a cover. Hello
published a paid interview with Ms. Lewinsky's father, Bernard
Lewinsky, that included pages of photographs of Ms. Lewinsky in her
father's newly leased California apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, ``our strategy is distance and
dignity,'' said Lynn Goldberg, who is managing public relations for
Ms. Lewinsky and Morton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although she hasn't been able to speak for a year, the
American perspective is that she's really been around and we really
want to sell books,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ``It's a common publicity
question to deal with if somebody is so overexposed. If you really
want to know how Monica feels, you need to read the book. It makes
the book the essential document for closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some American publishers consider it a potential
problem for the book that ABC decided to expand its program on Ms.
Lewinsky; it may leave very few surprises to prompt potential
readers to pay up to $24.95 for the book.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, though, clearly believes that plenty of viewers want to see
more of Monica Lewinsky. Last week it sought advertising rates of
$800,000 for a 30-second commercial. That is less than the $1
million the network is charging for spots on its Academy Awards
show, but it is five times the rate it would normally charge for
``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   And if that isn't enough, potential readers in the rest of the
world will be able to see the British interview with Ms. Lewinsky
conducted by the Channel Four anchor Jon Snow, a program that will
also be broadcast this week in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Channel Four paid more than $600,000 for the interview, but the
company has already made that money back with sales of rights to
broadcast the interview in more than 25 countries, according to R.
Bernard Macleod, the managing director of Channel Four
International. He added that talks were continuing with other
television stations interested in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Romanos, the president of Simon &AMP; Schuster, said he was not
sure just how much success the book might enjoy because ``it
largely depends on how much Monica Lewinsky gives away for free as
a result of the Barbara Walters interview.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After two hours of Monica, I wonder if there will be anything
left or if anybody will care more,'' he said. ``But I've always
said that the book will probably make a best-seller list for a week
or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster, which published Morton's successful biography
of Diana, met with Morton and Ms. Lewinsky last year to consider
their book proposal. Romanos said he was impressed then with Ms.
Lewinsky, whom he described as a likable young woman who could be a
next-door neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was that we just weren't hearing the information
that we needed to hear,'' Romanos said. ``I just didn't think that
she was going to come across as sympathetic, to overcome that
problem that it's hard to draw an audience, particularly of women,
who want to run out and read about somebody's affair with a married
man.''
</P>
<P>
   To shape her image and promotion, Ms. Lewinsky is being aided by
a retinue of advisers, giving the effort more the gravitas of a
political campaign than of a book tour.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does she get the attentions of the publicity department
at St. Martin's Press, but also the counsel of Ms. Goldberg, a
longtime publishing professional whom St. Martin's hired for the
project. Additionally, John Scanlon, a media consultant whose
clients have ranged from CBS and Brown &AMP; Williamson to Ivana Trump
during her divorce from Donald Trump, was recently retained by the
Lewinsky family.
</P>
<P>
   These advisers sum up their American strategy in words that
sound like preparations for a charity ball _ dignity, simplicity,
elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Mara, the London publisher who helped assemble the
entire project, remains unworried that Ms. Lewinsky's status as
``the other woman'' will dampen book sales.
</P>
<P>
   At last count earlier this month, he had sold the rights to
publish the book in almost a dozen countries. Last week, he was
still selling rights to serialize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this will be popular,'' he said. ``I've known this
from the very beginning when we were told by very intelligent
people in New York that there was no market for Monica _ she's the
other woman, Americans don't like that. But I was talking to people
in the street and I was hearing a completely different story and
they were much more sympathetic to her than the intelligentsia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report outlining the scandalous affair with President
Clinton flopped as a book in Europe. Still, O'Mara contends,
readers will be interested in the book because it explores Ms.
Lewinsky's struggle with the independent counsel or, as O'Mara
prefers to refer to his villain, ``the grand inquisitor.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Mara declined to estimate how much Ms. Lewinsky could make
through foreign book sales. St. Martin's Press paid a $600,000
advance for the rights to publish in North America, with bonuses
tied to best-seller rankings. But that does not include Ms.
Lewinsky's advance in Britain or royalties from other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Most lucrative, perhaps, are the sales of her television
interview through Channel Four International in Britain; according
to several sources, it is giving more than 70 percent of the
revenue from those sales to Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Macleod of Channel Four declined to say how much the interviews
are being sold for, noting that the price varies by country.
Estimates range between from $100,000 to $500,000, depending on the
market; if so, Ms. Lewinsky could make several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know exactly how much she is going to be making, down to the
penny,'' Macleod said. ``All I can say is that we will be making
payments to Monica.''

   CONGRESS-BUDGET (Washington) _ With the prospect of huge budget
surpluses diminishing the commitment to fiscal discipline, Congress
now appears all but certain to increase the spending limits that
were a central part of efforts to balance the budget and tame
Washington's insatiable appetite for new programs. The current caps
would require deep spending cuts this year, even as both parties
are pushing for more spending on the military, education and other
programs. It is a dilemma with tremendous political and economic
ramifications, and Republicans in particular are in a bind. By

   MICROSOFT-TRIAL (Undated) _ For Microsoft's witnesses at its
antitrust trial, the simple words of introduction have become
deeply unnerving. ``My name is David Boies, and I represent the
United States.'' It is no wonder why the big software company's
witnesses have come to fear facing Boies, the Justice Department's
trial lawyer, in the government's sweeping antitrust case against
the Microsoft Corp. Time after time, he has caught Microsoft
witnesses off-guard as the words from their mouths on the stand
contradict the statements in internal Microsoft documents and often
their own e-mail. Yet as both sides have now presented their main
evidence, with the last of Microsoft's 12 witnesses having finished
last Friday, the question remains just how much the company has
been merely embarrassed or truly damaged in the courtroom. By Steve

   CRACK-LEGACY-I (Victorville, Calif.) _ Every 20 seconds, someone
in the United States is arrested for a drug violation, and every
week, on average, a new jail or prison is built to lock up more
people in what has become the world's largest penal system. It was
not always so. Ten years ago, half as many people were arrested for
drug crimes, and the nation's incarceration rate was closer to
those of other democracies. But in the 1980's the United States was
shaken by crack cocaine, and the criminal justice system has never
been the same. Crack prompted the nation to rewrite its drug laws,
lock up a record number of people, and shift money from schools to
prisons. It transformed police work, hospitals, parental rights,
courts. More than anything, crack changed the makeup of American
prisons. Nearly twice as many whites use crack as blacks, according
to national surveys, but as the war on drugs focused on poor city
neighborhoods, blacks went to prison at a rate far surpassing
whites. (First of two parts.) By Timothy Egan.

   Taking Hostages in the War on Drunken Driving
</P>
<P>
   Having chased away (or at least forced underground) murderers,
burglars, robbers, drug traffickers, car thieves, muggers,
panhandlers and squeegee men, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
has turned his attention to drunken drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has seldom met a crime pattern he thinks he cannot
smash, ordered police to begin seizing the cars of nearly anyone
arrested for drunken driving, whether hard-core repeaters or
first-time offenders. And to make sure that New Yorkers understood
that he was very, very serious, the Mayor said that even for those
acquitted in criminal court of driving while intoxicated, the city
might still pursue the permanent confiscation of their cars in
civil court.
</P>
<P>
   That led The Financial Times, hardly a journal of the left, to
say that New York was ``fast becoming the Singapore of the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's goal, of course, was to shock people into changing
their behavior. If you want to drink, he said, just make sure you
don't drive. Have a sober friend drive you home, take a cab or try
out New York's subways.
</P>
<P>
   While the political impact of the move was unclear, its legal
underpinning seemed firm. The Supreme Court has generally upheld
the use of forfeiture by federal and state prosecutors, who have
tried to inhibit the drug trade by charging traffickers with
criminal violations while also seizing their assets in civil
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are legal questions. Is it appropriate to
confiscate a car upon arrest rather than conviction? Is it fair to
seize the cars of drivers with unblemished records? Is the
punishment too varied, since one motorist could lose a car worth
$40,000 while another might forfeit one worth $1,000?
</P>
<P>
   Questions like these will no doubt keep the courts busy over the
next few months.

   The Pro Wrestling Sleazometer
</P>
<P>
   On television, wrestling sells, sells big. Monday night's ``WWF
Raw'' on the USA Network is a top-rated cable program with millions
of viewers each week. But are viewers drawn to precision maneuvers,
artful pins, athletic excellence? Uh, not exactly. Turn on the show
for 30 seconds and you'll see behavior far more, well, indelicate:
crotch-grabbing, obscene gestures and on down the ladder of taste.
</P>
<P>
   Far too indelicate, it would seem, to be a fit subject for
statistical analysis. But as living, gut-crunching proof that
nothing is safe from scholarly probing, the small-screen tabloid
``Inside Edition'' commissioned an Indiana University study of a
year's worth of ``WWF Raw.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you're titillated by pro wrestling, gape on. If you're
disgusted, keep surfing. If you're a parent, worry. A third of
viewers are 17 and under, and many schoolchildren imitate the
obscene behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're a data freak, a feast awaits, including the exact
number of times a crotch was grabbed, incidences of satanic
activity, scenes of wrestlers appearing to urinate as well as
categories too offensive to list. Plus the number of minutes out of
a two-hour telecast typically devoted to wrestling: 36.
</P>
<P>
   The study does not, by the way, say how many former pro
wrestlers have been elected governor (1) or how many times Garrison
Keillor, on his weekly radio show, ``Prairie Home Companion,'' has
poked fun at that governor, Jesse Ventura of Minnesota.

   A Guilty Verdict In Texas Dragging Death
</P>
<P>
   John William King helped write himself onto Death Row. Until the
24-year-old white supremacist from Jasper, Texas, wrote a letter to
a local newspaper claiming that he had been in the pickup truck
with two other white men charged with dragging a black man to his
death in 1998, authorities had no direct evidence linking King to
the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Then police found a trove of King's racist writings at his
apartment. Several young Jasper women stepped forward with letters
King wrote them while in prison on a burglary charge. And finally,
while awaiting trial, King tried to smuggle out a letter to another
defendant in which, prosecutors said, he all but confessed to the
murder of the man, James Byrd, a 49-year-old Jasper resident.
</P>
<P>
   King's weeklong trial ended with a rapid guilty verdict, and
three days later the jury wrote the final line: death by lethal
injection. The two other defendants are awaiting trial.

Clinton Legal Expense Trust, Clinton's supporters announced last
week. Some contributors, like the president's friends in Hollywood
and corporate America, gave the maximum amount of $10,000, but many
wrote smaller checks of $10 and $20.

than what President Clinton proposed two months ago. It would give

January, and provide bonuses to selected mid-career personnel.

   Selling goods to China is never easy. It's a lot harder these

sell the Chinese a $450 million communications satellite. Hughes
has been accused of being too helpful to the Chinese about how to
make their rockets more accurate _ a technology that could be
applied to missiles as well. So the Clinton administration reversed
itself and blocked Hughes from selling the communications
satellite, saying the risk of aiding the Chinese military was too
great.

   Fatal Avalanches in Austria
</P>
<P>
   Avalanches struck the ski villages of Galtuer and Valzuer in the
Austrian Alps, and the bodies of nearly 40 victims were recovered
by the weekend. There have been record snowfalls this month in
western Austria and Switzerland, and with roads closed, hundreds of
thousands of European ski vacationers remain trapped in resorts,
some isolated for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Austrian authorities flew thousands out from Galtuer and nearby
areas by helicopter and continued the search for victims.

   China Satellite Deal Blocked
</P>
<P>
   Selling goods to China is never easy. It's a lot harder these
days for Hughes Electronics, which for years has been trying to
sell the Chinese a $450 million communications satellite. Hughes
has been accused of being too helpful to the Chinese about how to
make their rockets more accurate _ a technology that could be
applied to missiles as well. So the Clinton administration reversed
itself and blocked Hughes from selling the communications
satellite, saying the risk of aiding the Chinese military was too
great.

<P>
   The National Cancer Institute recommended changes in the
treatment of invasive cervical cancer, which kills 5,000 women a
year in the United States. Until now treatment included only
surgery and radiation, but five new studies have shown that adding
chemotherapy with the drug cisplatin can lower death rates by 30
percent to 50 percent. To succeed, the chemotherapy and radiation
must be given simultaneously.

   Wilson, 65, the two-term former governor of California whose

   ENDLESS-SCANDAL-REVIEW (Undated) _ Less than two weeks after his
acquittal, President Clinton has again had to deny a sexual
allegation from the past. And Monica Lewinsky's TV interview with
Barbara Walters has already been lengthened and strategically
leaked to stoke viewership. And ground rules are being negotiated

   HMOS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Rarely a week goes why when an HMO is
not hammered in the press or in court for denying payment for the

Millions of Americans are refocusing on the thing that most defines
their lives: interest-rate shifts, gyrations of their mutual funds,
the palpable lure and temptations of wealth. What this is doing to
the country _ from money to values _ is one of the most intriguing
questions about American life at the century's end. By Peter

   SOCSEC-TAXES-REVIEW (Washington) _ The political dynamics that
existed when President Reagan and Congress enacted the historic Tax

<P>
   MONICA-EPONOMY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Many people named Monica,
Lewinsky or Tripp have been accidental victims of the recent
scandal. For instance, Monica Tripp, a 911 dispatcher, has had to
endure a constant barrage of crank calls, sophomoric jokes, sexual
innuendo and brazen leers. She says, ``Even my co-workers give me

from historic family tombs, most of them from the 19th century, in

<P>
   LOMAN-MENTAL-REVIEW (New York) _ A new Broadway production of
`Death of A Salesman' re-examines Willy Loman from a mental-health
perspective. In the past, Loman has variously been interpreted as a
stand-in for the common man, a suicidal victim of the capitalist
machine, a man undone by his own ignorance and womanizing, etc. But
what if he is none of these? What if he was really just a man
struggling with a psychiatric condition that was poorly understood

   TURKEY-WATER-REVIEW (Istanbul) _ The Tigris and Euphrates rivers
are still immensely important resources, politically as well as
geographically. Today, Turkey controls their flow through a network
of dams, and it is determined not to give up that control. This is
a key reason why Turkey has refused to grant autonomy to its

Turkey has. By Stephen Kinzer. WITH GRAPHIC MAP.

 WITH ULSTER PEACE EFFORT DEADLOCKED, EYES RETURN TO U.S.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Irish and British officials increasingly are
looking to President Clinton for another intervention in the
Northern Ireland peace effort, hoping he can end the dispute over
the disarmament of the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute threatens to end the attempt by Protestant and Roman
Catholic leaders to achieve permanent peace in the northern British
province.
</P>
<P>
   The president's involvement, including two widely acclaimed
visits to Ireland, is credited here as essential to the advance of
the overall peace agreement approved by Protestant and Catholic
leaders 10 months ago and overwhelmingly endorsed in referendums
here and in the North.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here and in Belfast, the northern capital, have
indicated clearly in recent days that if the Northern Ireland
Assembly in Belfast fails to resolve the disarmament dispute by
mid-March, then the president is likely to try to persuade
Protestant and Catholic political leaders to meet during their
scheduled visit to the White House on St. Patrick's Day, March 17.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Sullivan, the new American ambassador to Ireland and
a former governor of Wyoming, said on Friday that he would not
speculate on the specifics of the involvement of Clinton, who is a
personal friend. But he added, ``The president is deeply interested
and anxious to see the peace agreement implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, on his first visit to Northern Ireland, Sullivan, who
became ambassador six weeks ago, discussed the disarmament dispute
with the Assembly's two leaders, the Protestant first minister,
David Trimble, and his Catholic deputy, Seamus Mallon.
</P>
<P>
   He was accompanied by James Lyons, Clinton's economic adviser
for Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. That post previously
was held by former Sen. George Mitchell, who became chairman of the
peace talks that produced a formal agreement last Easter to end the
sectarian warfare involving the province's Protestant majority and
its Catholic minority.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans did not meet officials of Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, or of the Democratic Unionist Party of the Rev. Ian
Paisley, which vehemently opposes the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Before any White House meeting, political leaders in the Irish
Republic and in the northern British province of Ulster are hoping
that a compromise can be achieved by the chairman of the northern
disarmament commission, Gen. John de Chastelain, the former leader
of Canada's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders say they hope de Chastelain will make a statement in
the coming weeks that could defuse the disarmament issue and permit
the peace effort to move into its next phase by March 10. That is
the deadline for the Assembly to appoint 10 cabinet-like executives
to prepare for the return to Northern Ireland of home rule powers
now held by the British government.
</P>
<P>
   Creation of the cabinet has been blocked by Trimble's refusal to
allow full participation by Sinn Fein until the IRA begins to
disarm. The IRA, which has been observing a cease-fire for 19
months, says it will not disarm before the peace agreement is fully
carried out, which is expected to be in May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland said that he
would trust any statement on the impasse made by de Chastelain. His
words echoed those of John Taylor, the deputy leader of Trimble's
Ulster Unionist Party, last week. Also, the Irish foreign minister,
David Andrews, reported that he had a useful meeting in Northern
Ireland on Friday with Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief
negotiator and the party's representative to the de Chastelain
commission.

2 MASSACRES PROMPT INDIA TO TRY TO RULE EASTERN STATE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ For Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, the
euphoria of his historic peacemaking visit to Pakistan was
short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   The stories about high-stakes nuclear diplomacy quickly were
bumped off the front pages this week by his government's scramble
to salvage its move to dismiss the government of the eastern state
of Bihar, one of India's poorest and most populous.
</P>
<P>
   After furiously lobbying some of its own partners in the
coalition government it leads, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
Janata Party on Friday managed to convince the lower house of
Parliament to ratify the central government takeover of the state.
The government made the move on the grounds that two massacres of
low-caste people there in the past month demonstrated a breakdown
of law and order.
</P>
<P>
   But the upper house of Parliament is expected to vote against
ratification, probably next week. The measure can be introduced
anytime in the next six weeks. If it is defeated, the government of
Bihar will be restored to power and the wobbly national coalition
government will have sustained yet another blow to its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Vajpayee's government removed the populist
first couple of Bihar, Laloo Prasad Yadav and his wife, Rabri Devi,
from power. It acted after a second massacre of low-caste people on
Feb. 11. In less than three weeks, a private militia organized by
upper caste landowners killed 34 men, women, and children from the
caste known as the untouchables, or the Dalits.
</P>
<P>
   Such butchery has occurred sporadically over the last 20 years
in Bihar as an outgrowth of the struggle between landowners and
poor farm workers who have sought to be treated with dignity and
paid higher wages. Hundreds have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The government had been confident that its takeover of the state
would be ratified in Parliament, especially after Sonia Gandhi,
leader of the opposition Congress Party, declared that the
government of Bihar had lost the moral authority to govern
following the second massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party, which has led India for most of its 51 years
of independence, itself has invoked the constitutional provision
that allows a national takeover of state governments dozens of
times. Many critics say the provision has often been misused for
partisan political gain.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, the Congress Party surprised the national government
by announcing that it would oppose a takeover in Bihar, making
ratification doubtful in the upper house of Parliament, where the
opposition is stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Congress Party officials said the massacres, while ghastly, did
not warrant the ejection of an elected government. They also
accused Vajpayee's government of installing a partisan, political
official as governor of the state, betraying its self-interested
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   But both the Bharatiya Janata Party, which heads the coalition
government, and the Congress Party could have political motives. A
central government takeover of Bihar would allow the governing
party and its allies to use the patronage and power of the state to
strengthen their weak political position there, political analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party, which trounced the Bharatiya Janata Party in
state elections last November, needs to regain ground in Bihar and
neighboring Uttar Pradesh, two powerhouses in the Hindu heartland,
if it is to lead the national government again without a heavy
reliance on a patchwork of allies.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party can ill-afford to let the governing party
gain the upper hand in Bihar, experts say, nor does it wish to be
seen as supporting the Hindu nationalist party that the substantial
minority of Muslim voters in those states oppose.
</P>
<P>
   For the last nine years, the state has been ruled flamboyantly
by Yadav or his wife, who present themselves as the champions of
the lower castes and religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate in the lower house of Parliament, Home Minister
L.K. Advani portrayed the decision to dismiss the Bihar government
as motivated solely by a desire to protect the people of the state.
``This decision has not been taken for or against any party,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharad Pawar, a Congress Party leader, accused the governing
party of using the massacres for its own political ends. ``Of
course politics has its own place,'' Pawar said. ``But for the sake
of your political benefit, you should not use Dalits for that
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Yadav declared on the floor, ``You are attempting to destroy a
government of the poor people.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers and advocates for the Dalits say they are
skeptical that the violence against agricultural workers will stop,
whether there is a takeover or the Laloo Yadav-Rabri Devi
government returns to power.

FEMINIST PROPELS OUTCRY AT BRUTAL MEXICO KILLINGS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico _ Within hours after youths passing by a
Juarez drainage canal on a recent day discovered the body of a
13-year-old girl, the most recent victim in a long series of sexual
killings here, Esther Chavez Cano was rushing to spread the dismal
news.
</P>
<P>
   She was on the phone to members of the feminist organization she
heads. She was typing e-mail messages to congresswomen and
journalists. In news interviews, Ms. Chavez, a 65-year-old former
accountant for Kraft Foods, was accusing the new governor of
Chihuahua of breaking campaign promises to investigate the killings
of women in Juarez more seriously than his predecessor did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous that these murders have been used to win
votes, but the minute the politicians get in power they forget
about the dead women,'' Ms. Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Irma Angelica Rosales, was raped and smothered with
a plastic bag on Feb. 16, hours after she lost her $4-a-day job in
an American-owned factory. She became the third such victim in this
border city that faces El Paso since Gov. Patricio Martinez Garcia
took office in October.
</P>
<P>
   But a trail of similar crimes preceded Miss Rosales' killing.
Authorities have counted 184 women killed in Juarez since 1993.
About 80 were raped and their bodies dumped in the desert. State
officials say only 24 fit a pattern of serial sexual murder, but
Ms. Chavez, who keeps detailed lists of the dead on her home
computer, says she believes the figure is far higher.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years back, as battered female bodies turned up here
frequently, dumped in desert gullies and vacant lots, these crimes
gained little notice. Even now, few of the killings have been
solved.
</P>
<P>
   But this latest killing provoked considerable outrage, which is
a testimony to Ms. Chavez's outspoken advocacy and the fledgling
feminist movement she helps lead.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez newspapers made the young woman's death front-page news.
Television editorials urged authorities to stop the violence.
Demonstrations have been scheduled to protest the killing. As
outrage grew, Martinez offered a $5,000 reward for information
identifying the sexual predator.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing sexual murders pose a challenge to Martinez, who
is a member of President Ernesto Zedillo's governing party. He won
election last year partly by lambasting his predecessor, from the
opposition National Action Party, for investigative mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Gonzalez Rascon, Chihuahua's Attorney General, said his
government had made prosecuting the murders a priority. New
initiatives, including restrictions on liquor sales and beefed-up
police patrols, have reduced crime, and a shake-up of the unit
investigating homicides in which women are the victims has
increased efficiency, he said in a letter responding to written
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made good advances,'' he said. In response to Miss
Rosales' killing, he said. ``We've assigned our best elements to
its investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday there was a setback when two Mexico City
criminologists invited to Chihuahua to help out by the Martinez
administration resigned in protest, asserting that the sexual
homicide inquiries are in chaos, with case files and lab tests
missing and inexperienced detectives in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Martinez told us that he'd appoint better
investigators, but the officials he's named are worse than those
they replaced,'' Rep. Alma Vucovich, president of the Mexican
Congress' Committee on Sexual Equality, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Many victims, like Miss Rosales, had migrated to Juarez from
cities to the south. She arrived in January, moving into a mud
shanty with her brother. He paid $20 for a false document stating
that she was 16, enabling her to get an assembly job at the plant
where his wife worked, Electrocomponentes de Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   She had trouble adjusting to factory discipline, and on Feb. 10
was suspended for a day for talking. On the morning of Feb. 16 she
quit her job, plant officials said, but her sister-in-law said Miss
Rosales told her in a tearful conversation at the plant that she
had been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go straight home on the bus,'' the sister-in-law said she told
Miss Rosales. ``Don't walk, its dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager left about 9 a.m. Two youths found her body six
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of young factory women have been attacked walking through
Juarez's desolate industrial parks, and Ms. Chavez's organization
has urged owners to provide secure transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Creevey, an executive at the International Wire Group,
based in Mishawaka, Ind., which owns Electrocomponentes, said the
plant provided no bus service. He called Miss Rosales' salary
``confidential,'' but her relatives said that during seven days of
work she earned $27.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chavez was about to retire from her accounting career about
the time the sexual murders began here in the early 1990s. Dismayed
by officials' indifference, she began to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   She drew attention with criticisms of male investigators and
politicians, who argued that women were inviting attack by wearing
suggestive clothing. She attacked machismo, whose roots in a
Chihuahua culture that glorifies ruthless desert horsemen who force
women into submission may make it even stronger than elsewhere in
Mexico. She became an advocate for working-class women whose
brutalization was passing unchallenged to a degree inconceivable
had the Juarez dead been drawn from a higher station.
</P>
<P>
   ``She seemed very audacious,'' said Guadalupe Ramirez Lopez,
director of a Juarez human rights group, who recalled seeing the
short, slender Ms. Chavez stand to criticize a state prosecutor in
1995. ``She was the only one daring to demand better
investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   Her criticisms of the official inquiries have been accepted
widely. Chihuahua officials recently acknowledged that the state
police have never even assembled a psychological profile of the
serial killer or killers. The Federal Bureau of Investigation
agreed this month to send profilers to Juarez to study the case, a
spokesman in El Paso said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chihuahua police remain sloppy and indifferent, Ms. Chavez
said. She cited the experience of Armine Arjona Baca, a physician,
who told her story in a separate interview.
</P>
<P>
   During the night of Jan. 31, Dr. Arjona heard the screams of a
woman coming from a canal behind her house, and phoned the state
police. The officer who answered argued that it was not his
agency's job to respond to emergencies but promised, grudgingly, to
send a squad car. Dr. Arjona called back 30 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that woman still screaming?'' the agent responded,
irritated, Dr. Arjona said. A woman's body was found later that day
elsewhere in Juarez. It is unclear whether the cries Dr. Arjona
heard came from the murder victim.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Rosales' killing threw Ms. Chavez's life into tumult as the
teen-ager's family reached out to her. She held their hands in
angry meetings with bureaucrats who delayed releasing Miss Rosales'
body, and as coffin vendors tried to profit on the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was a nightmare,'' she wrote in an e-mail she
distributed on Feb. 20, the day after Miss Rosales' body was
shipped to her hometown for burial. ``The anguish of these poor
people. I was in a volcano of pain.''

SHIRLEY STOLER, 69, ACTRESS IN `SEVEN BEAUTIES' 
</HEADLINE>
  (as) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shirley Stoler, an actress best known for her role as
the Nazi commandant in Lina Wertmueller's 1976 film ``Seven
Beauties,'' died on Feb. 17 at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical
Center. She was 69 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure after a long illness, said her
brother Ira.
</P>
<P>
   Stoler, a native of Brooklyn whose acting career spanned four
decades, considered herself the first significantly fat actress to
do dramatic roles rather than comedy. Her weight, which hovered
around 250 pounds in her early years, limited her choices, she said
in a 1976 interview with The New York Times. ``Weight shouldn't be
a hindrance, but casting people are afraid of it,'' she said. ``I
could play `Medea,' but they wouldn't cast me for it.''
</P>
<P>
   And though she yearned for a glamorous role, her imposing figure
frequently landed Stoler the part of the villain or shrew, most
notably in ``Seven Beauties,'' in which, dressed in black leather
boots and men's boxer shorts and brandishing a whip and cigar, she
played the sadistic commandant of a Nazi concentration camp to
critical acclaim. Six years earlier, in Leonard Kastle's
``Honeymoon Killers,'' she played a highly fictionalized version of
Martha Beck, the predatory nurse executed for murder in 1951. Her
film credits also include ``The Deer Hunter'' and ``Klute.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoler appeared on Broadway in the role of Lolita's mother in
Edward Albee's 1981 stage adaptation of the Nabokov novel. She also
appeared on television in the PBS production of ``Displaced
Person,'' and played villainous roles on many television series.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her brother Ira, of Fairfield, Conn., she is
survived by another brother, David, of Wanaque, N.J., and a sister,
Miriam, of Delray Beach, Fla.

CALIFORNIA GOP GRAPPLES TO PATCH WOUNDS OF DEFEAT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Last November, the California Republican
Party suffered its worst defeat in 40 years, losing races for
governor, U. S. Senator and nearly every other statewide office,
and shrinking its minority by five seats in the State Assembly and
two in the Senate. So as party regulars gathered for their winter
convention here this weekend, still licking their wounds and
spoiling for fights over abortion and their future leadership, a
certain gallows humor prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got this circular firing- squad thing just about
perfected,'' said Dan Schnur, once an aide to former Gov. Pete
Wilson and one of the state's snappier wordsmiths, who dryly
referred to the latest round of clashes between the party's
moderate and conservative wings here as an exercise in ``semiannual
self-immolation.''
</P>
<P>
   Because this is California, crucible of trends, with its newly
moved-up presidential primary election on March 7, 2000, there was
no shortage of interested witnesses to the festivities. A parade of
half a dozen presidential contenders arrived to press the flesh and
test the waters in a climate of soul-searching that seemed
emblematic of the party's internal post-impeachment struggles
around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to admit it, but what happens in California happens in
the West; it's the 800-pound gorilla,'' said Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, who warned the delegates on Friday night: ``Scorched-earth
Republican primaries will lead directly to an Al Gore presidency,
and to Democratic control of one or both houses of Congress. Don't
let us go down the road of mindlessly destroying each other.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain made no direct mention in his speech of the California
Republicans' current fight: a rare contested election for party
chairman and vice chairman, driven in large measure by differences
over abortion. But in an interview afterward, he acknowledged that
he was ``keenly aware of the battles that are going on in this
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest battle flared last month when the party's current
vice chairman, John McGraw, a Silicon Valley software executive who
would normally be a shoo-in for the top post, was quoted in a San
Francisco Roman Catholic publication describing ``killing our
babies'' as ``the issue of the century.'' He later said his views
reflected his ``personal moral priorities'' and not those of his
party.
</P>
<P>
   But the party's gubernatorial nominee, former state Attorney
General Dan Lungren, a staunch opponent of abortion, lost to Gray
Davis by 20 points last November, and his own campaign manager has
since said that it would be difficult for any Republican who
opposes abortion rights to win the governorship. So party moderates
decided to mount the first challenge in a chairman's race in 28
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's suicidal,'' said Bob Larkin, an insurance agent from Simi
Valley and former chairman of the Ventura County party, who notes
that the state party has lost 600,000 members since 1990, going
from nearly 40 percent of the state's registered voters to just
under 35 percent. ``The right wing doesn't care if they lose.
They'd rather be right and pure. But we're losing members at the
rate of 415 a day. We'll lose more Republicans over the time of
this convention than will be here as delegates.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin and other moderates are supporting a rump slate of
Nicholas Bavaro, a Modesto businessman, for the two-year term of
chairman, and former Assemblyman Brooks Firestone, a winery owner
and heir to the Firestone tire fortune from Santa Barbara County,
for vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone lost a bitter congressional primary last year to a
fellow assemblyman, Tom Bordonaro, who harshly attacked Firestone's
support for abortion rights and gun control but then went on to
lose the general election to the Democratic candidate, Lois Capps.
</P>
<P>
   ``That showed me an example of a party being ineffective, and,
yes, part of what I'm trying to do is prevent that from happening
to anyone else,'' Firestone said.
</P>
<P>
   Because party rules stipulate that the next chairman must come
from the northern part of the state, Firestone could not run for
chairman this time. But he is given some chance of defeating Shawn
Steel, a conservative lawyer from Beverly Hills, in the voting on
Sunday for vice chairman, thus positioning himself to run for
chairman the next time around. Meanwhile, McGraw and his
conservative faction are still expected to defeat the moderate
Bavaro for the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Friday night, McGraw, 36, said he believed
his remarks on abortion had been misconstrued, but insisted, ``I
have that behind me now,'' and said he was determined to send a
message of tolerance. ``I'm a neophyte at this, and that was not
the most politic statement,'' he said, adding that part of the
party's self-examination was the natural consequence of defeat.
``Hey, we got a whipping,'' he said. ``Nothing easy about it. But
what are you going to do? Quit?''
</P>
<P>
   The party's differences over issues from abortion to gun
control, affirmative action and the environment are nothing new. In
fact, they persisted in the eight-year tenure of Wilson, whose
support for abortion rights and acceptance of a tax increase to
close a crushing budget gap early in his first term bitterly
rankled many conservatives. But because of Wilson's powers as
titular head of the party, he was able to paper over the
disagreements to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had these problems, but because we had the
governorship and a staff that worked really hard to keep the
tensions below the surface, they haven't popped up,'' said State
Sen. Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, regarded as one of the party's
cannier hands, who has endorsed both Firestone and Steel.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Goodman, a former Wilson aide who is close to Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, a no-show at the gathering here, said the state
party ``has to decide that winning is more important than ideology,
and ultimately, rather than having internal divisive fights, we
ought to be coming together to nominate the strongest possible
national candidate to play and win in California.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone at the convention was singing that tune. The
California Young Americans for Freedom distributed yellow fliers
denouncing ``Vichy Republicans'' for being willing to ``surrender''
on abortion, ``capitulate'' on gun control, ``run away'' from
school vouchers and ``abandon the elephant mascot and replace it
with a mule.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he had tried to communicate to the delegates that
``it isn't just the message; it's the way we deliver the message,''
and in the interview he expressed distress that the party's core
message of lower taxes, smaller government, deregulation and the
like had lately been overshadowed by more divisive issues, and a
lack of feeling for diversity. ``You've got to not only say these
things,'' he said, ``but you've got to say it in an inclusive
way.''

HALF OF WORKERS IN SMALL CONCERNS UNINSURED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of workers in small companies who have health
insurance fell below 50 percent last year for the first time in at
least a decade, according to a study by the Henry J. Kaiser Family
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The drop, coming when the economy remained strong and jobs were
plentiful, deepened a gap in coverage that the Census Bureau had
reported in 1997 when the number of uninsured Americans rose to
43.4 million, or 16.1 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser report said many small companies had dropped health
insurance or made it more difficult for employees to obtain by
tightening eligibility requirements or extending waiting periods
before they could receive benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The number of small companies that offered health insurance
dropped to 55 percent, compared with 59 percent in 1996. The
decline translated to 1.8 million more workers in small companies
that were not offered health insurance last year, said Jon R.
Gabel, director of the survey, which was conducted by KPMG Peat
Marwick, the accounting and benefits consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   In small concerns with fewer than 200 employees, 47 percent of
employees did not have insurance, the survey said, compared with 52
percent in 1996. In companies with 200 or more employees, 64
percent of employees had health coverage, down slightly from 2 of
every 3 workers in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the best of times,'' said Gabel, who has been
surveying employee benefits since 1989. ``What will happen to
insurance if the economy slows down?''
</P>
<P>
   He said employees of small companies were as willing as any
workers to participate in health insurance, even though they
typically earned less and had to pay more for less coverage than
workers in large companies.
</P>
<P>
   Benefits managers at 1,581 randomly selected companies were
surveyed last summer. The margin of error was plus or minus 2.5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   William S. Custer, a health economist at Georgia State
University, said the Kaiser survey was consistent with a census
report last year that was based on a 1997 survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the growth of the economy,'' Custer said, ``more
people are working and losing their eligibility for Medicaid,'' the
state-run health programs. Most were hired by small businesses,
which were ``less likely to offer coverage,'' said Custer, who was
not involved in the Kaiser survey.
</P>
<P>
   In a finding that surprised some health policy experts in
Washington, the small employers strongly supported a number of
proposals for more government regulation of health insurance. In
the Kaiser survey, 80 percent favored requiring health plans to pay
for emergency room visits and 88 percent favored assuring patients
an independent review of health plan decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Small employers were less enthusiastic about proposals to permit
patients to sue a health plan for medical malpractice: 47 percent
were in favor, 33 percent were opposed and 21 percent were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Caldeira, a lobbyist for the National Federation of
Independent Business, which opposes the legislative proposals, said
the federation's members overwhelmingly were against adding to
regulations, which they believed would increase the cost of
insurance premiums.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For Microsoft's witnesses at its antitrust trial, the simple
words of introduction have become deeply unnerving. ``My name is
David Boies, and I represent the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder the big software company's witnesses have come
to fear facing Boies, the Justice Department's trial lawyer, in the
government's sweeping antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. Time
after time, he has caught Microsoft witnesses off guard as the
words from their mouths on the stand contradict the statements in
internal Microsoft documents or in their own e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as both sides have now presented their main evidence, with
the last of Microsoft's 12 witnesses having finished on Friday, the
question remains how much the company has been merely embarrassed
or truly damaged in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, legal experts say, is by no means as clear-cut as
might be suggested by the daily reports of Microsoft's miscues. The
recent drift of significant rulings in antitrust cases, they note,
tends to be pro-defendant as the courts have been generally
reluctant to second-guess business decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boies has done an excellent job, but the outcome of this case
is still in doubt,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at George
Washington University Law School. ``There is enough flexibility in
the doctrine of antitrust and enough uncertainty about how the case
law applies to a dynamic, high-technology industry like computer
software that it could go either way.''
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, the government's case is that Microsoft illegally
used its monopoly power to thwart the challenge to its dominance
posed by Internet software, stifling competition and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old Boies _ known for his rumpled blue suits, for
his uncanny memory and for having defended IBM in a marathon
antitrust case _ has clearly put Microsoft through a humbling
courtroom experience.
</P>
<P>
   He rattled a senior Microsoft executive by pointing out
misleading aspects in a videotaped demonstration that he introduced
as evidence. He confronted Microsoft's economic expert with his
earlier writing, which seemed to contradict his testimony, and the
befuddled witness said, ``What could I have been thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after Boies seemed to dismantle another Microsoft
executive, forcing him to retract some of his testimony, Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson joked as a Microsoft lawyer took over that
the task before him was a ``heroic endeavor.''
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom, Boies (pronounced BOYZ) is trying to undermine
the credibility of Microsoft's witnesses, which is a central
element in the government's legal strategy. Attacking Microsoft's
credibility, antitrust experts say, helps reinforce the strongest
parts of the government's current case _ a case that suffered a
setback a month after it was filed last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The government sued Microsoft last May in a complaint that
focused mainly on the Internet browser market. It contended that
Microsoft bundled its Internet browser to the company's
industry-standard Windows operating system in an illegal attempt to
hobble a promising challenger, Netscape Communications, the pioneer
in software used to browse the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replied that its Explorer browser and Windows were not
two products but a single product, and that Microsoft could put
anything it wanted to into Windows.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court essentially agreed with Microsoft last
June in a separate but related case. The court said Microsoft had
the right to fold a browser into its operating system as long as it
could make a ``plausible claim'' of consumer benefit.
</P>
<P>
   After the appeals court ruling, the government added evidence to
flesh out the allegation in its original complaint that Microsoft
was engaged in a ``pattern of anti-competitive behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the trial began in October, the government's roster
of witnesses included not only Netscape's president but also
executives from Apple, IBM, Intel, Intuit and Sun Microsystems. In
one episode after another, they testified, Microsoft was a
monopolistic bully, using its power as a club against other
companies to try to curb competition and divide markets.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denies each allegation, saying that its accusers are a
collection of its rivals trying to portray routine business
meetings in the software industry as something sinister.
</P>
<P>
   These allegations all center on private meetings _ some more
than three years ago _ involving Microsoft and other companies. The
court must sort through the written evidence and the testimony to
decide whom to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened at these meetings are we-said, they-said
disputes,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the
Justice Department's antitrust division. ``That's why the
government has tried so hard to go after the credibility of
Microsoft's witnesses in general.''
</P>
<P>
   The credibility strategy is also an effort by the government to
bulletproof any lower-court ruling from appeals. No one can predict
with certainty how Jackson will rule in this nonjury trial.
</P>
<P>
   His questions, comments and even rebukes to Microsoft witnesses
may indicate that Jackson leans toward the government. But
regardless of the verdict at U.S. District Court, the case will
almost surely go to the U.S. Court of Appeals and perhaps to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson could certainly be overruled on matters of evidence and
law. But legal experts say it would be very difficult to reverse
him on findings of fact based on credibility. ``The judge can say I
looked all these witnesses in the eye and I don't believe them,''
noted Litan, who is now at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The government has amassed a lengthy list of allegations. They
range from trying to get rivals to divide markets to pressuring
personal-computer makers and Internet service providers to agree to
exclusionary contracts that unfairly curb competition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to rule in favor of the government, the courts must
decide that some of Microsoft's actions were clear-cut violations
of the antitrust laws and not merely what one antitrust scholar
called ingredients in a ``stew of unsavory behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, legal experts say, has certainly been able to raise
doubts about some of the incidents. The government, for example,
contends that Microsoft made an illegal offer to Netscape to divide
the browser market at a pivotal meeting on June 21, 1995, an offer
Netscape declined. Based on the courtroom testimony and reams of
e-mail evidence, the executives of the two companies left that
meeting with sharply differing views of what occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The legal hurdle in attempted collusion cases, antitrust experts
say, is fairly high. The key case, they say, is a 1984 ruling
involving American Airlines Inc. In a tape-recorded phone
conversation, Robert Crandall, American's president, tried to
persuade the president of Braniff Airlines to jointly raise their
fares 20 percent on flights from Dallas. A federal appeals court
ruled against American, finding the evidence ``uniquely
unequivocal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft-Netscape meeting, antitrust experts say, does not
seem to rise to that unambiguous standard of evidence. ``I doubt
that charge will hold up,'' said Kovacic of George Washington
University.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists that most of the credibility attacks on its
witnesses are on issues not central to the case.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Boies got Richard Schmalensee, dean of the Sloan
School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
to say he could not imagine what he was thinking when he wrote in a
1982 Harvard Law Review article that ``persistent excess profits''
suggest that a company has considerable market power _ contrary to
his testimony that Microsoft's enormous profits are not an
indication of monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Microsoft's lawyer pointed out a footnote in a
1982 article in which Schmalensee noted that extremely high profits
could be explained by ownership of a ``unique and long-lived
asset.'' A particularly valuable intellectual property, like
Microsoft's Windows, could qualify as such an asset, Schmalensee
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we sorry he did not go to the footnote on the first day?''
said William Neukom, a senior vice president and general counsel of
Microsoft. ``Sure we are. It gave David Boies a moment of drama,
and it dominated the news stories of the trial that day. But it
does not affect the factual record of the case, not one whit.''
</P>
<P>
   Most legal experts believe that the strongest part of the
government's case is the allegation that Microsoft's restrictive
agreements with computer makers and Internet service providers,
combined with financial incentives to favor Microsoft's products,
unfairly put Netscape at a disadvantage to thwart competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence that Microsoft constantly placed hurdles to make
it more difficult for consumers to choose Netscape looks quite
strong,'' said Stephen Axinn, a leading antitrust litigator.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's legal strategy is to try to focus the court's
attention on the outcome in the marketplace, not on Microsoft's
inflammatory e-mail or contract details. And Microsoft argues that
many of its contract restrictions have since been eased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever those arrangements were, whatever measure of
exclusivity they created for a period of time, Netscape was able to
gain a substantial number of new users,'' said Richard Urowsky, a
partner at Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, the law firm representing
Microsoft. ``There was no foreclosure of consumer choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom battle will be silenced for a while. Jackson
declared a six-week recess because of scheduling conflicts with
other cases. In mid-April, the case resumes as each side can call
three rebuttal witnesses, followed by final arguments. A verdict is
expected in the summer.

   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Tens of millions of Nigerians cast ballots
Saturday to choose their next president, hoping to end a long era
of military dictatorship and to fulfill the promise of democracy
for Africa's most populous country.
</P>
<P>
   The elections, which were the culmination of one of the most
tumultuous periods in Nigeria's history, appeared to draw a high
voter turnout here in the country's largest city and in the
capital, Abuja.
</P>
<P>
   Results were not expected until late Sunday. But the
front-runner remained Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, a former president
and the only general to give up power voluntarily to a civilian
government. That elected government, which began in 1979 and ended
with a military coup in 1983, was the last time Nigeria had
nonmilitary leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's vote inspired enthusiasm even among typically
skeptical residents of Lagos, the traditional southern center of
opposition politics in a country long dominated by rulers from the
north. As Ndubuisi Ebubeogu, a 36-year-old shipping worker,
prepared to vote at a polling station in Ajengule, one of the
biggest slums in Lagos, he said the electoral process was more
important than whether Obasanjo or his rival, Olu Falae, won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am excited about this system,'' Ebubeogu said. ``If Falae
wins, let it be given to him. If Obasanjo wins, let it be given to
him. I want to believe in this system. Globally, things are going
democratically. We want to join the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your child can be president of America whether he holds a gun
or not,'' he continued. ``But here, because of what we have
experienced, he cannot. I want to be able to tell my child that he
can be president whether he is a military man or not, whether he is
from the north or south _ only that he is a citizen of Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   During the weeklong campaign, neither candidate offered
specifics on how to address the myriad problems of a country
potentially rich as the world's sixth-largest oil producer, but
hobbled by gross corruption and deep ethnic, religious and regional
fissures. But if Obasanjo sold himself as the man capable of safely
guiding Nigeria to civilian rule from a military ever ready to
snatch back power, his rival presented himself as a clean break
from the past.
</P>
<P>
   Falae, a former finance minister, attacked an Obasanjo
presidency as a continuation of military rule. His message
resonated in this country, which has been ruled by the military for
all but 10 years since 1960. But it was undermined by his
campaign's poor organization and overwhelmed by Obasanjo's
better-financed campaign, which enjoyed the support of the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo, a Yoruba from the southwest, is the candidate for the
dominant People's Democratic Party. Falae, also a Yoruba from the
southwest, is the joint candidate of the Alliance for Democracy and
the All People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hopeful the transition to democracy will be smooth and
that with the rest of the world watching Nigeria will once again
regain its former glory,'' Obasanjo said after voting in his
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Falae also voted in his hometown. ``If the election today is
free and fair and peaceful and Obasanjo wins in those
circumstances, I will be the first person to congratulate him,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other Western countries have been trying
to prod Nigeria toward civilian government. American oil companies,
like Mobil and Chevron, have billions of dollars invested in
Nigeria, which ranks as the fifth-biggest supplier of oil to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Local, statewide and national assembly elections since December
were judged to be generally fair by election monitors. But there
has been enough evidence of fraud that election officials suspect
that of the 53 million registered voters in a population of 108
million, only 40 million are genuine.
</P>
<P>
   And so for the presidential elections, officials took strict
precautions, including having ballot papers printed in Britain,
Nigeria's former colonial ruler.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where a little more than half the population is
literate, people voted by having their thumbs stained with
indelible ink and putting their print on the box next to one
party's logo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More than 115,000 polling stations were set up across the
country, many in front of houses, on street corners or under trees.
To be elected to a four-year term as president, a candidate must
win the absolute majority of the popular vote and at least a
quarter of the votes in 24 of Nigeria's 36 states. If neither
candidate reaches those figures, whoever wins a simple majority in
a runoff will be the winner.
</P>
<P>
   In Nigeria's last presidential elections, in 1993, Moshood K.O.
Abiola, a billionaire businessman from the south, appeared to be on
the way to victory when the northern-led military government
annulled the elections. The event led to five years of ruthless
dictatorship under Gen. Sani Abacha, whose violations of human
rights turned Nigeria into an international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, after Abacha's unexpected death, his successor, Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar, began a series of reforms and eventually
scheduled elections with the promise of a hand-over to a civilian
government on May 29. But in the meantime, Abiola, who had been
jailed for refusing to renounce his claim to the presidency, died
suddenly under government detention, plunging the nation into
crisis and raising the specter of national disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   In Lagos, in the Ajengule slum, A.O. Adebajo, a 65-year-old
retired school principal, was the first in line to get accredited.
Two election officials had set up a small wood table, which Adebajo
had lent them, in front of the Vicky Best Beauty Salon, and put up
a poster than read, ``Polling Station.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really happy because we are going to a civilian
government,'' Adebajo said. ``Since 1960, things have been up and
down. If we are able to do this now, things will be better. It will
be shameful if things do not go well this time around.''
</P>
<P>
   His neighbor, Isaac Ekee, a 70-year-old retiree from the
merchant marine, was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is our exercise of power on who is right to rule
us,'' Ekee said. ``We know who is right to rule us. But I'm sure
that many will try to rig it, the moneybags. You see big people are
moving among themselves. They should just go home and rest and
leave us alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But the elections filled most people with hope, from Vivian
Agbadike, 20, born the same year Nigeria's last civilian government
was elected, to Amina Umar, 100, born 15 years before a British
colonial governor cobbled together patches of land to create
Nigeria in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like voting,'' Miss Agbadike said. ``I want someone who
is good to rule Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Umar, her back bent, her figure so small that she had to
reach over her head to drop her ballot inside the box, said: ``The
president should take care of the interests of commoners and poor
people like me. We want government to help us get money to solve
our problems. We need food, we need money for our children to go to
school. We need roads, water and light.''

RIGHT-WING MARCH SHOWCASES GERMANY'S DISENCHANTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAGDEBURG, Germany _ Their heads shaved, their boots polished,
hundreds of young men marched into the cathedral square of this
central German town Saturday chanting ``Glory and honor to the
Waffen SS.''
</P>
<P>
   Police, arrayed around the square with shields and water
cannons, immediately issued a warning to the neo-Nazi rightists:
``We will arrest anyone who goes on chanting this slogan.'' It is a
crime in Germany to exalt the deeds of the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, mostly members of Germany's rightist National
Democratic Party, quickly switched their tack, raising their voices
to demand ``Work for Germans first'' and declaring: ``The national
resistance is marching here.''
</P>
<P>
   The extreme right remains marginal in Germany, hemmed in by all
sorts of constitutional restrictions. But, although small, it is
growing, especially in former East German towns like this one where
unemployment is rampant. And the extremists appear to be highly
organized and determined.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, beneath the unseasonal sunshine of Magdeburg, close to
1,000 rightists deployed around a square with the precision of a
paramilitary organization. Older men, wearing brown leather coats
betraying a nostalgia for the Gestapo, directed the movements of
younger men, most skinheads in their late teens and early 20s with
a taste for black leather jackets and big boots.
</P>
<P>
   It is in these two age groups _ the embittered old and the angry
young _ that right-wing organizations have recently proved most
successful in finding recruits. They can exploit the frustrations
of older people who have known nothing but authoritarian rule and
now have neither work nor prospects, and of school-leavers who find
no job openings or apprenticeships as German unemployment rises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have doubled our membership to over 6,500 in three years
and we will rise to power in this country,'' said Steffen Hupka,
the regional leader of the National Democratic Party. ``We stand
for German values, German culture, and against the guilt complex
imposed on us by powerful groups, especially in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   In his leather jacket, with a cellular phone in each breast
pocket, Hupka was very much the modern agitator, measuring his
words but leaving no doubt of his revolutionary intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Many in his party, he noted, did not believe the Holocaust ever
happened, ``but I will not give my own view because I could be
arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, where Magdeburg is
located, is running at close to 20 percent. One banner raised
Saturday said, ``Turkey for the Turks, Germany for the Germans,''
an allusion to the large numbers of Turkish guest workers in
Germany. Most such workers are in the west of the country and not
in the formerly Communist east.
</P>
<P>
   Another banner said, ``Multiculturalism equals genocide.'' A
third showed a photograph of a young blonde girl with wide eyes and
braids, who might have been lifted from a Nazi propaganda movie:
``Does she have a future in this country?'' it asked.
</P>
<P>
   Economic problems in the former East Germany have clearly helped
the rightists enormously, especially in combination with Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's pledge to open the way for many of Germany's
7.3 million foreigners to become German citizens. Indeed the formal
reason for Saturday's demonstration was a protest against proposed
new immigration laws.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering underscored the way the issue of immigration has
prompted an unlikely coming-together of the moderate right and the
extreme right, if only on this issue. The Christian Democrats have
organized a highly effective petition against Schroeder's initial
pledge _ now hastily dropped _ to allow foreigners to hold dual
nationality.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Ramm, a 56-year-old construction worker who lost his job
six months ago, said he had voted for the Christian Democrats in
the last election but now felt drawn to the National Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``People my age no longer have a chance,'' he said, ``and
foreigners are pouring in. At least these people stand for German
ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   As close to 2,000 police officers surrounded the square and
circled overheard in helicopters, Ramm commented acidly: ``If the
German police checked our borders as well as they check all of us,
we'd be a lot better off.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A court decision in Magdeburg early Saturday prevented the
rightists from marching through the town and confined them to the
square. At the same time, a counterdemonstration was held by
left-wing organizations that featured a rock concert and signs
saying: ``No human being is illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinhard Hoeppner, the prime minister of Saxony-Anhalt,
addressed the counterdemonstration, saying that he protested
against ``this attempt to abuse the necessary discussion about a
reform of the citizenship law for fueling xenophobia.''
</P>
<P>
   But it seemed clear Saturday that much more than the immigration
issue lay behind the rightist rally. There was also disillusionment
at the difficult integration of East and West Germany, a process
that has left many Germans angry at what they see as the false
promises of western capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway between the rightist rally and the counterdemonstration,
a fashion show was held in Magdeburg's new shopping mall. But the
glitzy models, the surrounding fast-food restaurants, and the
overflowing mounds of fruit, cheese and salami in stores could not
mask the city's uneasy passage from a recent Communist past to a
strained present.
</P>
<P>
   One young man, the word ``skinhead'' tattooed into his head, and
``White Brotherhood'' emblazoned on his leather jacket, held aloft
a photograph of a helmeted soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fathers in the Wehrmacht were not criminals,'' it said.

U.S.-CHINESE TENSIONS GROW ON EVE OF VISIT BY ALBRIGHT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The Chinese government Saturday night issued a
predictably tart response to the lambasting of its human rights
record in a State Department report on Friday, expressing ``strong
resentment.'' The statement, read on the television news here,
accused the United States of hypocritically meddling in China's
affairs by ``fabricating unwarranted charges'' while ignoring
serious rights violations at home.
</P>
<P>
   The official response did not mention that on Friday Wu Yilong,
one of the founders of a banned alternative political party, was
detained in the eastern city of Hangzhou for questioning. Peng
Ming, a liberal intellectual who tried to run an independent
discussion forum in Beijing, was also sentenced on Friday, without
trial, to 1{ years in a labor camp.
</P>
<P>
   These latest developments only add to the pressure on Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright to take a strong line on human rights
in the talks she will hold here with Chinese leaders on Monday.
While both sides are hoping to nurture common ground in the
meetings, Albright will undoubtedly prod China over other perennial
American concerns, such as weapons sales and a widening imbalance
of trade.
</P>
<P>
   But she is likely to get an earful in return from the Chinese,
who are worried and perplexed by the seeming nose dive in relations
with the United States, which only last summer pledged to work for
a ``strategic partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent American policies and statements, Chinese foreign policy
experts assert, have been insensitive to China's legitimate needs
on several matters. These include the administration's decision
this week to bar sale of a satellite to a company with indirect
ties to the Chinese military, its sharp criticism on human rights,
its demands for a rapid opening of markets and talk of a possible
missile defense system for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China tends to see specific setbacks, such as the barred
satellite sale, as the work of deeper, hostile political forces.
``We interpret the satellite dispute as a reflection of strategic
thinking that regards China as a threat and an adversary,'' said
Chu Shulong, director of North American studies at the China
Institute for Contemporary International Relations, a government
research organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk in America of a `China threat,''' Chu said, ``is
something we really worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Chinese view, their country is no threat to world peace,
but is simply taking its rightful place as one of the world's great
powers. Many of the strongest American concerns about China,
analysts here tend to believe, reflect a desire to keep China in a
second-class status.
</P>
<P>
   Among officials and even many liberal intellectuals, there is
deep resentment of what they see as a foreign caricature of an
increasingly diverse and vibrant Chinese society as a grim police
state.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, some people who actively threatened Communist Party rule
have been jailed. But at the same time, people here constantly
note, Chinese have more personal choices than ever, private
business is booming and the rule of law is starting to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's visit, and another later in the week by the American
trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, are intended in part to
prepare for a high-profile visit to the United States in April by
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   Trade officials are negotiating furiously over China's desired
entry into the World Trade Organization. A breakthrough would crown
Zhu's American trip and give a needed boost to bilateral relations.
But chances appear slim that China, grappling with a major
restructuring of industry and soaring unemployment, can make enough
trade concessions now to satisfy American demands.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the festering problems, both governments seem to
hope that Zhu's visit can rekindle some of the glow that emanated
from the exchange of presidential summits in late 1997 and last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Though they will not concede their own principles to achieve it,
the Chinese leaders are anxious to sustain friendly ties: They know
that American technology and cooperation are vital to their
economic progress and besides, most Chinese admire American
culture. Just this week, the Grammy Awards ceremony was broadcast
live on state-run radio.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Chinese are smarting over what they see as
worrisome trends in American policy. They fear that the decision to
bar a commercial satellite sale portends new, broader curbs on
transfers of advanced technologies. In public, at least, officials
scoff at the notion that they are stealing secrets for military
application.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Chinese point of view, this decision is very hard to
understand,'' said Jia Qingguo, a professor of international
studies at Beijing University. ``The Americans complain about a
trade gap, but then they don't want to sell what China wants to
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   On human rights, China will vehemently urge the United States
not to sponsor a resolution criticizing China at the annual U.N.
conference on human rights, to begin in Geneva in late March. In
the wake of stiff sentences China has dealt to several democracy
activists, Congress is pressuring the administration to act.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese government, which argues that society is
gradually loosening, sees such resolutions as gross intrusions on
its sovereignty. ``China feels very strongly about this,'' said Chu
of the government research group.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has made a commitment to change its human
rights practices gradually, said Jia, but it also must worry about
social stability as it tackles severe economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do Americans wish China to do, unleash a wave of
political unrest?'' Jia asked. ``Political instability here is not
in the interest of the United States.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In meetings Monday with Albright, China is also sure to register
its adamant opposition to proposed research by the United States
and Japan on a ``theater missile defense'' system. The technology
remains hypothetical, but discussions of missile defenses were
quickened by North Korea's test of a long-range missile _ seen
especially as a threat to Japan _ as well as by China's buildup of
missiles on its coast facing Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China has warned that introducing missile defenses to Asia will
only trigger a regional arms race. But the basic idea of using such
weapons to shore up American power in Asia _ and possibly blunt
China's _ is anathema here. And what most outrages the Chinese is
the speculation that such a shield might be extended to Taiwan,
which is considered a renegade province. Providing missile defenses
to Taiwan, Jia said, ``would not only damage China's sovereignty,
but also pose an obstacle to unification of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders know that these issues and others will
inevitably divide China and the United States. But they had hoped,
especially after Clinton's glittering visit here last June, that
disagreements could be boxed off as the countries pursued their
``partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   As an overarching goal of this week's meetings and the prime
minister's April visit, Chu said, ``China wants to reconfirm the
positive trend in relations.''

DAVID H. SMITH, 67, MAKER OF MENINGITIS VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (as) 
 By KAREN FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW TORK _ David H. Smith, a researcher and entrepreneur who
helped figure out a way to coax even the immature immune system of
an infant into mounting a defense against a bacterium that causes
meningitis, died on Feb. 23 at his home on the Upper East Side of
Manhattan. He was 67 and also lived on Martha's Vineyard and in
Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was malignant melanoma, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith won the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research
in 1996 for his work in developing a vaccine against the bacterium
Haemophilus influenzae type B, or Hib. The prize was shared with a
former colleague, Porter W. Anderson Jr., and two researchers from
the National Institutes of Health, John B. Robbins and Rachel
Schneerson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hib vaccine work is a wonderful success story,'' said
Richard A. Insel, a professor of pediatrics at the University of
Rochester and a former colleague of Smith at the university. ``I
don't think people thought it would be this successful, almost
eradicating the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, about 20,000 cases of Hib invasive disease
in preschool children were reported to the federal Centers for
Disease Control. In about 12,000 of those cases, the children had
meningitis, an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord membranes
that can kill or cause permanent brain damage. In 1997, a few years
after the vaccine became available for infants, 258 cases were
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Smith became convinced that a Hib vaccine was feasible but could
not interest a drug company in the work, so he founded Praxis
Biologics in Rochester in 1983, said his wife, Joan. ``He was so
determined to do this,'' she said, ``that he quit his job and
mortgaged the house and founded the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Praxis' first vaccine was developed in 1985, but it was
effective only in older children. In 1989, the company was bought
by American Cyanamid and became Lederle-Praxis. Smith was chairman
and chief scientific officer of the new company in 1989 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A successor company, Wyeth-Lederle Vaccines, won approval in
1990 for a vaccine that is now used in infants starting at 2 months
of age.
</P>
<P>
   That vaccine stimulates an infant's immune system by joining a
protein from another bacterium, like tetanus or diphtheria toxin,
to sugars from Hib bacteria. The protein stimulates immature immune
cells, prompting the production of antibodies to the Hib sugars and
protecting the child from infection.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy of using what is known as a ``conjugate'' vaccine
is now being studied to see if it is effective against other
childhood diseases.
</P>
<P>
   David Hamilton Smith was born in Canton, Ohio, and graduated
from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1953. He earned his medical degree
at the University of Rochester School of Medicine in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   He conducted research at Harvard Medical School, and served as
chief of infectious diseases at Boston Children's Hospital from the
late 1960s to 1976. He was chairman of the pediatrics department at
the University of Rochester from 1978 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He was also active in conservation efforts. He led the effort to
establish the Polly Hill Arboretum, a 60-acre tract with more than
2,000 species of plants, on Martha's Vineyard; it opened to the
public last year.
</P>
<P>
   He also gave more than $9 million to the Nature Conservancy to
finance 48 postdoctoral researchers to study freshwater
conservation. He was on the board of the Environmental Defense Fund
at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Smith is survived by a brother,
Richard, of Delaware, Ohio; three daughters, Andrea Smith and
Rachel Smith, both of New York City, and Jennifer Smith of Takoma
Park, Md.; two stepdaughters, Jody Leader of Brookline, Mass., and
Kristin Leader of Rome, and five granddaughters.

SPORTS COLUMN: A CONTENDER'S FEELING DOWN IN PORT ST. LUCIE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Across the state, the Yankees steel
themselves for their title defense in a bustling big-league city,
down the boulevard from a cluster of strip clubs. Here, with
nothing in sight except a handful of neat, low-slung strip malls,
the Mets quietly train for the storm of expectation that awaits
them in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know what to expect,'' Mike Piazza said the other day,
sitting shirtless at his dressing stall in the middle of the
clubhouse. He _ like Rickey Henderson and Bobby Bonilla _ is a rare
Met who does know what it is to step into the New York baseball
season and be counted on to immediately perform with a post-season
strut. He may be the only Met who has actually confronted the jury
of sneering critics, made them blink and eventually smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we start thinking about competing with the Yankees,
we've got to worry about our own division,'' Piazza said. ``But
it's true, the owners here spent the money on the free agents.
They've committed themselves to winning. They're giving it a
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet March, but already the buzz for the Mets has
begun. The general manager, Steve Phillips, talks about the
electricity in the clubhouse, and admits they can no longer cling
to the security blanket of being that ``nice little team.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta already has lost Andres Galarraga. Houston did not
re-sign Randy Johnson, and Moises Alou is down for the year. The
Padres thanked the city of San Diego for agreeing to build them a
new stadium by surrendering the core of their National League
champions. Here is what this means for the Mets, who are chock full
of returnees and additions: Anything less than the wild card will
be perceived, given the expenditures and all that comes with them,
a considerable flop.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really good team,'' Bobby Valentine said in the
manager's office.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked if it was the best team, at least on paper, he had
ever managed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have all the lineups,'' he said, opting out of that
loaded question in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine has never had the luxury of oiling a winning machine
like Joe Torre's Yankees, but he has never made the playoffs with
some above-average talent either. He can be thin-skinned about
that, and he has a strange habit of blowing a small controversy
into a Kansas cyclone, so it is not unfair to wonder how Valentine
will hold up in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Some managers and coaches have excellent careers in the comfort
zone of steering bad teams to respectability. It is entirely
another task, psychologically and otherwise, when management hands
you an expensive payroll, pats you on the back and informs you, in
so many words, that it has already factored post-season revenue
into its fiscal budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put together a wish list and were able to get everyone on
it,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   In the ideal season, the Mets believe themselves capable of
mounting a challenge to the Braves. In the more realistic setting,
they are carrying the playoffs-now burden with a pitching staff
that contains no dominant starters, questionable depth in the back
end of the rotation and an aging, vulnerable closer. They could
easily find themselves in another wild-card race, under more
extreme pressure this time to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances are that there are going to be ups and downs, some
difficult times,'' Piazza said. He wanted to make it clear that
while he is brimming with personal confidence, anticipating numbers
as good as any he produced in Los Angeles, one player cannot carry
a team. He feels ready, though, to shoulder a different load,
assume the role for which he underwent on-the-spot training last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, under $100 million expectations, he didn't hit, as
advertised, but he took the city's best shots, and came back
swinging. Came back to at least carry the Mets into the playoff
chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing that happened for me was that I was force fed
into that kind of situation last season, dealing with that
blue-collar baseball mentality New York has,'' Piazza said. ``I'd
never experienced anything like that. There was some criticism in
LA, but, really, out there it was like I could do no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say last summer was easy, because there was
so much change, some tough times. But I couldn't have planned it
any better, the way it worked out. I feel good about the fact that
I hung in there. I think New Yorkers can appreciate that. I feel
more ready now to try to not only get into the playoffs, but lift
my team once I get there, which, for whatever reasons, I wasn't
able to do in LA.''
</P>
<P>
   He wisely offers no guarantees, but makes this promise: ``After
last season, after facing some things as an athlete and a person
that I never had to before, I can't imagine I'll ever be afraid to
fail.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same soft-spoken way, he sounded like David Cone, who,
pitching for the Mets or Yanks, has hunkered down right in
Manhattan, looked New York right in the eye. After checking out the
suburbs, Piazza has kept his apartment in Manhattan. Down here in
Port St. Lucie, in the midst of open space, curious retirees and
gentle ocean breezes, he prepares for April, for chillier days, for
the big-city storm that comes for New York's teams that dare to
contend.  &QL;

WITH GINGRICH GONE, GOP STRATEGIST CARRIES ON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ohio)  (Eds: See also CALIF-REPUBS) 
(mk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Picture Sancho Panza trying to lope forward without
Don Quixote and the task of Rich Galen suggests itself as he hits
the hustings once more at the head of GOPAC, the strategizing and
fund-raising vehicle for the conservative revolution once led by
Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   With all those many political windmills still standing out
there, Gingrich is gone, purged from the House speakership, and
Galen, his sharp-tongued insurgent sidekick, dares not yield to any
sense of exhaustion or despair, for there is a fresh campaign to be
scouted and waged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful what you wish for; you may get it,'' Galen responds
with a grin to Democrats as well as Republicans who admit to him
lately how vapid Washington seems with the hyperkinetic Gingrich
gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You miss Newt's political and intellectual energy,'' Galen
concedes only briefly, for he must carry on in the post-Gingrich
fray now as GOPAC faces the next election with control of the House
at stake and the Republicans nursing a mere six-vote majority.
</P>
<P>
   The gemlike flame of the 1994 House Republican victory was
nurtured in GOPAC, with its well-organized outreach recruiting and
training sessions for candidates who stormed into majority power in
a historic upset. But now, in carrying GOPAC forward, Galen must
help defend the crippled GOP margin in 2000, with Gingrich off in
the wilderness and the party hurting from the failed impeachment
trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republican Party, with some justification, is
trying consciously or unconsciously to wean itself from Gingrich _
possibly with too much ardor,'' said Galen, 52, who exemplifies the
capital's permanent political cadre, the lesser-known devotees who
endure beyond election results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Stalinist, an erasure of history,'' he continued,
pondering the party's identity crisis. ``But it's a strong sense
that this ain't Newt's party anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be strategists like Galen and other onetime Gingrich
stalwarts who will help tailor any fresh party image. He insists
that in his visits to promising precincts, which stretch from
county to national candidacies, he finds a party resolved, more
than wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get much lower than we were for the last two and a
half months,'' he said of the impeachment struggle. As a maverick
conservative, he had proposed an early negotiated settlement by
congressional leaders _ a proposal that saw him instantly
excoriated by pro-impeachment Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Galen is characteristically unbowed, particularly from the
pulpit of his GOPAC Web page (www.mullings.com), where he has been
entertainingly manic in explaining the capital's scandal culture to
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been spinning and leaking and appearing and predicting
and explaining and talking and making up jokes and making up
excuses and getting made up and rolling our eyes and counting votes
and reading more spicy material than we have since 1971 when we
discovered the complete works of D.H. Lawrence were available in
the college library under `Classical Lit,''' he summarized in one
riff, asking, ``Isn't our system great?''
</P>
<P>
   Galen, who was raised in New Hyde Park, N.Y., is a former radio
news reporter who tried politics on a dare, won a city council seat
in Marietta, Ohio, and then moved to Washington to become a
congressional and party strategist. He and Gingrich were cool
toward each other at first, but eventually the speaker had to
wonder aloud that they made a good team. ``I told him, `That's
because I'm twice as smart as you thought I was and you're only
half as crazy as I thought you were,''' Galen fondly recalled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I'm finding a fresh burst of energy now because we've gone
back to arguing the things we love to talk about,'' he said of
tax-cut proposals and the rest of the non-impeachment agenda that
he dearly craves. ``And there ain't nothing better than legitimate
presidential contenders to re-energize a party.'' He expressed
confidence that the Republicans could win the White House next year
and retain majorities in both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that optimism, Galen predicts ``a good old-fashioned '70s
and '80s political cycle,'' with a focus on wholesome issues and
personal scandal relegated to the fringe. He said the public wanted
it that way and that the two parties had little to campaign on in
their impeachment performances of attacking and defending the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is accruing to Republicans anymore,'' he
said of the public's resentment of impeachment. ``To the extent
that people thought we should be punished, I think we have,'' he
said of the shrunken House majority. ``It may well be that the real
danger lies with Democrats who so ardently supported Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Galen sounded wistful as he idealized politics as a creative
contact sport, not the blood sport it has seemed lately. ``If
you're going to be in politics, you have to be an optimist,'' he
said, sounding humbled by the banishment of his speaker, but
already busy traveling and strategizing beyond the Gingrich
revolution.

<P>
   The courtroom success that David Boies has enjoyed depends on
thorough preparation, plenty of backup from lawyers for the Justice
Department and 19 states suing Microsoft, and a steel-trap memory.
He starts with a script but, far more than most lawyers, diverges
from it. He will let a witness give a rambling speech and then,
seizing on a spoken sentence or two, he recalls a document among
thousands in evidence that refutes the witness's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists that though these ``gotcha moments'' of
courtroom drama may be prominently reported in daily news accounts
of the trial, they do not undermine the factual record of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the legal impact, it is often an impressive performance
_ made possible by Boies' formidable memory, which helps him
overcome the fact that he is dyslexic. A late reader as a child, he
still reads with difficulty. ``He overcompensates with an
overwhelming memory,'' observed his wife, Mary Boies, who is also a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense of IBM in a 13-year federal antitrust case
dropped in 1982, Boies, then a partner at Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore,
prepared to cross-examine the government's economic witness by
reading some background papers and being briefed for a half-hour by
two colleagues. During the briefing, Boies wrote four words on a
yellow legal pad, recalled another lawyer who worked on the case.
He then cross-examined the government's economist for five days
with those four words as his notes. ``It was a tour de force,'' the
lawyer recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Boies, who left Cravath in 1997 to start his own firm, Boies &AMP;
Schiller, is working for the Justice Department only on the
Microsoft case. His rate works out to under $50 an hour, he
figures, less than one-tenth his usual rate. By all accounts, it
has been a bargain for the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft legal team is led by William Neukom, Microsoft's
tall, silver-haired general counsel, and a corps of lawyers from
Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell including John Warden, Richard Urowsky and
Steven Holley.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom, 57, has been handling the company's legal affairs since
1979, when he was working at the Seattle law firm of the Microsoft
chairman's father, Bill Gates Jr. (The software entrepreneur is
Bill Gates III.) The senior Gates asked Neukom to handle a lease
for his son's 12-person software company, which was moving from
Albuquerque, N.M., a Seattle suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom bridles at the suggestion that Microsoft's defense has
stumbled badly. ``No one has an opinion that is worth a nickel
unless he or she has read all the written testimony, read all the
court transcripts and seen all the videotapes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The daily press coverage of the trial, he insists, is a
distortion because the stories magnify a dramatic moment or two
while largely ignoring the substance of the case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Boies approach, in Neukom's view, is to use the ``high jinks
of courtroom theatrics to try to obscure the evidentiary record.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, legal experts are skeptical. The Microsoft side, they
say, has made a puzzling number of basic mistakes, noting that
witnesses should not be surprised by documents or prior testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is the buzz of the legal community, and it's an
embarrassment for Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell and Microsoft,'' said Stephen
Gillers, a professor at New York University Law School. ``The one
way they can redeem themselves is to win, if not in this round then
before the appeals court or the Supreme Court. It's always hard to
argue with victory.''

 &HT;    Lyons comes of age
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Albany ruled Georgia high school basketball in the
early 1990s. Westover won four consecutive Class AAA boys titles,
twice beating rival Albany High, and college recruiters besieged
the southwest Georgia city in pursuit of such blue-chip prospects
as Dontonio Wingfield, Melvin Drake, Michael Spruill and Pertha
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   But the player who might have had the most raw talent in Albany
at the time wasn't part of any of it.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Lyons was nothing more than a playground legend then _ a
high-school dropout with loads of basketball moves and nowhere to
display them properly.
</P>
<P>
   Now _ at age 26 _ he finally has a stage. Soon, he might have a
much larger one.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leading junior college scorers in the nation, Lyons is
averaging 27 points per game at Georgia Perimeter College. Big-time
recruiters are flocking to south DeKalb County to see Lyons and the
cat-quick Jaguars, who went into the weekend 28-1 and ranked No. 3
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can stop Derrick,'' coach Alfred Barney said. ``Major
college coaches get a look at him and can't believe it. They all
wonder where he's been.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand how they missed him. College coaches
don't spend much time at Albany's Turner Job Corps Center, where
Lyons honed his skills after dropping out of high school without
ever playing a varsity game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my state championship,'' Albany High coach Archie
Chatmon said. ``Not even Westover could have beaten us with
Derrick. It's not a question of whether he was as good as those
other players back then but if he could have been even better. He
had that much talent.''
</P>
<P>
   But to show it, Lyons had to get on the court. When his mother
was forced to move in 1989, he transferred from Dougherty to Albany
late in the ninth grade. But he never gained his eligibility for
the next season. Hopelessly behind in school and short of money,
Lyons dropped out of school in 1991 at age 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard, real hard, to go to high school games then,''
Lyons said. ``Those players were getting all this attention, and I
was nothing. It hurt bad.''
</P>
<P>
   It hurt even worse when Robinson, Drake and Wingfield became
college standouts. Lyons had to watch them on television and
wonder, what if?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was wasting my basketball talent,'' Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   But to play in college, Lyons first had to get there. Encouraged
by Chatmon, Dougherty coach Charlie Givens and others, Lyons took
courses at Turner Job Corps, but he failed to get the GED he needed
in place of the high school diploma he never got. He was working
construction jobs around Albany when his life finally began to
change for the better.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing about Lyons for several years, Georgia Perimeter's
Barney tracked him down in the summer of 1997 and persuaded him to
give the GED test one more try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this was my last chance,'' said Lyons, who has a
6-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting the books like he never had before, Lyons passed the GED
test at age 25 after cramming for three months and became eligible
at Georgia Perimeter (then DeKalb College) for the second semester
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, a well-built 6-foot-4 guard, scored 21 points in his
first game _ against nationally ranked Allegany and Steve Francis _
and there has been no stopping him or the Jaguars since. They
finished No. 9 in the nation last year and this season have lost
only to Pensacola in the third game.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting better than 65 percent, Lyons scores on thunderous
dunks, unstoppable spin moves and high-arching 3-pointers. He also
swoops down on the ball like a condor in Georgia Perimeter's press
and is always willing to hit an open teammate with a pass. That's a
rarity in junior college basketball, where most players think that
they have to score to be seen by major colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is definitely one of the top players in junior college,''
said Barney, whose team is averaging 97 points per game. ``He can
take over a game. Florida State, Iowa State and other schools are
already after him, and a lot more will be if we get back to the
nationals.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lyons probably won't be eligible to play at a major college
until the 2000-2001 season _ when he will be 28. Because he didn't
enter Georgia Perimeter until January 1998, he won't graduate this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to sit out a year if I have to,'' said Lyons,
occasionally called ``Old School'' by teammates. ``After everything
(else), I'm not going to let that stop me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons' mother and grandmother are just as proud of having him in
school as they are of his basketball success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to encourage him the best I could, but I never thought
it would happen,'' mom Rose Ellis said. ``I'm sure glad it finally
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very proud,'' grandmother Mary Taylor said.
``None of my kids or grandkids ever finished high school or went to
college. Derrick is the first.

 &HT;    Heating up the hockey market in Atlanta
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They started with an $80 million expenditure, a hole
in the ground and a caricature of a bird that appeared to have used
too much feather mousse and would have Toe Blake spiking his
fedora.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, members of the sales staff, attired in team
togs, were out knocking on doors of 300 Atlanta businesses, waving
hockey sticks in one hand and ticket brochures in the other. A
half-page ad in this newspaper last week read, ``Power Play With
Pano,'' the hope that haute cuisine would lure the rich to the
luxury of a club seat.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Atlanta Thrashers' staging of clinics at ice and
roller rinks and youth centers is not considered unusual in
marketing circles, running ads in movie theaters and sending
representatives to a Kwanza festival, a Jewish synogogue and a
Catholic church men's club, comprising mostly retirees, at least
indicates a significant barrier push.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to new-time hockey. Sorry, Toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot different than it used to be,'' former Atlanta
Flames player Curt Bennett said recently, as he watched two dozen
kids at a Boys &AMP; Girls Club play street hockey. ``Are these kids
gonna go to a hockey game? Probably not. But it broadens the base
of hockey fans. Back when I was playing, I can remember (coach)
Boomer (Geoffrion) sitting in a little office downtown, on the
phone selling tickets. That was the extent of our marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Flames left for Calgary in 1980, they were averaging
10,024 fans per game. The NHL has mandated the Thrashers sell at
least 12,000 season tickets by March 15. The team will not release
a current sales figure, but Derek Schiller, the team's vice
president for sales and marketing, vows, ``It won't be a problem.
An announcement is imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fortunate. Because Schiller's father, Harvey, who happens
to be the Thrashers' president, said, ``If we don't sell 12,000
tickets, Derek's fired.'' He was joking. We think.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the unlikely, worse-case scenario, it is logical to
assume that the NHL is not going to strip Atlanta of its hockey
franchise, and in the process chuck the Time Warner/Turner empire
out of the exposure-hungry league and refund an $80 million
expansion fee. At Wharton, they would refer to that as a bad
business decision.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL has been aiming for a return to the Atlanta market since
Tom Cousins sold the team to Canadian Nelson Skalbania, who moved
the team to Calgary. The Flames' attendance dwindled over time. But
overall, they didn't suffer from lack of fan support as much as
little corporate involvement and a real-estate depression that left
Cousins strapped for cash.
</P>
<P>
   With about seven months to go before the Thrashers' first game _
214 days, according to the electronic billboard on the Downtown
Connector _ there is no indication that finances will be a problem
this time. The Omni has been replaced by one giant revenue stream,
an arena with 18,500 seats for hockey, with a title sponsor,
Philips, and 90 leased luxury suites. Club-seat sales have not been
as strong as hoped, prompting a recent corporate push and ticket
agents dressed like Wayne Gretkzy. But it is comforting to Derek
Schiller that approximately 65 percent of the team's ticket
purchases _ at an average of $45 per ticket _ have been personal,
nor corporate. The NHL average is 60 percent corporate, 40 percent
personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's a good sign that people are spending their own
money right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The message being: Atlanta is buying into a product, even though
a player hasn't been drafted, a coach hasn't been hired and general
manager Don Waddell only bought a Zamboni last week; actually, he
bought four at $55,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   There are other positive signs: Nashville, Tenn. _ with a
population of 700,000, 18 percent of the Thrashers' estimate of 3.8
million for metro Atlanta _ is averaging 15,846 fans in its first
year, has had 10 sellouts and even drew 13,507 the night Tennessee
played in the Fiesta Bowl. The population of the Atlanta area has
more than doubled since the Flames left, in large part because of
an influx of Northern transplants, and hockey's popularity has been
broadened by a roller-blading boom.
</P>
<P>
   It all bodes well for the short term. The belief is that the
Thrashers, because of the initial euphoria, have a
two-to-three-year honeymoon period to attract fans and establish
themselves. After that, Atlanta's tendency to support winners
figures to hold form.
</P>
<P>
   John Bevilaqua, the president of Creative Marketing Strategies
in Atlanta, said he suspects that the growth of street hockey will
lead a number of youths to persuade their parents ``to take them to
a game, even though the parents may not know anything about the
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Bevilaqua added, ``They've done a lot of things well. But in the
end, the quality of the product determines whether people come back
again. Think about Coke. They did all this market research and
thought it would be smart to change the formula they had used for
99 years. But consumers said, 'We don't like this.' The Thrashers
are the new kids in town. Everybody will try it. The Flames were
enormously popular for their first two, three or four years, then
their popularity tailed off. There should be enough transplanted
snowbirds now to sustain a fan base. But I'm not ready to say yet
they're going to be a success in the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   The executives of the Thrashers, like the brown song birds they
represent, are willing to sidestep out on a limb. Derek Schiller
left his comfortable position as head of marketing for the champion
New York Yankees to sell hockey to Atlanta. Schiller agrees that in
the end the product will determine the Thrashers' success. He joked
that the best marketing strategy is to ``sign Pavel Bure,'' a
reference to the Florida Panthers' post-Bure attendance jump.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers' roster figures to lack marquee value for at least
a year or two. But the first step of the marketing plan, Schiller
said, was merely spreading the word that the NHL is returning. He
estimated that when the team began its one-year-out marketing
campaign in October about 10 percent of Atlantans knew who the
Thrashers were. ``Now I believe that's up to at 60 to 70 percent,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That can be attributed to both advertising and exhaustive
efforts in the community. The team has staged several clinics and
has set up booths at events all over town. It recently kicked off a
street-hockey program in the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we said from the outset was we were not going to
pick out just one segment of the population to market to,'' said
Schiller, who played high-school hockey in Colorado Springs, and
still plays in an adult league. ``We wanted to reach across all
demographics.''
</P>
<P>
   If the name, ``Thrashers,'''was not immediately embraced by area
sports fans, the logo and team colors were. To Schiller, it meant
more than potential T-shirt sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a logo that has been received well in the marketplace
has done us a world of good,'' he said. ``If we had a poor logo,
people might say, 'I like the NHL but you guys are kind of boring.'
It's amazing the way a look (creates) perceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of breakfasts and cocktail parties have been used to
gauge feedback from current or potential season-ticket holders. In
the process, team executives have tried to create a buildup, with
little more than the logo in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You market potential,'' Schiller said.
</P>
<P>
   You try to create new avenues, like implementing hockey into
math programs in school _ one goal plus two goals equals hat trick.
You consider hiring a syndicated radio personality, Scott Ferrall,
to do play-by-play, hoping his celebrity appeal will compensate for
a lack of game-calling experience and maybe lead to a sweeter

 &HT;    Will Rodman help L.A. win title, or create havoc?
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Of all the accomplishments in an NBA career marked by
championships, suspensions and stupefying shenanigans, what Dennis
Rodman pulled off Wednesday eclipsed anything anyone has ever done:
He got a coach fired before playing a single game.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, that's what the Lakers' expulsion of Del Harris came
down to; if Harris could not handle the ultra-talented bunch
without Rodman, general manager Jerry West reasoned, the decent,
respectful Harris would get run over once the pierced-bodied,
robo-rebounder showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already there are problems,'' Rodman acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   And the fun has just begun.
</P>
<P>
   Signing Rodman for the rest of the season amounted to a
crapshoot for Los Angeles. If he performs on the court as he has
over the years _ that is, defend the post with fervor, rebound in
traffic and project an energy that permeates his team _ the Lakers
could become the championship team they look to be on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that Rodman was nearly as valuable as Michael Jordan
during the 1996 NBA finals against Seattle, hauling in virtually
every key rebound. And his defensive job on Karl Malone was
significant to last year's Chicago three-peat.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Rodman) brings something different to the table,'' West said.
``He brings a tenacity. We've never had a player like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting Rodman alongside all-stars Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant catapults the Lakers to the top of the league in marquee
value.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the equation, however, is frightening. B.R. _
Before Rodman _ the Lakers have shown themselves to be a fragile
group, capable of imploding at the mere scent of turmoil. It was
convenient to bounce Harris after the team continued to
underachieve with three losses in a row, the last pair to inferior
Denver and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   West used such words as ``floundering'' and ``deterioration'' to
describe the club. The Lakers played listlessly, and Harris, an
ordained minister, did nothing to reverse their plight. Last year,
he won the battle with former Laker guard Nick Van Exel, whom he
failed to control or co-exist with much of the season. West dealt
Van Exel to Denver, hoping that Derek Fisher's team-oriented
approach would serve the club better. It hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   And so, enter Rodman. The flip side to A.R. _ After Rodman _ is
that the psychedelic-haired, tattoo-covered forward has a penchant
for creating an atmosphere of discord. Over the years, he's been a
one-man El Nino, causing havoc in devastating fashion. His antics
with the San Antonio Spurs in the 1995 playoffs _ two ejections for
flagrant fouls, two bare feet after taking his shoes off on the
bench _ preceded the team's elimination by Utah and his move to
Chicago. With the Bulls, many times they overcame Rodman's
silliness en route to three championships.
</P>
<P>
   There was Jordan to do what David Robinson did not in San
Antonio, which was impose his will and strong personality. And,
significantly, there was coach Phil Jackson, who deftly dealt with
Rodman by allowing him enough space to function in his far-out
world but remain a viable cog on the court.
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling if Kurt Rambis, the interim coach, can
command enough respect from Rodman to keep him relatively in check,
but the evidence was blatant that Harris was not that savvy or
strong-willed. If Rodman's foolishness _ and there will be some _
distracts the talent, the Lakers again will not fulfill their
promise. After all, what place embraces weirdness more than L.A.?
And there are hourly flights from there to Rodman's city of
lewdness and crudeness, Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could (not) care less what players do off the floor,'' West
said.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds good _ until Rodman starts missing practices and
planes. Until he starts offending fans and officials alike,
insulting teammates and spewing venom in the media. Yet, so
intriguing is Rodman that even the fired Harris conceded to
regretting the lost opportunity to coach him. ``I don't know what
kind of ride it would have been,'' Harris said, ``but I sure wanted
to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ride with Rodman probably will register NBA earthquakes high
on the Richter scale. He craves attention so much that he'll see to
that. So, the ultimate question: Is Rodman worth the trouble?
</P>
<P>
   Considering what he could add on the court if he acts anything
close to ``normal'' off it, the answer is yes. But with this guy,
there are no guarantees.

 &HT;    Difficult task set before Jasper priest
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The Rev. Ron Foshage was a consoler in the
courtroom all through the dreadful trial that appalled America.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic priest was a familiar sight at the Jasper County
courthouse because he volunteered to sit with the ailing father of
the white racist on trial for dragging a black man to death.
Without the priest, the heartbroken Ronald King would have been all
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Foshage, known as Father Ron, offered to provide spiritual
comfort even though King is not Catholic and doesn't attend his
church. The priest's gesture was all the more extraordinary because
he is the pastor for District Attorney Guy James Gray, who was
seeking the death penalty for King's son. As Gray introduced one
startling piece of evidence after another, his priest sat a few
feet away, consoling a sometimes sobbing Ronald King.
</P>
<P>
   Many say Jasper could learn from Foshage as it tries to recover
from the emotional trauma of a two-week trial over one of the most
vicious racial killings in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father Ron wasn't trying to send a message, but if there's a
message in it, it's that we've got to help each other and forget
any feelings of hate and anger and dislike, and those kinds of
things,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Mays, who publishes a bi-weekly African American
newspaper called East Texas Communicator, said she was proud to see
Foshage by Ronald King's side in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say there is no racism in Jasper. I am not
going to say all blacks and whites get along in a good
relationship, because they don't,'' Mays said. ``But Father Ron's
outstanding, caring position during this trial is an inspiration to
what Jasper can become.
</P>
<P>
   Foshage, the only Catholic priest in Jasper County, has received
some unkind calls from people around the country. They criticized
him for supporting the father of John William ``Bill'' King, who
was convicted and sentenced to death last week for torturing and
beheading James Byrd Jr., a disabled black man.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most people thank me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crank calls do not surprise Jasper residents who have become
accustomed to cruel remarks from outsiders who blame the whole town
for what happened to Byrd. They defend Foshage as strongly as they
defend their town.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was setting a good example of how people ought to express
themselves toward people that are in trouble or who need a helping
hand,'' said Andrea Tatum, a Jasper optician.
</P>
<P>
   Foshage, 51, is well known in Jasper County even though
Catholics are less than 1 percent of the population. A native of
St. Louis, Mo., he has lived in Jasper for 13 years and serves as
pastor for four parishes. He drives 800 miles a week to celebrate
15 Masses and attend to other needs of his parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   He has assumed a leading role in trying to improve race
relations in Jasper since Byrd's murder, and presided at the recent
ceremony to remove the 163-year-old fence that separated black and
white graves in the city cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Foshage has comforted Ronald King since last summer, but was
spurned in his attempts to counsel Bill King. The priest went to
see Bill King in jail, but had no idea what to say to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a nervous wreck. I got in the car to drive to the county
jail and I said, `Jesus please either tell me what to say or don't
let me see him,''' Foshage said.
</P>
<P>
   When he got to the jail, he was told that King was not allowed
to have any visitors. Later, Bill King refused to see the priest.
</P>
<P>
   One person who did want to visit with Foshage was Gray, the
prosecutor. He has consulted the priest over the past few months on
the meaning of Bill King's Satanic tattoos as well as the Catholic
church's position on the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he is not a strong advocate of the death penalty but
believes it is necessary for murderers who would kill again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Catholic church's official position is that if a person
commits a serious crime and goes through a proper (legal) channel
and is judged by his peers, the church accepts the death penalty,''
Foshage said.
</P>
<P>
   He told the prosecutor, ``Guy James, this (case) meets all the
criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   In their meetings, the prosecutor showed the priest the evidence
he planned to present at trial. The priest knew the trial would be
a shock for Ronald King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mentioned to him if he needed some spiritual guidance, I
would certainly be there for him,'' Foshage said. ``I simply told
him that if no one was going to sit with him I would be proud to
because he's such a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald King has three other children. Two live out of town and
did not come to Jasper for the trial. His daughter in Jasper came
to court only a few times with her father.
</P>
<P>
   Friends say Ronald King's emphysema has deteriorated severely
since his son's arrest last summer. Before, he walked without
assistance and breathed on his own. Now, the 68-year-old retired
lumber mill worker uses a wheelchair and an oxygen tube.
</P>
<P>
   Foshage helped him to and from the courtroom during the trial.
On the days that Ronald King did not feel up to attending, Foshage
sat in his place in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really wasn't until the trial that he saw how horrible (his
son's involvement) was,'' Foshage said. ``Several times he would
turn to me and say, `Father l didn't know that.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when they were talking about the tattoos. They
showed the Blessed Virgin and the Christ child with the horns,''
Foshage said. ``He turned to me and grabbed my leg and said,
`Father I'm so sorry' because he knew the Blessed Virgin was
important to us as Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most difficult moments of the trial for Foshage came
when Ronald King testified and tearfully pleaded with the jury to
give his son a life sentence. Ronald King was ashen-faced and
shaking and the priest was worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald are you OK?'' the priest asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to do this. I've got to do this,'' Ronald King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing Mr. King hurting so deeply and knowing I couldn't do
anything to take away the hurt really bothered me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Foshage did not meet Bill King until the jury was deliberating
whether to give him the death penalty. Law officers allowed Ronald
King to see his son for 20 minutes, and the priest accompanied him.
</P>
<P>
   While father and son hugged and cried, Foshage stood nearby. At
one point, Bill King shook the priest's hand and thanked him for
caring for his father.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the meeting, ``He pushed his father to me in the
wheelchair and he gave me a great big hug and said, `I can't thank
you enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wondering if Bill even loved his dad until I went back
and saw that moment,'' Foshage said. ``I said Bill we're praying
for you. I told him the Lord loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   Foshage himself was overcome with tears at one point during Bill
King's trial. When the jury convicted the younger King, his father
began sobbing and had to go home. But Foshage stayed.
</P>
<P>
   He went to the other side of the courtroom and hugged each
member of the Byrd family and told them that Ronald King wanted
them to know how sorry he was for their loss.
</P>
<P>
   When the priest returned to his seat, he was crying and so upset
he immediately got back up and retreated into a restroom. There, he
began to pray:
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord, you want me to be here, and I certainly need to be here.
Give me the strength to do what you want me to do or what needs to
be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Foshage returned to his seat a few minutes later, determined to
continue the assignment he said was the most difficult task he had
ever faced as a priest.

   BRITAIN-RACE _ LONDON _ The 600-page report on the 1993 murder
of a17-year-old black man named Stephen Lawrence in 1993 places the
spotlight on the treatment of blacks in London and the rest of
Britain, and is being described as the first shot in a revolution
in race relations. The report makes damning criticisms of the
metropolitan London police, pointing out, perhaps for the first
time in Britain, institutional racism. It calls for widespread
reform throughout government and highlights a rarely discussed
problem in modern British society. The investigation was so marred
from the start that the five men accused of the crime will probably
never be punished. (Roughton, Cox News Service).

   HATEGROUPS _ MANNING, S.C. _ An hour past midnight, pastor
Jonathan Mouzon sped toward his country church as fast as his Chevy
Lumina could carry him. A section of sky glowed the orange of a

to the door of the Macedonia Baptist Church. A skull and crossbones
on the white paper illustrated an ominous warning: ``KKK _ is
watching you.'' By the time he pulled up, what looked like a
tornado of fire churned from the middle of the church. Before
sunrise, Macedonia's ashes joined the heap of 400 other black
churches burned from 1993 to 1996. So when a white lawyer from
Alabama called offering to sue the Klan and win justice, some in
the Macedonia flock were skeptical. Doubters figured Morris Dees
was out to make a buck on their tragedy. But since co-founding the
Southern Poverty Law Center in 1971, Dees has wielded the civil
lawsuit like a Buck Knife, carving financial assets out of hate
group leaders who inspire followers to beat, burn and kill. Now in

WHEN LOYALTY TALKED, THE MANAGER DIDN'T WALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ Scene I: Team executives meet with prospective
manager in Dominican Republic hotel, virtually concluding agreement
except for signature.
</P>
<P>
   Scene II: Prospective manager flies home to Florida. Team
executives follow on flight two hours later, unable to join
prospective manager and perhaps get his signature because his
flight has no more seats available.
</P>
<P>
   Scene III: Team executives arrive at home of prospective
manager, only to find representatives of his current employer there
making an offer they hope he can't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Scene IV: Prospective manager accepts offer from current
employer, relegating himself to more losing seasons with
impoverished team and passing up opportunity to lead nouveau riche
team to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it was that Felipe Alou remained the manager of the
Montreal Expos instead of managing the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I didn't do was fly to Los Angeles,'' Alou
said, recounting his October experience. ``I was practically gone
from the Expos. When the Dodgers got permission to talk to me, they
flew to Santo Domingo and I met with them the first night they
arrived there at the hotel. We really had more or less an agreement
right away. There were a few small details left.''
</P>
<P>
   These scenes played out after Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' new
general manager, requested and received permission to speak with
Alou, with whom he had worked in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our families have been close,'' Malone said. ``His wife and my
wife have been very good friends ever since '94. It was a peculiar
situation. Because of our relationship, I wanted to do what was
best for him. We felt pretty much an agreement was in place. But
the Expos made it difficult for him to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Expos did not want their remarkably talented manager to
leave, why did they give the Dodgers permission to talk to him in
the first place?
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make him feel comfortable, whether that was
signing him to an extension or talking to other clubs,'' Jim
Beattie, the Expos' general manager, said. ``He said if other clubs
called, he'd like to talk to them. The Dodgers called, we asked him
and he said he wanted to talk to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou, at 63 the second-oldest manager in the major leagues, had
managed the Expos for seven seasons, a tenure that was preceded by
12 years as a manager in their minor-league system, including seven
years at the Class A level. He had built a reputation for being
able to overcome a steady exodus of his best players and still
field a competitive team made up of youngsters who responded to his
leadership. If not for the players' strike in 1994, he might have
taken the team to a division championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos last year had an $8.3 million payroll, the lowest in
the majors, and did not plan to remove the decimal point and have
that much larger number as their 1999 payroll. The Dodgers, on the
other hand, will pay their players an amount in that neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, we could do some things,'' Alou said, his eyes
lighting up at the thought of what might have been had he gone to
the Dodgers. ``They told me they were going to go out and get some
of the best players and they are doing that. It was an incredibly
good-looking situation for me to go to.''
</P>
<P>
   While Alou was talking to Malone and Bob Graziano, the Dodgers'
president, his wife, Lucie, called to tell him that the Expos would
like a chance to meet with him before he signed with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flew back to Florida and the Dodgers flew to Florida but not
on the same flight,'' Alou related, sitting in his spring training
office. ``That made a difference. My flight left at 8; theirs left
at 10.'' If they had gone at 8? ``You'd be talking to me somewhere
else. But there was no room on that flight.''
</P>
<P>
   When Alou arrived home, Beattie and an Expos minority partner,
Mark Routtenberg, were arriving to meet with him. ``They told me
they wanted me to stay,'' Alou said.
</P>
<P>
   Re-enter Malone and Graziano. ``They arrived about 1 o'clock in
the afternoon and they came to my house and the Expos were inside
the house,'' Alou said. ``That really was a tough call for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou said his wife took Malone and Graziano to a nearby
restaurant for lunch. Malone recalled that Lucie Alou was having
lunch at a restaurant next door to where he and Graziano went.
However the scene played out, Alou said, ``When they came back from
lunch, it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou's contract with Montreal had this year remaining. The Expos
offered to add two years and raise his salary to what will amount
to $2 million a year. Alou has never been about money, but the
Expos, in effect, are rewarding him for his quarter century of
service and extreme loyalty to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Malone and Bob Graziano are two beautiful people, great
people,'' Alou said. ``Kevin and I have a lot in common. I didn't
know Graziano. What a wonderful person he is. I was caught in the
middle. I decided to stay with the Expos.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did he pass up the chance to see how the wealthy teams in
baseball live? Alou cited his years with the Montreal organization,
the effort the team's representatives made by traveling to his home
and the fact that his wife is from Montreal and two of his children
were born there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the possibility of being in the World Series was
attached to managing the Dodgers,'' Alou said. ``But there are
times when you are so committed to something. If you tie a dog to a
chain for a long time, chances are that when you try to turn that
dog loose he can't go anywhere. I believe that's what happened to
me. The permission was granted for me to leave. I talked to the
people who wanted me, and they had everything that I asked and
more. Instead, I turned around and stayed where I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Beattie said that knowing Alou, he was not really surprised that
he opted to stay. Malone also knows Alou.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed,'' Malone said, ``but I think that was more
from a friendship standpoint. It didn't surprise me. I felt he did
what was right for him.''

<P>
   Rest, on His Own Terms
</P>
<P>
   And on the day of the 2,633rd game, Cal Ripken rested.
</P>
<P>
   That was last Sept. 20, when the Baltimore Orioles played the
New York Yankees and Ripken removed himself from the lineup. After
having played three seasons and 502 games beyond Lou Gehrig's
fabled 2,130-game streak, Ripken decided to end his own
mind-boggling, body-defying streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had no regrets, no feeling of euphoria, no feeling of
sadness,'' the 38-year-old third baseman said. ``Everything seems
very normal to me. There's no relief, no sadness, no jumping up and
down. It just seems normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken, who had last missed a game 16{ seasons earlier _ that's
16{ seasons _ said there was not necessarily one reason he could
cite for his decision to sit down that night, but he offered one
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always uncomfortable that the streak sometimes would
overshadow the team,'' he said, countering the suggestion of his
critics that he was always more interested in the streak than the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to put the focus back to where it should be. I don't
like the focus to go away from the team. I just come out to play
and try to help you win. When the focus starts getting pulled away
from that, it can almost be seen as counterproductive to your team
and it's time to put the focus back where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did he pick that game?
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed that the timing was right,'' he said. ``I made
up my mind if we fell out of the wild-card race, if we couldn't get
back in it and the games didn't mean anything toward the end, then
I'm going to take a day off.''
</P>
<P>
   Orioles manager Ray Miller said he plans to give Ripken a day
off now and then. How will it feel having time off? Ripken said he
did not know.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's uncharted territory for me,'' he said. ``I just know
what it's like to play 162 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone Defends Himself
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' general manager, took exception to
the charge by executives of other clubs, reported here last week,
that he has hired scouting and player development people away from
other teams by offering gobs of ``Murdoch money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not true,'' Malone said. ``I've never said, `I've
struck an oil well; are you ready to leave?' I recognize I have the
resources, but I didn't say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Two executives Malone has hired as assistant general managers
were specifically mentioned, Ed Creech, formerly of St. Louis, and
Bill Geivett, formerly of Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creech and Geivett coming to work for me had nothing to do
with money,'' Malone said. ``Creech was unhappy there. These people
who have come with me wanted to work with me. Creech and Geivett
are probably the two lowest-paid assistant general managers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Curious Strike Zone
</P>
<P>
   The edict from the commissioner's office that the strike zone
commonly called by umpires will be raised to 2 inches above the top
of the uniform pants has people puzzled. The memo notes that the
upper limit of the strike zone, as defined in the rule book, is a
line midway between the top of the shoulders and the top of the
pants.
</P>
<P>
   That line is well above two inches above the pants _ unless the
batter is Ed Grimley, the old Martin Short character from
``Saturday Night Live.''

WINTHROP K. EDEY, 61, CLOCK ENTHUSIAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (as) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Winthrop K. Edey, who found nothing so fascinating as
the mechanical clarity of antique clocks and the minutiae of his
own offbeat life, died on Feb. 22 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
Center, near his home on the Upper West Side. He was 61 and had
devoted his life to assembling one of the world's finest private
collections of clocks and watches and to the extraordinary diary he
had kept since he was 6.
</P>
<P>
   His family said the cause was Hodgkin's disease.
</P>
<P>
   If he sometimes seemed eccentric _ and a man who strolled in
Central Park wearing plaid Bermuda shorts, short black socks and
brown wingtips inevitably would _ Edey, known as Kelly (a
diminutive of his middle name, Kellogg), was simply not bound by
the usual constraints of life.
</P>
<P>
   As the grandson of Morris W. Kellogg, an engineer who made
millions designing and building oil refineries, not to mention the
nation's World War II atomic-bomb plants, Edey was relieved of the
need to earn a living.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, after growing up in Upper Brookville on Long
Island, graduating from Amherst College and studying at the
Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, he spent the rest of
his life doing exactly what he felt like doing exactly when he felt
like doing it.
</P>
<P>
   To Edey, who began taking clocks apart and putting them back
together about the time he started his diary as a boy, what he felt
like doing was pursuing his childhood interests with such devotion
that they became virtual obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way Edey, whose interest was less in the clocks' often
elaborate decorative cases than in the timeless beauty he saw in
their intricate inner workings, turned himself into an
internationally known expert on the history and construction of
antique clocks and collected them with such a discriminating eye
that when he helped the Frick Collection assemble an exhibition of
French clocks in 1982, nine of the finest specimens were from his
own collection.
</P>
<P>
   A creature of habit for all his financial freedom, Edey chose a
life of such regularity that friends could set their watches by his
schedule. He got up at 5 in the afternoon, his pleasure at having
slept while others were working unmarred by a need to work while
others were at rest.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, after an evening out with friends (dinner for them,
breakfast for him), Edey would return to his West 83rd Street town
house and work through the night studying clocks, pursuing a
separate and abiding interest in ancient Egypt and writing in his
diary.
</P>
<P>
   Described as Proustian in its sweep and attention to detail
(Edey could devote several pages to the ramifications of a friend's
failure to return a phone call) the multivolume diary, some of his
friends are convinced, will someday be regarded as an important
social document of New York life in the second half of the 20th
century.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it will be partly because Edey traveled in some heady art
circles, befriending the likes of Andy Warhol (who included Edey in
his 1963 underground movie, ``The 13 Most Beautiful Boys'') and
Robert Mapplethorpe, as well as prominent gallery owners, museum
officials and collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Edey also developed a passionate interest in photography,
assembling a small but impressive collection of photographs by Man
Ray and others, and taking pictures of his own, generally New York
street scenes and foreign landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Edey, a fussy sort who favored old-fashioned fountain
pens over ballpoints and maintained his town house in such
19th-century purity that it still has its original working gas
jets, tapestries, stove and marble-slab kitchen table, was not one
to whip out a little Leica when he spotted an appealing scene on
his extensive travels.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he, or rather his hapless traveling companion of the
moment, would lug a huge, wooden turn-of-the-century view camera
complete with tripod and 11-by-14-inch glass plates. Although he
continued to take pictures, which often had a dark, moody quality,
after an exhibition in the early 1970s, Edey did not pursue
photography professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Edey is survived by a brother, Maitland, of Vineyard Haven,
Mass., and two sisters, Beatrice Phear of Cambridge, Mass., and
Marion Edey of Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Edey, who began buying antique clocks before they became a
collecting rage, continually refined and improved his collection of
about 60 clocks and watches, 39 of which he has given to the Frick
Collection, along with his diaries.
</P>
<P>
   Pending an appraisal, Edgar Munhall, the Frick curator, would
not venture a guess on how many millions the clock collection might
be worth, but after taking a glance he suggested that the real
treasure might be the diaries, whose publication future is yet to
be determined.

 &HT;    Boston Ruins most surprising
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a year that could see four of the ``Original Six''
teams _ Boston, Montreal, New York Rangers, Chicago _ miss the
playoffs, along with 1998 Stanley Cup finalist Washington, no
team's collapse this season is more surprising than the Bruins. The
Capitals have suffered an inordinate number of the injuries, while
the Bruins, considered a team on the rise, are struggling at the
.500 level despite strong goaltending from Bryon Dafoe and one of
the league's best coaches in Pat Burns. And that coach is getting
fed up. ``Everyone here is worrying about things they can't
control,'' said Burns, who has never missed the playoffs in his 10
years as a head coach. ``I'm sick of all that. I'm sick of the
money, sick of people saying we're lifeless, that we don't play
with emotion. Well, one think I'm not is a quitter.'' Dafoe is
among the leaders in goals against average (2.12), saves percentage
(.924) and shutouts (six). But the Bruins are scoring only 2.58
goals per game. Dafoe said, ``It's discouraging. As happy as I do
feel about my goals-against (average) and save percentage, I'd
trade it in for where I was as far as wins last year. I'm ahead in
all categories from last year except for wins. Probably the most
frustrating thing is you can go out and feel you had a pretty good
game, but you walk away pretty disappointed because it's a loss. It
doesn't matter how well you played because, if you don't win, it's
not satisfying. That's the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   TIES THAT BIND
</P>
<P>
   If Tampa Bay owner Art Williams accepts an offer of
approximately $125 milion for the Lightning from Bill Davidson, the
league should approve the sale quickly. Commissioner Gary Bettman,
a former legal counsel for the NBA, has strong ties to Davidson.
Bettman is seeking to upgrade some ownership situations in the
league, and Davidson who owns the Detroit Piston and the Palace in
Auburn Hills, Mich. _ has had his assets valued at $1.5 billion.
``We're pushing very hard to get this thing done quickly,'' said
Tom Wilson, Davidson's point man in negotiations. ``At this point,
anything that isn't a step back is a step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   That Carolina signed goalie Trevor Kidd to a two-year, $4
million extension hardly insures his future with the team. Kidd was
scheduled to become a restricted free agent but he still might be
left unprotected during the Thrashers' expansion draft, given the
career rejuvenation of starter Arturs Irbe. He is 6-9-3 with a 2.75
GAA and two shutouts. . . . The Rangers are pushing to get a deal
done with potential unrestricted free agent Brian Leetch. One
problem: Leetch doesn't merely want to be the NHL's highest-paid
defenseman, about $6 million annually, he wants to be among the
highest paid players, $8 million or more. Leetch: ``Everyone is
pretty much in the same mode: We'd all like to stay. But come July
1, you're in a great position to decide where you want to play for
a good portion of the rest of your career.'' . . . Only one thing
prevented Buffalo from acquiring center Doug Gilmour from Chicago:
Gilmour exercised his no-trade clause. The Sabres would have
shipped Matthew Barnaby to the Blackhawks. Barnaby, a nightly
scratch for the Sabres, said, ``Sometimes it's better to move on.
I'm still part of the Buffalo Sabres, but when you haven't played,
you lose focus.'' . . . The Rangers continue to shop defenseman Ulf
Samuelsson in an attempt to trim their payroll, and Philadelphia is
interested. . . . Phoenix forward Rick Tocchet after a 7-1 loss to
Florida: ``They looked like the (Soviet) Red Army team. Geez, they
were flying. They looked like 21 (Pavel) Bures out there.''

<P>
   The courtroom success that David Boies has enjoyed depends on
thorough preparation, plenty of backup from lawyers for the Justice
Department and 19 states suing Microsoft, and a steel-trap memory.
He starts with a script but, far more than most lawyers, diverges
from it. He will let a witness give a rambling speech and then,
seizing on a spoken sentence or two, he recalls a document among
thousands in evidence that refutes the witness's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists that though these ``gotcha moments'' of
courtroom drama may be prominently reported in daily news accounts
of the trial, they do not undermine the factual record of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the legal impact, it is often an impressive performance
_ made possible by Boies' formidable memory, which helps him
overcome the fact that he is dyslexic. A late reader as a child, he
still reads with difficulty. ``He overcompensates with an
overwhelming memory,'' observed his wife, Mary Boies, who is also a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense of IBM in a 13-year federal antitrust case
dropped in 1982, Boies, then a partner at Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore,
prepared to cross-examine the government's economic witness by
reading some background papers and being briefed for a half-hour by
two colleagues. During the briefing, Boies wrote four words on a
yellow legal pad, recalled another lawyer who worked on the case.
He then cross-examined the government's economist for five days
with those four words as his notes. ``It was a tour de force,'' the
lawyer recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Boies, who left Cravath in 1997 to start his own firm, Boies &AMP;
Schiller, is working for the Justice Department only on the
Microsoft case. His rate works out to under $50 an hour, he
figures, less than one-tenth his usual rate. By all accounts, it
has been a bargain for the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft legal team is led by William Neukom, Microsoft's
tall, silver-haired general counsel, and a corps of lawyers from
Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell including John Warden, Richard Urowsky and
Steven Holley.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom, 57, has been handling the company's legal affairs since
1979, when he was working at the Seattle law firm of the Microsoft
chairman's father, Bill Gates Jr. (The software entrepreneur is
Bill Gates III.) The senior Gates asked Neukom to handle a lease
for his son's 12-person software company, which was moving from
Albuquerque, N.M., to a Seattle suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom bridles at the suggestion that Microsoft's defense has
stumbled badly. ``No one has an opinion that is worth a nickel
unless he or she has read all the written testimony, read all the
court transcripts and seen all the videotapes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The daily press coverage of the trial, he insists, is a
distortion because the stories magnify a dramatic moment or two
while largely ignoring the substance of the case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Boies approach, in Neukom's view, is to use the ``high jinks
of courtroom theatrics to try to obscure the evidentiary record.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, legal experts are skeptical. The Microsoft side, they
say, has made a puzzling number of basic mistakes, noting that
witnesses should not be surprised by documents or prior testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is the buzz of the legal community, and it's an
embarrassment for Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell and Microsoft,'' said Stephen
Gillers, a professor at New York University Law School. ``The one
way they can redeem themselves is to win, if not in this round then
before the appeals court or the Supreme Court. It's always hard to
argue with victory.''

MOLLY HARROWER, 93, RORSCHACH TEST EXPERT 
</HEADLINE>
  (as) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Molly Harrower, a clinical psychologist who devised a Rorschach
test for use in group therapy, died on Feb. 20 at her home in
Gainesville, Fla. She was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harrower developed her own set of inkblot cards to
administer to groups of Canadian military recruits in World War II.
Known as the Harrower Blots, the tests were used to help analyze
personality traits through a subject's interpretation of a standard
series of inkblot designs.
</P>
<P>
   She also refined diagnostic tests to measure tolerance for
stress.
</P>
<P>
   With Dawn Bowers, Dr. Harrower edited ``The Inside Story:
Self-Evaluations Reflecting Basic Rorschach Types'' (Erlbaum,
1987). Among her other titles were ``Appraising Personality''
(1952), ``Personality Change and Development'' (1958), ``The
Practice of Clinical Psychology'' (1962), ``Psychodiagnostic
Testing: An Empirical Approach'' (1965) and ``The Psychologist at
Work'' (revised edition, 1971). She also wrote ``The Therapy of
Poetry'' in 1974 and contributed to ``The Quest for the Nazi
Personality: A Psychological Investigation of Nazi War Criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harrower, a native of South Africa, was educated in England
and graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of
London in 1928. She briefly studied dance and painting in France
but was persuaded to continue her education on a fellowship at
Smith College with the theorist Kurt Koffka, a founder of Gestalt
theory.
</P>
<P>
   Working for Koffka, she obtained her Ph.D. at Smith in 1934. The
association prompted a book, ``Kurt Koffka: An Unwitting
Self-Portrait,'' reprinted in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harrower had a private practice in New York, worked as a
psychologist for federal agencies and taught at universities in
various parts of the country before joining the University of
Florida in 1968. She retired in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Mortimer Lahm, died in 1967.

 &HT;    Flames may be on move
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ It is with some irony that as Atlanta
prepares for a return to the NHL with an $80 million expansion
franchise and an expensive arena, the city's former NHL team
suddenly has all the appeal of a 63-cent Canadian dollar.
</P>
<P>
   And it might soon be headed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Harley Hotchkiss, a co-owner of the Calgary Flames,
said, ``Our only recourse is to leave'' if the Canadian government
does not grant the team some tax breaks. It was a microcosm of the
problems facing all six north-of-the-border franchises in the NHL.
The six Canadian teams _ Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Ottawa,
Toronto and Vancouver _ pay 10 times the property taxes _ $21.8
million _ of the 20 operating in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The financial situation is worsened by the fact that players are
paid in American dollars, even though revenues to the north are in
devalued Canadian dollars. Also, owners do not have the sweet arena
deals of most U.S. franchises.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ottawa is in first place in the Northeast Division
despite the NHL's third-lowest payroll and an average of 17,000
fans per game in an arena with 142 of 147 luxury suites leased. But
owner Ron Bryden estimates that he will lose $7 million _ U.S., not
Canadian _ this season, and he will not commit to keeping the
Senators in Ottawa past next season _ when, it's worth noting,
Alexei Yashin will be due a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should not come as a threat,'' Bryden said, referring to
a possible move. ``But if no one in Canada cares, why should I
care?''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is similar in Calgary, which landed the Flames
when owner Tom Cousins, needing a financial fix for the sagging
real-estate market, sold the club in 1980 to Nelson Skalbania, who
moved it out of the South. The Flames prospered, landing a new
arena and winning a Stanley Cup in 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 years later, the Flames might miss the playoffs for the
third season in a row and could be headed for financial losses
despite the league's second-lowest payroll. Attendance has dropped
more than 3,000 per game since a peak of 19,986 in 1990-91. And
with free-agency approaching, franchise centerpiece Theoren Fleury
will be gone sooner _ before the March 23 trade deadline _ or later
_ signing elsewhere after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury would have been dealt to L.A. three weeks ago, but the
deal was contingent on him approving a four-year, $25 million
extension. He declined, mostly for personal reasons: His wife is
pregnant and due in April, and he doesn't want to uproot his
family. L.A. remains a likely destination after the season, if the
Flames' can't find a trade partner. Calgary probably can't afford
to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating to know Fleury may not be here when all is
said and done,'' general manager Al Coates said. ``You don't like
to lose your top players for economic reasons. ... We have to be
careful. We have to keep our salaries in line. It's not our fault.
It's our problem but not our fault.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flames' last link to Atlanta is Al MacNeil, who coached the
final year before the move and now is the team's director of
operations. MacNeil says he thinks that the Flames will survive in
Calgary, but he recognizes the problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came here, it was another era,'' MacNeil said. ``The
people who brought the team here were successful businessmen,
Calgary was thriving and they weren't afraid to spend money. What's
knocking the heck out of us is the Canadian dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, Seattle and Portland are possible NHL markets.
Conservative projections have at least three Canadian teams
relocating _ Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's being said by the crepe-hangers,'' MacNeil said. ``But
the situation has to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleury is resigned to the possibility of leaving a city where he
has lived and worked for 11 years. What really disturbs him are
thoughts that the Flames might not be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look how much money hockey generates taxwise for the
government,'' he said. ``They should do something. If they keep
losing Canadian teams, that's a lot of taxes they won't be getting
from the players. These owners are businessmen. If you were a
businessman, would you just keep shelling it out?''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen years after moving to Calgary, the Flames face an
uncertain future. The only certainty is that they won't be moving
to Atlanta.

 &HT;    Art of the (side) deal
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nobody ever projected that Marty McSorley was going to
be the key to the Thrashers' first season. But Edmonton's possible
circumvention of expansion draft rules involving the veteran
defenseman has set off alarms with NHL officials.
</P>
<P>
   For the expansion draft, each team must expose one defenseman
and one forward who have each played 40 games this season or 70 in
the last two and who is either under contract for next season or
has an option for such. Oilers general manager Glen Sather is
planning to use McSorley as the defenseman, but there's a problem:
He's not under contract for next season, and actually, Sather
doesn't want to lose him.
</P>
<P>
   McSorley makes $1 million this season, but an Edmonton newspaper
said the GM will sign the vet to a voidable option year worth $2.3
million in 1999-2000. At that price, the Thrashers surely would
pass on McSorley. The belief is that Sather, because of a side deal
with McSorley, would let the option for next season expire, making
the player an unrestricted free agent, then re-sign him for
slightly over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The league is keenly aware of the scenario, but its power might
be limited. ``All contracts have to be approved by this office,''
NHL spokesman Frank Brown said. ``I won't comment on
hypotheticals.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers general manager Don Waddell said he ``would not make a
big deal about'' the McSorley situation. ``Nobody ever said we were
going to get a great team out of the expansion draft, anyway,''
Waddell said. ``Our main objective is to get a good goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   JERSEY UNVEILING
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers will unveil their home jerseys during March 27
ceremonies at Centennial Park. Further details will be made
available this week.
</P>
<P>
   STAT PACK
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa goalie Ron Tugnutt is on pace to have the lowest
goals-against average of the modern era, which is defined as when
the red line was introduced in 1943-44.
</P>
<P>
   Year _ Player _ Team _ GAA
</P>
<P>
   1998-99 _ Ron Tugnutt _ Ottawa _ 1.50
</P>
<P>
   1971-72 _ Tony Esposito _ Chicago _ 1.77
</P>
<P>
   1950-51 _ Al Rollins _ Toronto _ 1.77
</P>
<P>
   1953-54 _ Harry Lumley _ Toronto _ 1.86

<P>
   1955-56 _ Jacques Plante _ Montreal _ 1.86
</P>
<P>
   DRAFT PEEK
</P>
<P>
   It didn't make big news in Atlanta _ unless you work for the
Thrashers. Center Tim Connolly, projected to be one of the top five
players taken in the June amateur draft, suffered a broken leg last
week and is out for the season. Connolly, who had 34 goals and 34
assists in 46 games for Erie of the Ontario Hockey League,
attempted to skate around a Windsor player when the two collided
and went down. The good news for Connolly is that it was a clean
break, with no ligament damage, and some scouts say they think that
it won't affect his standing. ``That's why you scout these guys so
much early,'' Waddell said, ``because now you won't get another
chance to watch him play.''

 &HT;    Dealing with defeat Robinson's main obstacle
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Few question that NHL Hall of Famer Larry Robinson has
at least two of the three qualifications to be a successful coach:
1) he knows the game; 2) he commands respect from his players. But
the Los Angeles coach has yet to prove that he can deal with
defeat, as evidenced by several, woe-is-me, Hamlet-like speeches
and a tendency to blame officials after games, such as last week's
post-game explosion in Calgary. After a 2-2 to the Flames, Robinson
called the officiating, which didn't appear awful to most people,
the ``worst I've ever seen.'' If he is not fined by the NHL, it
will be a miracle. Robinson was particularly upset by Calgary's
tying goal, when 5-foot-6 Theoren Fleury appeared to grab L.A.'s
6-2 Mattias Norstrom in front of the net, stole the puck and
scored. Fleury laughed when told about Robinson's comments, alluded
to his own diminutive stature and said, ``Penalty on me? Yeah,
right. It was just a battle for the puck _ and I won.'' If the
Kings don't make the playoffs, Robinson probably will be gone, and
the decision will be made by president Tim Leiweke, not general
manager Dave Taylor. The Kings have been decimated by injuries all
season, but the team nonetheless has underachieved, and a new arena
with several unsold seats awaits next season. If available,
Robinson would draw interest from several teams, including the
Thrashers. To quote one NHL executive, however, ``There's no doubt
Larry's a great coach. But he doesn't take losing well. He might
need to be with one of the six teams that can win a Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   GOODBYE, DIRK
</P>
<P>
   One day after proclaiming, ``Everybody's job is in jeopardy,''
Chicago coach Dirk Graham proved prophetic _ as it related to
himself. The Blackhawks, with only 16 wins and 131 goals (2.22) in
59 games, fired Graham before he could complete his first season
and have given a mandate to replacement Lorne Molleken to open up
the offense. Graham was inspirational as a player, but his methods
didn't translate as a coach, and he certainly was no X-and-O
wizard. Even Molleken said, ``Dirk's belief was to simplify the
game. That was dumping the puck in and going in to create a
forecheck off that. Sometimes players got frustrated with it, for
whatever reason. But that was Dirk's belief, and as a coaching
staff, we backed it.'' The players didn't _ particularly Tony
Amonte, Doug Gilmour and Alex Zhamnov. A few days before the
firing, Amonte and Graham openly feuded on the ice during a
practice, then later claimed that it was all an act for the media.
No matter whether it was, Amonte's playing time had dropped
dramatically in recent weeks _ and he is the Hawks' top triggerman.
But Graham was ``set up for failure,'' to use GM Bob Murray's
words. There has been a blur of personnel blunders, and Murray
continues to suffer because of meddling from executives Bill Wirtz
and Bob Pulford.
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Seen in a Calgary souvenir shop: Flyers' souvenier pucks at
$4.95 (Canadian), Blackhawks' at $3.95. . . . There is a growing
believe that Dallas might not trade backup goalie Roman Turek, even
though it surely would lose him to Atlanta in the expansion draft.
Turek, 10-1-2 with 1.80 average and .921 saves percentage through
16 games, provides the Stars with an insurance policy should
starter Ed Belfour get injured during the team's possible Stanley
Cup run. Teams have 48 hours to deal after the playoffs before
setting its protected list, but Dallas might not want to sacrifice
a position player instead of a goalie because there is goaltending
depth in the system. . . . For those keeping track, coach Marc
Crawford won only three of his first 14 games in Vancouver. . . .
San Jose survived its road trip (4-5-1), but its playoff future
will be determined by a stretch in which the Sharks play 18 of 24
against Western Conference opponents. Center Mike Ricci said,
``It's definitely not time for us to say, 'Oh, God, this trip's
over.'''

   Rain will spread across the Northeastern states as a
strengthening storm system arrives from the Middle West. The day
will begin with some sunshine near the New England coast, but
clouds will thicken and rain will arrive during the afternoon and
evening. Farther south over the eastern Ohio Valley and Middle
Atlantic states, damp weather will prevail much of the day. A few
thunderstorms will be imbedded in the rain area over the Middle
Atlantic region later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Potent thunderstorms will erupt ahead of a cold front in the
Southeast. The thunderstorms will build from northern Florida and
southeastern Georgia early in the day into the eastern Carolinas by
afternoon. Strong, shifting winds between the ground and 15,000
feet combined with increasingly humid air will heighten the risk
for severe thunderstorms with hail and a few tornadoes during the
midday hours.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the cold front, gusty breezes from the northwest will
draw cooler air from the western Great Lakes through the Ohio
Valley to the interior Southeast. Snow showers will dust parts of
the northern Great Lakes states. Rapid clearing will follow the
cold front in the Southeast, but, farther north, clouds will linger
for much of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Wet weather will persist over much of the Pacific Northwest as
onshore flow delivers moist air from over the Pacific. Early
morning snow levels in the Cascades will be near 6,000 feet but
will lower to 4,000 feet by evening. Meanwhile, most of the
Southwest will be mild and dry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: When Winter Ends
</P>
<P>
   While the calendar indicates that winter isn't over until March
20, many meteorologists would say that the season ends Sunday. The
event commemorated on the calendar is the end of astronomical
winter, a time when the most direct rays of the sun shift from the
southern to the northern hemisphere. For the purposes of official
climate records, winter began on Dec. 1, 1998 and ends on Feb. 28,
1999. According to another unofficial measurement, winter will pass
on March 5, the end of coldest 90-day period of the year in most of
the northern United States.

AUCKLAND READY TO LEAD CHARGE FOR AMERICA'S CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ The City of Sails is what Aucklanders
call their metropolis, and it is much more than a marketing slogan
cooked up by an identity-hungry chamber of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Stand on the deck of the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, the
club that will be host to the 1999-2000 America's Cup regatta
starting in October, and you can see nearly 2,000 boats moored in
Westhaven Harbor. There are several hundred more nearby in Bay's
Water, where a local boy named Peter Blake learned to sail in a
dinghy long before he became a knight and a national role model.
There are several hundred more in Half Moon Bay, in Gulf Harbor,
and thousands more scattered among the myriad inlets and even the
backyards of New Zealand's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water is easy to get to here, and though boating is not
cheap, it is not considered to be elitist,'' said John Cutler, a
New Zealander who is sailing director for America True, the
challenger syndicate from the San Francisco Yacht Club.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there are an estimated 80,000 vessels in Auckland, one
for every 11 inhabitants. A year from now, when Team New Zealand
defends the America's Cup it won so convincingly in 1995 in San
Diego, enough of those vessels will be in the Hauraki Gulf to form
a spectator fleet that would dwarf most navies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got 650 boats in San Diego, and we're looking at peaking
at five to six thousand,'' said Tony Thomas, the America's Cup
event director. ``Can you imagine the atmosphere with a kind of
diamond surrounded by boats and inside that diamond are two
America's Cup yachts having a battle. It will be like a stadium, a
very full stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be the rough equivalent to staging an Alpine ski race in
Austria, or a football game in Dallas. And at least for the moment
in Auckland, souvenirs for the country's most prominent sports
team, Rugby Union's All Blacks, have been pushed out of the display
windows by paraphernalia hawking and hailing the merits of Team New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   ``In San Diego, there were a few people who knew about the
America's Cup and were excited about it, but the majority didn't
care,'' Cutler said. ``But down here, this is a substantial
event.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there's more to America's Cup than its popularity among
sailors. The event always provides a backdrop of intrigue and
clandestine activity on the technology front. In Auckland, it could
prove even more difficult to keep, say, a new keel under wraps
because the syndicates will be working in particularly close
quarters when the challenger series, known as the Louis Vuitton
Cup, begins Oct. 18. Unlike in San Diego, all the yachts and their
crews and support staff are expected to be based in the same
location: the Viaduct Basin which has been transformed at the
considerable cost of $45 million (U.S.) from a relatively shallow
fishing basin into a world-class harbor.
</P>
<P>
   When New Zealand won in 1995, Blake, the veteran sailor in
charge of the successful campaign, knew he wanted five years _
instead of the customary three or four it usually takes to mount a
defense _ to give Auckland time to prepare. Blake also wanted to
capitalize on the year 2000 hoopla and the synergy generated by the
Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone has shared Blake's buoyant vision, however. For one
thing, the long gap between cup competitions has not made
fund-raising easy for the challengers. And though Auckland has a
rich sailing culture, it lacked the sort of deep-water slips that
America's Cup yachts require.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that problem has been rectified, although several of the
syndicates are disgruntled that the rental fee for an empty lot in
the America's Cup harbor complex exceeds $200,000 (U.S.) for the
duration of their stay. Cutler estimates that construction costs
will bring the total price to well above $500,000 (U.S.).
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, 15 syndicates, 5 of them American, have made
official challenges for the cup, although Blake expects no more
than 12 to be on the starting line in October. Prada, the
well-financed and well-organized Italian syndicate, has constructed
its boat shed and headquarters. So has America One, whose skipper,
Paul Cayard, won the prestigious Whitbread Round the World Race
last year in his first attempt but remains most passionate about
America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Team New Zealand's headquarters, an imposing structure made of
corrugated steel and painted black, has been operational since late
last year, and to get past the front door, one must put a thumb on
a high-tech scanner and hope the fingerprint matches the one on
file.
</P>
<P>
   Security will, as always in this event, be intense. In early
February, Chris Main, an Aucklander working for the Japanese
syndicate Nippon Challenge, accused a Team New Zealand support boat
of ramming his inflatable craft as he observed the Kiwis train from
a distance. The New Zealanders maintained that Main had been
violating the rules, which stipulate that competitors must stay 200
meters away from each other's yachts.
</P>
<P>
   On a less bellicose note, unidentified pranksters made their way
into America True's compound one night in February and taped a huge
red silhouette of Godzilla, complete with small airplanes and
falling bodies, on the side of the syndicate's training boat, which
used to feature only a logo of the Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the challengers, including Young America, the New York
Yacht Club entry, have been training here with practice boats
during the Southern Hemisphere's summer in an attempt to
acclimatize themselves to the conditions they will face in the
race. This being Auckland, those conditions will be highly
variable, and though the wind is generally 10 knots stronger in
October than it is in late February and early March, when the final
races will be contested, there are no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anybody who is building a one-sided boat for this
course is not looking at the data,'' said Bob Billingham, chief
operating officer for America One.
</P>
<P>
   The course is framed on three sides by land, including several
islands that will prove telegenic from sea level and helicopter
level. Because of the surrounding land, the ocean swells that
sailors had to deal with off Fremantle, Australia, in 1987 and off
San Diego will not be a factor. ``This a natural amphitheater,''
Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Billingham and other challengers know that it will be extremely
difficult to wrest the cup from Blake and Team New Zealand in their
home waters. The Kiwis will not conduct the traditional defender's
trials, preferring instead to unify their efforts and their
sponsorship and to refine their two boats until a challenger
emerges from what should be a particularly grueling process if 12
syndicates are involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single biggest advantage the challengers have is that we
will be racing against each other for four and a half months,''
Billingham said. ``The New Zealanders don't have anybody to race
but their own team, which isn't necessarily bad considering that
their second-string crew and boat are probably way better than 90
percent of everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a calculated risk by Blake, and the man who helped spark a
national celebration in 1995 and was knighted for his efforts is
well aware that sporting popularity can prove as ephemeral as a
yacht's wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team doesn't want to have to go live in Rio de Janeiro
forever, and neither do I,'' Blake said, a thin smile forming under
his thick mustache.

 &HT;    Georgia without a heavy hitter
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From Carl Vinson to Richard Russell to Sam Nunn to
Newt Gingrich, Georgia had a decades-long run of powerful members
of Congress to look out for its interests.
</P>
<P>
   Military bases, defense factories and roads were built. Federal
dollars flowed and flowed and flowed.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the federal government shut hundreds of defense
facilities around the nation, Georgia was spared.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, for the first time since the Depression, Georgia
lacks what in sports terminology might be referred to as a ``go-to
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is diminished influence. Period. End of story,'' said
Republican Rep. Charlie Norwood. ``It was pretty nice when the
speaker was from Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a congressional heavyweight could not come at a
worse time. Unlike the heyday of the Great Society in the 1960s or
the Ronald Reagan-inspired defense build-up in the 1980s, Congress
controls relatively little money for discretionary projects.
</P>
<P>
   GINGRICH MASKED LOSS OF NUNN
</P>
<P>
   The battles over the defense budget are more fierce. The Clinton
administration set aside no money in 2000, for example, for the
C-130J cargo plane, a mainstay of the Lockheed Martin plant in
Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another round of base closings looms.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's 13 members of Congress, while no less vigilant than
their predecessors, are scrambling to minimize the damage from
Gingrich's resignation as well as Nunn's retirement two years
earlier. Between them, the two men served in Congress 44 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's role as speaker in a sense masked the absence of
Nunn, whose expertise on defense matters and stout protection of
Georgia's bases and production facilities were unquestioned.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn himself was the successor to Russell, who also was chairman
of the Senate Armed Services Committee and, for a time, the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee on military spending. And Russell
served much of his Washington career with Vinson, whose 50-year
House tenure included leading military committees for 30 years,
beginning in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the state's longest-serving congressman is
Democratic Rep. John Lewis, who arrived in 1987 and ranks 115th out
of 435 in terms of seniority. Lewis also is a chief deputy whip for
the Democrats, assigned to help garner support for Democratic
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, beginning his seventh year of service, is a
member of the Senate leadership, but he has staked out a position
on education and as a master of internal party politics. These are
not the sorts of topics that typically translate into more federal
money on the local level.
</P>
<P>
   None of the other 11 Georgians in Congress is a committee
chairman or a ranking minority member. Rep. John Linder had been
chairman of the House Republican campaign committee, but he lost
his post in the aftermath of Gingrich's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call, which ranks delegations'
clout every two years, dropped Georgia 10 slots, from 20th to 30th,
because of Gingrich's exit.
</P>
<P>
   On his first day in Congress last week, Republican Rep. Johnny
Isakson tried to put the best face on his status as the most junior
House member, magnified because he took Gingrich's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a fool,'' he said after Speaker Dennis Hastert
(R-Ill.) swore him in a second time for the benefit of
photographers. ``However, I do have the same vote as the
highest-ranking member. I'm going to do my best to leverage that
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Isakson's partners in the House insisted that the state
will fare just as well in the post-Gingrich era. Georgians sit on
key committees, including Appropriations, Commerce, National
Security and Ways and Means. Isakson will join the transportation
panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the speaker, but we didn't lose our voices,''
Republican Rep. Mac Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Bob Barr, whose district is home to the Lockheed
Martin plant, said, ``I think we have a very strong delegation. We
have members on every one of the key committees.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has placed calls on behalf of Lockheed Martin to the White
House, where he is well-regarded for his staunch defense of
President Clinton during the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Jack Kingston is on the appropriations panel.
Republican Saxby Chambliss and Democratic Sen. Max Cleland sit on
the military committees in their chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss has hired a former Gingrich defense aide, Krister
Holladay, as his deputy chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   But as of the middle of February, the Air Force had no plans to
accelerate the purchase of the C-130Js, which threatens to shut
down the production line that employs 2,000 to 3,000 people
sometime in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton asked for one of the cargo planes in his
budget. But before the year was out, Gingrich had inserted into the
budget six additional planes, at more than $50 million each.
</P>
<P>
   LOCKHEED MARTIN AFFECTED
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin officials and members of Congress said,
ultimately, the C-130J program is not at risk. The Air Force's
long-range plans call for 150 planes to replace its aging air cargo
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   And the planes also are popular in Congress because they often
go to state National Guard units.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even a temporary shutdown of the production line would
mean layoffs for Lockheed Martin workers and probably escalate the
price of the new F-22 fighter, which shares some overhead costs
with the cargo plane program.
</P>
<P>
   A potentially bigger worry is the fate of some of the state's
military bases. Vinson, Russell and Nunn used their positions not
only to protect the facilities, but also to enhance their missions
to ward off future efforts to close them.
</P>
<P>
   State and congressional officials mounted an all-out effort to
preserve the bases in the last round of closings, which employed a
bipartisan commission in an effort to remove politics from the
issue of shuttering bases and eliminating jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, two Gingrich appointees served on the base-closure
commission and a former Nunn aide played a key role on the
commission staff.

 &HT;    Carrying the burden of survival
 &HT;    By Moni Basu
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALCUTTA, India _ Every muscle in Shankar Raj's 56-year-old body
ripples as he hoists the wooden handles of his two-wheeled rickshaw
off the dusty ground. His eyes meet mine only once as he turns
around to ask our destination, and then he begins a slow trot.
</P>
<P>
   Raj's soot-covered bare feet quickly fall in stride as he ambles
along winding back alleys with the weight of two adult passengers
in the seat behind him.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 hours a day, Raj and his rickshaw jostle for space among
taxis, cars, buses, scooters and every other mode of transport in
this congested city. After 32 years, he has perfected a rhythm to
his maddening work. On every fifth step, he chimes a brass bell
around his right wrist to signal his presence to pedestrians in his
way. He stares vacantly ahead, stopping and going at the customer's
behest, withstanding verbal - and sometimes physical - abuse for a
bumpy ride or a wrong turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a life you would wish for. But what am I going to
do? My family depends on me for food,'' he says, catching his
breath.
</P>
<P>
   Half way into the three-mile journey, I could stand no more of
watching man act as beast of burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop. We'll get down here, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, Raj has come to a complete stop from a full
gallop.
</P>
<P>
   He slowly lowers the handles of the rickshaw, bringing his
passengers closer to the ground. He looks up in disbelief when he
is handed twice the negotiated rate of 15 cents. ``Bless you, my
child,'' he says, wiping the sweat off his brow with the end of his
tattered T-shirt. ``God will save your soul for having mercy on
me.''
</P>
<P>
   For his hard labor, Raj, like most other rickshaw wallahs, earns
an average of $1-2 a day, low even by Calcutta standards. After
paying for food and housing and the 30-cent rickshaw rental fee,
the average puller pockets 10-20 cents on a prosperous day.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is saved is usually sent to far-away homes, often in
villages in neighboring states, to care for the families they have
left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The rickshaw wallahs who share a stand on central Calcutta's
Creek Row consider themselves slightly luckier than the rest _ they
sleep rent-free on the floor of a factory across the street. In
return, they perform domestic chores for the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Ali Hassan, spend nights on the garbage-strewn
sidewalk next to their bustling Colootolla Street stand in front of
the Tashkent laundering shop and Vikram scooter rentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do this because we have to do it. This is not any kind of
life,'' says Hassan, 32. ``Sometimes, when I am working, I think
about how it would be if I could get another job, a better job. It
is backbreaking for one man to pull another man. I mean, it is
inhuman, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I once had your health. Now look at me. Look at my body, my
feet,'' says Hassan pointing to the veins bubbling from his legs
and the callouses covering the bottoms of his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Several minutes later, Hassan puts the shade down on his
rickshaw and takes off with the load of two burkha-clad women
firmly planted on his vinyl-covered seat.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 700,000 Calcuttans use rickshaws every day, nearly
three times the number who ride the much more costly subway. This
is a city in which these human-powered vehicles are still a vital
mode of transportation as they weave in and out of traffic-logged
streets faster than cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the summer, people like to use rickshaws more than taxis
because they are so much cooler,'' says Prem Mahato, 35, who left
home in Bihar to find work in Calcutta. ``It is unbearably hot
then, but more profitable for us. Same thing in the monsoon season
_ rickshaws are more convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahato says that when he is running from one place to another,
he often dreams about doing something else. He once found escape
from this grueling line of work as a sweeper with the local Campa
Cola factory. But the respite ended when the soft-drink company
closed its doors several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Invented by the Japanese, rickshaws were introduced here in 1918
by Chinese immigrants. Calcutta is now the only major Indian city
that allows the antiquated means of transport on its streets.
</P>
<P>
   The Calcutta Municipal Corporation officially authorizes 12,000
rickshaws to operate in the city. But there are probably an equal
number of unlicensed ones. There have been attempts to remove
rickshaws altogether to help speed up the crawling pace of city
traffic _ the last effort being in 1997. Protested by the rickshaw
pullers' union, the ban was never implemented.
</P>
<P>
   That was a good thing for Dalo Sau, 33, whose wife and two
children back in Bihar depend on the $12-15 he sends them each
month.
</P>
<P>
   On this warm February day, Sau has managed to take advantage of
the mid-afternoon traffic lull to rest his weary body. But not his
mind. Almost horizontal on his parked rickshaw, he knows that at
any moment, he might once again have to give his all.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as I have to eat, I will pull this rickshaw,'' says
Sau. ``There is no choice, is there?

OUTDOORS: ANNUAL EXPOSITION HELPS PASS THE SLACK TIME  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUFFERN, N.Y. _ There are various ways in which anglers and
hunters in the Northeast deal with the long pauses in their
activities, enforced by both the weather and the legal seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Some languish. Others use the slack time to ready their gear or
plan expeditions. All, however, eagerly await the start of
open-water trout fishing, turkey hunting or the first spring runs
of striped bass or bluefish along the coast. This yearning can be
honed by delving into the literature of the sport of choice, but
for some the most expeditious entry into a state of anticipatory
delight is to attend a late-winter show.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best such events in the region is the annual World
Fishing and Outdoor Exposition, which runs Thursday through next
Sunday at the Rockland Community College Field House, in Suffern.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at the show can be particularly valuable to those who
have an urge to hunt or fish in a new area or to go whitewater
rafting or canoeing in the wilderness. Under one roof are booths
staffed by representatives of states and provinces or by guides,
charter boat skippers, outfitters or lodge operators.
</P>
<P>
   Those who already know where their next outdoor adventure will
be might want a new fishing rod or reel, or fowling piece.
Exhibitors at the exposition, now in its 22d year, will be offering
show discounts on many such items. People with a hankering for a
new fly rod for trout won't have to wait until they get home to see
how it performs: they can test it on the show's 50-foot casting
pool.
</P>
<P>
   The American mania for competitive angling is recognized in the
show's Metro New York Open Challenge, a ``virtual reality''
big-game fishing contest open to all and sponsored by The Fisherman
Magazine. Strapped into a fighting chair with big-game rod and reel
in hand, contestants watch actual underwater footage of Pacific
sailfish or mahi-mahi striking a lure and hurtling away. The rod
bends and line peels from the reel as the fish runs. A computerized
scoring machine measures how well the angler deals with the fish's
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, March 7, there will be a Bassmaster casting
competition for youngsters 7-10 and 11-14, sponsored by Zebco and
Kmart. Winners go on to compete at the state level, and the top
junior anglers meet in the final event, which is held in
conjunction with the 1999 BASS Masters Classic later this year;
scholarships worth a total of $20,000 are awarded to the finalists.
</P>
<P>
   New at the show this year is ``Wildlife on Wheels,'' a display
of various live animals including several whitetail deer, a black
bear, a cougar, an elk and a wolf.
</P>
<P>
   As in previous years, the Raptor Education Foundation's popular
display of live birds will feature eagles, hawks, falcons and owls.
All are birds that were physically or emotionally damaged, rescued
and rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
   Professional anglers will demonstrate casting and retrieving
techniques with various lures, both topwater and deep-running, in a
6,000-gallon glass-sided tank stocked with hungry black bass. Among
these pros will be Penny Berryman, the 1992 Bass N' Gals Classic
Star World Champion.
</P>
<P>
   For those more interested in oceangoing striped bass, a longtime
show participant, Bob Rochetta, will tell how he manages to
consistently catch huge stripers, including the one he took off
Montauk in 1981, at 76 pounds still the men's world record for the
species on 50-pound test line.
</P>
<P>
   Both Berryman and Rochetta will take part in the show's
seminars, which will be held every day. These sessions, conducted
by experts, range through many aspects of freshwater and saltwater
angling. For estuary fishermen, Manny Luftglass will conduct two
seminars on fishing the tidal portions of New Jersey's rivers and
its bays. Mike Laptew will make two angling presentations, enhanced
by superb photography.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be seminars on hunting deer and wild turkeys.
Pursuers of the turkey might also wish to see the exhibit of the
various sub-species of American wild turkeys assembled by Halley
Caller Wildlife Calls, and those who enjoy the additional challenge
of hunting deer with muzzle-loading firearms would benefit from
catching one of Dave Ehrig's two final-day sessions on that
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Diehard Boatyard will sponsor a 6,000-square-foot display of
fishing boats, runabouts, canoes, kayaks, motors and marine
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GO
</P>
<P>
   The Rockland Community College Field House can be reached by
taking the New York State Thruway (Interstate 287) to exit 14B
(Airmont Road). Follow the signs to the show. Daily admission is $9
for adults, $3 for children. Those under 5 are admitted free. Hours
are 2-9 p.m. Thursday, 1-9:30 p.m. Friday, 9:30 a.m.-7 p.m.
Saturday and 9:30 a.m.-5:30 p.m. Sunday. More information is
available from the Web at www.sportshows.com, or beginning at noon
March 2 by phone, (914) 356-6076.

REPORT SAYS FOREIGN BANKS LENT BILLIONS FOR APARTHEID
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Swiss and German bankers played a key role in propping
up South Africa's apartheid government, according to a report
issued last week by groups seeking billions of dollars in
reparations and debt forgiveness for the current South African
government.
</P>
<P>
   When most governments around the world were boycotting South
Africa under U.N. sanctions, major Swiss and German banks continued
to give billions of dollars in loans, the groups said.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, at least, American banks started to scale back their
involvement in South Africa from 1985 to 1986, but money continued
to flow into the country.
</P>
<P>
   This report focuses only on the Swiss and German involvement.
The researchers said they wanted to leave the in-depth work on
American and British involvement to researchers from those
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the source, the money helped the white-minority
government survive and left South Africa with a substantial debt
that undermines the new government's ability to turn around the
economic and social situation it inherited, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking that the Swiss government and banks explain how
this happened,'' said Mascha Madorin, an economist with the Swiss
Action Financial Center. The demand by her group, part of a
coalition of eight nongovernmental groups, that Switzerland be held
accountable in South Africa comes on the heels of disclosures about
Swiss banks' dealings with Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study does not call for a specific amount of debt
forgiveness, Gottfried Wellmer, who wrote the study, said an
appropriate amount for Switzerland, Germany, Britain and the United
States would be $11.3 billion, the amount of South Africa's public
debt in 1993, the last year of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss banks have said they were against apartheid but were free
to conduct business in South Africa. As a neutral country that is
not a member of the United Nations, Switzerland declined to impose
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   A Swiss Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Yasmine Chatila, said
Swiss National Bank figures indicate that ``banks began to reduce
their positions in South Africa starting in 1984.''
</P>
<P>
   A Swiss parliamentary committee has rejected a proposal to set
up a panel to examine the country's ties with the apartheid
government. The issue will be taken up again in Parliament next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Nils de Dardel, the committee chairman, said he hoped the
report, titled ``Apartheid-Caused Debt: The Role of Swiss and
German Finance,'' would lead to an extensive inquiry, including
access to banks' archives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Madorin said the watchdog group was eager for a full-scale
inquiry because she had had to rely on South African Reserve Bank
figures; comparable information was not available from the Swiss,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her data, for example, showed that Swiss banks increased their
financial presence in South Africa until 1989. They also helped
bypass sanctions by aiding South African corporations in setting up
seemingly independent companies or buying foreign companies, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the United States and Germany together
were responsible for more than 50 percent of South Africa's 1993
debt, meaning they would be asked to cancel more than $5 billion in
debt. The Swiss were responsible for nearly 21 percent, or around
$2 billion, the report said. The remaining $3 billion to $4 billion
came from the British.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   South Africa began looking to outside sources for financing in
the 1970s to update and expand military forces, arms and supplies.
Four countries _ Germany, the United States, Britain and
Switzerland _ were South Africa's most important business partners.
By 1993 South Africa got 90 percent of its long-term foreign
financing from these four nations, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The $11.3 billion is long-term public sector debt. The total
foreign debt in 1993, both private and public, was $25.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States was the biggest player in the private
sector, Germany had the largest role in the state-run area because
it financed public works like electrical power stations, railways
and telecommunications facilities, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland had a major importance to the South African economy
in three areas: as a financial center for South Africa's trade in
gold and diamonds, as a long-term lender to the apartheid
government and its public entities and as a short-term lender
during crisis periods, the report said.

RE-ELECTION PLEDGES COMPLICATE STRATEGIES  
 WHAT IF POLITICIANS COULD TELL NO LIES?  
 DETROIT MAYOR FACES RECALL PETITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the main reasons Democrats are so optimistic about
retaking control of the House of Representatives next year is that
nine Republicans, but only one Democrat, pledged in the 1998
campaign not to seek re-election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But taking the pledge to surrender power and suppress ego is one
thing. Sticking by it is another.
</P>
<P>
   At least three of the Republicans _ Scott McInnis of Colorado,
Tillie Fowler of Florida and George Nethercutt of Washington state
_ are having second thoughts, to the chagrin of Democratic leaders.
But to the delight of those leaders, the sole Democrat who took the
pledge, Martin Meehan of Massachusetts, is also having second
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   So Democrats still see a special opportunity to narrow, if not
overcome, the current 10-seat edge that Republicans have in the
House. They figure that, at a minimum, six Republican-held seats
will be open next year because the incumbents chose to limit their
stays on Capitol Hill _ and open seats are the easiest to contest.
</P>
<P>
   Enter U.S. Term Limits, one of the leading groups pushing for
mandatory limits on service in Congress. It is demanding that the
three wavering Republicans, as well as the single Democrat, stick
by their pledges, and it says it will spend more than $20 million
between now and next election day to keep their feet to the fire
and to promote its cause.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few weeks, to increase pressure on the waverers,
the group, based in Washington, has commissioned polls in several
districts that indicate that voters strongly embrace term limits
and want legislators who pledge to limit their service to stick
with their pledges _ or risk losing votes.
</P>
<P>
   The group's executive director, Paul Jacob, warned in releasing
the poll results: ``Representatives might be able to survive a
broken term-limits pledge in their own districts, where they have
all the advantages of incumbency, but it will devastate any hopes
they have for statewide office in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nethercutt's district, U.S. Term Limits has gone a step
further, buying space on a big red, white and blue billboard in
Spokane and offering ``thanks'' in advance to Nethercutt for
``keeping your word.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we owe it to George to take him at his word,'' Jacob
said, calling the billboard a pressure ploy, not an embarrassing
misreading of where Nethercutt stands, or does not stand, on term
limits.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt countered: ``I assume they mean my promise to cut
taxes, balance the budget and end the welfare system as we knew it.
That's what I promised, too.''
</P>
<P>
   What If Politicians Could Tell No Lies?
</P>
<P>
   Last year's elections in Georgia were notably negative and
mean-spirited, with candidates for governor and lieutenant governor
repeatedly accusing their opponents of lies and distortions. In
fact, when Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor's opponent, Mitch Skandalakis,
broadcast an ad that raised the issue of whether Taylor had ever
been hospitalized for drug abuse, Taylor filed a slander suit.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is pending _ and so is a new bill in the Georgia House
of Representatives that would make it a violation of the state's
ethics laws for a candidate to lie while on the campaign trail.

<P>
   The bill's leading sponsor, Rep. Jeanette Jamieson of Toccoa, in
northeast Georgia, contends that things have gotten totally out of
hand recently in Georgia and the rest of the nation when it comes
to public figures and would-be public figures stretching the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to tell the truth about the fat content in a
hamburger,'' she argued the other day, ``why shouldn't you have to
tell the truth about another individual who is offering for public
office?''
</P>
<P>
   The legislative prospects for her bill are unclear at this
point.
</P>
<P>
   Some other states that have tried to legislate political
morality over the years have, however well-meaning their intent,
run into freedom-of-speech problems. Last year, for example, the
Washington State Supreme Court struck down a law that banned false
political advertising, finding that it infringed on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia bill is relatively benign in that it has no
provision that candidates who lie could be fined or jailed. Rather,
the bill would let the Georgia Ethics Commission, the enforcer of
the state's election laws, hold hearings when accusations of lying
are made, with the prospect that a finding of wrongdoing would
embarrass the violator as a prevaricator.
</P>
<P>
   But even that provision worries some legislative leaders, who
suggest that maybe those old political standbys, true facts and
voter anger, remain the best solution to campaign lying, not still
another law, especially one that tries to govern what comes out of
a politician's mouth in the heat of a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thin line on freedom of speech,'' Rep. Calvin Smyre of
Columbus, the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said last week
when asked about the Jamieson bill's legislative prospects.

   Detroit Mayor Archer Faces Recall Petitions
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 4, 1997, Mayor Dennis Archer of Detroit swept to a
second term with 84 percent of the vote. But before the year was
out, anti-Archer grumbling could be heard, and now, just over a
year later, teams of Archer critics are on the street circulating
petitions for a recall vote.
</P>
<P>
   They need 57,000 signatures. So far they have about 25,000, and
they confidently predict they will get the rest by mid-April so
that a special election can be held this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to go,'' Ernest Johnson, one anti-Archerite, said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   The leaflets being passed out by the people gathering
signatures, most of whom are members of two city community
organizations, Black Slate Inc. and the Community Coalition,
complain that the mayor, a Democrat, has ignored the needs of
Detroit's schools, allowed its neighborhoods to deteriorate and
failed to provide adequate city services, especially snow removal
when a recent blizzard crippled the town.
</P>
<P>
   The city normally does not plow residential streets and has just
59 snowplows. But the mayor delayed contracting for 17 snowplows
from the suburbs, which then recalled their plows when it began
snowing again.
</P>
<P>
   But worst of all, say the mayor's critics, he deeply angered the
city's blacks, who make up 75 percent of the population, by passing
over the only black bidder when it came time to award lucrative
casino licenses. In so doing, many of the anti-Archerites contend,
the mayor, who is black, created a perception that he is too close
to the city's white business establishment.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor says he has always run the city on principle, not by
favoring one group or interest over another. And he says he will
continue to run it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Will the recall work?
</P>
<P>
   With dozens of people out on the street gathering signatures,
the anti-Archerites very well might get the election they seek. But
the way many political professionals in the city see it, removing a
mayor who won re-election with 84 percent of the vote will be a
daunting uphill struggle.

 RIVERA'S METHODS ARE SUBTLE, BUT HIS FASTBALL AND JOYOUS NATURE
AREN'T 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla &UR; 11 &LR; . _ Mariano &UR; 12 &LR;  Rivera hits targets instinctively.
This is the easy part of what he does. As a boy, he used to whip
rocks at cardboard or hurl tightly wound string at tiny inner tubes
on the beaches of Panama. As a man, he aims baseballs at a
catcher's mitt and almost never misses. All the same, really.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed, and allowed the New York Yankees' Rivera to
become perhaps the most dominant relief pitcher in the American
League, is his subtle mastery of a baseball's movement. Rivera's
fastball _ typically in the range of 93 to 96 miles an hour _ used
to be as straight as Park Avenue; now it possesses more turns and
bends than the Taconic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more mature as a pitcher,'' said Joe Girardi &UR; 13 &LR; , one of
the Yankees' catchers. ``He understand more about how to close,
about that mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera reached into his locker here the other day and pulled out
a baseball. How, he was asked, are you making the ball move so
much? How do you make the ball veer into the hands of left-handed
batters, or dive at right-handed batters?
</P>
<P>
   Leaning forward in his chair, Rivera held the baseball nearly at
arm's length; enveloped in his fingers, it looked like a stunted
tangerine. ``It depends on how you grip the baseball,'' said
Rivera, two fingers and a thumb tucked underneath the ball, his
right index and middle fingers extended over the top, slightly
bent, flexing. ``You can get it to cut more if you do this. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   His fingers didn't appear to move. He apparently had changed the
pressure applied by his fingertips. ``Or you do this, to get more
movement . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera struggled to explain, but then, Hendrix &UR; 14 &LR;  might've &UR; 15 &LR; 
had trouble accounting for the sounds that emerged from his guitar.
</P>
<P>
   This is Rivera 101, through the eyes of his catchers: When he
first emerged in the major leagues, in 1995 and '96, his primary
pitch was a sailing four-seam fastball that he usually threw high
in the strike zone. Rivera would throw a 96 mile-an-hour fastball
thigh high for a strike, and then he would throw the next
belly-button high, and the next chest high, and they would keep
swinging, and mostly missing. In 1996, when Rivera served as the
set-up man for John Wetteland &UR; 16 &LR; , he struck out 130 batters in
1072/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   But major-league hitters are adaptable. ``They started making
adjustments on him, once they had seen him,'' Girardi &UR; 13 &LR;  said.
``They didn't always swing at that high ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera realized, too, that all those strikeouts &UR; 17 &LR;  would take
their toll on him, eventually. And, in fact, some American League
scouts felt he tired at the end of the 1997 season. Rivera wanted
to become more efficient, to pitch in the bottom half of the strike
zone and generate more ground balls, rather than strikeouts &UR; 17 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Rivera found that, with the right grip, he could throw what is
known as a cut fastball. When throw by a right-handed pitcher, a
cutter veers toward a left-handed batter. Because Rivera throws his
so hard, however, the movement is explosive, very late and very
sharp. ``It's just nasty,'' said Jorge Posada &UR; 18 &LR; , the Yankees'
starting catcher.
</P>
<P>
   A left-handed slugger like Mo &UR; 19 &LR;  Vaughn &UR; 20 &LR;  will start swinging
at a fastball that appears to be over the heart of the plate, and
by the time he whips around his bat, Rivera's cutter will have
turned and jammed Vaughn &UR; 20 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Last year, left-handed batters had 115 at-bats against Rivera,
and hit exactly zero home runs and accounted for just nine
strikeouts &UR; 17 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton &UR; 21 &LR; , the Yankees reliever, believes Rivera's cut
fastball to be something of a freak of nature, because Rivera
releases his cutter in almost the same way a quarterback throws a
football _ the fingers held to the side of the ball, rather than
over the top, as almost all fastballs &UR; 22 &LR;  are thrown.
</P>
<P>
   When facing right-handed batters, Rivera sometimes employ a
two-seam fastball. When thrown by a right-handed pitcher, it will
veer back into a right-handed batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has become someone who really likes to pitch inside,''
Posada &UR; 18 &LR;  said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, and down. Girardi &UR; 13 &LR;  said that in 1995 and 1996, he
would set a high target with his mitt, and Rivera would throw high
fastballs &UR; 22 &LR; . Now the Yankees catchers set low targets, in the
bottom half of the strike zone, often just underneath the hands of
both left-handed and right-handed batters.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera struck out 36 batters in 611/3 innings in 1998, and there
was much speculation that Rivera had lost his fastball, that he was
in jeopardy of losing his stuff. To the contrary: Rivera had simply
become more efficient, as he wanted, and evolved from a
strikeout &UR; 23 &LR;  pitcher into a groundball &UR; 24 &LR;  pitcher. In 1995, he
averaged .65 groundballs &UR; 25 &LR;  for every fly ball, and needed an
average of 18.7 pitches to get through each inning. In 1998, he had
1.6 groundballs &UR; 25 &LR;  to every fly ball, and needed 14.9 pitches per
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The efficiency, and Manager Joe Torre's &UR; 26 &LR;  conservative
rationing of Rivera through the summer, paid off in October. ``He
cut down on his pitches, and that was important in the long run,
over a full season,'' Girardi &UR; 13 &LR;  said. ``He was really strong in
the playoffs this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for last year's playoffs, an American League advance
scout trailing the Yankees said that Rivera ``is the best closer in
baseball right now, and there's really nobody close to him.'' In
one scouting assessment, it was noted that 93 percent of the
pitches thrown by Rivera were fastballs &UR; 22 &LR;  but very different
fastballs &UR; 22 &LR; , cutters and four-seamers and two-seamers.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera didn't surrender any runs in 131/3 innings in the
playoffs and World Series, and with the finish line in sight, he
overpowered opposing hitters once more, striking out 11 and
allowing six hits. Trevor Hoffman, San Diego's hard-throwing
closer, appeared in 12 more games than Rivera during the regular
season, threw more pitches and had more strikeouts &UR; 17 &LR;  and his
fastball was clocked at a mediocre 88 miles an hour in Game 3 of
the World Series, when he allowed Scott Brosius' &UR; 27 &LR;  decisive
three-run home run. Rivera, on the other hand, was throwing 95-97
miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just unbelievable,'' San Diego Manager Bruce Bochy &UR; 28 &LR; 
said, after the Yankees swept the Padres in the World Series. &QL;
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Part of Rivera's daily regimen now is to sign dozens of pictures
and magazine covers that bear his image his arms outstretched,
possessed by joy and by Girardi's &UR; 13 &LR;  bear hug in the first moment
after the Yankees clinched last years World Series.
</P>
<P>
   It is an expression that comes easily to Rivera. He loves his
life. Rivera is always the same, teammate Derek Jeter &UR; 30 &LR;  said.
Easygoing, gracious, quick to offer a pat on the shoulder as he
passes, constantly smiling. Jeter &UR; 30 &LR;  would go to the mound before
the most crucial innings last season and say to Rivera, ``Let's go,
let's get it done now,'' and there was never any doubt Rivera would
succeed. There was always the sense that on the mound, Rivera could
barely contain his grin, that he was absolutely sure he would
prevail and that like a little kid, he was having the best time.
</P>
<P>
   Tension? Nervousness? Please.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of fun out there,'' Girardi &UR; 13 &LR;  said.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera believes his own demeanor closely resembles that of his
father, also named Mariano &UR; 12 &LR; . ``He thinks you should be
responsible, and that you should respect other people,'' said
Rivera, ``and that you should enjoy your life.''
</P>
<P>
   His father is a fisherman who now captains a boat; when Rivera
was growing up, his father was part of a crew that would go out for
nets full of sardines, a week at a time. But even in his father's
absence, Rivera was surrounded by family, cousins and his mother.
If he did something wrong, his relatives or his teachers punished
him immediately, and he waited mournfully for his father to come
home for more punishment. ``He would give me a whipping,'' Rivera
said. ``It's so different here. I see little kids be disrespectful
to each other, or to their parents, and I cannot believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera and his friends played soccer or football, or baseball,
though they almost never had baseballs. They would cut three
grapefruit-sized holes in a strip of cardboard, and hang this from
two stakes jammed into the sands of a nearby beach. They would have
contests on who could throw a rock or whatever object they had
through a particular hole. When Rivera was a teen-ager, he started
joining his father on the boats, and could not believe how hard the
work was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't the life I wanted,'' he said. A Yankee
Contract &QL; 
And a Job in Perspective  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was thrilled to sign with the Yankees at age 20, became
stronger and started throwing harder, and realized immediately how
much he liked what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the national rotation of reporters would ask Rivera
two or three times a week about the game-tying home run Sandy
Alomar &UR; 31 &LR;  hit against him when the Yankees were four out away from
winning the division series in 1997, about the home run's impact on
Rivera's psyche.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of these questions increased dramatically once the
playoffs began, and Rivera always patiently and respectfully
answered. But it was apparent, if you happened to eavesdrop
repeatedly on these conversations, that Alomar's &UR; 31 &LR;  home run did
not haunt Rivera at all, that he truly believed the blow to be a
one-time phenomenon, and if not for the endless inquiries, he would
have all but forgotten about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could throw the same pitch in the same spot,'' Rivera said,
shrugging his shoulders, ``and he probably couldn't hit it the same
way again. I supplied the power for that. He just put the bat on
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad at the time. But, when it was over, what could I do
about it? It was already behind me. What's the sense in worrying
about it? What good does that do you? Why get upset? Just enjoy
yourself. When you have doubts, you're done, you're history, you're
finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera saved 43 games in 52 attempts in 1997, and 36 in 41
chances in 98; he has become better each year, better and more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to work on my sinker this year,'' said Rivera. ``You
will see more sinkers, and I think the groundballs &UR; 25 &LR;  will go
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Throwing strikes is easy. But making the ball move, that's what
Rivera is all about now. &QL;

REGULATORS AUTHORIZE OLIVETTI TO BID FOR TELECOM ITALIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ A $60 billion bid by the No. 2 Italian phone company,
Olivetti SpA, for Telecom Italia was given a green light to move
forward Saturday, when Italian stock market regulators ruled that
it was legally admissible.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came two days after Telecom Italia chairman Franco
Bernabe won boardroom backing for what is expected to be a long and
bitter corporate battle, unaccustomed for the Italian business
world and reminiscent of big American hostile buyouts of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti's assault on Telecom is the first test case to come
under new Italian takeover legislation, enacted last summer, that
weakens the defenses that companies here traditionally used to fend
off aggressive raiders. As a result, many believe that Olivetti's
move clears the path for future corporate predators.
</P>
<P>
   The huge hostile bid, the largest ever in European business, has
split the center-left government of Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema,
a former Communist. The Italian state holds a 3.4 percent stake in
Telecom. The Italian Treasury, which formally controls the shares,
argues for neutrality, but other ministers have said the government
must assure that a key national asset like Telecom, the former
state phone monopoly, does not fall into foreign hands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last Monday, Olivetti's original bid _ in cash, stock and bonds
_ met a setback, when the regulator, Consob, ruled that it failed
to meet requirements set by Italian takeover law.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti officials worked feverishly to reconfigure the bid. In
a statement Saturday, the regulators ruled that Olivetti's revised
bid was ``such as to furnish the market the information necessary
for the bid,'' which could now go ahead sometime in April.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for both companies, reached by phone, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   For Olivetti, the ruling means that it will now have to submit a
formal prospectus, which it expects to do in about a month.
</P>
<P>
   For Telecom, the ruling imposes narrower room for maneuvering
against Olivetti, which is one-fifth the size of its larger rival.
</P>
<P>
   At its meeting Thursday, Telecom's board dismissed Olivetti's
reconfigured bid as riddled with ``formal and substantial
shortcomings,'' including the absence of a deadline for the bid and
an explanation of how the bid's debt financing would affect Telecom
Italia's debt and development outlook.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Saturday, Consob said that its ruling meant
that the ``period of offering'' had begun, and that as a
consequence Telecom would have to ``abstain from fulfilling any
acts and operations that would block the achievement of the
objectives of the bid,'' unless they were approved by at least 30
percent of a Telecom shareholder assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Telecom's board unanimously gave Bernabe a mandate to
examine the possibility of merging Telecom with its mobile phone
unit, Telecom Italia Mobile. The combination would have the aim of
raising the value of the entire group to put it out of Olivetti's
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, in a sign of investor disappointment that Olivetti did
not sweeten its revised bid, Telecom Italia's stock fell 0.145
euros to 9.59 euros, or $10.54, after rising Wednesday above the 10
euro per share price Olivetti is offering.
</P>
<P>
   Olivetti's first offer was rejected by Consob partly because it
was conditional on the sale of the company's existing phone units
to Mannesmann AG of Germany. Saturday, Consob said Olivetti had put
no direct conditions on its revised offer.

EDITORIAL: GUATEMALA'S NIGHTMARE PAST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 28:
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of recent Latin American brutality, no nation can
match Guatemala. The civil war that ended in 1996 went on for 36
years and killed hundreds of thousands, the vast majority of them
Mayan civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Now the country's truth commission, known as the Commission for
Historical Clarification, has issued a report whose unflinching
description of what happened captures the scale of Guatemala's
tragedy. It is up to Guatemala's government to show that the
country has changed, by embracing the report and moving quickly to
carry out its recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The truth commission was sponsored by the United Nations. Its
conclusions are numbing. The commission believes that more than
200,000 people were killed, more than 90 percent of them by
government forces. Some of the state's counterinsurgency
operations, the commission concludes, could be characterized as
genocide. The report dismisses the military's claim that the
massacres were the excesses of rogue soldiers and instead finds an
``extermination en masse of defenseless Mayan communities,''
directed from the very top. The state, the report concludes, had
become an instrument to protect a racist and unjust economic order.
</P>
<P>
   This is blunter language than usually found in U.N. documents,
but there is no doubt of its truth. The report is also candid about
the role of the United States, which sponsored a military coup in
Guatemala in 1954, trained the officer corps and worked with the
intelligence services who planned and directed some of the worst
abuses of the war.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington has helped uncover its complicity. It provided
more money than any other country to support the commission's work.
Agencies that in the past refused to cooperate with Latin American
truth commissions or trials turned over important files to
Guatemala. The Agency for International Development and the Central
Intelligence Agency especially were cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   The report emerges at a time of uncertainty about whether
Guatemala can become a real democracy. The commission does not name
the guilty, out of fear of provoking the military. The government's
response is crucial. President Alvaro Arzu so far has been silent.
He should endorse the report and quickly establish a body to see
that its recommendations are carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The commission stressed the need to dismiss military officers
who are credibly accused of serious crimes. The report calls for
prosecution of those responsible for the worst atrocities and
recommends payment of reparations to victims' families. The
commission's courageous report describes a hellish past.
Guatemala's leaders must show that those days are over.  &QL;

FENCED-IN DEER STIR DISPUTE OVER BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATT: Ill., Miss.)   (rk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILLMAN, Mich. _ Even in midwinter, the 26,000-acre Turtle Lake
Club here in northern Michigan is beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   A large clubhouse of hewn logs and a dozen spacious cottages sit
on a snow-dusted meadow by the milewide private lake. To the north
is an expanse of cattail marshes. To the west and south are miles
of dark green forests of fir, spruce and northern white cedar. And
to the east lies a large wood of aspen and oak, the branches
denuded by winter and the clearings roamed by small groups of deer
looking for food.
</P>
<P>
   This sylvan paradise has become the unlikely subject of a
bruising legal battle. On one side are the club's 19 members,
powerful industrialists united by a love of blood sports. On the
other side is a newly elected state attorney general, a Democrat,
who accuses the club of illegally building 30 miles of fence around
the property this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Watching warily from the sidelines are Michigan's dairy and beef
cattle farmers. They are terrified that their herds may be infected
by the recent spread of bovine tuberculosis among the wild deer in
the area, the first such sustained outbreak ever documented in
North America and a potentially serious threat to the Midwestern
livestock industry.
</P>
<P>
   State officials contend that the Turtle Lake Club's fence will
make matters worse by disrupting deer migration and confining the
deer to a lightly hunted area, allowing the tuberculosis to spread
faster. The club has contended that the woven-wire fence is needed
to keep out trespassers and that deer can leap the fence, ranging
from four to eight feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides insist that they will not back down. ``Wealthy
landowners have to obey the law in the same way as everyone else,''
the attorney general, Jennifer M. Granholm, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   James A. O'Toole, the club's lawyer, said that the club would
keep fighting despite having lost the first round in court a week
ago, when a local judge issued a preliminary injunction barring the
erection of any more fences but allowing the club to continue
putting up fence posts. ``We intend to litigate the matter to its
conclusion,'' O'Toole said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials and local residents say that club members
include the current and former chief executives and owners of some
of Michigan's largest companies, including Roger B. Smith, the
former chairman of General Motors, and Robert J. Eaton, the
co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler. Neither was available for comment,
their spokeswomen said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials first became aware of a bovine tuberculosis
problem in upstate Michigan in late 1994, when an emaciated buck
was shot on the Turtle Lake Club's property and was found to have
the disease. Infected deer have been found since then in five
counties, as cases crop up farther and farther away from the club.
</P>
<P>
   Bovine tuberculosis is caused by different bacteria from those
that cause human tuberculosis. But people can become sick with it
by drinking unpasteurized milk from an infected cow. The bovine
disease can weaken and kill livestock.
</P>
<P>
   State officials and academic biologists say that while the
Turtle Lake Club may not be directly responsible for Michigan's
outbreak, this area's many hunting clubs made the outbreak
possible. The clubs have fed truckloads of corn, sugar beets and
other food to deer each winter for years so that fewer deer would
die of starvation. This has meant more animals to shoot in hunting
season.
</P>
<P>
   Wild deer tend to stay fairly dispersed as they forage for food.
But deer crowd together at food piles, touching noses and breathing
on one another, spreading tuberculosis, said Harry A. Jacobson, a
professor emeritus of wildlife at Mississippi State University and
one of the world's foremost authorities on deer.
</P>
<P>
   The disease has recently begun spreading to cattle here, with
infected animals having been found in three small herds. All 173
animals in the three herds have been destroyed, said Daniel J.
Wyant, Michigan's director of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin has restricted shipments of cattle from Michigan and
some slaughterhouses in Chicago are turning away Michigan
livestock. Federal and state officials have begun a program to test
for tuberculosis every cow, steer and bull in an area of
northeastern Michigan the size of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   It is impractical to wipe out the roughly 250,000 wild deer in
this area, and tourism related to deer hunting is a bigger industry
in Michigan than the $1 billion dairy and beef industry. So the
state is banning all feeding of deer and barring the construction
of fences that enclose deer.
</P>
<P>
   The hunting clubs have complied with the ban on feeding and the
incidence of bovine tuberculosis in wild deer has leveled off at a
little under 3 percent. But the Turtle Lake Club triggered the
legal tussle by starting to build its fence last month.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca A. Humphries, chief of the wildlife division at the
Department of Natural Resources, came last autumn to this small
town 200 miles northwest of Detroit to ask that the club not build
a fence. But state officials heard on Jan. 25 from one of the
club's neighbors that fence construction had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, the state began aerial reconnaissance of the
secretive club's land, which covers an area twice as large as
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The state has sued the club, and the litigation has quickly
turned into an odd quarrel over how high deer can jump. State
guidelines for private deer farms recommend 10-foot-tall fences to
keep the deer from jumping out. According to even the state's
lawsuit, the majority of the club's fence is eight feet tall, while
some stretches are only four to six feet high. So the club has
maintained that its fence is not a deer fence.
</P>
<P>
   State officials strongly disagree, and have retained Scott R.
Winterstein, an associate professor of wildlife at Michigan State
University who has studied the deer here using radio collars.
Professor Winterstein said that few deer would try to jump the
eight-foot fence, while does with fawns would not even attempt the
four-foot fences.
</P>
<P>
   The club's fences are a serious problem because they are likely
to increase the prevalence of tuberculosis within the club while
still letting occasional infected animals escape, he added.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Many deer tracks were visible one afternoon in the snow along
both sides of a two-mile stretch of eight-foot fence, but none of
the deer appeared to have jumped the fence. ``They'll come right up
to the fence but not over the fence,'' said Elaine Carlson, a state
biologist, as she studied the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Trespassing is a problem here. Sipping coffee at the local diner
at dawn today, five men, three in camouflage jackets, all
grudgingly acknowledged having fished or hunted without permission
on the club's land at least once. But they said that any serious
trespassers would simply cut holes in the unguarded fence.
</P>
<P>
   State lawyers see another motive for the club's fence. ``What
they've done is try to capture all the winter herding of deer on
their property and fence them all in,'' said Christopher D. Dobyns,
the assistant attorney general for natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole, the club's lawyer, declined to comment on the details
of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The club has few defenders here. Much of the land was logged in
the 1800s, then sold to wealthy families in Detroit and Chicago,
leaving a few infertile tracts for the farms and villages. This is
one of the poorest areas of the Midwest, with Hillman's 630
residents having a median household income that is just one-third
of the national median.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Turtle Lake Club is fighting a school tax assessment,
and schools will have to drastically retrench if the club wins.
</P>
<P>
   The Turtle Lake Club, which has its own airstrip for members'
private planes, survives with only 19 members because it sits atop
a natural gas field. Royalties from the wells cover much of the
115-year-old club's costs.
</P>
<P>
   The club also used to raise free-range cattle on its southern
fields, and some local residents say the cattle had a tuberculosis
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how the outbreak of bovine tuberculosis began,
many dairy farmers are upset by the club's actions. Galen H.
Schalk, whose family has raised dairy cows here since the 1940s,
said that he had found three infected wild deer on his farm, while
his 14-year-old son, Christopher, shot a coyote at the barn last
year and learned later that it was infected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on your mind every day,'' Schalk said as he milked his
cows recently. ``If one of my cows is infected, the whole herd
goes.''

 &HT;    Jackson, Jordan still keeping eyes on NBA happenings
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Bulls yanked the stalls of Michael Jordan and
Scottie Pippen from their United Center locker room. They'll be
redecorated in some fashion honoring the two main reasons Chicago
won six NBA titles in eight years. There were no preparations to
acknowledge their former coach, Phil Jackson, but the Lakers opened
a can of Worms, so to speak, when they fired Del Harris last
Wednesday after signing Dennis Rodman. Speculation is rampant that
Jackson is No. 1 on owner Jerry Buss' coaching list if Kurt Rambis
slips this season. As of late last week, no one with the Lakers had
contacted Jackson or his agent, Todd Musberger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot rule out (Jackson coaching again) this season,''
Musberger said. ``But we should not read too much into that,
because we are in hypothetical land and Phil is quite happy working
the speaking tour and helping his good friend Bill Bradley,'' who
is running for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, my office never does a commitment for Phil
without an escape clause. How would Phil react if (the Lakers) say,
`I got a job for you?' '' Musberger said. ``That's hard for us to
comment on until it really happens. ... But he keeps one eye
trained on the action in the NBA. He's as up on it today as he was
when he was with the Bulls. He has not closed the door on coaching
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that open the way for another Jordan return? He did say
he'd only play for Jackson. And he apparently has been keeping up
with the NBA. He's called Bulls assistant coach Frank Hamblem and
player Dickey Simpkins. When the Hawks beat Chicago 83-67, Jordan
left a message on Hamblen's voice mail saying, ``I can score 67
points in a game. Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpkins added: ``He called me one time, getting on me about
having just one rebound in a game. But I wouldn't say he's missing
this. I would say he's just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   WHOA, NELLIE
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago next month, the largest trade in NBA history went
down, a nine-player deal by Dallas' Don Nelson and New Jersey's
John Calipari. Already, it's clear that the Mavericks got the worse
of the deal. But not by much.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days on the job, Nelson sent Sam Cassell, Jim Jackson,
George McCloud, Chris Gatling and Eric Montross _ his starting five
_ to the Nets for Robert Pack, Khalid Reeves, Ed O'Bannon and Shawn
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson called the acquisition of Pack and Bradley ``our point
guard and center cornerstones of the future.'' Turns out, neither
Pack nor Bradley even starts for a Dallas team that's anemic.
Reeves and O'Bannon are out of the NBA. As for the Nets, Calipari
kept Cassell and Gatling, but Jackson and McCloud were eventually
traded. And Gatling asked to be traded on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moral of the story: Size doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   THEY SAID IT
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't care anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Lakers' Eddie Jones, the subject of countless trade
rumors, on why he would OK a deal to Charlotte for Glen Rice after
refusing other deals in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather get teeth pulled.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Cleveland's Bob Sura on guarding mercurial 76ers point guard
Allen Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think David Stern's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Detroit's Grant Hill who was unable to change his July wedding
plans with singer Tamia Washington to participate in the 2000
Olympic Trials
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, this is a dog year. A lot of guys are going out on the
floor with a lot of hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   _ New York's Larry Johnson on the rash of injuries around the
league
</P>
<P>
   ``He just needs to meet me outside in the parking lot, and we'll
settle it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Houston's Scottie Pippen on referee Hue Hollins, a nemesis
over the last five years
</P>
<P>
   ``They're manhandling him. Rik's not playing with force, and
they're just throwing him around.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Indiana coach Larry Bird on passive center Rik Smits
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   To the NBA. The league has done a credible job acknowledging
Black History Month. It has sponsored weekly symposiums at New
York's NBA Store featuring such former league stars as Tiny
Archibald, Isiah Thomas and Buck Williams, to discuss the history
of the league and the influence of blacks and its future.
Transcripts are on NBA.com.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   To the Los Angeles Lakers. Del Harris led the Lakers to 61 wins
last year and, after a 6-6 start this season, he gets the pink
slip? True, L.A. should be better than its record, and the coach
takes some responsibility. But he's a decent man who got caught up
in the selfishness and uninspired acrimony of a group of players.
He deserved better.

BAPTIST LEADER FOUND GUILTY OF SWINDLING AND THEFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARGO, Fla. _ The head of the United States' largest black
religious organization was found guilty on Saturday of swindling
millions of dollars from companies trying to do business with its
members and of stealing donations intended to rebuild churches in
the South destroyed by arson.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Henry J. Lyons, the powerful president of the National
Baptist Convention USA, was convicted of racketeering and grand
theft in Pinellas County Circuit Court on Saturday afternoon after
a monthlong trial that mixed law and religion and, his lawyers
said, was an attack on the separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The same jury refused to convict his aide and co-defendant,
Bernice Edwards, on a single racketeering charge, causing Ms.
Edwards to break down in tears when the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been so long,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argued that she and Lyons had used nonexistent
membership lists and the good name of the Baptist convention to
steer more than $4 million from corporations eager to do business
with black communities, and that they had used the money to finance
their lavish lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons seemed emotionless as the verdict was read. His conviction
on the single racketeering charge and two counts of grand theft
could carry a sentence of up to 30 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, which deliberated one full day and part of two others,
had its verdict ready by midmorning, but the decision was not read
until Saturday afternoon because of a mysterious e-mail message
sent to two Tampa Bay television stations that seemed to point to
jury misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards' lawyer had moved for a mistrial, minutes before the
verdict was read, asking Judge Susan Schaeffer to throw the unknown
verdict out because of the e-mail, which claimed that a juror had
openly discussed deliberations with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail included details identifying the juror, including her
first name and the fact that she had once appeared on the Ricki
Lake show. When the judge questioned the juror under oath, she
denied having discussed the case but did concede that she had been
on the Ricki Lake show.
</P>
<P>
   As the judge tried to decide what to do, a second e-mail
message, apparently from the same person, arrived saying only that
the information about the juror had been secondhand.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to help the judge make up her mind. She said she
could not delay the reading of the verdict for such a flimsy
reason.
</P>
<P>
   At least two members of the all-white jury had tears in their
eyes as the verdict was read. Later, a member of a small group of
supporters who sat behind Lyons throughout the trial, stood up and
told the judge, ``We remain people of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge replied, ``So do I.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both defendants were charged with one count of racketeering,
involving several instances of promising to sell nonexistent lists
and access to what they said were the convention's 8.5 million
members. Prosecutors said that figure was grossly inflated and
might be more like a million.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also said that Lyons had stolen most of the $240,000
donated to his organization by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai
B'rith, money that was supposed to be passed along to the black
churches that had been burned down.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trial in which the name of God was evoked again and
again, mostly by lawyers for Lyons and Ms. Edwards, whom they
described as his servants.
</P>
<P>
   But as Lyons and his aide tried to cloak themselves in religion,
and as their lawyers tried to convince jurors that when money was
floated into his personal account, it was just the way that black
churches ``do business,'' prosecutors hammered again and again at
their credibility, with bank statements, letters and other
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 28-day trial, prosecutors documented specific
instances of what they say was theft, claiming that the minister
used the good name of his organization to steal millions.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution produced two letters from the convention to the
Anti-Defamation League, which, prosecutors said, falsely claimed
that the money the league had donated to the burned black churches
had been distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also produced a document in which the convention had
estimated its membership, state by state. The list, which Lyons and
Ms. Edwards used in their scheme, the prosecutors said, claimed
more black members for some states than there were black residents.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, Lyons and his lawyers predicted that God
would deliver him and Ms. Edwards from what they called the
persecution of the state.
</P>
<P>
   As the all-white jury of five women and one man began
deliberations on Thursday afternoon, Lyons, Ms. Edwards and a group
of about 25 associates joined hands in the courthouse hallway and
sang ``What a Friend We Have in Jesus.'' Then a supporter and
convention member, the Rev. Charles Emery of Gary, Ind., led the
group in a rousing prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our father, we need your intervention,'' said Emery, who asked
God to help the jury reach the ``right'' verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need you to work on their hearts,'' he said, as the people
in the circle shouted ``Yes, Jesus,'' and a man stomped his feet.
``We need you to work on their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as tears filled the eyes of some in the circle, Emery made
a prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We claim the victory right here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he had finished, Lyons' wife, Deborah Lyons, hugged a
weeping Ms. Edwards. It was the actions of Mrs. Lyons that led to
the investigation of her husband's business dealings and lifestyle.
In July 1997, Mrs. Lyons set fire to a $700,000 waterfront home
that her husband had bought with Ms. Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lyons was sentenced to five months' probation in the
incident, but afterward she said she did not suspect her husband of
having an affair with Ms. Edwards _ he had several other affairs,
prosecutors claimed _ and stood by her husband throughout the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Others stood by him, as well. His church, Bethel Community
Baptist Church in St. Petersburg, retained him as pastor, and
leaders in the National Baptist Convention voted to keep him as
president, even as some members worried that he would drag the
100-year-old organization's reputation down with him.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons' lead lawyer, Grady Irvin, told the jury that it was the
cemetery and life insurance corporations that were greedy, that
they took advantage of ``the little preacher'' who was just trying
to represent his membership.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted a closing argument from prosecutors that dripped
with sarcasm and scorn. One of the items the defendants bought was
a diamond as big as a marble, they said.
</P>
<P>
   What Lyons and Ms. Edwards did, in the name of their church and
their religious organization, is ``beyond hypocrisy,'' said Bill
Loughery, the assistant state attorney. ``Somewhere along the line,
he traded the Good Book for the bank book. That's what this case is
all about.''

THROUGHOUT LIFE'S TRAVAILS, GIRARDI IS KEEPING THE FAITH

 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ There were tears in Joe Girardi's eyes, and he did
not try to wipe them away. His brown eyes were red because he was
talking about losing his mother, losing his baby and finally,
hopefully, having a new baby. The emotions were unusually close to
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   As Girardi discussed what he, his wife, Kim, and his family have
endured _ and what they expect to eventually enjoy _ he spoke
softly and evenly. He believes in hope. God, he said, has a plan
for everyone, and life's travails will somehow be handled. At least
that is what Girardi wants to believe. Sometimes, it has been
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers being in the Pfister Hotel in Milwaukee after the
Yankees played the Brewers in April 1997 and trying to reach Kim on
the telephone. It was late and there was no answer. Where was his
pregnant wife? Girardi felt helpless and frightened. The minutes
passed like hours before he received a call telling him about Kim's
miscarriage 10 weeks into her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the toughest things we've ever had to go
through,'' Girardi said. ``We thought that God had timed it
perfectly. The baby was going to be born in November, so we'd have
the whole off season to be with the baby. I kept calling her that
night and she wasn't answering. I knew something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old catcher, seated in a folding chair in the
clubhouse at Legends Field one day last week, stared straight
ahead. Girardi is cautiously elated about becoming a father later
this year, but losing a baby is never forgotten, and he seemed to
be reflecting on the loss while he talked.
</P>
<P>
   For a year after the miscarriage, Girardi consoled Kim. But
nothing he said fully soothed her. They are a deeply religious
couple and so close that Girardi once brought Kim to the podium
during a news conference at Yankee Stadium to announce a contract
extension, draped his arm around her and never let her return to
her seat.
</P>
<P>
   But the months after the miscarriage were distressing and
reminded Girardi of how he felt when his mother, Angela, passed
away from ovarian cancer 15 years ago. The final words she said
before dying were directed to Girardi, who was 19 at the time.
``Don't forget me,'' she said. He felt grief then and grief after
the miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who is 33, felt it more.
</P>
<P>
   ``She started to blame herself,'' Girardi said. ``She took it a
lot harder than I did. We went through a tough period until like a
year later. It was much tougher for her because it was part of her.
I just told her it wasn't her fault. It was God's will.''
</P>
<P>
   Girardi's voice never wavered. Girardi, who has contributed
mightily to two World Series championships in three years in New
York, is one of the leaders of the team's chapel group, and became
committed to his faith through his wife, whom he met while both
were attending Northwestern University. Still, Girardi wondered why
she had to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Why her?''' Girardi said. ``I don't think `Why
me?' too much. Maybe that's because I saw what my mom went through
and never saw her slack off in what she wanted to do. Very seldom
will I say, `Why me?' I kept saying: `Why her, God? Let her have a
baby.'''
</P>
<P>
   Girardi proudly revealed Kim's pregnancy last week while talking
about his passion for children. The convivial Girardi has
befriended a 14-year-old named Ray Smith, a dauntless teen-ager who
has undergone three open-heart surgeries, adores the Yankees and is
the only kid in Mount Marion, N.Y., who has Girardi's telephone
number and address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way: he's my best friend,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of Girardi's hopes for a family came up while he was
talking about his friendship with Smith and was asked why someone
who loves children as he does has not had any himself. Girardi
explained that he and Kim have tried to have a child since 1996,
only to have had the miscarriage jolt them.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Georgetown University Medical Center, studies
have shown that about 31 percent of pregnancies may end in
miscarriage. Girardi had begun to doubt that he would ever have
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had set in my mind, kind of, that we might never get
there,'' Girardi said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Kim is three months pregnant and doctors have said she
is fine, Girardi feels comfortable telling people about their
pregnancy. Kim, who has asthma and allergies, was bedridden for
three days at the outset of the pregnancy, but Girardi said she has
been fine since then _ other than dealing with her protective
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't let me do anything,'' Kim has said.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three months, Girardi has cooked, cleaned, walked
the dogs, done the laundry and persuaded Kim to go slow. That is
not easy for a woman who loves to exercise and has plans to pursue
a doctorate in psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her to rest,'' Girardi said. ``Nothing else.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Girardi chuckled at the thought of his wife as a couch potato,
and the tautness in his face vanished. The Yankees are scheduled to
be playing in Anaheim, Calif., on the due date, so the Girardis
might ask doctors to induce labor before the team leaves for the
West Coast. Girardi said they will name the baby after Kim's
grandfather, Sereno. If it is a girl, the name will be altered to
Serena.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi said he thinks he will be a good father, because he has
his mother's sensitivity and his father's devotion. His mother once
attended all 60 amateur games he played in one season, and his
father, Jerry, used to drive the six-hour round trip to take him to
Cubs games. Girardi looks forward to being a devoted parent, too.

<P>
   ``What's helped us through that is we've seen so many instances
in our life where God had a better plan for us than we ever had,''
he said. ``I think the most glaring thing is when I was traded to
New York, and I'm reminded of it every day. It's much easier to say
that, now that she's pregnant, but it was hard when she wasn't
pregnant because you're trying to figure out why. You have to
realize there's a plan.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Personalities battle on the court
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kenny Anderson and Antoine Walker are battling. While
the Celtics were being blown away in Washington, Walker screamed at
Anderson, turned to the bench and said loudly, ``I can't play with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson told Walker to get in position if he wants the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Furious, coach Rick Pitino screamed, ``The next guy who opens
his mouth is getting suspended for a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the players went at it again in practice, they denied
there is a problem, and Pitino said, ``It's not a problem. It won't
happen again. I'm very disappointed that it happened as a coach
because it's unprofessionalism at the highest level.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE BATTLES
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Alonzo Mourning and Washington's Terry Davis were in a
verbal battle before the Heat blew out the Wizards. Davis called
Mourning a ``sissy'' and said he always complains about foul calls.
``Zo'' then complained about receiving an unnecessary beating from
Davis and other centers around the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was in the World Wrestling Federation,''
Mourning said. ``Someone is going to have to take notice. I can't
retaliate like I did last year. All I can do is grin and bear it
and toe the line. It's every game this is happening. You can see a
team's game plan is to try and foul me.'' Mourning punished Davis
with 29 points, 12 rebounds and six blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Miami, Mark Strickland is back in Pat Riley's doghouse.
He's the most athletic big man Miami has, but he doesn't defend and
has lapses in concentration. ... Meanwhile, after being blown out
by the Heat, Washington coach Bernie Bickerstaff questioned his
team's toughness. Forward Juwan Howard then questioned
Bickerstaff's tactics. He refused to double team Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ITCHING TO RETURN
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are winning and Latrell Sprewell is itching to get
back for their Friday trip to Milwaukee, where his family lives.
He'll have an MRI done on his right heel this week. ... All is not
well with the Knicks, however. Larry Johnson is in great pain from
tendinitis in his left knee. Johnson was told he must play in pain
the rest of the season. Coach Jeff Van Gundy said it's Johnson's
daily decision to practices and play. ``If I could get 25
productive minutes, that would be good,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   NETS IN TANGLES
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the perils of Calipari. Nets coach John Calipari met with
reserve forward Chris Gatling, who's insisting he be traded. He
wants to deal Kendall Gill for the Warriors' John Starks, but Gill
says he will quit before he plays for P.J. Carlesimo. Then there
was a recent the on-court dispute with Scott Burrell, who was sent
to the table to report in with Eric Murdock, then recalled.
Calipari said he was sending a message to the players on the floor.
Burrell said, ``You're embarrassing us.'' The two players met with
Calipari before the Portland game. ``I'm not going to say it's not
a problem,'' Murdock said.
</P>
<P>
   BULLS COACH OPTIMISTIC
</P>
<P>
   Tim Floyd on whether the Bulls can compete this season: ``I'd
prefer not to talk about our talent. In terms of it, it's the best
I've ever coached.'' Guess that means the Bulls definitely get to
the Sweet 16. ... Indiana's Mark Jackson has been doing that goofy
dance again and coach Larry Bird isn't pleased. ``He is back to
doing his shake. I don't like that. We talked about it. And I
didn't like it.

 &HT;    Years of solid production garner respect, says Malone
 &HT;    By Jeff Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Antonio McDyess got two technicals and was ejected
during Denver's loss at Utah. That made the young forward wonder
when he will get the respect shown Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the message the ``Mailman'' sent: ``Ten years. And you've
got to produce for 10 years. And there's still people that are
going to test you. I've done it now for 14 years. Like anything
else, a lot of guys come in and say a lot of things, and the only
thing you can say to them is: years and production. That's what
gets it. You've got play a lot of years, and you've got to produce
all those years.''
</P>
<P>
   McDyess may do it in nine years. When the Nuggets stunned the
Jazz Wednesday, he went 10-for-15 with 24 points. Malone, who was
5-for-13, had 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   `ADMIRAL' TAKES CHARGE
</P>
<P>
   If you're a fan of the David Robinson, this should lead your
personal newscast: Robinson dunks. Robinson pumps his fist.
Robinson dives for a loose ball? Yes, it's all true. Give teammate
Mario Elie the MVP. Robinson played like the David of young,
totaling 29 points, 17 rebounds, three steals and two blocks
against Olden Polynice and the Sonics. In the second half he didn't
miss a shot and had 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising play? He crashed to the floor early in the
fourth quarter to wrestle for a loose ball, getting a jump ball.
``That's a perfect expression of how badly someone wants to win the
game,'' Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. ``You couldn't make
something like that up. I hope somebody got a picture of that
because it will be hanging in my office.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie, who had been riding Robinson for his laid back ways,
``told him I want to see that every night. When your main player is
playing well, it fires you up.''
</P>
<P>
   A GRIZZLY DISPLAY
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver coach Brian Hill was livid with counterpart Butch
Carter in the wake of the Grizzlies' loss in Toronto. In the
closing seconds of the game, Hill, fuming, glared toward the
Raptors bench and touched a finger to his temple, as if to say,
``What are you thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   What infuriated Hill was Carter's decision to make substitutions
for Charles Oakley, Doug Christie, Kevin Willis and Vince Carter so
they could be acknowledged by the sellout Air Canada Centre crowd
of 19,800. Hill felt his team was being shown up. Asked about his
finger-to-temple display, Hill said, ``I'll remember this for a
long time.'' ...Grizzlies' general manager Stu Jackson says Bryant
``Too Big Country'' Reeves is ``getting there (in shape). He had
lost about 17 pounds by the time a lot of the stories came out
(about his weight) but he still has a ways to go. He has to be more
consistent and he has to work harder.''
</P>
<P>
   DOUBLES AND TRIPLES
</P>
<P>
   As Jason Kidd goes, so go the Suns. When Kidd has a
double-double (three times) or a triple-double (four times),
Phoenix is 7-0 this season. When he doesn't, the Suns are 0-4. Kidd
has four of the five triple-doubles in the NBA this season and now
has 23 for his career, sixth all-time since the league began
keeping the stat in 1979. He passed Michael Ray Richardson (21).
Next is Michael Jordan (28). ...Suns center and former Chicago Bull
Luc Longley got a visit from Bulls owner and Arizona resident Jerry
Reinsdorf last week. Reinsdorf stopped by Longley's house to
present him with his 1998 championship ring. ``He thanked me for a
great job and wished me luck in my future endeavors with the
Suns,'' Longley said.

UNION CRITICIZES PLANT CLOSING IN GUATEMALA
</HEADLINE>
  (as) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's largest apparel union has accused the Phillips-Van
Heusen Corp., the nation's largest shirt maker, of undercutting
workers' rights by closing its factory in Guatemala _ the only
unionized factory among the more than 200 export-oriented apparel
factories in that country.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Mazur, president of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
and Textile Employees, said that the factory closing was intended
to warn apparel workers at other plants in Guatemala and Central
America that if they voted to join a union their jobs would be in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruce J. Klatsky, chairman of Phillips-Van Heusen, which is
based in New York City, said that the union was blowing the plant
closing out of proportion. He said the company had closed the
Guatemala City factory because a large customer, Mercantile Stores,
had turned to another company to make its shirts, leaving Phillips
with too much production capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Klatsky insisted that the decision to shut the plant had nothing
to do with the fact that it was unionized. He noted that the
company had closed two other plants in recent months. ``We face
this problem pretty significantly,'' Klatsky said. ``We just
couldn't maintain continuous and efficient production in a smooth
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Klatsky said his company, which also makes apparel under the
G.H. Bass, Gant and Izod labels, was a leader among American
apparel companies in terms of working conditions and factory
monitoring programs.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said Phillips-Van Heusen was hypocritical
because it was one of the few companies participating in the White
House anti-sweatshop task force and had agreed to take a tougher
stance against poor working conditions than most other apparel
makers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, after a six-year struggle, the 500 employees at the
Guatemala City factory obtained a union contract, which
significantly improved their wages and the quality of the water at
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contract these workers had was a beacon of hope for more
than 80,000 maquiladora workers in Guatemala,'' Mazur said,
referring to maquiladoras, factories in special low-tariff zones
that export almost all their output. ``By shutting the factory,
Phillips-Van Heusen sent a message to other workers in Guatemala:
If you fight for justice, if you fight for a union, we will not
honor your contract. We will walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   To increase the pressure on Phillips-Van Heusen, the needle
trades union has flown two workers from the Guatemala factory to
the United States to talk about the plant closing and the hardship
it has caused. The union insists the company violated the labor
contract and Guatemalan law by not providing advance notice when
the factory closed in December.
</P>
<P>
   Mazur said he was disappointed that a company in the White House
Apparel Industry Partnership, a group of companies, unions and
human rights groups cooperating to develop an anti-sweatshop code,
would close the only unionized apparel plant in Guatemala's
maquiladora zones.
</P>
<P>
   But Klatsky said that his company had gone the extra mile, even
offering to donate the plant's machinery and equipment to the
workers if they were able to find a new owner.

SPORTS COLUMN: THREE FOR THE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., N.Y., Fla., Ohio, Pa.)  (mk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three college quarterbacks have created a gulf between
themselves and the rest at their position. This trio stands alone
in the type of smart spirals they toss, whether their passes are on
short or long routes, on in or out patterns, on the deep post or on
the fly. With a flick of the wrist, even off-balance and on their
back foot, they can zing a pass more than 50 yards downfield. Their
footwork is light and their release is sharp. They are mobile,
accurate passers who do not scramble seeking to run but run looking
to throw. They look like leaders. Winners.
</P>
<P>
   A dynamic trio: Tim Couch of Kentucky, Donovan McNabb of
Syracuse and Daunte Culpepper of Central Florida. One, two, three.
They could go that way in the NFL draft on April 17.
</P>
<P>
   That is the current buzz among draftnicks, that for the first
time since the 1971 NFL draft, three quarterbacks could command the
top three spots. In 1971 it was Jim Plunkett to the Boston
Patriots, Dan Pastorini to the Houston Oilers and Archie Manning to
the New Orleans Saints. One, two, three.
</P>
<P>
   This time it could be Couch to Cleveland, McNabb to Philadelphia
and Culpepper to Cincinnati. One, two, three.
</P>
<P>
   The talent after this superb trio wanes but might, indeed,
produce more gems. Akili Smith from Oregon, Cade McNown from UCLA,
Ted White from Howard, Shaun King from Tulane, Brock Huard from
Washington, Michael Bishop from Kansas State and Brian Kuklick from
Wake Forest hope to surprise. At least two from this group of seven
realistically hope to crack the first round. Remember, in the
storied quarterback class of 1983 where six first-rounders were
selected, Dan Marino was the sixth quarterback chosen. Stars at
quarterback often are drafted at surprising numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Last season two quarterbacks landed in the top spots: Peyton
Manning to Indianapolis and Ryan Leaf to San Diego. One, two in the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   This season, three could be the charm.
</P>
<P>
   Couch appears a lock in Cleveland. He is 6-foot-5, 225 pounds.
He has the entire package _ size, arm, release _ and most
importantly to Cleveland, Couch took an undermanned Kentucky team
and was its backbone, lifting the football program to long lost
heights. Here is a talented player who, under pressure, delivered.
Scouts love that. Cleveland does, too.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb and Culpepper are close, almost flip-flop players at No.
2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate to be the person and the team making the second
decision,'' said one NFL general manager. ``With McNabb and
Culpepper, one of these guys is probably going to be very good and
the other is going to be great. Which one is which?''
</P>
<P>
   The thinking can go that Culpepper has played in a pro offense
at Central Florida and has already shown plenty of his potential.
He is a daunting 6-4, 250 pounds. Huge at quarterback, yet mobile
with wondrous feet and arm.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb, however, played in a system at Syracuse that did not
always feature pure pro-style passing and, thus, his upscale is
seen as greater. Just how far can he go? He has it all, big arm,
accurate passing, mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Some scouts believe Culpepper is the favorite over McNabb
because his experience at quarterback has been more pro-like.
McNabb, they say, may never catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Couch and Culpepper did not perform in passing and running
workouts at the NFL scouting combine held recently in Indianapolis.
But McNabb did.
</P>
<P>
   He was easily the star quarterback at the combine. He left many
observers agape, similar to the way he did in his Senior Bowl
performance. McNabb is 6-2, 225 pounds. He is not quite as big as
Couch and Culpepper, but he is faster. McNabb earned respect for
his willingness to participate fully at Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   All three will hold private workouts for NFL teams beginning
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best of the rest are Smith, who has a cannon-like arm,
and McNown, whom scouts call magical because although he is only
6-feet, he plays and produces in a much bigger way.
</P>
<P>
   This draft, however, starts with Couch. And McNabb and Culpepper
could quickly follow. Three for the money. Three for the show.

THE FLYERS WAIT FOR LINDROS TO TAKE THE WHEEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (as) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, when the Flyers bus' rumbles through the Lincoln
Tunnel and emerges into the bustle of Manhattan, Eric Lindros sits
back, looks out the window and wonders what it might have been like
to live and work here instead of in Philadelphia. What if the
Quebec Nordiques' owner, Marcel Aubut, had been more adroit or if
the arbitrator, Larry Bertuzzi, had decided differently?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of joining the Philadelphia Flyers seven seasons ago,
Lindros would have become a Ranger. He would have been understudy
to Mark Messier, a man he admired and emulated. Wearing the big 88
on his blue, red and white Rangers jersey instead of the orange,
white and black of the Flyers, Lindros could have been a key
performer on a New York team contending, maybe even this season,
for the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In the Flyers' media guide, atop his biography, Lindros lists
Madison Square Garden as his favorite National Hockey League rink
and New York as his favorite NHL city. But this is not to suggest
that Lindros is not satisfied or motivated with his current team,
once again a top contender for the Stanley Cup and on display
Sunday at the Garden against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday happens to be Lindros' 26th birthday, but in some ways he
seems older. He has been a hockey celebrity since age 16, and he
has experienced plenty of strife in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Because Aubut and the Nordiques traded Lindros to the Rangers
and the Flyers on the same day in June 1992, Bertuzzi had to choose
between the two teams. He favored Philadelphia. The multiplayer,
multimillion-dollar deal sent Peter Forsberg to the Nordiques, who
later moved to Denver and became the Colorado Avalanche. Forsberg
became one of the world's best players and helped the Avalanche to
the 1996 Stanley Cup. They might contend again this season.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, wearing the captain's ``C,'' helped the Flyers to the
1997 finals, where they lost in four games to Detroit. Although
they have been slumping slightly, the Flyers are still among the
top Eastern Conference teams.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Flyers finally win the Stanley Cup, the critics will
say Lindros at last proved himself, in his seventh season, the way
Wayne Gretzky did in his fifth with Edmonton, the way Mario Lemieux
did in his seventh with Pittsburgh. Should they fall short, people
will murmur that Lindros has never quite lived up to expectations.
They will question his leadership and his inspirational qualities,
exactly as they did last winter when he captained a good Team
Canada to a disappointing fourth-place finish in the Olympics. Even
Bob Clarke, the Philadelphia general manager, hinted before this
season that Lindros needs to take his team further and show he
deserves to be one of the highest-paid athletes in his profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play the same from year to year, no matter what is said,''
Lindros said, referring to Clarke's comments. ``Everybody deals
with pressure in different ways. He can say what he wants to say
and he has the right to go out and voice what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros also spent last summer talking, somewhat less publicly
than Clarke. He was embarrassed that the Flyers were eliminated in
the first round by Buffalo in five games. After discussing his
ideas for the team with Clarke, Lindros was not happy with the way
the general manager responded. At his cottage in Ontario, Lindros
visited frequently with Steve Yzerman, the captain of the Stanley
Cup champion Detroit Red Wings. And he had another meeting, a
positive one, with Roger Neilson, the Flyers' coach, perhaps the
coach with whom Lindros has felt most comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Earning $8.5 million this season in the last year of his
contract, Lindros could become a restricted free agent this summer.
However, he and his father, Carl Lindros, who serves as his agent,
have what Carl Lindros says is a verbal agreement to play next
season with Philadelphia _ providing Clarke does not trade him, as
Clarke, last summer, implied he might. But is a verbal contract
recognized by the NHL?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Carl Lindros said.
</P>
<P>
   Is it recognized by the NHL Players Association?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Carl Lindros said. ``We have a handshake.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Eric Lindros allow bids for his services, he could move
to another team, perhaps a wealthy team like the Rangers, for much
more money. A team would have to compensate the Flyers with five
first-round draft choices if the Flyers did not match its offer to
Lindros. The Rangers were willing to give that up for a lesser
player, Joe Sakic of Colorado, two years ago. But Carl Lindros said
he and his son have a nonwritten understanding with the Flyers,
just as they did after Aubut gave the Flyers permission to talk to
the family on that day of two trades in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   So they intend to honor it, Carl Lindros said, again for $8.5
million, plus several large bonuses involving personal achievements
in the current season. One of those bonuses concerns the Hart
trophy for most valuable player, which Lindros won in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Although the buzz in recent weeks has been that Pittsburgh's
Jaromir Jagr could win the Hart, a Lindros booster could make a
good case, and a strong fourth quarter of the season could change
the handicapping. Jagr leads the National Hockey League with 89
points, but Lindros is in second place with 83. Jagr has 28 goals,
but Lindros has 35, only 2 behind John LeClair, his linemate, who
leads the league with 37. As a tandem, Lindros and LeClair are to
the Flyers what Mantle and Maris were to the Yankees. They are
together most on the ice, not off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're close, but we've got different things going,'' Lindros
said. ``He's married with a couple of kids and I'm single.''
Lindros lives, he said, ``about a 7-iron away'' from LeClair. Six
other teammates have homes in the same housing complex. ``Our group
is pretty close,'' Lindros said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but Lindros has always projected a certain apartness,
as well as an aura of danger. As a teen-ager, he resisted Canada's
feudal junior system and forced a trade to a team near his Toronto
home. Before turning pro, he resisted the NHL's draft, stayed
amateur for a year and forced Quebec to trade him. A large man who
plays a collision-based style, Lindros has suffered two
concussions, one severe, and has caused a few. His frightening
devastation of Ottawa's Andreas Dackell early this season _
unpenalized and resulting in no suspension _ had to send a chill
down spines in 26 opposing rinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a clean hit,'' Lindros said of the crunching check into
the boards that left Dackell bloody and dazed. ``I give and take
hits a lot.'' Does he ever worry about accidentally killing
someone? ``I don't wish harm on anybody,'' Lindros said. ``I don't
wish injury on anybody. I've been hurt more than most.''
</P>
<P>
   Once was last year, when Pittsburgh's Darius Kasparaitis hit
him. ``One of the stupidest mistakes I've ever made was trying to
carry the puck with my head down,'' Lindros said, and it left him
``in la-la land'' for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lindros has an aggressive, scary side in competition,
he also has a humanitarian instinct. He has been honored for his
work with the Children's Miracle Network, which provides
hospitalization for children with long-term illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   On the ice, his concerns are less serious and more upbeat. On
his right wing, the arrival of Keith Jones had made the
Lindros-LeClair unit a better line. The return of Mikael Renberg
and the acquisition of Daymond Langkow have improved the other
forward units. In goal, John Vanbiesbrouck has made it a better
team.

   ``To the organization's credit, they've really renewed the team
with a lot of new blood,'' Lindros said. ``There's a lot of light
at the end of the tunnel for us.''

HOPE RISES FOR MIAMI BUT DIMS FOR RUTGERS

<P>
   MIAMI _ The Rutgers Scarlet Knights played one of their most
resilient games of the season on Saturday, although at the end they
had nothing to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   They fought back from a 17-point second-half deficit to come
within 3 points of the University of Miami on two occasions before
the Hurricanes held on, 68-63, in front of 10,494 people at Miami
Arena, the fourth-largest crowd in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Billet's basket in the last five seconds brought Rutgers
within 66-68, but Miami forward Tim James ended it with two free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   Billet had a 3-point attempt blocked by James with 15 seconds
left that could have tied it for Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they'd be tough,'' James said. ``They are a quality
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Greer led the Scarlet Knights in scoring with 22 points.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers, 17-11 over all and 9-9 in the Big East, needed a
victory to feel better about securing a bid to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. Now the Scarlet Knights
must hope to be impressive in the Big East tournament, which begins
Wednesday at Madison Square Garden in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For Miami (21-5, 15-3), this was its eighth straight Big East
victory. If Connecticut is upset in Sunday's game with Syracuse,
Miami will win the No. 1 seeding in the conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in with a three-game losing streak, Rutgers coach Kevin
Bannon chose to pull his two freshman regulars _ center Rashod Kent
and guard Dahntay Jones. Replacing them were the 6-foot-11-inch
Alvydas Tenys and another freshman, Billy Collins, making his first
start. Never mind that Kent, with .662 field goal accuracy, is on
target to break the school record for field goal percentage.
</P>
<P>
   The moves worked, as the Scarlet Knights got off to a good
start. Greer and Rob Hodgson clicked on 3-pointers to open the
game's scoring, and their defense forced Miami into missing its
first half-dozen shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes didn't score until 4 minutes 10 seconds had
elapsed, on a James jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team could muster much offense. With 8:18 gone in the
game, Rutgers clung to a 13-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Miami stayed close in part because of Rutgers' off-target
shooting, and the Hurricanes took their first lead of the game _ at
16-15 _ with 6:37 left in the half on Kevin Houston's free throw.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights promptly retook the lead on Greer's
turnaround jumper, but it was short-lived. Kent entered the game in
the half's last four minutes, but missed three of four free throws
as Miami built a 24-21 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Kent's dunk helped, but the Hurricanes scored 8 of the last 12
points to take a 32-27 lead into halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously for Rutgers, Billet, who came into the game having
made 38.7 percent of 610 career 3-point attempts, missed both of
his chances from beyond the arc in the half. And Rutgers made just
one free throw, against six for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes, meanwhile, had control at halftime without much
of a contribution from their two top scorers. James, a senior
likely to be chosen in the National Basketball Association draft,
had 6 points. Johnny Hemsley, who has been a consistent long-range
threat, was scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   That changed dramatically in the second half, as Miami began to
assert itself on the scoring of the James-Hemsley tandem. Hemsley
quickly had a pair of 3-pointers, while James contributed an
alley-oop dunk, a tip-in and a jumper.
</P>
<P>
   When the Scarlet Knights looked up, they were behind, 54-37.
</P>
<P>
   A 9-point run by Miami put the visitors in a major hole, but
they didn't roll over. With Miami up by 56-41, Greer sank a pair of
3-point shots to pull Rutgers within 9 points with 8:19 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights kept the pressure on, easing within 6 points
of their hosts before a pair of free throws by Miami center Mario
Bland and a James driving layup restored the comfortable lead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hodgson made four straight free throws and Collins sank
one of two to bring the visitors within 61-55.
</P>
<P>
   Kent fouled out shortly thereafter, with 7 points and 2
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a Hemsley's 3-pointer, the Scarlet Knights showed
great resilience. Billet's free throw with 3:27 left made it a
6-point game again. Then a free throw by Hodgson and Greer's drive
brought Rutgers within 3. The Knights could not get any closer.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Miami retired James' jersey, No. 40. The only
other Miami player to have his number retired is Rick Barry, who is
in the Basketball Hall of Fame.

JOHN HENRY SMITHES, 88, MAKER OF PORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (as) 
 By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The name Cockburn's means port to many aficionados around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But grape farmers in the ruggedly mountainous Douro River valley
of Portugal still call the shipper Casa Smithes. To them it is
irrelevant that John Henry Smithes, who died in England on Jan. 22
at the age of 88, retired 29 years ago as a director at Cockburn
Smithes (pronounced CO-burn SMITH-eez), one of the world's major
port houses.
</P>
<P>
   An outdoorsman, Smithes immersed himself in grape-growing and
wine-making and became one of the trade's most influential
blenders. He shaped Cockburn's dryish, lean, elegant style,
especially such perennial favorites as Fine Ruby and the flagship
Special Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Smithes was equally renowned for ``elevating spitting to a high
art,'' said Peter M. Cobb, a director. ``He had spittoons all over
the place. He spat right into them from six feet away. The wine
never hit the floor.'' For once, famously bad English teeth proved
a boon. ``One thing John didn't have many of was teeth,'' Cobb
said. So nothing ``got in the way'' of a wine's trajectory in the
Cockburn's tasting room at Vila Nova de Gaia.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and associates described Smithes as an unpretentious,
hot-tempered, lovable eccentric. After private school, he joined
the family business in Cockburn's London office in 1930. At a time
when dark suits, stiff collars and bowler hats defined proper
business attire, he clung to a disreputable tweed jacket, brown
brogues and a rakish slouch hat.
</P>
<P>
   Such earthy irreverence better suited Oporto, Portugal, where he
joined his father and became a partner in 1938. But World War II
approached, and he and Nancy Smithes, to whom he would be married
for 65 years, went home to England. Both joined the Royal Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
   As a pilot, Smithes could not land his fighters flawlessly; he
inflicted more damage on them than Nazi fire did. His superiors
turned him into an observer and rear gunner. Back in Portugal in
1946, he proved unpilotlike, too, in his Fords.
</P>
<P>
   If he did not master switchback roads, he knew almost every inch
of every quinta, or estate, of the steeply terraced Douro region.
He appreciated the characters and explored the commercial prospects
of red grapes virtually unknown outside Portugal: touriga nacional,
tinta roriz, tinta barroca, touriga francesa, tinta cao and
mourisco.
</P>
<P>
   Smithes started Cockburn's first experimental vineyard, at Tua,
in 1933, with many clones of indigenous varieties. ``The
experiments were not acted on for 30 years,'' Cobb said, ``because
it took the trade 30 years to realize that it could not rely on
independent growers to provide high-quality fruit.'' In 1975, five
years after Smithes retired, Cockburn's started buying and planting
acreage in a big way _ his way.
</P>
<P>
   Smithes, whose tasting abilities were the talk of the valley,
defined and classified hundreds of separate lots of wine before
blending them. He was brilliant at judging young ports and
cask-aged ports, and in putting together the blends of ruby ports
and old tawnies. But some thought he was less adept at producing
vintage ports.
</P>
<P>
   Although he ultimately took himself out of the Douro, he could
not take the Douro out of himself. After retiring to south Devon,
he bought and converted a property into a miniature quinta, with
terraces, vines and a bay view. Twice a year he revisited
Cockburn's (now owned by the Britain-based Allied Domecq Spirits
and Wine), at harvest and in springtime, when the new wine had
settled down.
</P>
<P>
   Smithes once gave an old friend, David Lett, owner of the Eyrie
Vineyards in the Willamette Valley of Oregon, a wooden port-holding
canteen inscribed:
</P>
<P>
   I must have one at 11,
</P>
<P>
   'Tis a duty which must be done,
</P>
<P>
   If I don't have one at 11,
</P>
<P>
   I must have 11 at 1.
</P>
<P>
   In Lett's view, ``It was the one at 11 that propelled John to 88
years.'' Above all other wine qualities, Smithes prized ``grip,'' a
term that characterizes the length and quality of a port's finish,
or aftertaste. His associates also interpreted it as the guiding
principle of his life.

MICHAEL ST. CLAIR, 86, DEALER IN AMERICAN ART 
</HEADLINE>
  (as) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael St. Clair, director of the Babcock Galleries
in New York City for 40 years and an influential dealer in American
art, died on Feb. 22 at his home in Manhattan. He was 86 and also
had a home on Fire Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A dapper, exquisitely mannered man who rarely talked about
himself, St. Clair was one of the deans of American art dealers.
His main accomplishment lay in reviving, through exhibitions and
publications at his gallery, the reputations of several neglected
American painters, including the early 20th-century modernists
Alfred Maurer and E. Ambrose Webster and the Impressionist Childe
Hassam.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the legacy of Marsden Hartley that St. Clair probably
affected the most, partly because he was able to acquire so many of
the artist's works, and partly because Hartley's achievement
sustained the most dramatic upward re-evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   St. Clair was born in Bradford, Pa., and grew up in the oil
fields of Pennsylvania and Oklahoma, where his father worked.
Intent on becoming a painter, he studied with Thomas Hart Benton at
the Kansas City Art Institute from 1934 to 1939, and then with
George Grosz at the Art Students League in New York and with
Boardman Robinson and Yasuo Kuniyoshi at the Colorado Springs Art
Center. In the early 1940s he was director of the Works Project
Administration Art Center School in Oklahoma City and had his only
solo show there, in 1942, at the Oklahoma Art Center.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, St. Clair served with the 328th Fighter
Squadron in North Africa and Europe, earning a silver star and
three bronze stars for bravery during a battle near Salerno, Italy,
in September 1943.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he settled in New York City and pursued painting
for more than a decade, supporting himself as a window designer and
private art dealer. In 1959 he joined Babcock as director and
subsequently purchased the gallery, which was founded in 1852 and
is the country's oldest commercial gallery devoted exclusively to
American art.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, St. Clair also took over the Hartley estate from the
dealer Paul Rosenberg, who had become frustrated by the lack of
interest in the artist's work. St. Clair drove to Maine and
acquired the works held by the artist's executor, returning with a
small truck full of Hartleys. The works ranged from the artist's
exuberant semi-abstract ``German Officer'' paintings of 1914-15 to
the soft, elegiac landscapes and stark portraits from the years
before he died in Maine, in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1959 and 1980, St. Clair mounted 11 Hartley exhibitions
and began carefully placing Hartley's work in public and private
collections. He ultimately sold Hartley paintings to nearly 70
museums, often earmarking certain paintings for specific museums
long before the museum showed any interest in the artist. In 1978
the Whitney Museum of American Art staged the first Hartley
retrospective in a New York museum in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The living American artists Babcock exhibited in his gallery
included Ben Ben, Bessie Boris, Jerome Hill, Byron Burford, Margo
Hoff and Stephen Edlich. He remained involved with Babcock, which
was purchased by John Driscoll in 1988, until recently and was an
adviser on its current exhibition of Hartley prints.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, St. Clair established the Babcock Galleries Endowed
Fund for Art History at the Department of Art History at
Pennsylvania State University. He is survived by his companion,
Paul M. Jones.

SPORTS COLUMN: OUT-OF-TOWNERS FREQUENTLY STRUGGLE IN FUN CITY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Yankees made their deal for Roger Clemens 10
days ago, there was a surprising amount of grumbling from hard-core
fans who had been captivated by the way David Wells took to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everybody agreed it was a good baseball move, but
there was a third angle to the deal _ whether the oft-cantankerous
Clemens would run afoul of intrusive fans and news media in New
York. It is a reasonable question.
</P>
<P>
   Noo Yawkers are a sensitive breed. Tom Seaver did a radio
interview with Chris Russo a few weeks ago and the WFAN switchboard
was soon jangling with aggrieved locals very quick to volunteer,
``Hey, Mad Dawg, the guy copped an attitude with you.''
</P>
<P>
   They can sniff out haughtiness in a Manhattan minute. I suspect
it might not be a pretty sight if Hillary Clinton, who has never
run for anything, is exposed to vox populi asking why she thinks
she should be a senator in a state where she has never lived, or to
questions even more pointed and personal.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mickey Mantle, who ultimately became a folk hero, once
admitted that as a young player he had not understood what fans in
Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park were shouting at him. It wasn't the
accents, but rather that the quips and puns and references and
insults were often flying right over his crimson neck.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Roger Clemens who will be tested. The big dude from
Texas has come to New York to acquire his World Series ring. That's
nice. We have a very nice jewelry area on West 47th Street.
However, Clemens would prefer to have a club official do the
shopping and present him with some ostentatious championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   By his body of work and his strong ego _ and the way he has
accepted ritual teasing about beanballs past _ Clemens does not
seem a candidate to become the next Eddie Whitson. Yankee fans
remember Whitson, whose modest talent disintegrated in 1985 when
the fabled Bronx Men's Chorus performing their Bleacherian Chants
turned him into vertical hummus. He lasted a season and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens must know that New Yorkers do not pull their punches for
superstars. Mets fans had no mercy for Mike Piazza, his eyes as
bewildered as those of a stag in the middle of the Interstate,
trying to make sense of what he was doing in Shea Stadium last May.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Piazza had the skill and the courage to bounce
back, with doubles off outfield fences. Take that. Piazza, who has
since signed on for extended duty, accepts the hypocrisy, and more
power to him.
</P>
<P>
   Not that New York is the only town to give the cold shoulder to
outsiders. It cannot be easy to be Jose Offerman moving to Boston
right after the Red Sox squandered their hold on Mo Vaughn. It
wasn't easy for Charles Johnson trying to catch for the Dodgers
last year after the Murdoch henchmen banished Piazza. In
Philadelphia, the assassins on WIP make the screechers on WFAN
sound like National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   For some stars, New York becomes like the sports car for people
who hit certain milepost birthdays, the present to oneself. Mark
Messier exuded so much chesty confidence that it was no surprise he
led the Rangers to a Stanley Cup. The Rangers are not so wonderful
these days, but there is something reassuring about Wayne Gretzky
(temporarily injured) gliding up and down the Garden ice, a
long-standing hit like ``Cats.''
</P>
<P>
   Some athletes bring their own wall with them. As long as he has
played here, Patrick Ewing remains a Washington guy, loved and
respected but with somewhat less emotion than for Charles Oakley,
with his surly physicality, or John Starks, with his chest-thumping
unpredictability. It's a gut thing, like Jimmy Connors playing
cock-of-the-walk at the U. S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes athletes come to New York because it is just another
stop on the merry-go-round. Kerry Collins, the troubled quarterback
who signed that improbably huge contract, will soon discover that
Giants fans expect him to be Conerly, Tittle and Simms, every
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Some athletes avoid New York altogether. Greg Maddux knew his
workmanlike steadiness would play better in Atlanta than New York.
Albert Belle is bright enough to know he did not want to hear New
York's psychologists, real and amateur, counseling him inning by
inning.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that Clemens will not go through the trauma that
Piazza suffered. He is joining a great team. He does not play every
day. He will have had all spring to prepare. He is a master at
controlling his own universe. His glare keeps the pests away. When
he strides to the mound, he is ready.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens will have a lot of big leads in Yankee Stadium. It
will bring out the inner bully, the athlete's instinct that says
``Kick 'em while they're down.'' Jordan had it. Messier had it.
Lawrence Taylor had it. A great pitcher on the Yankees can afford
confidence. A tourist carrying a lot of heavy luggage running for
the Senate? That is another ball game. We are not rubes, and we are
not shy.

<P>
   GOSHEN, N.Y. _ Hanna Ingber is a senior at Goshen High who
believes, emphatically, that her school should dispense free
condoms to students. The school says this will not happen, and
since Ms. Ingber will be in college in the fall, it is easy to see
that she will not get her way any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Ms. Ingber, who is 17, has Goshen in a dither.
</P>
<P>
   With skill, determination and an instinct for using the news
media, Ms. Ingber has forced Goshen to pay attention to her, just
as she forced the school system to give her the middle school
auditorium for a forum on condoms last week. If her campaign has
brought a blast of unwanted publicity to Goshen, she said, that's
too bad. This town had to wake up.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ingber's panel of experts all turned out to favor providing
condoms to high school students. Several hundred parents showed up
and many objected, but the experts recited statistics to prove them
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, children are going to have sex, with or
without your consent,'' said Bradley Shippee, a panelist who
teaches AIDS prevention in prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ingber added, ``Just as school is a place to get a bagel if
you've forgotten your lunch, or a Band-Aid or a tampon, high school
should be one more place to get a condom.''
</P>
<P>
   Until about a year ago, Ms. Ingber was known mainly as the
founder of Students Advocating Animal Rights, which pickets rodeos
and circuses and holds a vegan Thanksgiving dinner. But then she
developed the condom campaign, and while some classmates think
she's a pain, some grown-ups have developed a frank admiration for
her and her ability to work the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a couple of people say to me that she reminds them
fondly of the '60s,'' said James Langlois, the superintendent of
schools. ``We live in a time of a low level of activism, and I have
at times wished there was more. Not the issues that she is focused
on, but I like the model of political activism that she has put up
in front of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been the one who speaks up, and I've always been
proud of that,'' Ms. Ingber said. Her first experience in
outspokenness came in eighth grade, when, for a social studies
assignment to produce posters about current political issues,
students created art on abortion, animal rights and other topics
that the principal said were too hot to display.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `These are too controversial and we don't want to
upset anybody.' The teacher just stood there cowardly and didn't
say anything, and most of the students just sat there,'' Ms. Ingber
said, recalling the incident. ``I just kept raising my hand and
saying, `Wait a minute, this is our assignment and both sides are
represented and what's going on?'''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, in another school exercise, Ms. Ingber and other
Goshen delegates to an Orange County student convention called
Using Government chose condom distribution as their convention
platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much sex going on that the parents and teachers
refuse to acknowledge, and even though these kids are taught safe
sex, they're not practicing it, and that scares the daylights out
of me,'' Ms. Ingber said. ``Of all the people who I know have had
unprotected sex, I ask, `If you had had a condom with you, would
you have used it?' and the answer is always yes, and that proves
that sex education works and that the problem is availability.''
</P>
<P>
   The student convention rejected the Goshen condom proposal, but
by then Ms. Ingber had turned her attention to a real government _
the Goshen Unified School District. When she decided the school
system was giving her proposal the run-around _ officials kept
talking about advisory committees _ she went to The Times Herald
Record of Middletown, which produced a front-page story about her,
accompanied by a photo of Goshen High students flourishing condoms.
</P>
<P>
   That story drew the attention of a disc jockey named Rockin'
Steve from the Poughkeepsie rock radio station, WPDH. He spent a
morning handing out condoms to students in front of the high school
during his radio show. Some made the condoms into balloons and
kicked them around.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows how to use the media, and she's using you, too,''
Langlois told a certain reporter politely. ``I don't know many high
school kids who would call up The New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   The local coverage embarrassed a lot of people and angered some
students. ``It's given us a bad name,'' said Matt Quick, a junior
who sat on the panel as an opponent of condom distribution in
school. ``At the home basketball game against Burke, the opposition
fans were shouting `condom kids' at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the key to Ms. Ingber's resolve may lie precisely in her
knowledge that for the insurgent, there is no such thing as bad
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the town were really upset,'' she said,
``but it just brought a lot of attention to the issue, and that is
the most important thing. It was our publicity that got Goshen
awakened to what we were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of Ms. Ingber's parents are lawyers, and Ms. Ingber aspires
to go to Yale and to have a career in the law. ``I guess my
background prepares me for arguing and, you know, logical
thinking,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The parent opposition at the forum had three things to say about
her plan: that teen-agers who are mature enough to have sex are
mature enough to go to Planned Parenthood on Greenwich Avenue to
pick up free condoms, that school condoms send the wrong message,
and that condoms can fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of playing Russian roulette with two bullets in the
gun, you seem to be saying, `Well, let's tell the kids to play
Russian roulette with only one bullet,''' Mike Grady, the father of
a second-grader, told the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father never talked to me about sex,'' Shippee responded,
``but you know what? I think it's time all parents started teaching
their kids about sex.''
</P>
<P>
   That idea, teaching, turned out to be the middle ground on which
both sides could meet. Langlois, who had some apprehension about
the meeting, left it a happy man. ``A community can deal with
condoms on its own,'' he said, ``but education is something we can
all believe in.''

NEW YORK CITY SEEKS POLICE WHO LIVE WHERE THEY WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (as) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the New York Police Department launches its
largest-ever recruitment drive aimed specifically at city
residents, top city officials remain unclear about the goals of the
program, and national experts on policing say there is no evidence
that having officers live where they work makes any difference.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts announced last week by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
Police Commissioner Howard Safir, which will cost $10 million to
$15 million, come in response to calls for residency requirements
by politicians and community advocates in the aftermath of the
fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African street
vendor, by four white police officers on Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Though Giuliani and Safir oppose such a requirement, they said
they would soon give city residents a boost on exams for promotions
and would pursue plans to provide low-interest mortgages or even
cash grants for down payments to lure officers into the five
boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Data released by the department last week show that the
percentage of New York officers living in the city has declined
over the past decade, to 54 percent from about 60 percent. And,
supporting the argument that hiring more city residents would help
diversify the force, those figures show that less than half the
white officers, 43 percent, live in the five boroughs, while 78
percent of both black and Asian-American officers, and 73 percent
of Hispanics, do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want a police department that's reflective of the people
that they're policing,'' said Norman Siegel of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, a leading advocate of residency requirements as
part of an affirmative action plan for the department. ``There's a
greater possibility that people who not only live in the city but
live in a particular neighborhood will understand the particular
people in that community.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as he announced the new drive, Safir said he would not
favor city residents for top department posts. He even pointed out
that officers living in the city have a higher rate of misconduct
than those living in the suburbs, and said ``diversity is the key
reason'' for the recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   And law enforcement analysts say the trend toward requiring
officers to live where they work, or giving them financial
incentives to do so, is more about public relations than
substantive impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cheap solution that's based on stereotypes,'' said
Samuel Walker, a professor of criminal justice at the University of
Nebraska at Omaha who has advocated diversifying police
departments.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Kerlikowske, deputy director of the Department of Justice's
Community Oriented Policing Service, agreed, saying: ``There is
nothing that I know of that supports the idea that a police officer
living in the city vs. living outside the city provides better
service, is more caring. There is a perception on the community
side that this will make a better police department, one that
listens more, but I don't buy into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Residency requirements for city workers date to the 19th
century, and about 25 percent of municipal police departments with
more than 100 officers require them to live within the city limits,
according to a forthcoming Justice Department study. Another 40
percent of departments require officers to live within a certain
radius of the city. New York, for example, allows officers to
choose among the five boroughs and six nearby suburban counties in
New York state.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continuing debate, the past decade has seen a boom
in government initiatives to encourage officers to live in the
cities they patrol _ particularly in distressed, crime-ridden
neighborhoods _ by offering cheap or even free housing and
take-home patrol cars.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a nascent program providing subsidies for officers
living in New York housing projects has attracted just 46 people,
little more than a tenth of a percent of the force. Safir's policy
of giving city residents extra points on the police entrance exam
has helped boost the level of applicants who live in the five
boroughs from 62.4 percent of a 1993 class of recruits to 69.6
percent of a 1998 class, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the total force, the largest group, 30 percent, live on Long
Island; of those in the city, more than half live in Queens and
Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we're Palestinians and they're Israelis, coming over
every day to the West Bank,'' said DeShawnta Johnson, a young black
woman from Brooklyn who described the Police Department as ``an
occupation force'' patrolling a mostly minority city.
</P>
<P>
   Of New York's nearly 40,000 officers, 67.4 percent are white,
13.5 percent black, 17.5 percent Hispanic, 1.5 percent
Asian-American and the tiny remainder American Indian, department
figures show.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo shooting intensified calls for a residency
requirement and was the catalyst for unveiling the new residency
initiatives, Safir said. Of the four officers who fired 41 bullets
at Diallo as he stood in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment, two
live on Long Island, one in Brooklyn and one in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the Diallo shooting raised our consciousness,''
Safir said. ``As we recruit more city residents, the department
will more adequately reflect the city.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no studies showing how many officers in departments
across the country live in the cities they patrol. In 1994, 83
percent of the Los Angeles Police Department lived outside the
city. In Seattle, it was about one in three that year, up from 25
percent in 1986. Several large cities, including Chicago,
Philadelphia and Boston, require all city workers, including police
officers, to live within their borders, and those laws were upheld
by the United States Supreme Court in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   New York City passed a law in 1986 requiring city workers to
live in the five boroughs, but the police are exempt, along with
other uniformed personnel, educators and about 100 professional job
categories.
</P>
<P>
   Residency rules are popular not only to improve relations
between the police and the community, but also as a way for cities
to hold on to tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But policing experts and officials of the local police union,
the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said that many officers
cannot afford to live in New York, prefer suburban schools for
their children and often want to put distance between themselves
and a stressful job. With police forces across the country
expanding, experts said, departments should not add criteria that
make it harder to attract the best applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police officers, in my experience, try to get as far away as
they can,'' said Wesley Skogan, a political scientist at
Northwestern University who specializes in community policing.
``Partly because it's cheaper, but they also want to get away from
their work, they want to keep their families away, for fear of
retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   But government agencies continue to try to lure police officers
into troubled neighborhoods as part of a community policing
strategy. In addition to ad-hoc programs in cities around the
country, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has
the ``Officer Next Door'' program, in which police officers can buy
HUD properties for half their market value.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 2,284 officers nationwide have bought HUD homes through
the program, according to a spokesman, and 1,889 more are
available. In New York, 24 officers are buying homes from the
federal agency, and another 17 properties are available, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said he was talking with various financial institutions
about providing low-income loans for officers, and was also
considering having the department make the down payment.
</P>
<P>
   While union officials said they would welcome such incentives,
policing experts questioned whether it was the wisest use of the
money. Stipends for officers who speak a foreign language, or
cultural diversity training, might be more efficient paths to
improving community relations, they suggested.
</P>
<P>
   But John Timoney, who left the New York Police Department after
29 years and is now police commissioner in Philadelphia, which has
a residency requirement, said residency does make a difference, if
only in the public's perception of the department. Timoney, who
grew up in New York, moved to Rockland County, N.Y., after about a
decade on the force, and then returned to Manhattan when he became
the department's first deputy commissioner in 1995, said that in
dozens of community meetings in his new city, he has never heard
the police described as ``an occupation force,'' a refrain he heard
often in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be more support for the police here on a
personal level; everybody seems to know a cop somewhere, or know
someone who knows a cop, because they live in the neighborhoods,''
Timoney said in an interview. ``Clearly, they have a bigger stake
in the city. Their own survival, their kids' survival, depends on
it. Whether that makes them better cops, I'm not sure you can make
that quantum leap.''

SPORTS COLUMN: QUICK FIXES FROM THE YANKEES TO THE METS TO THE
OLYMPICS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Try to remember. It was only two years ago, back when the
Olympics were pure and Latrell Sprewell was merely an obscure
All-Star, that the Yankees bought David Wells as a quick fix to get
the team back to the World Series. We didn't love him right away.
If a fat, undisciplined loudmouth could wear pinstripes, what was
our excuse? But the Boomer turned out to be perfect as well as
imperfect, and he helped us be No. 1 again.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's gone and we have a supposedly better-model Boomer,
disciplined, more discreet, with seemingly more impressive numbers.
Roger Clemens was not greeted with a universal welcome.
Commentators called it greed, disloyalty, a quick fix that would
destroy the winning ``chemistry'' of the Yankee clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chemistry, grow up,'' snapped Jane Heller of Stuart, Fla., one
of the Yankee-ologists I periodically check for reality checks.
``People change every year and so does the chemistry. The underpaid
kid Derek Jeter is now an overpaid heartthrob. Bernie Williams is
different, Darryl is certainly different. It was a business
decision that brought Wells, and a business decision that replaced
him with Clemens.''
</P>
<P>
   Business, indeed. Who would have thought that the mightiest mark
in sports, the Yankees, would climb into bed with the lowly Nets?
Yet that made sense, too. George Steinbrenner loaded his bases for
another round with Cablevision to make a television deal. If
Cablevision doesn't step up, the Yankees and the Nets could go into
competition with the company that owns the Rangers and the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Quick fix? What do you think Mark Messier was? Especially after
Coach Mike Keenan arrived. Sprewell is another quick fix that looks
good. Like Clemens?
</P>
<P>
   ``Slow down, we'll see,'' rumbled Roger Sims of Everett, Wash.,
another reality checker. ``Look at the stats. Sure, Clemens is
going to the Hall of Fame, but don't be so sure he's taking us with
him. He was 20-6 last season and Wells was 18-4. But add Wells'
post-season, you've got 22-4. And strikeouts can take a lot out of
an arm. A ground ball on the second pitch can be better. An out's
an out.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller, the author of such comic mysteries as the forthcoming
``Sis Boom Bah,'' says that she used to hate Clemens, especially
when he drilled her favorite Yankees. ``But then I once hated Wade
Boggs, and I ended up loving him.''
</P>
<P>
   Less demonstrative, Sims, a retired TV news producer, would not
commit emotionally to Clemens, but did say: ``I am a long-time
Steinbrenner hater. I applaud him for this. And it hurts me.''
</P>
<P>
   The quickest fix in sports these days may be the International
Olympic Committee's attempt to move beyond what a spokesman calls
``some unethical behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC needs to do this before sponsors pull out and fans begin
to regard the Games as merely another entertainment spectacular,
like Ice Follies, Super Bowls and Demolition Derbies. Without its
carefully cultivated veneer of a peace-bringing spiritual movement,
the Olympics would simply be a pretentious track meet.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy director of press relations for the IOC, Franklin
Servan-Schrieber, sharply was critical of my report from Los
Angeles last week that suggested ``systemic corruption'' as part of
a long-time Olympic culture. The article went on to link the
current Salt Lake City scandal to the blind, if not approving, eye
that Avery Brundage and other officials turned on the so-called
1936 Nazi Olympics, in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be very careful about moral lessons,'' said
Servan-Schrieber, a historian, speaking from IOC. headquarters in
Lausanne, Switzerland. ``The most requested video at the Olympic
Museum is Jesse Owens running victoriously in 1936. He was showing
the world the truth about race. The judgment of history was a
message of hope. That was a dark time in our history and everyone
was tested. The Simon Wiesenthal Center has done good things, but
what did they want to achieve by ruining the name of the
Olympics?''
</P>
<P>
   The Wiesenthal Center had rummaged through the Brundage papers
at the University of Illinois and found unsettling letters. One was
from Sigfrid Edstrom of Sweden, an IOC president, suggesting that
America handle its Jewish problem as efficiently as the Germans
were doing. Another letter confirmed that Brundage had bid on, and
won, a contract to help build the German Embassy in Washington
after the Berlin Olympics. World War II canceled that contract. But
it did not cancel the sense of impropriety and arrogance in such an
arrangement, if not outright graft.
</P>
<P>
   Servan-Schrieber dismissed such a possibility. The only graft in
Olympic history, he maintained, was limited to Salt Lake City. It
was being fixed.

OLD FRIENDS RESCUE MAN WRONGLY JAILED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty years ago, James Wilson spent a brief but
critical few months as a student at Public School 79 in the Bronx.
He barely learned to read or write, and because of his mental
retardation, he never really grew up.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson made friends. And after the once rambunctious
fifth-grader became a destitute adult, charged with a robbery he
insisted he did not commit, those friends saved him from a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, now 31, walked out of Rikers Island jail on Friday
afternoon a free man, thanks to two of his former P.S. 79 teachers
and dozens of acquaintances who fought a four-month battle to prove
that the state had jailed an innocent man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's no angel, but he's no criminal,'' said Ed Prisinzano, a
gym teacher who helped organize a neighborhood crusade to rescue
Wilson, and who was present when the robbery charge was dismissed.
``I never thought for a moment that he could have committed this
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was arrested on Oct. 18 shortly after five men were
robbed of jewelry and cash at gunpoint in the vestibule of their
Bronx apartment building. The police found Wilson nearby, on the
platform of the Metro-North train station at Fordham. He was fast
asleep, with two other homeless young men at his side.
</P>
<P>
   None of the stolen goods were found on him, but at least one of
the victims said Wilson might have been one of the two men who
robbed him.
</P>
<P>
   Word of his arrest reached his friends at P.S. 79 a few days
later. They could not believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson dropped out of school early in the sixth grade, but he
had remained a familiar presence in the neighborhood, even after
his mother and his grandmother, who had cared for him, died. He ate
many of his meals a few blocks away, at a food distribution center
for the homeless called Part of the Solution, and attended
counseling sessions nearby.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Wilson would visit his old teachers, sometimes taking
them their mail and smilingly cadging money and candy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd ask me for a dollar here, a dollar there,'' recalled
Prisinzano. ``We'd give him food when he came around. We'd give him
clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   When they learned of Wilson's arrest, his friends feared most
for his safety. Their first letter, signed by teachers and others
who knew him, was sent a few days before Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   It pleaded with the Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson,
to protect Wilson. With his ``diminished mental capacity,'' it
said, he could become easy prey to other inmates.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the proceedings against Wilson were moving swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, whom Prisinzano would not identify Saturday, began
talking about a plea bargain with the district attorney's office
soon after his arrest. An agreement was reached. No grand jury
heard the case. On Dec. 1, Wilson pleaded guilty to a lesser charge
of attempted robbery and was given a prison sentence of two years.
</P>
<P>
   Prisinzano said that Wilson did not understand what was
happening to him and did not understand that he had other options
than to accept the plea that his lawyer suggested to him.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the teachers were deep into amateur detective work.
They searched homeless shelters and soup kitchens for alibi
witnesses, talked with the robbery victims, and visited the crime
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's sleeping buddies from the Fordham station were
frightened to talk, Prisinzano recalled, and had to be coaxed
through intermediaries to give their stories to the teachers.
</P>
<P>
   More letters were sent to the authorities, this time arguing
that evidence collected by Wilson's supporters showed he was not
guilty of participating in the robbery in any way.
</P>
<P>
   From a legal and procedural point of view, the district
attorney's office faced an odd situation. Wilson's original lawyer
had not filed any motions to withdraw the guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   But the persistence of Wilson's friends paid off. The case was
investigated again, and at the district attorney's instigation, the
plea was withdrawn and the charge dismissed. Wilson, as reported by
The Daily News on Saturday, emerged from the Bronx Criminal Court
building beaming.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``What was unique about this is that we were moving at the
behest of friends of the defendant, not the defendant or his
attorney,'' said Eric Warner, the senior executive assistant in the
prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge now for Wilson's friends is to find him a home,
supervision and help. Staff members from the Bronx school took up a
collection for a small temporary room, but they want a more
permanent arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Prisinzano, a teacher for 38 years and a native of the Bronx,
said he also wants people to draw a lesson from Wilson's ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``James is not the only innocent man in prison,'' he said. ``And
for every innocent one, there's a guilty one out on the street. So
you have got to be absolutely sure. You have to have safeguards.''

 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The eighth highest point in Manhattan is about to
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Wind and weather permitting, a 180-foot-long boom _ a steel
structure almost the length of a city block _ was scheduled to be
lowered early Sunday morning to 42nd Street from the tower crane
atop 4 Times Square, the Conde Nast building.
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer, when the crane finished climbing to the top
of the tower it helped build, the boom tip has been been poised 51
stories and nearly 900 feet over Times Square, becoming a point on
the skyline almost rivaling the Citicorp Center.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of next week, if all goes as planned, not a trace
will remain of the crane, which is worth about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Its removal answers a question that has puzzled many New Yorkers
about tower cranes: once a building is built, just how are the
cranes taken down?
</P>
<P>
   The answer _ besides ``very carefully'' _ turns out to be
straightforward. The tower crane is used to erect a smaller crane,
called a stiff-leg derrick, on the rooftop. The tower crane is
broken down, and the derrick lowers it to the street in stages,
starting with the boom.
</P>
<P>
   Then the derrick is taken apart into pieces that can fit into a
hoist or freight elevator. Down it goes to the ground, and off to
the next job.
</P>
<P>
   The public rarely witnesses these operations because they are
scheduled at night or on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 Times Square, there is a bit of a hitch because of the
complex, constricted nature of the rooftop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have room on the roof to lay the boom down and
disassemble it,'' said Mel Ruffini, a vice president of the Tishman
Construction Corp., the construction manager. ``That's why it's
being brought down in one section.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruffini said wind would be a critical factor in deciding whether
to proceed. If the maneuver is postponed, it will be put off until
next Sunday, since 42nd Street will have to be closed temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Four Times Square is an especially sensitive site because there
have been construction accidents there, including a catastrophic
collapse of a subcontractor's scaffolding in July. Thereza
Feliconio, 85, who lived across the street, was killed as pieces of
steel crashed into her room in the Woodstock Hotel. Times Square
was snarled for days, and one block of 43d Street was closed for a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The tower crane has not been implicated in the accidents,
however. City officials and industry executives said tower cranes
have a good record overall. The more frequently reported accidents
involve mobile cranes at street level or smaller, unlicensed
derricks. In January 1998, for example, a smaller 40-foot crane at
the Conde Nast site fell while lifting a 40-ton load of granite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very rarely have a problem with a tower crane,'' said
Gaston Silva, the city's buildings commissioner. ``In general, the
tower cranes are very safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Tower cranes are operated by licensed riggers. The cranes and
derricks division of the Buildings Department reviews the assembly
and dismantling procedures and also inspects the equipment before
and after it is erected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tower cranes, because they're larger, heavier and more
complicated, are treated more carefully,'' said Jay P. Shapiro,
principal engineer at Howard I. Shapiro &AMP; Associates, a structural
engineering firm specializing in cranes and derricks. ``For the
volume of construction and the number of cranes in use, it's
remarkable how few accidents there are.''
</P>
<P>
   Two tower cranes were used to build 4 Times Square: a Favco 1500
with a 181-foot boom and an FMC TG1900 with a 180-foot boom and a
10-foot extension. Both are owned by the Canron Construction Corp.,
the structural steel subcontractor. The Conde Nast building is
being developed by the Durst Organization and was designed by Fox &AMP;
Fowle.
</P>
<P>
   The cranes climbed upward through the building as it rose,
lifting themselves from floor to floor. In April, the TG1900 took
down the Favco and continued its ascent, reaching its high point in
June.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the TG1900 made 250 to 300 ``picks,'' as the lifting
maneuver is called, handling steel girders, facade panels and
cooling and heating equipment. Its last big job was on Feb. 8, when
it hoisted an emergency generator to the rooftop.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, the tripod-like derrick was built. It sits on
the rooftop, as green and angular as a giant praying mantis.
</P>
<P>
   The derrick has four cables and can hoist a 35-ton load. The
boom of the tower crane, the heaviest load that the derrick will
handle, weighs 17 tons. Elio Cettina, the general superintendent of
the 4 Times Square project for Tishman, said workers stationed in
the street would use long lines to keep the crane boom from
swinging during its journey down.
</P>
<P>
   After the boom is lowered, the rest of the crane will follow
over four or five days: the gantry, mast, counterweights and
mechanical deck, including the winch and operator's cab. The crane
will be taken to a yard in South Plainfield, N.J., for
refurbishing.
</P>
<P>
   Where will it go next?
</P>
<P>
   Although cranes are often shipped cross country and sometimes
overseas, this particular TG1900 probably will be used to construct
3 Times Square, the Reuters building, for which Tishman is also the
construction manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there's a prior commitment,'' Cettina said, ``it will
come back to Times Square in the middle of the summer.''

EDITORIAL: THE DIALLO LEGACY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 28:
</P>
<P>
   The death of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed West African killed in a
fusillade from four white police officers, was both a personal
tragedy and a civic trauma. The strains it caused between the New
York Police Department and the minority and immigrant communities
are serious and prolonged. Many white citizens share the concern
that the city's declining crime rate has been achieved through
brutal tactics that are aimed disproportionately at people of color
and threaten the civil liberties of all citizens. This concern
points toward Diallo's legacy to his adopted city. That legacy is
an overdue discussion about how to fulfill the demand for safer
streets without rending the social fabric of a diverse and
sometimes unruly city.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the police department or at City Hall can afford to
misunderstand the fear aroused by the 41 bullets sprayed in
Diallo's direction by a police unit that prides itself on owning
the night. Coming at a time when racial profiling is in the news
and memories of the police assault on Abner Louima are still fresh,
the seemingly disproportionate force in this case convinces
residents of minority neighborhoods that aggressive crimefighters
can be dangerous to them and their children.
</P>
<P>
   Those who express this concern most thoughtfully, like Hugh
Price, president of the National Urban League, are careful to
praise police for retaking New York's most lawless territories and
liberating ordinary residents to move beyond their fortified
apartments. But these same voices warn that too many people now
fear police as much as they once feared crime. There are
encouraging signs that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police
Commissioner Howard Safir are listening.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor told new police graduates recently they must be
respectful and restrained, that they must act as civil rights
workers. The commissioner has noted that more training is planned
and that renewed efforts are being made to add minority officers to
the force. He is also instituting other reforms, and has retrieved
from the City Hall basement the task force report after the Louima
case that Giuliani derided at the time as proposals that ``make
very little sense.''
</P>
<P>
   We hope the retrieval of the Louima report indicates a new
openness to information, for there seems to be a rich mix of
statistics and opinion that can help the Giuliani administration
adjust police practices in a way that preserves rather than
jeopardizes gains in the war on crime.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly some of the information is contradictory. The mayor
noted that the number of shootings by police is down to 1985
levels. At the same time, the police unit in the Diallo case has
frisked more than three people for every one arrested, a situation
that feeds concerns that young men are being frisked on the basis
of race. William Bratton, the former police commissioner, has
argued that when crime drops to a certain level, police must adjust
how they wield their authority
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said for the city's chief crimefighter. There is
a time for the announcement of new crackdowns and a time for
following through on the spirit of dialogue embodied in the mayor's
address to the police cadets. It is that latter spirit that should
guide Giuliani and Safir to a new effort to reassure New Yorkers
that the police are there to protect and serve, not to threaten in
arbitrary or discriminatory ways.

FOREIGN STUDENTS DISCUSS CHALLENGES OF LIFE IN NEW YORK CITY AT
CONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Expressing concerns ranging from finding jobs to
finding dates, foreign students from nine countries who attend 13
colleges and universities in the New York region met Saturday for a
conference at Hunter College on the opportunities and challenges
international students face in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was sponsored by Metro International, a nonprofit
group founded in 1977 to help build a bridge between foreign
students and New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to get them out of the classroom, and into the
city, so they have more than just an academic experience when
they're here,'' Margaret Shiba, the program's executive director,
said of the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The students, from Europe, Asia and South America, said they had
come to New York only to discover problems similar to those they
faced at home. Moreover, they said, few New Yorkers seemed excited
about meeting foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Sascha Jerrentrup, a student from Dusseldorf, Germany, led off a
discussion about racism in New York City. Here to study engineering
at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, Jerrentrup, who
is white, said he was dismayed by the relationship between black
New Yorkers and the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised when I was in the subway,'' he said,
recalling an incident he had seen. ``There was this black guy just
taking a nap. Two white policemen were saying, `Is everything OK,
sir,' but you know the way it was meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerrentrup said the stereotype abroad is that racism in America
is confined to paramilitary groups hiding out in the Idaho hills.
But in his view, the recent shooting of an unarmed immigrant by the
police in the Bronx suggested far broader problems with race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image is of a melting pot where people from all
backgrounds can live together comfortably,'' he said, adding,
``It's a nice picture, but it's not the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants in another session, on language and culture, said
the fast pace of American life, and of speech, posed problems.
Several students said they found it hard to get involved in
conversations because people spoke so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   And several said that the internationalism of New York had an
unexpected downside. ``In New York, you could spend your whole life
never speaking English,'' said Elkin Urrea, from Colombia, who is
studying English at Hunter College.
</P>
<P>
   A student from Russia, Boris Baranov, who had traveled to the
Midwest, said he got less attention in New York. ``They treat us
more like immigrants'' than like visitors, he said of New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The students also spoke of the aggressive socializing in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Acton, an international student organizer at Teachers
College at Columbia University, described typical New York behavior
as going to a party and ``seeing how many people can I meet in a
night, whereas in other countries fun might be sitting down with
coffee and having a long talk.''

OFFICER FINDS SUSPECT IN 1972 KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly 27 years after the police say a bookmaker shot
an acquaintance dead at a Brooklyn bar and then vanished, a police
detective handing out sketches of the suspect happened upon him
Friday on a midtown Manhattan street.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Joseph Carfagno, 72, a bookmaker and convicted
rapist, was arrested in the April 23, 1972, killing of Joseph
Destefano, 35, after an argument outside the Graham Lounge in
Williamsburg, said Detective John Krol of the 94th Precinct in
Brooklyn. Charges have not yet been filed.
</P>
<P>
   The detective, who is on desk duty because of an illness, had
taken it on himself to research unsolved cases. He said he had gone
to West 49th Street on Friday to pass out digitally updated
sketches of Carfagno near a hotel where the suspect had once worked
as a clerk and had long been known as a bookmaker.
</P>
<P>
   But before the detective and his partner had even parked,
Carfagno appeared, standing in front of a parking garage on 49th
Street. Krol said he recognized the man's distinctive webbed
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't know what we were doing, because we weren't even
wearing suits and were driving my Ford Escort,'' the detective
said. ``I think he just figured we were going into the garage to
check prices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't know until we pulled out our badges,'' he added.
``But when we nudged his left hand out of his pocket and saw the
unusual web formation around the fingers, we knew it was him.''
</P>
<P>
   According to press accounts, Carfagno was nearly arrested in
1976, when the police received anonymous tips that he was living in
a Manhattan hotel. But he vanished before the detectives arrived.
</P>
<P>
   He had been well known to the police before the shooting at the
Graham Lounge. Beginning in 1952, he spent nearly eight years at
Rikers Island jail on rape charges, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960 he was implicated but never indicted in a shooting into
a Brooklyn bar. Two men were believed to have cracked open the
bar's front door, and then one stuck an automatic pistol through
the opening and sprayed four shots at the patrons inside, the
police said. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, Carfagno was convicted of operating a policy
numbers game, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the suspect was still a bookmaker, Krol said, ``I
couldn't say yes and I couldn't say no, but we vouched for safe
keeping $7,408 we found on him.''

2 MASSACRES PROMPT INDIA TO TRY TO RULE EASTERN STATE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct time element in 2nd graf)   By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ For Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, the
euphoria of his historic peacemaking visit to Pakistan was
short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   The stories about high-stakes nuclear diplomacy quickly were
bumped off the front pages last week by his government's scramble
to salvage its move to dismiss the government of the eastern state
of Bihar, one of India's poorest and most populous.
</P>
<P>
   After furiously lobbying some of its own partners in the
coalition government it leads, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
Janata Party on Friday managed to convince the lower house of
Parliament to ratify the central government takeover of the state.
The government made the move on the grounds that two massacres of
low-caste people there in the past month demonstrated a breakdown
of law and order.
</P>
<P>
   But the upper house of Parliament is expected to vote against
ratification, probably this week. The measure can be introduced
anytime in the next six weeks. If it is defeated, the government of
Bihar will be restored to power and the wobbly national coalition
government will have sustained yet another blow to its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Vajpayee's government removed the populist
first couple of Bihar, Laloo Prasad Yadav and his wife, Rabri Devi,
from power. It acted after a second massacre of low-caste people on
Feb. 11. In less than three weeks, a private militia organized by
upper caste landowners killed 34 men, women, and children from the
caste known as the untouchables, or the Dalits.
</P>
<P>
   Such butchery has occurred sporadically over the last 20 years
in Bihar as an outgrowth of the struggle between landowners and
poor farm workers who have sought to be treated with dignity and
paid higher wages. Hundreds have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The government had been confident that its takeover of the state
would be ratified in Parliament, especially after Sonia Gandhi,
leader of the opposition Congress Party, declared that the
government of Bihar had lost the moral authority to govern
following the second massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party, which has led India for most of its 51 years
of independence, itself has invoked the constitutional provision
that allows a national takeover of state governments dozens of
times. Many critics say the provision has often been misused for
partisan political gain.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, the Congress Party surprised the national government
by announcing that it would oppose a takeover in Bihar, making
ratification doubtful in the upper house of Parliament, where the
opposition is stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Congress Party officials said the massacres, while ghastly, did
not warrant the ejection of an elected government. They also
accused Vajpayee's government of installing a partisan, political
official as governor of the state, betraying its self-interested
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   But both the Bharatiya Janata Party, which heads the coalition
government, and the Congress Party could have political motives. A
central government takeover of Bihar would allow the governing
party and its allies to use the patronage and power of the state to
strengthen their weak political position there, political analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party, which trounced the Bharatiya Janata Party in
state elections last November, needs to regain ground in Bihar and
neighboring Uttar Pradesh, two powerhouses in the Hindu heartland,
if it is to lead the national government again without a heavy
reliance on a patchwork of allies.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party can ill-afford to let the governing party
gain the upper hand in Bihar, experts say, nor does it wish to be
seen as supporting the Hindu nationalist party that the substantial
minority of Muslim voters in those states oppose.
</P>
<P>
   For the last nine years, the state has been ruled flamboyantly
by Yadav or his wife, who present themselves as the champions of
the lower castes and religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate in the lower house of Parliament, Home Minister
L.K. Advani portrayed the decision to dismiss the Bihar government
as motivated solely by a desire to protect the people of the state.
``This decision has not been taken for or against any party,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharad Pawar, a Congress Party leader, accused the governing
party of using the massacres for its own political ends. ``Of
course politics has its own place,'' Pawar said. ``But for the sake
of your political benefit, you should not use Dalits for that
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Yadav declared on the floor, ``You are attempting to destroy a
government of the poor people.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers and advocates for the Dalits say they are
skeptical that the violence against agricultural workers will stop,
whether there is a takeover or the Laloo Yadav-Rabri Devi
government returns to power.

REAL ESTATE: HOME IMPROVEMENTS FROM NEW LEAFPROOF GUTTERS TO
SEAMLESS SIDING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most home-and-garden shows have a fairly predictable assortment
of vendors hawking a fairly standard assortment of windows, doors,
wall-coverings, bath fixtures and kitchen appliances. But they also
provide a showcase for newer products that are not yet widely
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Among the products at last weekend's 20th Annual Builders' Home
Show in Kingston, Pa., near Wilkes-Barre, were an innovative gutter
design, a siding system designed to be to houses what custom-made
clothing is to people and a framing _ or rather molding _ system
for poured-concrete structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gutter That Never Clogs ... Guaranteed!'' was a tag line
guaranteed to catch the eye of any homeowner who has spent the
better part of an afternoon perched on a ladder scraping soggy
leaves out of a clogged rain gutter. ``If a Leafguard gutter clogs,
we'll clean it for you,'' said Jim Palushock, office manager for
F&AMP;L Gutter Systems in Hazelton, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Palushock's company is a distributor of the Leafguard gutter
system, a replacement gutter manufactured by Englert Leafguard in
Perth Amboy, N.J. The Leafguard gutter, he explained, never has to
be cleaned because it is designed to prevent the buildup of debris.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bradley, operations manager for Englert Leafguard,
explained that with an ordinary gutter, the top is either left open
_ thus acting as a catch basin for leaves _ or it is covered with
an add-on screen that must be cleaned periodically so that
accumulated debris does not block water from flowing into the
gutter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Leafguard gutter has a built-in sloping hood that
extends beyond the roof's edge and over the gutter channel, keeping
solid objects out of the gutter. Rather than just end at the far
edge of the gutter the hood instead curls down and in _ like a
breaking wave _ so that the lip of the hood ends up positioned over
the gutter channel.
</P>
<P>
   When water and debris coming down the roof get to the hood, Mr.
Bradley explained, the debris falls off at the curve while the
water sticks to the hood surface long enough for it to reverse
course and get in over the gutter where gravity causes the water to
drip into the gutter.
</P>
<P>
   (This is similar to what happens when you try to slowly pour
liquid out of a container that is filled to the brim. It's
virtually impossible to prevent at least some of the liquid from
running down the side of the container and dripping off the
bottom.)
</P>
<P>
   The Leafguard system is a replacement cut and formed ``on-site''
to the exact size necessary.
</P>
<P>
   While it is more expensive than an ordinary gutter, costing from
$8 to $13 a foot to install, depending on location and complexity
of the installation, he said, all LeafGuard systems come with a
lifetime warranty against clogs. (Additional information can be
obtained by calling (800)638-2507.)
</P>
<P>
   Another ``made-on-location'' exhibit at the Kingston show was
sponsored by ABC Seamless of the Poconos, a roofing and siding
company in Pocono Summit, Pa. ``We bring the factory to your
house,'' said William T. Winkler, president of the company, which
is a franchisee of ABC Seamless, a siding manufacturer in Fargo,
N.D.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler pointed out that while much of the siding material
installed today is made of vinyl or aluminum, the siding he
installs is made of hot-dipped galvanized steel coated with
polyvinyl chloride _ commonly known as PVC _ to provide protection
against the elements while allowing for expansion and contraction
without cracking. Moreover, ABC Seamless siding is
``custom-tailored'' to fit each house.
</P>
<P>
   Standard aluminum and vinyl siding material, Winkler explained,
comes in lengths of about 12{ feet. Whenever the area to be covered
is larger than that, he said, separate pieces of siding must be
used. That results in visible seams where the individual sections
overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Seamless siding, on the other hand, comes on a roll, and can be
measured, formed and cut to the exact size needed by installers
working from a specially equipped truck at the client's house.
Since the siding material can be cut to any length of up to 150
feet long, overlaps are unnecessary and unsightly seams are
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cost is generally 15 to 20 percent higher than the cost of
vinyl,'' Winkler said, adding that ABC Seamless carries a lifetime
warranty on the material itself and a 20-year warranty against
defects in installation. Additional information may be obtained by
calling (800) 732-6577.
</P>
<P>
   Another intriguing product on exhibit at the show was ECO-Block
_ a product that provides a new way of building houses from
concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``ECO-Block provides a labor-saving, energy-efficient method of
building with concrete,'' said Bill Cotton, the owner of Cotton's
Concrete Foundations and Forms, a construction company based
Athens, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   With the ECO-Block system, Cotton said, a house starts out as a
hollow-walled shell made of expanded polystyrene foam. The shell is
constructed with 2{-inch-thick rectangular panels _ each about 4
feet wide and 16 inches high _ fastened into topless, bottomless,
open-ended ``blocks'' by using special connectors that create a 4-
to 12-inch-wide space between the facing panels.
</P>
<P>
   The blocks then are assembled to form the hollow-walled shell
and, after openings for windows and doors have been cut out of the
walls and fitted with frames, the shell becomes a mold, or form,
for the exterior walls of the finished structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just pour in the concrete,'' Cotton said.
</P>
<P>
   James Dorr, northeast region manager for ECO-Block, the Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., company that manufactures the product (its Web
site is www.eco-block.com), said that using polystyrene foam as the
form for the concrete had several advantages.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, unlike plywood _ the form material most commonly
used in concrete construction _ Eco-Block does not have to be
removed after the concrete has cured. Instead, Dorr said, the
2{-inch-thick foam serves as insulation on both the inner and outer
surface of the exterior walls, thereby cutting heating and cooling
costs and eliminating the need for additional insulation in the
exterior walls.
</P>
<P>
   He said, since Eco-Blocks have built-in nailing strips every
eight inches, it is possible to fasten virtually any standard
finish material to the interior and exterior walls _ including
sheetrock, paneling, siding, brickface or stucco. Moreover, he
said, electrical conduits and plumbing can be routed through the
interior face of the exterior walls _ without having to drill holes
through scores of framing studs _ simply by using a router or ``hot
knife'' to carve a channel in the polystyrene. Perimeter support
for interior floors, he said, is easily created by imbedding
galvanized ``joist hangers'' in the concrete walls.
</P>
<P>
   Dorr said the cost of building a concrete house using the
Eco-Block system typically runs only 1 to 2 percent more than
conventional construction methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when you're surrounded by six inches of concrete and five
inches of foam,'' he said, ``you just wouldn't believe how quiet a
house can be.''

   Little by little, Jeanette Antolin's quest to make it onto next
year's U.S. Olympic gymnastics team is gaining momentum. She has
already achieved her goal for this year _ making it onto the
Pan-American team _ and a recent performance earned her an
unexpected invitation to the American Cup next weekend in St.
Petersburg, Fla., the biggest international meet in the United
States and an event in which she will compete against top
international gymnasts.

many Americans may focus on Vanessa Atler, the 1997 co-national
champion, and Kristen Maloney, the current national champion,
Antolin will quietly continue her journey. She hopes to maintain or
improve her sixth-place national ranking. Only the top seven
gymnasts make the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   For Antolin, 17, of Paradise, Calif., being the underdog and
competing in someone else's shadow is nothing new. For a decade
that shadow belonged to her older sister, Katie.
</P>
<P>
   The two, who are 16 months apart, spent almost 11 years training
together and even competed for the United States at a meet in
France in 1993. While most of the attention was focused on Katie,
who was competing at the elite level at 13, Jeanette did not become
jealous. She instead became more motivated. ``It's not that I
wanted to beat her, I just wanted to get to her level,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Antolin never made it to the national team and stopped
competing for a few years after coming down with chronic back pain.
Her younger sister then began to shine, most recently at the Pan-Am
trials on Feb. 14 in Pomona, Calif., where she finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   As Katie watches Jeanette progress, there is sheer admiration
instead of bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``She definitely deserves to be in the place that she's in right
now,'' said Katie, 18, who knows firsthand how hard it is to train
at a world-class level. The older Antolin, who has resumed
competing, is attending Cal State-Fullerton on a full athletic
scholarship, even though she competes only on bars.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Jeanette Antolin's gymnastics unique is her
combination of ``flexibility and elegance mixed with strength and
power,'' said her coach, Don Peters. He coached five members of the
1984 Olympic team and came out of retirement to coach Antolin.
</P>
<P>
   Peters says his pupil is among the top gymnasts because she
enjoys competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``While other gymnasts say, `Darn, it's my turn,' Jeanette sees
the green flag is up and says, `Good, it's my turn,''' said Peters,
who was the national and Olympic team coach from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
   At 2, Katie Antolin was enrolled in recreational classes that
Jeanette later joined. What began as a hobby for the sisters soon
became their life's passion. With the girls quickly advancing
beyond the recreational level and with coaches telling their
parents the girls had a shot at some day going to the Olympics, it
was clear to Nola and Orlando Antolin that they had to give their
daughters a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving this level of skill has been a family effort for the
Antolins, who in 1991 moved from Paradise to Huntington Beach,
Calif., nine hours away, so their daughters could train at the
Scats gym, where the Pan-Am trials were held.
</P>
<P>
   It's a decision they have yet to regret, said Nola Antolin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been good for them,'' she said. ``They've done good in
school. They can use the skills they've learned in their lives.
They've done lots of traveling and met a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But being able to afford their daughters' gymnastics lessons and
traveling expenses has never been easy for the Antolins, who are
now divorced. From Day 1, Nola Antolin, who has a full-time job as
a secretary at a public school, has also worked part-time at Scats
to help defray costs of training there, and family members have
helped out when times got especially tough. Once Jeanette made the
national team, in 1995, the U.S. Gymnastics Federation began paying
for her training costs, but there are still traveling expenses to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   While there was a time when the entire family _ including
21-year-old brother Gilbert _ could watch all of Antolin's
competitions, that does not happen anymore because she now competes
mostly in Europe. At the Pan-Am trials two weeks ago, which were
held on the campus of California Polytechnic State University in
Pomona, Antolin felt lucky to have her own cheering section filled
with family, friends and teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Antolin has also attracted the attention of all the little girls
in her gym and has finally become used to their running out and
buying the same leotard she bought the day before in the gym's pro
shop. Not only does she enjoy getting the attention (``I love being
somebody everyone looks up to,'' she said), she also enjoys giving
her fans attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'll sign autographs after meets until her hands cramp,''
Peters said. Could Antolin be signing the word Olympian beside her
name? Her family and friends think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at her and say, `We're this close,''' her father said.
While that distance was once measured by the space between his
outstretched hands, now it's marked by the space between his
fingers.

REAL ESTATE: FILLING IN DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN BRASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Jonathan Segal, an architect turned developer, says
he builds ``affordable urban boxes.'' In the last eight years, when
few others were building downtown, Segal completed seven of his
small loft and row-house developments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Segal's designs typically call for two- to three-story stucco
buildings, with compact living spaces, 18-foot ceilings, tall
windows and ``garden'' patios. ``I'm not designing for families,''
said the 36-year-old Segal. ``I'm designing for hip, urban
singles.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He is one of a small group of architects building creative
infill projects targeting younger residents who until
recently &QC; couldn't afford to live in downtown San Diego.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Segal's most recently completed project is Kettner Row, 16 row
houses in Little Italy, a 50-block neighborhood of warehouses,
offices and small restaurants on San Diego Harbor. Called
``convertible housing,'' the project is designed to allow the owner
to use the street level space as an office or studio. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The houses, with 1,280 to 1,800 square feet of space, sold as
soon as they were finished in 1998 for prices ranging from $190,000
to $265,000. The residents, mostly 25 to 40 years old, include a
lawyer, a real estate agent and an artist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scott Woods, a 38-year-old hotel consultant, rents one of the
row houses for $1,400 a month. Tired of commuting, he moved
downtown from the suburbs three years ago.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have one wall that's all glass,'' Woods said. ``I didn't
expect to find something like this in the middle of the city.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The redevelopment of Little Italy is an experiment for the
Centre City Development Corp., a city agency. It was the first time
the agency actively had sought more than one developer for a large
parcel. It approved a plan calling for seven architects to design
six separate housing projects in a little more than one block. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, with vacancy rates soaring and the area in a general
recession in the mid-90s the agency couldn't find builders able to
finance large projects downtown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to hit home runs during the recession with big
projects, and it just wasn't going to happen,'' said Peter Q.
Davis, chairman of the agency's board. ``So we had to go for
singles.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventional wisdom,'' said Michael Stepner, a longtime city
planner who is now dean of the New School of Architecture here,
explaining the redevelopment agency's yearning to tackle big
projects, ``was that the only way to get something done was to take
over an entire block and find one developer.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To help spur the development of Little Italy, the agency offered
developers discounts on city-owned land and it financed off-site
improvements, including sidewalks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some local residents initially criticized the modern designs for
not addressing the heritage of Little Italy, a community where
Italian immigrants first settled at the turn of the century. But
the architects argued that the area's roots were more closely
linked to the fishing fleet, which was once based at the foot of
the neighborhood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The last place I wanted to look for inspiration was Rome,''
said Ted Smith, one of the architects. ``I think the history of the
area was smaller buildings oriented to the waterfront.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith and his partner, Lloyd Russell, designed the Merrimac
Building, a three-story work-living loft project on a
5,000-square-foot lot around the corner from Kettner Row. It also
features a sharp box style, narrow spaces and tall windows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lofts of about 1,100 square feet in the Merrimac rent for $700
to $800 a month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have built 50 and they would have rented,'' Smith
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tenants are primarily artists, architects and graphic
designers who, like Smith, live and work in the building. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both Kettner Row and the Merrimac have won state and national
design awards and praise from fellow architects. In 1998 an
American Institute of Architects awards jury praised the new
downtown residential developments as ``bold'' and ``energetic.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say downtown is in the midst of a renaissance.
With no large projects built in the last five years, the average
resale price of condominiums downtown went from $248,000 to
$401,000, according to Market Profiles of San Diego, a research
firm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Development of the Gaslamp Quarter, with nightclubs and
restaurants, helped bring new vibrancy to downtown's nightlife. A
trolley system that began in 1981 links downtown to outlying areas,
including the United States-Mexico border. In 1997, the first large
supermarket opened downtown and last November voters approved a new
hotel and baseball stadium complex for the southeastern corner of
downtown. It will be home for the San Diego Padres. ``The decision
to live downtown is much easier today than it was even five years
ago,'' said Peter Reeb, a real estate analyst. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Real estate analysts talk about a phenomenon similar to ``a
switch being flipped'' downtown, in terms of builder interest in
developing residential units. In five years, the price of land in
Little Italy has jumped from $25 to $75 a square foot, Smith said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Segal has four downtown projects either under construction or
approved by the city. One calls for one of the city's oldest
taverns, the Waterfront bar in Little Italy, to be incorporated
into a loft project. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of Segal's new projects _ except for a three-unit
development that will include his own residence _ are designed to
rent. The vacancy rate for downtown rental units 2.3 percent,
according to the San Diego County Apartment Association. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The time's right for rentals; all the moons are aligned,''
Segal said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Davis of the redevelopment agency said downtown was entering a
new era in residential development.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first 22 years of redevelopment we did 4,000
residential units, and we'll probably do 4,000 in the next five
years,'' Davis said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His agency is once again looking for developers willing to take
over an entire block. Last year, his agency put out a request for
proposals to redevelop 12 sites in the waterfront Marina District,
the southwest corner of downtown near the San Diego Convention
Center. More than 30 proposals were received. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the redevelopment agency chose eight commercial and
residential plans including several covering entire blocks. The
projects, which are expected to be completed over the next three
years, will add 1,157 apartments and for-sale units to the existing
7,900 units downtown, according to Market Profiles of San Diego.

FINALLY IN THEATERS: THE $9.50 MOVIE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, N.J.)   By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The cost of a movie ticket at Loews, Cineplex Odeon
and Sony Theaters in New York City jumped to $9.50 Saturday _ the
highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, it's a little bit crazy,'' Matthew
Kehoe, 19, a Hunter College student, said of the new prices posted
at the box office of the Loews Village VII, where he was waiting to
see ``200 Cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other patrons confronted with the 3 percent to
8 percent price increase by Loews Cineplex Entertainment at 425
theaters in 22 states and Canada, Kehoe briefly debated the
alternative _ waiting six months to rent the video _ then plunked
down his money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kind of stick it to you because people love to see
films,'' Kehoe said. ``Parents aren't going to say to their kids,
we're not going to see this Disney movie because it's too
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Another patron, Greg Krelenstein, 19, of Marlboro, N.J., a
student at New York University, also paid up, but said the new
price ``definitely makes you more selective,'' and added: ``It's
unfair, especially being in a neighborhood where all the students
are. Nobody can afford $9.50 to see one movie.''
</P>
<P>
   As patrons at Loews Village VII paid, the ticket seller asked
each in turn: ``Would you like to make a donation to a needy
child?''
</P>
<P>
   No way, was the general reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of undiscounted adult movie tickets in New York City have
gone up steadily in the last five years, from $7.50 to $8 in 1994,
then to $8.50 in 1996 and $8.75 to $9 in 1997. Theater owners have
insisted that the increases have had little effect on patronage in
affluent markets like New York.
</P>
<P>
   Loews Cineplex Entertainment, the product of the merger of
Sony/Loews Theaters and the Cineplex Odeon Corp. in May 1998,
operates 2,900 screens in the United States, Canada and Europe,
including one third of those in the New York metropolitan area and
half of those in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Marc J. Pascucci, senior vice president for marketing, said
prices at most of the company's theaters in Manhattan increased to
$9.50 from $8.75, while those in the rest of the city, Long Island
and northern New Jersey, went to $8.50 from $8. He said the
increase was prompted by higher operating costs, but contended that
it was still an entertainment bargain.

STRAWBERRY MISSES PRACTICE AFTER REACTION TO CHEMOTHERAPY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ Darryl Strawberry skipped most of the Yankee
workout Saturday, saying he felt awful after undergoing
chemotherapy. Manager Joe Torre reiterated there is no pressure on
Strawberry to participate, and his first priority is for the
outfielder to ``get better'' and recover from colon cancer. ``I
told him, `Whenever you're ready to play, come tell us,''' Torre
said.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry hoped he would feel well to participate, the first
time he has tried to work out the day after chemotherapy. But he
felt ill when he woke up and did not eat breakfast. After
stretching under a hot sun at 10 a.m., Strawberry returned to the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take chemo, it's hard on your body,'' Strawberry, who
will have his next chemotherapy on March 12, said. ``I didn't know
how my body would react.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll let Darryl do what he wants to do,'' George
Steinbrenner, the principal owner who came out to watch batting
practice for the first time this spring, said.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, who refused to comment on the Yankees' recent
merger with the Nets, said it is natural to worry about how a team
performs the year after winning a championship. Guarding against
complacency, he said, ``is up to the manager and the coaching
staff. I don't think you have to convince these players _ I just
think you've got guys who really have a good chemistry.''

ALFONZO GOES TO SECOND, WHERE METS NEED HIM 
</HEADLINE>
  (as) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Edgardo Alfonzo would like to know what
the fuss is all about.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's not as if he hasn't played second base before.
He did it in 1994 when a phenom named Rey Ordonez was promoted from
Class A St. Lucie to Class AA Binghamton midway through the season.
Alfonzo had been the Binghamton shortstop, but he moved to second
to make room for Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly say that's what won a championship for us,''
said John Tamargo, who was then the Binghamton manager and is now
the Houston Astros' bullpen coach. ``Nothing got through the middle
of that infield. And Alfonzo ended up doing a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   He did such a great job that in 1995, Alfonzo made the jump from
Class AA to the major leagues. Over the next two seasons, he made
75 starts at second base for the Mets, but for the last two seasons
he played mostly at third base, where his defensive play was among
the best in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   But in their efforts to shore up the team's offense, the Mets
signed Robin Ventura for $32 million over the next four years.
Since Ventura plays third base, Alfonzo is back at second.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets asked Alfonzo if he was willing to make the switch, but
in truth they were making the move whether he liked it or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have changed our mind one way or the other,'' Mets
General Manager Steve Phillips said. ``We knew he'd play where we
needed him to play. Even if he was disappointed with it, he could
have at least felt that we valued his opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfonzo shrugged it all off. Never mind that at the end of last
season, he said he had become comfortable in his role at third
base. Or that last season's second baseman, Carlos Baerga, was one
of Alfonzo's best friends on the team.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets wanted him to play second, he would play second.
Alfonzo used to take grounders there last season during batting
practice, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So what if he played third base in Venezuela during winter ball?
He worked out at second every day before the games.
</P>
<P>
   It undoubtedly helped ease the transition when he was signed to
a four-year, $18.4 million deal with the Mets in the off season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the Mets if we're going to be a better team, I'll give
it a chance,'' Alfonzo said. ``I mean, I've played there before.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Ordonez have always played well together, too, dating
back to the days when they were first paired in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were immediately comfortable with one another,'' said
Phillips, who was the Mets' director of the minor leagues in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``They picked each other up,'' Tamargo said.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Alfonzo and Ordonez have six weeks to rekindle the
spark.
</P>
<P>
   There are some questions, however. First, Alfonzo has filled out
since his minor league days. That could cause some problems because
he might not be as flexible as he once was, and Ordonez delivers
the ball hard to second base. Given Alfonzo's history of back
problems, it remains to be seen how well he will stand up to
runners bearing down on him as he attempts to turn double plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets don't seem worried, however. Manager Bobby Valentine
has said that he has no doubts that Alfonzo will handle second
well. Ditto Phillips and Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Alfonzo has brought a ``what, me worry?'' attitude
into camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will only take a couple of days to get myself back again,''
Alfonzo said.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the Mets' infield will be formidable.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez has won the last two Gold Gloves at shortstop _ he said
last week that the only way he could improve was if he could learn
to retrieve a ball from the clouds _ and Ventura has won five at
third base. First baseman John Olerud is underrated but solid. He
joked that he may be this infield's weak link.
</P>
<P>
   If Alfonzo can pick up where he left off with Ordonez, the Mets
might find themselves with the most stingy infield in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with guys for years, you get a feel for them,'' said
Tamargo, who was also Alfonzo's winter league coach with Magallanes
in Venezuela for two seasons. ``But those guys were making plays
right off the bat. It was just a click from the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, the Mets are hoping things will click again. &QL;

HURWITZ REJECTS $450 MILLION REDWOODS DEAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn.: Calif.)  
(Eds.: Filed in ``a'' and ``f'' categories) 
 
By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pacific Lumber Co., the California logging
operation owned by Houston-based Maxxam, on Friday rejected a $450
million deal to preserve the largest stand of ancient redwood trees
left in private hands.
</P>
<P>
   The decision could well end an arduous, 2 1/2-year effort by
federal and California regulators to consummate an agreement with
Pacific Lumber and protect groves of redwood giants, some dating
back to the time of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton made a last-ditch effort to salvage the
negotiations, calling Maxxam Chief Executive Charles Hurwitz from
Air Force One on Thursday to discuss the deal, White House
spokeswoman Amy Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes this deal would be the best thing for
the company, the American people and the environment,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Houston financier could not be swayed. Pacific Lumber
President John Campbell said late Friday the proposals as
structured would have forced the company to drastically reduce the
amount of lumber it produces annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company was willing to make substantial concessions had an
overall agreement been reached that left the company economically
viable,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell did not reject out of hand the notion of negotiating
further this weekend, although the likelihood of a turnaround at
this juncture seems remote.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, in a prepared statement
released late Friday, said: ``I am sorry that the Pacific Lumber
Co. has decided to walk away from the Headwaters transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that this transaction would have been in the best
interests of both Pacific Lumber and the American public,'' Babbitt
added. ``I would have provided economic security for Pacific Lumber
by providing them with a road map for future harvests.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt vowed to vigorously enforce regulations to protect
endangered species that live in Pacific Lumber's woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who had been instrumental in
getting the parties this close to an agreement, said, ``I am deeply
disappointed that an environmentally sound agreement to preserve an
incredible natural resource and help retain thousands of jobs in
the region has been rejected by the company.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the fate of Pacific Lumber's damp and misty
Headwaters Forest, acres of towering redwood trees that, if left
unprotected, could someday become backyard decks and hot tubs.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said the company had no immediate plans to begin
logging in the old-growth redwood areas. Pacific Lumber officials
plan to meet Monday to figure out where to go from here. The
company could resurrect litigation against the government, accusing
it of using regulations to unfairly take control of private
property.
</P>
<P>
   The state and federal proposals would have created a 7,500-acre
preserve in exchange for $380 million in federal and state funds.
Congress has authorized nearly $250 million for the federal share,
but that funding will expire Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The California Legislature also had agreed to provide $112
million more to purchase an additional 2,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Of that money, $450 million would have gone to Pacific Lumber,
with the remainder going to another company and to the local
community.
</P>
<P>
   But as part of an agreement to purchase the property, state and
federal regulators wanted to impose a series of restrictions that
would have regulated Pacific Lumber's timber operations on its
remaining 211,700 acres for the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   One key restriction would have barred the company from logging
within 100 feet of fish-bearing streams and within 30 feet of other
waterways on the property.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions also would have banned logging operations in 12
areas set aside as conservation zones for the marbled murrelet, a
rare seabird protected under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   If Pacific Lumber were to violate these provisions, the company
would have been forced to pay 150 percent of the timber value for
trees cut down in the stream buffer zones and 250 percent of the
timber value for chopping down trees that serve as nesting areas
for the murrelet.
</P>
<P>
   Both California's Wildlife Conservation Board and Interior
Department officials approved the final sale proposals Thursday.
But the Maxxam and Pacific Lumber boards rejected them Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, which have battled with Hurwitz and
Pacific Lumber for years over the Headwaters Forest, expressed
disappointment at the company's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hurwitz would be very foolish to walk away from the table
at this point,'' said Jill Ratner, president of the Oakland,
Calif.-based Rose Foundation. ``The company is not going to get a
better deal. The areas that are off limits are not going to be open
to substantial logging, with or without this agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they'll keep talking, and I hope Mr. Hurwitz will come
to his senses,'' Ratner said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber has been cited numerous times in recent years for
violating California's rules governing logging. In November, the
company lost its logging license, forcing it to rely on contractors
to harvest timber.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental activists contend the company's record required
regulators to take a firm stance.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Prevention issued Pacific Lumber a conditional operator's license.
And Campbell, in a prepared statement, said the company is
determined to win back the confidence of regulators and the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not tolerate violations of forest practice rules,''
Campbell said. ``Every member of our compliance team has the power
to halt operations if there is a question or concern about
compliance.''

A number of things topsy-turvy in this NBA season
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Dale Robertson
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The coach was as straight-laced and upstanding as a man can be.
The only thing shocking about him was the natural silver color of
his hair. He had dedicated his life to his profession, that of
teaching basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The player, on the other hand, is covered in tattoos, has his
body pierced in myriad places, maintains a lifestyle that would
make Bacchus, or the Marquis de Sade, blush and says his only
remaining goal is to play an NBA game stark-naked.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, given the times, the team eagerly hired the
player and immediately fired the coach.
</P>
<P>
   I love this game.
</P>
<P>
   We sort of knew Del Harris and Dennis Rodman weren't going to be
Phil Jackson and Michael Jordan, didn't we? Bill Clinton would have
been a better fit on Ken Starr's team than the Worm was going to be
on Harris' Lakers. So Harris became the NBA's first post-lockout
coaching fatality a dozen games into the league's weirdest season
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder what color Del's distinguished 'do would have turned as
he tried to rein in Rodman? Alas, we'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the Rockets will get their first up-close viewing of the
new-look Lakers on Sunday after a short detour through British
Columbia. They're returning to the Great Western Forum three weeks
and two days after unsuccessfully launching their long-delayed
season there. Amazingly, the abbreviated campaign will be
one-fourth gone.
</P>
<P>
   And we won't know a heck of a lot more about what they've got
than we did Feb. 5. The Rockets were one of the most turned-over
teams in the NBA at the outset, with seven fresh faces _ three of
them rookie guards. And their growth process has been uneven to say
the least, particularly since Charles Barkley lasted only five
starts before hobbling off with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   So if they can't be sure who or what they are, how can we
possibly expect to?
</P>
<P>
   Cuttino Mobley is potential star material. That we've seen.
Michael Dickerson might be, too. The Cat and the Doctor (M.D. _ get
it?) could be franchise anchors well into the future, although
they've both shown the consistency of a Rodman news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Bryce Drew, the other new kid, is as lost as he can be,
although, oddly, he's no more fogged in than third-year pro Matt
Maloney, who has played himself into oblivion as though he were
allergic to his fat new contract. See, money can't always buy
happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Rudy Tomjanovich's denials, it's obvious the point will
have much to say about where the Rockets are ultimately pointed.
One concerned veteran has mused: ``If we don't get that position
straightened out, we're wasting our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a number of the league's other would-be lords have
behaved more like laggards as well. With the aforementioned Lakers
and San Antonio scuffling along in .500 land, the reconstructed
Rockets aren't being trampled by a runaway pack. Tomjanovich can _
and does, readily _ contend that, because of all the changes, his
lads should still be stutter-stepping.
</P>
<P>
   Which, nonetheless, doesn't explain the disinterested effort of
Thursday night against the Hawks. That wasn't the result of a
chemistry problem. It was purely biological. The Rockets' heart
took the evening off.
</P>
<P>
   There's no surprise the early Finals favorites appear to be Utah
and Indiana. Had the Jazz started the season in June, it would have
been hitting all the right notes. Karl Malone and John Stockton
could come off life support and execute the pick-and-roll perfectly
straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   As for the similarly intact Pacers, they held the most organized
lockout workouts of anybody and were thus way ahead of the
competition on opening night. That they started a hesitant 4-3 was
a huge surprise, but a recent five-game winning streak indicates
they're beginning to build momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The goofiness seems to have given small boosts to dregs
Vancouver, Dallas, Denver _ all, unfortunately, Midwest rivals of
the Rockets _ plus Milwaukee, Philly and Toronto. The grandest
irony, of course, has been the first two teams to hit double digits
in defeats were the Clippers and the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Business as usual in the Clip joint; tragi-comedy in the
no-longer-United Center, where Chicago hasn't managed a victory in
six tries. The Sixers deep-sixed the Bulls by 18 in the ruined
temple Thursday night. Were this to be a full season, these poor
unlova-Bulls would be a serious threat to lose 72 games.
</P>
<P>
   With that dynasty in ruins, the '99 NBA race is a total
crapshoot, a phrase that also addresses the number of balls
clanking off rims from coast to coast. The pro game's offensive
elements never have been in a deeper funk, and it's not just
defensive dedication causing the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   But surely the Worm's return will make everything right again.

Ward looks bound for minors again
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Fran Blinebury
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ For two years now, Daryle Ward has been the
Bigfoot of the Astros organization, an out-of-focus figure in a
grainy photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Man or beast or myth?
</P>
<P>
   Large footprints have been left at the Class AA and AAA levels
in Jackson (Miss.) and New Orleans the past two seasons, with Ward
hitting a combined .317 with 42 home runs and 186 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet so few outside those minor-league outposts ever have had so
much as a glimpse of Ward, who was acquired by the Astros in
December 1996 as part of the package that also brought Brad Ausmus,
Jose Lima, Trever Miller and C.J. Nitkowski from Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks with the big club a year ago when Jeff Bagwell was
sidelined with a laceration in his right knee and only four plate
appearances as a pinch hitter. Then Ward disappeared back into the
woods, where the gossip mill at times turns him into a legendary
figure among radio talk-show callers.
</P>
<P>
   Big stick, big power, big future. Or big bust?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably just not a fit on our ballclub,'' Astros general
manager Gerry Hunsicker said candidly.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is Ward _ at 6-2 and kindly listed at only 230
pounds on the roster _ is big, too big, to be considered much of an
athlete anywhere but at first base or in the batter's box. And the
Astros, of course, are well-situated with Bagwell on the right
corner of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   There have been experiments with Ward in left field, and the
conclusion is as an outfielder he makes a decent first baseman.
Good hands. He'll usually catch what's thrown at him. But little
mobility to either direction.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Ward, 23, is an American League player trapped
in a National League organization, a prospect whose only future to
make a real impact in the game is likely as a designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question at all in my mind or in most of the
people in our organization that this kid can hit at the
major-league level,'' Hunsicker said. ``In truth, I like this kid's
bat better than I like (Mitch) Meluskey's. And you know what we
think of Meluskey, since we traded away our starting catcher from
the last two years and are giving him a chance to win the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward's problem is actually twofold. Bagwell, of course, is going
no place, except likely on to another season of hitting .300 and
driving in 100 runs for the Astros. And Ward has failed to make
progress with his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daryle is a lot like Meluskey was in that his mindset is that
he's a good-enough hitter for his bat to carry him to the
major-league level,'' Hunsicker said. ``We've talked to him and
told him that wasn't going to be the case. Meluskey, it seems, got
the message. He worked hard to improve his defense last year, and
now it looks like he's ready to make a place for himself in
Houston. With Daryle, there hasn't been any indication of that kind
of development.''
</P>
<P>
   Which would seem to make Ward a candidate to be traded to an
American League team. Except each time Hunsicker might be tempted
to do that, he is reined in by his own philosophy, which has been
to make sure the front-line players for the two-time NL Central
champ Astros are backed up by sufficient depth.
</P>
<P>
   That point has been hammered home in the early part of this camp
with the loss of Moises Alou for the majority, if not all, of the
season with a torn ACL. What if Hunsicker had given in to the
temptation to ship young Richard Hidalgo to Toronto in order to
reel in Roger Clemens? Rather than a solid outfield lineup of
Hidalgo, Carl Everett and Derek Bell and the confidence they can
maintain, the Astros would be scrambling to patch a huge hole.
</P>
<P>
   It might be tempting to try to trade for a prospect who looks
like a better fit right now, but a significant part of a general
manager's job is to prepare for the worst. So Ward waits,
impatiently, maybe less than fairly. He is like infielder Russ
Johnson, capable of playing for somebody in the majors but needed
as insurance for a team that wants to contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're one significant injury (to Bagwell) away from him being
a factor on our team,'' Hunsicker said. ``It's part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   A year from now, the Astros will move into the Ballpark at Union
Station. With a cozy (315 feet) left field and grass, the balls
down the line that would now go by Ward on the turf at the
Astrodome for triples might well be playable.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, top 1997 draft pick Lance Berkman will probably be
ready to take a spot in the outfield next season.
</P>
<P>
   Which would leave Ward's future with the Astros right back in
the same spot, like Bigfoot, out of place, out of focus, out of
time.

 AILING KNICKS HAVE NO TIME TO REST 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Mich. _ Of all the New York Knicks, Patrick Ewing
looked as fresh as a blossom next to his withering teammates Friday
night in Boston. This aging center with knees as worn as bald tires
was still standing after logging 82 minutes of playing time in a
48-hour stretch.
</P>
<P>
   He was the lucky one. Charlie Ward was gathering his things in
one corner of the locker room, holding a chunk of ice over the
blood-shot, swollen right eye he received from a finger poke in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Larry Johnson was grimacing from tendinitis as
he slipped on his left shoe. Behind a door, Knicks coach Jeff Van
Gundy was alternating sweats with chills while being treated for a
stomach flu after the Knicks' 94-80 loss to the Celtics in Boston,
a defeat that came 24 hours after the Knicks' overtime victory
against visiting Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there is no rest for what ails them.
</P>
<P>
   The fire drill continues with an afternoon game against the
Detroit Pistons on Sunday. Instead of sleeping in Saturday, the
Knicks taped themselves up and practiced for a game that will mark
the beginning of their first three-games-in-three-days stretch of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way the NBA is today,'' Ewing said. ``You have to
suck it up to win. You can't worry about being tired. If you have
to play, you have to play.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks (8-4) have to use rubber bands and paper clips to
hold themselves together for this next exhausting push, that's what
they'll do to keep pace with the rest of the Eastern Conference.
Other teams have already begun to experience the grind of the
unrelenting schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Knicks have had it easy. In their first 12 games,
only five were on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Once away from home, the Knicks have struggled. Three of their
losses have been away from the cozy comfort of Madison Square
Garden. And in those three defeats, the opposition has made a
mockery of the Knicks' league-best defense. Orlando, Cleveland and
Boston all walked away with 90-point games and double-digit
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find a way to change that pattern,'' Marcus Camby
said. ``We've been playing excellent at home, but we haven't been
able to do it on the road. Sunday, it's like a must-win game for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   To start their dreaded three-games-in-three-nights tour with a
victory, the Knicks have to cut the common threads of their three
road losses.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, they have been out-rebounded and have averaged 19
turnovers per loss. Second-chance points and mistakes have been
their undoing. In a season as fatigue-inducing as this one, a
talented Knicks team that relies on outworking opponents to win is
particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said it the other night, we get away with things out there
because of our talent,'' said Chris Childs, referring to how the
Knicks beat Minnesota even though they were badly out-rebounded.
``But if you just have talent against a team that outworks you,
you're not going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons have been suspect in their work habits, a fact that
has irritated Grant Hill. After a week of bickering,
finger-pointing and a five-game slide _ which included a dreadful,
78-69 loss at the Garden on Feb. 15 _ the Pistons have soothed
their dysfunction with four victories in their last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the ball better and leaning on Joe Dumars more, the
Pistons are just waiting to make amends for their sloppy effort
against the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Only Hill, who scored 31 points, hit double figures for Detroit.
Back then, the Knicks had a healthy glow about them. Now, that has
faded. One look at Johnson will tell you.
</P>
<P>
   After a 22-point effort against Minnesota on Thursday, Johnson's
tendinitis flared up in Boston and left him nearly frozen on the
court. He scored only three points and revealed how this tug-of-war
with his knee could last all year. He has been healthy one day,
hampered the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope not, but it was a problem this time,'' said Johnson,
who shot 1 of 5 against Boston. ``It was more when I sat down after
the initial start of the game. I was loose to start out with, but
once I sat down, I couldn't move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's especially frustrating when you lose like we did to
Boston. If you win, it's all right to have a tough night. When
you're losing, you really want to help your team. I've got to do
what I've got to do. I've got to fight through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and his teammates will start that fight Sunday.

MACLEAN ALSO AILING FOR RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RYE, N.Y. _ There were two lockers that were full of equipment
left intact at the Rangers' practice here Saturday, those belonging
to Wayne Gretzky and John MacLean.
</P>
<P>
   There was no surprise about the absence of Gretzky, who missed
his first game as a member of the Rangers on Friday night with a
bulging disc in his neck that will sideline him for at least two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But where was MacLean? He scored the last two goals in Friday
night's 3-0 victory over Phoenix, which Gretzky watched from a
luxury box above the Madison Square Garden ice.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, MacLean may be aching in the same area as
Gretzky, who missed his first game after playing 223 in a row for
the Rangers. MacLean had a magnetic resonance imaging test on his
neck Saturday afternoon. Pain there has forced him to miss
practices in recent weeks, though he has not missed any games, just
as Gretzky did not before Friday night despite being in pain for
months. It remains to be seen if MacLean will be able to play in
Sunday's home game against the Philadelphia Flyers and Eric
Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   Coach John Muckler tried to explain MacLean's ailment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has spasms up here,'' Muckler said, pointing to his neck,
``and he missed practice for precautionary reasons. He'll have an
MRI later today to see what is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   MacLean had his MRI in White Plains early Saturday afternoon and
the Rangers were expecting the results in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Rangers were adjusting to life without Gretzky.
Muckler said Saturday that his team would have to change its style,
paying more attention to defense before creating offense. That is
another way of saying the Rangers will employ the neutral zone
trap.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers emphasized defense before creating offense in the
victory over Phoenix on Friday night, and Muckler was extremely
pleased with the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the greatest job of the year for us,'' Muckler
said of the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler would not say that Sunday's clash with the Flyers would
be the strongest test of character yet for his team, but he
admitted that Lindros and John LeClair would present a huge problem
because ``they're the best in the business down low.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler said that Petr Nedved would shoulder most of the
responsibility of playing against Lindros, but the defensemen who
match up against Lindros are just as important. Muckler indicated
he would go with Brian Leetch and Ulf Samuelsson as his two
defensemen against Lindros and his line.

STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN A NEIGHBORHOOD LENDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With only a handmade sign taped to its storefront
window, the Central Brooklyn Federal Credit Union looks more like
the delis and discount stores on Fulton Street than a financial
institution. It has irregular hours, and when it is open, customers
are not allowed to withdraw cash. The cash machine works, but the
credit union has not issued any cards.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience, however, is not the reason that Central Brooklyn's
2,700 members have remained loyal. Founded six years ago by two
home-grown Ivy League graduates, Central Brooklyn became nationally
recognized as the fastest-growing black-owned urban credit union in
the country. Welfare mothers and homeless people opened accounts,
as did doctors, lawyers and merchants. Central Brooklyn, in return,
provided loans in struggling neighborhoods ignored by most banks.
</P>
<P>
   One of a handful of credit unions chartered in low-income areas
in the early 1990s, including one that opened in South Central Los
Angeles after the 1992 riots, Central Brooklyn made for a tidy
urban fairy tale of downtrodden people empowering themselves, and
its young founders were invited to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But the fairy tale did not last. Central Brooklyn's heady
beginning gave way to nagging deficits and, finally, a federal
takeover. Now, after a 15-month conservatorship, regulators must
decide Central Brooklyn's fate.
</P>
<P>
   For its members, Central Brooklyn is particularly important
because of banks' history of neglecting the poor. With less than $4
million in deposits, the credit union is a speck compared with even
small financial institutions. But for the minority neighborhoods it
serves, Central Brooklyn represents a measure of
self-determination, and its members have organized petition drives
and protest groups to regain ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a great interest in it,'' said Monifa Akinwole, a
Bedford-Stuyvesant resident who has led one of the petition drives.
``The institution addressed the needs of the community, which the
banks hadn't done.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise, fall and uncertain future of Central Brooklyn is a
reminder not only of how few financial institutions choose to
aggressively serve poor urban neighborhoods, but also of the
undeniable difficulties faced by those that do.
</P>
<P>
   The credit union's problems also raise questions about the
federal agency that oversees Central Brooklyn and whether it is
willing to, or even should, nurture small institutions that serve
low-income areas that other banks largely ignore.
</P>
<P>
   For members of Central Brooklyn, the fundamental issue now is
control. By March 23, a newly formed board of credit union members
must present a business plan to regulators. At least two other
larger credit unions are expected to submit competing merger
proposals. Members fear that an outside institution might not heed
the credit union's original mission of community reinvestment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very exciting notion, and still is, the idea that we
would have our own funding institution, the idea that we could have
our own economic engine in the neighborhood,'' said Mark Winston
Griffith, 35, the Brown University graduate who helped found the
credit union and became its first chairman.
</P>
<P>
   National studies continue to show that black people are denied
home and business loans far more often than white people. A 1998
National Bureau of Economic Research study showed that black-owned
businesses were 2.4 times more likely to be denied a loan than
white-owned companies. A 1998 study by the low-income housing
advocacy coalition Acorn found that black applicants for home loans
in New York City were rejected 2.3 times more often than white
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Griffith was working on community
revitalization projects for a nonprofit agency. He and a friend,
Errol Louis, a Harvard graduate, began to organize Central Brooklyn
to serve Crown Heights, Brownsville, Bedford-Stuyvesant and other
minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The two men evaluated the 14 banks serving central Brooklyn and
found that they spent only 7.5 cents in home loans for every dollar
deposited. Then, in November 1991, federal regulators closed
Freedom National Bank, a Harlem-based black-owned savings bank that
had a branch in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped us draw this picture that we were a neighborhood and
a people under siege,'' Griffith said. ``We were being stripped of
any ability to build wealth and build the economic infrastructure
of our neighborhood. What was really appealing about Central
Brooklyn Federal Credit Union was that it would be owned by the
people who were its shareholders, its customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit unions must be formed around a group of people with a
commonality, such as geography, employment or membership in some
sort of association. In the case of Central Brooklyn, the pool of
potential customers was the 750,000 residents of central Brooklyn's
low-income minority neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Federally chartered in January 1993, Central Brooklyn became an
instant success. Large banks like Chase, Chemical and
Manufacturer's Hanover pledged ``nonmember'' deposits.
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, membership had risen to 1,000 people, then passed 5,000
by 1996 as deposits exceeded $5 million. It cost $5 to join, and
members were required to keep a minimum balance of only $10. The
credit union made loans as large as $10,000, and as small as $150
to a homeless man for a security deposit on an apartment. The
symbolic high point came in May 1994, when Central Brooklyn moved
into a bank branch in Bedford-Stuyvesant donated by Chemical Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith and Louis were featured in national publications and
appeared on public television's `` McNeil/Lehrer News Hour.'' They
met with Vice President Al Gore at the White House. But hints of
trouble emerged in 1995 when Central Brooklyn failed to pay a
dividend. Budget deficits began to follow. Regulators began
applying pressure.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Louis, who oversaw daily operations, said Central
Brooklyn grew too fast and tried to do too much. A staff of tellers
accepted utility payments, sold money orders and subway tokens,
cashed checks and offered youth accounts _ consumer-friendly but
unprofitable services.
</P>
<P>
   Expenses spiraled out of control, and a plan to compete with
check-cashing shops failed miserably. But most of all, Central
Brooklyn's loan portfolio, the centerpiece of its empowerment
mission, lost money as low-income customers fell behind on
payments.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, after Central Brooklyn's deficit surpassed
$360,000, the three-member board of the National Credit Union
Administration placed the credit union under conservatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Lesia Bullock, an agency spokeswoman, said there were no
allegations of criminal wrongdoing. But regulators faulted Central
Brooklyn's management for inadequate bookkeeping and high expenses,
for not being careful enough with its loans, and for failing to
aggressively collect them.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the conservatorship infuriated the credit union's
board, which had approved a plan to address the problems and to
sell its branch building because it had become too expensive to
operate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community should have been given the time and space to
work out its problems,'' said Clifford Rosenthal, executive
director of the National Federation of Community Development Credit
Unions, an industry association group. ``We thought the credit
union and its community board of directors had developed strategies
to correct the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in control, regulators drew more criticism. They reduced
office hours and prohibited cash withdrawals. (To withdraw money, a
member must go to Central Brooklyn, have a teller write a check,
then cash it at another financial institution.)
</P>
<P>
   Central Brooklyn was billed $3,000 a week to pay for a
Boston-based consultant and would pay him more than $80,000. The
branch building was hastily sold for $250,000, a price that was
less than members hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   The transition from the branch building to Central Brooklyn's
current location two blocks away, on Fulton Street between Bedford
Avenue and Franklin Avenue, was handled so clumsily that many
depositors were not notified and could not find it. The deficit,
meanwhile, has risen above $500,000 under conservatorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, the sinister interpretation is that they are
deliberately bleeding the institution and making it more difficult
to save,'' said Louis, 36, now a consultant who works with large
corporations seeking to do business in the inner city. (One of his
clients is The New York Times.) ``A less sinister interpretation,
and probably more accurate, is that they are finding it very hard
to run a banking institution in the inner city. Surprise,
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman D'Amours, chairman of the National Credit Union
Administration, said conservatorship allowed Central Brooklyn to
correct ``record-keeping errors,'' shrink itself to a more
manageable size and, for the first time, register three consecutive
profitable months.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amours called the consultant's fee ``an off-putting number,''
but he attributed the increased deficit to existing problems. He
acknowledged that two larger credit unions outside the neighborhood
would like to merge with Central Brooklyn but said, ``Our primary
aim is to return the credit union to its members.'' Last week, the
agency granted members an extension until March 23 to prepare their
business plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency is politically divided, and Central Brooklyn's
members are concerned. The agency charters and regulates 7,900
federal credit unions and insures their deposits, as well as the
deposits of 4,200 state-chartered credit unions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, D'Amours, regarded as a friend to
institutions like Central Brooklyn, told a House subcommittee that
his agency should encourage the chartering of new small credit
unions that serve low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   But the two other board members, Yolanda Townsend Wheat and
Dennis Dollar, testified that the agency's obligation is to protect
its insurance fund by promoting the growth of large credit unions
that are more stable. Such a 2-to-1 split could mean problems for
Central Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very serious concerns that NCUA has stepped up its
campaign of merging these credit unions, particularly the smaller
ones,'' said Rosenthal. At least two of the other small credit
unions founded during the early 1990s have been taken over by other
credit unions.
</P>
<P>
   Central Brooklyn's members created a seven-member board earlier
this month to carry out the new business plan. Louis and Griffith
continue to play unofficial roles, but they are not board members,
partly because of their tense relationship with regulators. Akilah
Pannigan, a former IBM employee and the new chairman, said the new
board would run the institution very cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We envision initially a creep-before-you-walk attitude that
says, `We're going to do this slowly, but we're going to do it
right,'' Ms. Pannigan said.
</P>
<P>
   For Griffith, the return of the institution is critical. He
vividly remembers the loans that failed, but also loans that helped
an elderly woman pay for her husband's funeral or helped a homeless
man get an apartment. He and Louis say they realize that they made
mistakes, if well-intentioned ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We served a lot of people who couldn't go anywhere else, but
there is a price to pay for all those expectations,'' Griffith
said. ``The bottom line is you can't do everything.''

TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE BOND MARKETS IS GIVING EXPERTS FITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the strange things happening in the financial markets,
the recent behavior of interest rates is perhaps the weirdest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After January's Consumer Price Index reading last week showed
the 12-month inflation rate at only 1.7 percent, the 30-year
Treasury bond yield spent most of this week heading for heights not
seen since last summer. Although inflation is nil, those seeking
haven in the safest security known to humankind have begun
demanding an inflation premium way out of line with what current
reality would seem to require. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you accept the textbook theory that the natural rate of
interest is 3 percent, which is the return investors would require
in the absence of any inflation, the purchasing-power protection
being demanded lately by long Treasury investors is remarkable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What makes it all the more remarkable is how the prospect of
deflation is starting to seriously focus the minds of increasing
numbers of economists, financial analysts and pundits. After an
entire generation has come of age conditioned to fear inflation,
the world suddenly finds itself increasingly anxious over the
possibility of declining prices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those with vivid memories of deflation's destructive power are
those old enough to have experienced its consequences during the
Great Depression of the '30s. More than six decades later, most
still shudder when they ponder those bad old days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While deflation remains a question mark for the long term, the
short-term consequences of a slumping bond market mean trouble for
the stock market because bond prices and rates move in opposite
directions. As bond prices fall, the rising yield makes them more
competitive with stocks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a veteran money manager told The Wall Street Journal this
week, either bond prices have to go back up, which will bring
yields back down, or stock prices will go down. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since inflation shouldn't be a cause for concern, what is
driving the bond market? Conventional wisdom apparently holds that
stronger-than-expected U.S. economic growth late last year is
responsible. With the economy so hot, analysts say, it's unlikely
the Federal Reserve will act to further reduce interest rates even
though most of the rest of the world is struggling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Friday's revelation of a fourth-quarter growth pace for
the U.S. economy stronger than earlier estimated ignited rumors
that the Fed might even raise interest rates. This, of course, is
possible, but doesn't seem probable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given the fragile state of the global economy, such a move would
be psychologically devastating to world markets. The reason? It
would intensify fears of deflation because America is the only
engine of growth for many of the world's most depressed economies.
Any Fed policy move that would diminish U.S. demand for foreign
goods would be seen as a threat to global economic stability and a
contributor to further risk in countries already on the
deflationary brink. Adding to such worries is a rising trade
deficit, which raises political barriers to sound economic
policy-making. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other words, all the economic variables have converged at one
of those confounding junctures guaranteed to give market experts
fits. &QL;

IOWA COURT WON'T LET PRISONER DISCONTINUE DIALYSIS TREATMENTS

<P>
   Jerrell Brown's kidneys are shot. So is, by a psychiatrist's
estimation, his tolerance for life-saving dialysis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But as an inmate in a Des Moines jail, Iowa's high court ruled
Friday, he can't just quit. At least not yet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jailers can now require Brown _ by force, if necessary _ to
submit to the dialysis treatments that filter toxins from his
blood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Brown refused to be taken from the Polk County
Jail to Iowa Lutheran Hospital. His keepers challenged that refusal
in court, but a district judge Thursday ruled he could not be
forced to take the treatment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friday the Iowa Supreme Court agreed with the jailers, issuing a
temporary order allowing forced dialysis at least until a hearing
that is scheduled March 16. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old Brown, meantime, has remained short of precise
in explaining why he wants to stop dialysis. Without it, his
doctors say, he'd likely be dead within a week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is not at all concerned about death,'' said Des
Moines psychiatrist Michael Taylor, who spoke with Brown at length
before testifying that the inmate understood the choice he was
making. ``And he's not trying to kill himself....He is tired of the
situation he's in.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brown has been in jail since his arrest on a felony crack
cocaine charge since Dec. 16. His trial has been scheduled April 12
and his bond placed at $36,000. If convicted, he could be sentenced
to eight to 25 years in prison. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If he lives that long. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chronic high blood pressure ruined Brown's kidneys. He had been
undergoing dialysis treatments for a little over a year before his
arrest. He needs three to four hours of dialysis three times a week
to stay alive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As usual on Monday, deputies transported him from the jail to
the hospital on Monday in handcuffs and leg shackles wearing a
prison-issue green jumpsuit. But when guards came for him on
Wednesday, he refused to go. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a culmination of things,'' said Tom Berg, the attorney
assigned to represent Brown in his dialysis fight. ``It's a
multitude of factors.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outside jail, about 200,000 Americans rely on dialysis. And
sometimes, especially when their overall health deteriorates, they
quit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association of Kidney Patients, 7
percent of patients 65 or older voluntarily end their dialysis each
year. But in Brown's age group, only 0.7 percent of those between
20 and 44 years old choose to stop their treatments each year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said Brown had only missed an occasional treatment before
being locked up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue with him was that he was not trusted to go to
dialysis on his own,'' Taylor said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In jail, of course, that responsibility was not his, but that of
his jailers. ``He understood that,'' Brown said. ``He just didn't
like it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also said Brown felt humiliated by going to the hospital
under guard. The psychiatrist said Brown understands the great
danger of passing up treatment _ electrolytes build up in the body,
fluids aren't flushed, serum potassium causes irregular heart
beats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Polk County Attorney Michael O'Meara argued the state
has an interest in stopping inmates from killing themselves, in
part so they can try defendants on criminal charges. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a responsibility to do everything we can to preserve
this person's life,'' O'Meara said. After the court order Friday,
Brown went to the hospital for dialysis without resistance. ``We're
still holding out hope that Mr. Brown, when he realizes the concern
people have for his welfare, will have a change of heart.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taylor thinks that is unlikely. He said Brown seemed unworried
what his death would mean to his wife or two pre-teen daughters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``His father passed away when Jerrell was in his early 20s and,
in his words, Jerrell `got over it.' He felt his daughters would
`get over it' as well,'' the psychiatrist said. ``The most notable
thing about talking to him is his amazing lack of concern about the
whole situation.'' &QL;

SENSING AN IMAGE PROBLEM, AARP DITCHES FULL NAME IN FAVOR OF
ACRONYM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Steve Rivkin turned 50 two years ago, an irksome little
letter landed in his mailbox. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He'd had an inkling it would show up. When it did, he looked at
it with contempt and then tossed it unread, unopened, into the
trash. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It read: ``Dear friend, forget everything you've heard about
AARP being just for retired people. That couldn't be further from
the truth. As a matter of fact, life is just beginning at age
50.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rivkin, the president of a marketing firm in New Jersey, agrees
with the life-at-50 statement. But to him and three out of four
other baby boomers who have turned 50 since Jan. 1, 1996, AARP
might as well mean RIP. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though almost half of all Americans over 50 belong to AARP, only
one-quarter of eligible baby boomers do, 50 being the age of
eligibility. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AARP officials, distraught and discouraged at being shunned by
the boomers, a few months ago changed its name from American
Association of Retired Persons to just AARP. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning behind the shortening? To lose the word
``retired,'' because people hardly ever retire at 50. In fact, many
boomers expect to work well past ``retirement'' age of 65. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've listened to people say that AARP is rocking chairs and
old retired people,'' said Carola Wilson of AARP. ``People in their
50s think, `AARP isn't for me, it's for my parents.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But changing its name to AARP instead of something that embraces
boomers and still appeals to existing members might go down as one
of the biggest marketing bungles ever, some experts say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Their solution to the problem made it worse,'' says marketing
expert James R. Rosenfield, a member of AARP. ``There's only one
good explanation for creating a solution that makes the problem
worse _ being stupid and myopic.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he continued, ``AARP is the world's worst acronym _ it
sounds like a dog barking, like aarp, aarp!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For AARP, there's a lot at stake. Since Jan. 1, 1996, almost 7
million boomers have turned 50. By the end of 2014, all 78 million
boomers will have hit the big five-oh. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But just because they're 50-plus doesn't mean they'll act like
it. Many boomers seem to have developed a sort of
Peter-Pan-into-perpetuity complex. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Face it. Have Americans ever seen so many retain-your-youth
products and procedures proliferating over the airwaves, in
magazines and in newspapers? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgery procedures are more popular than ever. Sales of
skin creams, cosmetics, suntan lotions, hair-coloring products and
vitamins are exploding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of these attitudes, Hallmark has developed birthday
cards like the one that reads: ``It's your 50th birthday. Party
like two 25-year-olds.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of the I-don't-want-to-grow-old attitudes
abound. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One recent survey found that the typical boomer believes old age
begins at 79. And as an article in /{American Demographics/} notes,
boomers will ``push the threshold of the traditional `mature'
market into older and older age groups.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some boomers in the 30-plus crowd already reject the term
middle-aged _ they're not middle-aged, they insist, they're just
mid-youth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AARP-alternative organizations are popping up, many on the
Internet. One, the National Association of Baby Boomers, or NABB,
touts itself as the antithesis of AARP. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To quote: ``In many respects, we stand in direct opposition to
the points of view espoused by the American Association of Retired
Persons. NABB intends to become an advocate for members of our
generation. We wish to preserve the caliber of our lives.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson of AARP insists its organization is relevant to
boomers and many others over 50. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we're looking to expand our benefits and have the
most up-to-date offerings, the kinds of services that boomers will
be interested in,'' Wilson said. ``Already, we have a lot that we
think can be helpful to boomers like discounts, tips on healthy
living and caregiving.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But even its own marketing puts the negative before the
positive. For instance, one AARP mailing reads: ``Experience tells
us this may not be the most welcome piece of mail you ever
received. Just one of the most useful.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And then there's that pesky acronym, says Rivkin, who
specializes in analyzing and creating corporate names. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rivkin says AARP chose the same dubious route that Kentucky
Fried Chicken did when it rechristened itself KFC to get away from
the fear-of-fat word, fried. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they're going to camouflage themselves and get away
from an inappropriate name,'' Rivkin said. ``But in our language
all of us grow up understanding that initials stand for something,
so we begin translating backwards.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rivkin points out that GE, AT&AMP;T and IBM successfully made the
transition from a full name to a set of initials, ``but it took
literally years and billions of impressions.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And while Tom Otwell of AARP insists people refer to the
organization by its individual initials, Rivkin doubts that
assertion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A. A. R. P. has four syllables, AARP one,'' Rivkin said. ``And
not a very pleasant one _ it's very guttural, not at all soft.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The solution, Rivkin said, should have been something entirely
new. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have been a new name with a new identity,'' he said.
``That's the real answer, not a masquerade of initials.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Scott Aylward, president of advertising agency
Barkley Evergreen &AMP; Partners in Kansas City, isn't surprised by
boomers' aversion to AARP. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They're selling a product that people want to be in denial
about,'' Aylward said. ``Probably nothing that happens to you when
you turn 50 makes you feel older than when you receive that
letter.'' &QL;

INVENTOR BECOMES CELEBRITY BY BUILDING SMALL TRACTORS FROM
SCRATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Kan. _ The road to glory is pocked with unexpected
terrors that strain both wisdom and resolve. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Dennis Franz, a lifelong resident of this one-time cattle
town north of Wichita, faced such an ordeal in 1988 when the pilot
light in his steam-powered car burned out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The danged thing just wouldn't relight,'' said Franz, 55, a
very large and powerful-looking man known in Newton for building
all manner of odd and wonderful things, particularly very small
tractors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pilot-light disaster happened on Independence Day that year,
as Franz neared 12,000 feet on the side of Pikes Peak in Colorado. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was driving a perfect reproduction of a Stanley Steamer, an
old-time automobile. He had built the car from scratch, working 40
hours a week in his spare time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now he was testing his creation in the famous Pikes Peak auto
climb. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But everything went wrong,'' he told his hometown newspaper,
/{The Newton Kansan/}. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``An absolute and perfect fiasco,'' he added last week. ``The
car boiled over, the battery went dead, and then the pilot light
quit on me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all depressed,'' said Franz's middle daughter, Robin
Gay. But at that dark moment she struck a match to her father's
heart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let the mountain beat us,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Franz, who has spent his life solving mechanical problems, was
so moved by her words that he hauled it home, rebuilt it and headed
west again toward triumph. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back in August, and what a sight it was,'' Gay said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There was Dad, chugging up that mountain all alone, steam
billowing out of his car in the cold air. At the top, a crowd
gathered around clapping and cheering.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That applause ratified Gay's sense that her father was a most
unusual man, a link, no less, in the great chain of grease-covered
wizards who have long made rural America a breeding ground for
mechanical innovation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the idea for his steamer was born at a county fair in
1985, when Franz, who owns a heating and cooling business in
Newton, first saw an original Stanley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to make one of those,'' he told his wife, Rita, to
whom he has been married 35 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She was not surprised. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Denny's been building things ever since I met him,'' she
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When they met _ ` ``American Graffiti' time,'' Franz said _ he
was a high school dropout, a hot-rodding street racer with a
reputation as a brilliant backyard mechanic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the guy everybody went to when they had a mechanical
problem,'' said Rita Franz. ``People knew he made cars run good and
run fast.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By 1982, settled into family life, fast gaining respect as a
businessman, Franz redirected his excess energy and imagination. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That year, using only his own design and scrap materials, he
built a 7 1/2-foot-tall grandfather clock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He sat down with a hand calculator and figured out all the
gear ratios,'' said Rita Franz. ``He taught himself the workings of
a clock train and made every part.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The clock now stands in foyer of the Franz's rambling red-brick
home. Every hour on the hour it plays ``The Star-Spangled
Banner.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose that melody because it has a lot of notes,'' said
Franz, who made and tuned the clock's numerous tone rods. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he built other clocks,'' said Gay. ``Lots of clocks.
We had clocks ticking all over the house.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such things seemed normal to Franz's three daughters, for when
they were children, he talked to them every night at supper about
his mechanical projects. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see how excited he was by them,'' said Gay. ``He told
me once that he actually saw new ideas in his dreams.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On many evenings, Franz sat for hours reading the family
encyclopedia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't seem to matter which volume,'' Gay said. ``He's
interested in everything.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some 10 years ago, after completing a second Stanley-type car,
Franz, temporarily at a loss for what to do next, turned to his
wife. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to build /{something/},'' he said. ``Maybe I'll build
a scale-model tractor.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And so in a moment of whimsy, Franz took the first step toward
an acclaim he neither wished for nor imagined. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' he said, ``I didn't know much about classic
tractors. I didn't grow up on a farm.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So he visited a nearby farmer who had a 1925 John Deere Model D
tractor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked it over, and knew I was seeing a year's work,'' Franz
said. ``It was hard to make that commitment.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But he did. And 2,500 hours later, after hand-fabricating
thousands of parts, he finished a perfectly detailed,
radio-controlled, three-eighths-scale model of a rural icon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'll never do this again,'' he thought when he
finished. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And then he began building his second tractor, a
three-eighths-scale model of a classic Case. His third was a
one-fourth-scale Deere that weighs just 65 pounds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Miniaturization confuses people, because it's done in three
dimensions,'' he explained. ``A one-fourth-scale model is actually
64 times smaller than the real thing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His tractors are about knee-high to an adult, and in 1991, on a
lark, he took his first tractor to the Kansas State Fair. And there
he became a true farmland celebrity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite their toylike size, Franz's tractors are fully geared,
working machines with astonishing power. They can pull pickup
trucks around like twigs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the state fair, his tiny tractor won a tug-of-war with a
large group of children, hauling them, squealing and laughing,
through a field of grass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That story was told and retold across Kansas and elsewhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soon, to his delight and dismay, Franz discovered that he had
tapped into a thriving rural subculture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out that there are hundreds of antique farm-machine
shows every year,'' he said. ``I didn't know a thing about them,
and suddenly they all wanted me to come with my little tractors.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every year now, Franz receives scores of such invitations. He
accepts only a few. But when he does appear, he steals the day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the star of our show in 1997,'' said Winona Smith, who
helps run the annual threshing bee in the north-central Oklahoma
town of Fairview. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought us the biggest attendance we've ever had.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the fair's opening parade, Franz stood behind the bleachers
driving his tractors by remote control. Each machine had a doll in
the driver's seat, and the dolls seemed to be steering the tractors
and even changing gears. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 15,000 people there, and they were all stunned,'' Smith
said. ``When Dennis did his tug-of-war challenge with the kids, the
crowd was so thick you couldn't see him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But children are not his only fans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Old farmers, real machine experts, stood around his models in
total awe,'' said Oma Gay Nichols, another Fairview fair planner.
``Dennis does amazing work, perfect down to the finest detail. He's
a kind of genius. It's hard to fully appreciate what he does.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's something Robin Gay has heard all her life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's mind is like a wheel constantly spinning to create
things,'' she said. ``He never gives up. He just seeks new
answers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When people ask why he does it, all I can say is, why does an
artist paint?'' &QL;

 &HT;    IOC scandal: 10 more accused members get chance to respond
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The second batch of International Olympic Committee
members implicated in the Salt Lake City bidding scandal will have
a chance Sunday to defend themselves against charges that they
improperly accepted extravagant gifts and perks during the city's
campaign to win the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's six-man inquiry commission began meeting Saturday
behind closed doors at IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland,
to review allegations involving 10 members implicated in a report
issued Feb. 8 by an ethics commission in Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The report identified 24 members, but 14 already were named by
the IOC commission in late January. Four of those have resigned,
five have been recommended for expulsion, and one was issued a
warning. One died before the investigation began.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is expected to make its ruling on the other
three, whose cases were not closed in January because the IOC said
further investigation was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the meetings will come Sunday when accused members
will be allowed to appear before the commission, which recommends
what action to take.
</P>
<P>
   Theo Chapman, an IOC spokesman, said Saturday it was unclear how
many members would appear in person. Some have responded to the
allegations in writing.
</P>
<P>
   They sometimes have a tendency to just show up at these things,
Chapman said as the commission convened at the IOC's Chateau de
Vidy complex on the banks of Lake Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, led by Canadian IOC member Dick Pound, also
intends to begin reviewing reports by former bidding committees
that may contain further instances of improper conduct by members
dating back to the campaign for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   The committee said it has received responses from nearly all the
28 letters it sent to national Olympic committees and former
bidding groups. IOC officials expect to receive its report on the
Atlanta bid from the U.S. Olympic Committee on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Former officials from four of the six cities _ Atlanta, Athens,
Toronto and Manchester _ that bid for the Centennial Games have
indicated that their reports would contain no new allegations.

   Last month, a Salt Lake ethics panel reported that the IOC
members or their families benefited from more than $1.2 million in
cash, travel, medical care and other improper inducements. There
were 115 IOC members in 1995 when Salt Lake was selected to host
the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 new members implicated last month have been asked to
respond to the allegations before the commissioners recommend what
action to take.
</P>
<P>
   Members are being given the opportunity to appear before the
commission or to send their information in writing to defend
themselves, Chapman said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only one member _ Australian Phil Coles _ has indicated
that he intends to appear in person. Coles was named in the Salt
Lake report as making excessive visits to Salt Lake during the
city's campaign for the 2002 Games, Chapman said. Coles, who
arrived in Lausanne Friday, has denied he did anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that even more names will surface when the
commission reviews the responses from the former bidding cities.
</P>
<P>
   Since the IOC has vowed to clean house definitively at its
special session in two weeks, the Pound commission intends to
finish its work Sunday and report immediately to the IOC executive
board, which is expected to take action as early as Monday. The
board can vote to expel, warn or exonerate.

VETERAN OF WORLD WAR I RECEIVES FRENCH HONOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK WIEBE  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Born 103 years ago in the Missouri Ozarks and reared without a
formal education, Lee Otis Owens didn't grow up thinking he'd see
France from the seat of a horse-drawn wagon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he know that France, the country he helped liberate in
World War I, would one day bestow on him its Legion of Honor
medal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that's what happened Friday at American Legion Post 199 at
7942 Leavenworth Road, Kansas City, Kan. Octave Merveille, an
honorary French consul, pinned the medal on Owens' maroon suit
jacket. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed that I could be this important,'' Owens said
before the ceremony as television camera crews set up their
equipment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Owens is one of several veterans in Kansas and Missouri whom
Merveille, of Mission Hills, has been honoring on behalf of French
President Jacques Chirac. Chirac recently began a campaign to honor
surviving members of the U.S. Armed Forces who fought in France in
World War I. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Merveille also traveled to St. Joseph to honor
103-year-old veteran Arthur Cook. Last weekend, Merveille pinned
the honor on three veterans in southeast Kansas. Today, he plans to
go to southwest Kansas for three more ceremonies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And last Veterans Day, the deputy consul of France, Jean-Pierre
Tutin, presented the honor to McKinley Wooden, 103, of Lee's
Summit, in a ceremony at the Liberty Memorial. Wooden died in
December. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like personally to thank Mr. Owens,'' Merveille said
in a brief speech at the American Legion post. ``I probably
wouldn't be here today if he hadn't (made his sacrifice).'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Owens, who was drafted, served in the Army's 89th Infantry
Division from Feb. 25, 1918, until June 5, 1919, seven months after
the war. In the war, which ended Nov. 11, 1918, he endured heavy
and frequent artillery fire in the Argonne Forest as he carted guns
and ammunition to the front line on a horse-drawn cart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After his discharge, Owens returned home to Alton, Mo., to work
as a carpenter. Nearly three decades later, his son, Eugene, died
fighting in World War II on the same soil Owens had helped
protect. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't talk much about the war when I was growing up,'' Pat
Trower, Owens' daughter, said Friday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But when Owens moved to Trower's Kansas City, Kan., home 14
years ago, he began telling stories. They included one about the
Battle of the Argonne Forest, which reached its peak in the last
weeks of the war, resulting in 117,000 French and American
casualties. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like an earthquake,'' Owens recently told his
daughter about Argonne. ``The whole ground shook. Bullets made a
sound like thunder over my head. I never thought I'd get out
alive.'' &QL;

 DEPRESSING SEASON NOT WHAT GATLING HAD IN MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It started out so nicely. Chris Gatling,
the hometown hero who grew up only miles from the Meadowlands, came
into the season in great shape and great spirits. He talked of
winning the league's sixth-man-of-the-year award, of helping the
Nets challenge for the Eastern Conference title, of displacing the
Knicks as the metropolitan area's top basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   But after only 10 games of this depressing Nets season,
Gatling's tune changed dramatically. Gatling, no longer set on
trying to help New Jersey win the Atlantic Division title, wanted
out. He asked coach John Calipari for a trade a few hours before
the Nets (2-9) were defeated by Portland on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gatling, from Elizabeth, N.J., refused to comment on his trade
requests on Thursday and Friday, and he gave no indication before
the Portland game that he was disgruntled. Cordial with the news
media and jovial with his teammates in the locker room, he was
accepting of his decreased playing time, saying he would simply
have to wait his turn.
</P>
<P>
   While John Nash, the Nets' general manager, has said the club
will try to accommodate Gatling's wishes, Calipari brushed aside
the incident on Friday, almost implying that it was a non-issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gat and I have been on the same page,'' Calipari said. ``Guys
get disappointed when they're not playing, and I want guys to be
upset when they're not playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatling has been playing, but only sparingly. After averaging
11.5 points and 5.9 rebounds in 23.8 minutes a game last season,
the 6-foot-10-inch forward's production and court time have dropped
considerably. He entered Saturday night's home game against Boston
averaging only five points and 3.9 rebounds in 16.4 minutes. Not
since he was a rookie in Golden State, during the 1991-92 season,
has he played so little. And even then, he averaged 5.7 points a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Every Nets player besides Keith Van Horn has suffered
statistically this season, but Gatling's numbers have been
unusually low. Gatling, a 55 percent shooter for his career, is
making only 36 percent of his shots this year. And with a season
high of 14 points, he has scored in double figures only twice.
During the five-game losing streak the Nets took into their meeting
with Boston, Gatling has averaged 4.6 points in 12 minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   While Gatling, a 19-point scorer as an all-star for Dallas in
1997, is apparently disturbed by his lack of playing time, he is
largely to blame for it. In Tuesday's loss to the Knicks at Madison
Square Garden, Gatling played only eight minutes. But that was more
because of his five fouls than because of Calipari's refusal to use
him. With Rony Seikaly ailing from ligament damage in his right
foot, and the Nets' offense struggling badly without a low-post
presence, Calipari needed Gatling on the floor. But he picked up
three fouls in just four minutes of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Calipari, who brought Gatling to the Nets two years ago in a
nine-player trade with Dallas, said Gatling's trade requests would
not make him wary of playing him in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a professional,'' Calipari said. ``He understands it's in
his best interest to play well. I've known Gat for a long time and
I asked for him to be in the trade when we did the trade. And every
time he steps in the game, where's the ball go? To him. I know and
have great confidence in his game.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the hours following Gatling's trade request, Calipari
used him only 11 minutes against Portland. And foul trouble was not
the problem, as Gatling had only two. Gatling has asked for trades
before and not always during times of struggle. After the Nets
played well in losing to Chicago during last season's playoffs,
Gatling said he wanted to go to a new team.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of his mood swings and seemingly changing heart, Gatling's
teammates have viewed the request as an emotional response to a
troubling situation.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: MONICA THE MARKETER CHANGES HISTORY'S SCRIPT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky returns to the world this week, with the
Interview, the Book, and then _ what? A regular spot with Barbara
Walters on ``The View''? A consultant's post on CNN? Another shot
at the public relations game?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's list of references has expanded quite a bit since
her last foray into the job market. Who would not want to hire the
woman whom members of the House impeachment team have called
``intelligent,'' ``poised,'' ``mature,'' ``appealing,''
``articulate'' and ``a very impressive young lady''?
</P>
<P>
   What employer would not look twice at a candidate who appears to
remind virtually every Republican in Congress of members of his or
her own family?
</P>
<P>
   The $1.2 million Ms. Lewinsky has netted for talking about her
affair with President Clinton will not go far for a woman who has
required the ministrations of so many expensive lawyers, but many
people suspect her potential as a profit center has not been tapped
out. Already, New York magazine is touting her as a veritable
marketing genius.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, one of the more consistent laws of American social
history was that having flings with prominent politicians does not
pay. Remember Elizabeth Ray? Fanne Foxe the Argentine Firecracker?
Donna Rice? Gennifer Flowers? Their post-scandal lives ran along
very different trails, but in no case could you argue that romping
with a political alpha dog turned out to be a good career move. A
No Excuses jeans ad does not equate with long-term employment.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Lewinsky's 20th-century predecessors tend to have
depressing stories, the 19th-century ones are sometimes downright
tragic.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Chase Sprague, the daughter of the Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court, attempted to shield her lover, Sen. Roscoe Conkling,
when her husband exposed their affair in 1879. In gratitude,
Conkling dropped her cold and continued on his career as the
powerful Republican boss from New York. Ms. Sprague's marriage was
ruined and she became a lonely exile. Meanwhile, the senator
berated his wife (stashed away in Utica) for ``discussing family
matters of a private nature'' when she confided her own humiliation
to a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline Pollard, the star of the most celebrated political sex
trial of the 19th century, won a breach-of-promise suit against
William Breckinridge, a Kentucky congressman who used to give
lectures on the importance of chastity at a school where Ms.
Pollard was a student. Ms. Pollard followed the usual political
mistress career pattern _ she made an unsuccessful try for a stage
career.
</P>
<P>
   But her story is also an example of the ways the world has
changed over the last hundred years. Testimony at the trial
revealed that Ms. Pollard yearned to be a great writer, and had
made a habit of sleeping with older men to pay her tuition. It is
hard to imagine any of the Congressional firecrackers from the
1970s trading sex for education, and Ms. Lewinsky, by her own
testimony, did not have literary ambitions on her mind when she ran
into Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Harding's mistress, Nan Britten, pioneered the idea of
writing her own presidential memoirs after Harding's relatives
refused her requests for a stipend. She supported herself instead
with royalties from ``A President's Daughter,'' an
under-the-counter best seller about their love child that Ms.
Britten claimed was intended to lend support to illegitimate
children everywhere. That was Ms. Britten's last moment in the
limelight, but the passage in which she described lovemaking in the
oval office coat closet will live on forever.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Summersby wrote a very profitable book denying that she had
conducted a wartime romance with Dwight Eisenhower, then later
wrote a second successful book saying she had. Ms. Summersby did
not live long enough to report on which experience was more
pleasant. But for most women in her situation, neither alternative
has worked out very well.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Allen Peck always denied that she ever slept with Woodrow
Wilson, but she died lonely and went down in history anyway as the
woman who gave the president the nickname ``Peck's Bad Boy.''
Judith Campbell Exner kissed and told about John Kennedy, but she
does not seem to have had a very good time since.
</P>
<P>
   These stories serve an important function. There is nothing more
powerful than the allure of power, and you cannot remind young
people too often about the downside of illicit sex with a man who
has to run for re-election. (We have not made enough progress in
getting women into powerful jobs to tell whether the rule will work
both ways.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I was planning a life with him. I didn't understand I was
expendable,'' said Linda Jones after her affair with Henry
Cisneros, then the mayor of San Antonio, ended in an
extraordinarily messy disaster. Neither party seems to have been
wholly the victim in that romance, but the upshot was that Cisneros
returned to his wife and Ms. Jones is a divorcee serving time in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to wish Ms. Lewinsky luck in breaking this chain.
Anybody that young who has had to see her sexual indiscretions
turned into a joke in Iraq and a protest poster in Sudan deserves
to be cut a little bit of slack. But the weight of history is
against her, and those cautionary tales were so useful it is a
shame to give them up.

SPORTS COLUMN: CHEERING FOR THE MAN WITH THE WHISTLE  
(DW)

<P>
   Some kids collect stamps. Mine collects whistles. David's
friends buy Tommy Hilfiger's latest. He gets the newest style of
referee jersey. His younger brother writes fan letters to Steve
Young. David corresponds with Esse Baharmast.
</P>
<P>
   Like Baharmast, my son is a soccer referee. He has wanted to be
a referee since he was 5 and he and his friend Billy would blow toy
whistles and ``make calls'' on each other. At 19, David has a real
whistle in his mouth: a Fox 40. He's refereeing professional soccer
games, and couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no word I can find that adequately describes the
pleasure I get from being a referee,'' David once wrote. I
appreciate that sentiment but don't get it. It also complicates my
life.
</P>
<P>
   There's no model for relating to a son as referee. I knew how to
root for David when he was a pitcher, a place-kicker, a point guard
or a soccer midfielder. But how do you cheer for a guy in the
middle of the field with a whistle in his mouth?
</P>
<P>
   At 14, David took a 10-hour course to become certified as an
entry-level soccer referee. He already had begun working kids'
games in our local parks program. David nearly was lost to the
ranks of officiating when a coach cursed him as he worked his first
game. David has since come to realize that even as a
seventh-grader, he knew the rules better than this coach did.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually his skin thickened. Mine didn't. I don't enjoy
watching my son officiate soccer games. I can't bear the taunts of
``Come on, ref,'' ``Ref, you're blind'' and ``Call it both ways,
ref.'' I want to grab these cretins by the scruffs of their
ignorant necks and shake some sense into them. David just laughs
hecklers off. He says that one day when told to ``Call it both
ways!'' he's going to say OK and hold his arms out in both
directions.
</P>
<P>
   He is bothered only when he feels he has not reffed his best. To
get better he goes to referee clinics, is assessed by older
referees and seeks their counsel. David relishes the camaraderie of
the reffing community _ a beleaguered, misunderstood group _ and
idolizes its most prominent members.
</P>
<P>
   When the American referee Esse Baharmast was vilified unjustly
for a call he made during the World Cup, David wrote him an e-mail
of support. He already had written fan letters to other referees,
including one who invited him to be his guest at a Major League
Soccer game. There David got to engage in shop talk and banter in
the referees' locker room, then carry a clipboard onto the field as
if he was part of their crew. He was in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   David watches soccer on television as much in terms of
officiating as play. He knows the names of most of those blowing
whistles. If my son misses a game, his first question is not ``Who
won?'' but ``Who reffed?''
</P>
<P>
   Watching soccer with your referee son can be disconcerting. With
him at my side, it's hard to criticize the officiating. I always
figured that second-guessing referees was half the fun of being a
fan. Not when David's around. For one thing, he thinks my knowledge
of the rules doesn't match theirs. Even on judgment calls he won't
let me off the hook. ``How can you say that wasn't offside?'' he'll
ask if I protest a call. ``Were you in position? Don't criticize if
you don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   During his junior year of high school David spent a semester in
Costa Rica. Within weeks of arriving he had scouted up a couple of
games to referee. One erupted in a bench-clearing brawl. ``Don't
worry,'' he wrote us. ``I was perfectly safe. There was a security
guard at the park and as soon as it all began he wasn't trying to
break up the fight, he was right at my side. My friend Cuto also
told me later that he heard some players from the home team vowing
to protect me as well.''
</P>
<P>
   David's an athlete as well as a referee _ he was the captain of
his high school's soccer team and the place-kicker on its football
team _ but one who always has hated pickup games. ``Dad,'' he would
tell me as a child, ``they don't obey the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he is playing soccer for Earlham College in Richmond, Ind.
This is partly because he still loves to play, partly because he
thinks that playing will improve his perspective as a referee.
David recently began officiating games in the A-League,
professional soccer's highest minor league. I took him to one game,
in Cincinnati, then made myself scarce, watching my teen-age son
march onto the field lined up straight beside the center referee
and two linesmen. With their mottled green shirts, multicolored
flags and sober demeanor, the referees looked like medieval
jousters.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks earlier he had been the ``fourth official'' in an
A-League game between Cincinnati and Atlanta: handling
substitutions, calming the benches and standing ready to conduct a
shootout if two overtime periods did not break a tie. This was
almost necessary. When Atlanta scored with two minutes to go in the
second overtime, my son said he was the happiest man in the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   David's referee organization in Dayton, Ohio, has helped him
climb the professional ladder. It selected him as the male youth
soccer referee of the year for southern Ohio and has assigned him
increasingly difficult games to work, some involving players many
years his senior. This would make me a nervous wreck. My son the
ref thrives on that kind of challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In a way his perspective has changed very little since he was 5.
As far as David is concerned, he is on a mission. He is helping the
world become a better place by making it safe for soccer. ``All my
friends ask me,'' he once wrote in an essay for a soccer award, ``
`How can you like going out there and getting yelled at all the
time?' Until recently I didn't know what to reply. Now I think I
understand why it is that I love trying to keep 22 players from
killing each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always wanted there to be peace in the world. However,
when justice isn't done, there can be no peace. This is where I
fall in. As a referee I am the person responsible for making sure
that one group doesn't oppress another. We all want to leave a
legacy behind when we die. I'd like to be remembered as a
peacemaker. I won't do that in any negotiating room after a war. I
won't sit at my desk and speak through written words. I won't be in
a classroom lecturing on human brotherhood. I will teach peace and
brotherhood in the place I love to be most: on the soccer field.'' &QL;

TIGER LADY ASIDE, NEW JERSEY STRICTLY LIMITS EXOTIC PETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (as) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE FERRY, N.J. _ Since word got out nearly a month ago that
a woman named Joan Byron-Marasek was keeping 17 tigers in the
middle of Jackson Township, other residents around the state might
not be blamed for wondering whether there were rhinoceroses down
the road or perhaps giraffes in the next town.
</P>
<P>
   Not likely, said Paulette Nelson, a senior biologist with the
state Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife. Byron-Marasek's Tigers
Only Preserve is a rarity in New Jersey, a state that animal
specialists and conservationists say is one of the strictest when
it comes to allowing people to keep unusual animals.
</P>
<P>
   While New Jersey issued about 10,000 permits last year to owners
of such small exotic pets as snakes, ferrets, Siberian hamsters and
various species of finches and cockatoos, it was far stingier with
permits for larger beasts, like Byron-Marasek's tigers. Only 246
such permits were issued last year, Nelson said. Wildlife officials
want strict controls on the importing and exhibiting of exotic
creatures, she said, to discourage trade that could further
diminish their numbers in the wild, as well as to limit the dangers
that imported animals might pose to local species.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some notables among those who have joined the
Tiger Lady of Jackson Township on the state permit list. There is
Joseph D'Angeli, the Bat Man of Little Ferry, with his basement
compound containing a dozen fruit bats from Egypt and Indonesia,
with wingspans of up to five feet. And there is Joseph Bush, the
Monkey Man of Cherry Hill, with his three capuchin monkeys from
South America, who watch television from their cages in his home
when they aren't on the road with him playing bar mitzvahs,
conventions or Atlantic City casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Bush calls himself the state's only organ grinder licensed to
exhibit monkeys. He says that dealing with exotic animals is not
for everyone, and he has never kept more than three of the monkeys
at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a musician, and then 25 years ago, when I was in
between bands, I bought this monkey and became a solo act,'' said
Bush in a practiced rapid-fire delivery that consciously plays for
the rim shot. ``Now I make more money and I can depend on them,
because I have the key to the cage.''
</P>
<P>
   His white-faced capuchin monkeys live in a cage in one of the
bedrooms of his Cherry Hill home, and he has hired them out for
magazine advertisements, television commercials, birthday parties,
``meet and greets'' at corporate functions as well as Atlantic
City, where they are among the roving attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is one of 10 people in the state licensed to keep
monkeys, and occasionally he gets a surprise visit from a curious
child who has moved into the neighborhood and has heard about the
guy with the monkeys. But he said that, in general, he and other
handlers of exotic capuchins, macaques and spider monkeys keep a
low profile for fear of attracting attention from animal rights
activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so whacked out that they don't think any animal
ought to be in captivity,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   For D'Angeli, bats are not so much his pets as his passion. All
his neighbors know about the unusual creatures in his basement, as
do hordes of schoolchildren to whom he gives lectures and audiences
at the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City. He and his bats have
also appeared on television, on David Letterman's talk show and on
``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They call me the real Batman,'' D'Angeli said of the children
in many of his audiences. ``But then some of the kids get upset
when I don't have a cape on.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the American Zoological Society and a consultant on
bats to zoos and nature centers, D'Angeli became intrigued with the
creatures because of the large colony of indigenous brown bats that
live in the nearby Hackensack Meadowlands. He read all that he
could on the subject, and seven years ago he obtained his first
large bat, an Indian flying fox from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown bats are fine, but they are too small to be great
educational props,'' D'Angeli said, noting that this native species
rarely measures more than 10 inches with its wings spread. ``My
large ones have cute faces and can be seen well when I do my
lectures.''
</P>
<P>
   The owner of an exotic pet store in Fort Lee, D'Angeli does not
think private individuals should keep bats like his as pets, and he
was instrumental in having bats removed from the federal and state
listings of permitted pets. Bats like his, he said, should be kept
only for educational and research purposes and in facilities like
his, which have to be inspected annually and licensed by federal
and state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In stark contrast to the voluble Bush and D'Angeli,
Byron-Marasek has remained silent and secluded at the center of the
storm raging over her tiger preserve. A key question is whether a
431-pound tiger that was killed after it was found wandering in the
area was one of hers. She has denied it, but state officials have
ordered forensics tests on the animal to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Under her state permit, Byron-Marasek is allowed to keep the
animals for theatrical and educational purposes, but state wildlife
inspectors have turned up little evidence that they are being used
for either.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, angry Jackson Township officials intensified their
efforts to close the compound, citing a recent letter from a state
consultant who deemed the compound unsafe and questioned
Byron-Marasek's ability to care for the animals. The mayor of
Jackson Township, William J. Allmann, said the municipality would
try in court on Tuesday to force the state to close the compound
immediately as unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether any of the controversy surrounding Byron-Marasek's
tiger preserve had affected him, D'Angeli said that state
regulators seemed wary of his recent request for permits for
additional animals to enliven his lectures on rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to add a sloth and a monkey, but we were told that we
couldn't because the state thought that we didn't have the proper
experience,'' D'Angeli said. ``The people in charge of the permits
have given me and other people doing legitimate research a hard
time with permits because of the incident with the tigers.''

 &HT;    Battles over 49ers, Redskins heat up
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last week proved again that, in the NFL, the
ruthlessness in the board room is often as nasty as the violence on
the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Denise DeBartolo York reminded her employees
in a lengthy memo that brother Eddie DeBartolo is to have no
involvement in the activities of the franchise. While he waits to
testify in the racketeering trial of former Louisiana Gov. Edwin
Edwards, the 49ers owner-in-exile is in limbo. He isn't likely to
be reinstated by commissioner Paul Tagliabue until NFL owners weigh
the ramifications of his testimony. York gave husband John York and
aide Keith Lenhart oversight responsibilities for the team.
</P>
<P>
   The events in the Bay area, however, pale in comparison to what
is transpiring in the increasingly contentious battle for the
Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Very quietly, potential owners Howard Milstein, Edward Milstein
and Daniel Snyder _ whose $800 million bid for the franchise was
accepted by trustees for the estate of the late owner Jack Kent
Cooke _ hired former 49ers director of personnel Vinny Cerrato as a
consultant. Imagine how awkward it must be for Redskins general
manager Charley Casserly and coach Norv Turner to have Cerrato
looking over their shoulders and evaluating player moves. The
hiring of Cerrato reinforces the notion Casserly, and possibly
Turner even at this late date, still will be fired if the new
owners are approved.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, league vice president of public relations Greg Aiello
confirmed last week the NFL has hired investigator Terry Lenzner to
check out the Milstein group. Lenzner is no stranger to
inside-the-Beltway intrigue. Lenzner was hired by President
Clinton's attorneys to aid in the Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky
cases and was subpoenaed by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr to
explain his activities.
</P>
<P>
   There remains a core of owners, notably Jerry Richardson of
Carolina, who desperately want Cooke's son John Kent Cooke to
retain the 'Skins. Ironically, the Milstein brothers passed league
muster when they were bidding for the expansion Cleveland Browns.
Now there are questions about their ability to finance the Redskins
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Trifecta
</P>
<P>
   Not since Jim Plunkett (New England), Archie Manning (New
Orleans) and Dan Pastorini (Houston) went off the board at the top
of the 1971 draft have three quarterbacks been selected to start
the lottery. The trifecta is a longshot this year, but it could
happen. Cleveland figures to start the draft by taking Tim Couch of
Kentucky. Philadelphia has talked about Texas tailback Ricky
Williams with the second pick, but when Jim Haslett interviewed for
the head coach job, he told Jeff Lurie the team needs to groom a
young passer, and the Eagles owner now seems to be in agreement.
With quarterbacks mentor Andy Reid as the head coach now, Philly
might opt for Daunte Culpepper of Central Florida or Oregon's Akili
Smith. In Cincinnati, owner Mike Brown likes Georgia cornerback
Champ Bailey, but some Bengals favor taking Smith or Donovan McNabb
of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons officials will meet Monday with former New York Giants
quarterback Danny Kanell, but Gary Wichard, the agent for San
Francisco backup Jim Druckenmiller spoke last week with GM Harold
Richardson to gauge the club's interest in his client. It will not
be surprising if Kanell, who would welcome a chance to play for Dan
Reeves and learn from Chris Chandler, is signed by week's end. ...
Georgia Tech defensive end Nate Stimson, who wasn't invited to the
combine, is turning scouts' heads in personal workouts. Stimson
will play linebacker in the NFL. ... Look for new 49ers president
Bill Walsh to sign free agent quarterback Steve Stenstrom, who
played for him at Stanford, as a backup to Steve Young. The Niners
recently signed Jeff Garcia, who led Calgary to the Grey Cup in
1998, and he is being counted on to win the No. 3 job. ... In the
wake of the free agent defections of tackle Orlando Brown and guard
Wally Williams, Ravens left tackle Jonathan Ogden, a guy in a class
with Jacksonville's Tony Boselli, told agent Marvin Demoff to seek
a trade out of Baltimore. Contractually the Ravens can only keep
Ogden two more seasons. His deal stipulates the team cannot use a
``franchise'' label on him. ... Cincinnati will pay quarterback
Jeff Blake a roster bonus of $500,000 on Monday, meaning Neil
O'Donnell is history.

   BRITAIN-RACE _ LONDON _ The 600-page report on the 1993 murder
of a17-year-old black man named Stephen Lawrence in 1993 places the
spotlight on the treatment of blacks in London and the rest of
Britain, and is being described as the first shot in a revolution
in race relations. The report makes damning criticisms of the
metropolitan London police, pointing out, perhaps for the first
time in Britain, institutional racism. It calls for widespread
reform throughout government and highlights a rarely discussed
problem in modern British society. The investigation was so marred
from the start that the five men accused of the crime will probably
never be punished. (Roughton, Cox News Service). MOVED.

SUMMER RENTALS ON THE BEACH STILL AVAILABLE , BUT GOING FAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Maine, Mass., N.J.)  (rk) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in a heavy, ceaseless rain, the house is light, wrapped in
the sea mist. The dunes and the high grasses fill nearly every
window of this sprawling five-bedroom house, built in Southampton,
N.Y., in the late 1980s, with ocean on one side and bay on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   The large living room is dotted with comfortable sofas and
chairs upholstered in soothing shades of white and yellow, with a
trace of gray on the walls. It is no surprise to learn that a
decorator lives here. The place is camera ready. It is also
available for rent, for the month of August, for $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Garrity and J. Geoffrey Hull, real estate brokers from
Allan M. Schneider Associates who are showing the house, say it
only recently came on the market and predict that it will rent
quickly. Although $150,000 may sound like a sale price, not a
rental, even this sum doesn't deliver a house with everything. To
some of their clients, the house would represent a compromise,
because it lacks a tennis court and shares the driveway with
another mansion.
</P>
<P>
   If someone had a higher budget and wanted a house without those
particular drawbacks, Frank Newbold, a vice president of Sotheby's
International Realty, who heads the East Hampton office, could
offer one in East Hampton that is $500,000 for the summer season.
That price produces a very large stucco house with tennis courts, a
swimming pool, ocean views and exquisite gardens. The final cost on
all rentals can be as much as 10 percent more, in this case
$50,000, because the housekeeping and gardening staffs have to be
paid, and that is extra.
</P>
<P>
   Stories like that can drive an average person into an average
bar, convinced there is no hope of finding a nice little spot for
summer weekends, to taste the salt, to feel the sand.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, there are places available all along the Northeast
coast that are reasonably priced. Many towns on the New Jersey
shore, on Cape Cod, on Fire Island and in Rhode Island offer
rentals for a week or two that can house a family near the beach
for about $2,000 a week or less. More expensive areas in
Connecticut, the Hamptons, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket tend to
restrict rentals to a month, or the season. Even in the Hamptons,
it is possible to rent a small house for the season for less than
$2,000 a week that will give access to the same natural and
unnatural wonders that draw the wealthiest New Yorkers to the tip
of Long Island. ``That's a big misconception, that it's impossible
to rent out here,'' Hull said. ``I did a couple of rents of $15,000
for the season, and I have one studio for $5,000 for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   But, brokers are quick to say, there is no time to waste.
Brokers in beach towns throughout the Northeast say they are
renting places earlier than ever, sometimes beginning in November,
and that many of the most expensive and least expensive places have
already been rented. Most say that their inventory this year has
declined, as owners have decided they don't need the extra cash
they get from renting. Prices are up between 5 percent and 10
percent over last year, and the record season of 1998 is expected
to be equaled or exceeded this year.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, demand is similar to last year's, although in the
Hamptons, it seems to have dipped a bit. Brokers say the pool of
renters has shrunk a little because so many decided to buy last
year after several seasons of renting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Newbold said that sales in his office were triple the dollar
volume of the previous year, and in January 1999, the sales were up
25 percent over the previous January.
</P>
<P>
   Spurring matters along is the impending 2 percent transfer tax
that will be levied on buyers of properties in all the East End
towns, including Shelter Island, beginning in April to finance the
acquisition of public space.
</P>
<P>
   While demand is relatively steady in most places, there are
exceptions. When a place becomes hot, everything changes quickly.
Shelter Island, between the North and South Forks of Long Island,
has long been a haven for people drawn to its slow pace and solid
Victorians. For years, the real estate market was dead. But
suddenly, it has become appealing to a new crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers credit _ or give the blame for _ its new status
primarily to Andre Balazs, the hip hotelier who bought an old
motel-cum-restaurant and reopened it in the summer of 1997 as
Sunset Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Balazs, whose other properties include Chateau Marmont in Los
Angeles and the Mercer Hotel in SoHo, is married to Katie Ford,
president of Ford Models, and has been spending weekends on Shelter
Island for a number of years.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of his venture was almost immediate. ``The market on
Shelter Island has exploded,'' said Jane RuTon &UR;  &LR; Harrison, the
manager of the Shelter Island office for Allan M. Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   Places are still available, but demand has been much higher, and
many are already rented. ``We've definitely come into vogue with
the young Wall Street bonus people,'' Ms. Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunset Beach has brought international interest. ``I'm on
the board of the Chamber of Commerce,'' she said, ``and last summer
we got 30 calls a week from places like London and Los Angeles,
wanting to know about Shelter Island.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the island's tranquillity has been protected by the
need to take a ferry to get there _ and the fact that the ferry
stops running on summer nights at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are up about 20 percent over last year, she said, with
one waterfront house renting for $30,000 just for July, ``which is
crazy,'' Ms. Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was not sure that the excitement over Shelter
Island could be maintained. ``For a lot of people who try it for
one season, it won't be glamorous enough,'' she said. ``Everything
closes up by midnight. There's no Hamptons night scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Rents at the lower end, for perhaps a ranch house in a
development, start at about $10,000 for the summer season, she
said; to get close to the beach, about $20,000 a season is needed.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, she said, houses with pools rented for $12,000
for the season; now, they are $20,000. Still, the island is a
bargain compared to many parts of the Hamptons; she still has, for
instance, a rustic waterfront barn, on an estate, at $14,000 for
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Island has also picked up this year, with rentals and sales
booming. The long and narrow island, where no house is more than
two blocks from the water and where cars are forbidden during the
summer months, had lost some of its allure for buyers and even
renters after storms in the early '90s washed away a number of
houses. At the time, it seemed that the island itself might soon be
swallowed by the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of those storms seems to have faded. Last year, the
market improved, and now ``things are going great guns,'' said Ali
Beqaj, a partner in Southwind Real Estate in Saltaire, where
four-bedroom houses for the season rent for from $16,000 to
$30,000. Usually, Beqaj said, people don't commit to rentals on
Fire Island until March, when the ferry starts operating.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he said, they have been taking places without seeing
them first. After many houses had languished on the market for
years, sales suddenly also picked up, with 20 houses selling last
year in Saltaire alone.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right place on Fire Island is a matter of picking
the most congenial town. The island, which has very few restaurants
and stores, attracts all kinds of people, but each town is largely
homogeneous. The Pines has long been a magnet for gay men, and many
gay women have homes in Cherry Grove. Saltaire used to be mostly
Irish; now it is mostly Jewish, Beqaj said. Some towns like Kismet
and Ocean Bay Park allow groups to share houses and don't mind a
little partying; others are so restricted they evoke mutterings
about police states.
</P>
<P>
   Beqaj didn't even suggest Saltaire, where outdoor grilling is
forbidden, for a client who does a show on grilling for the Food
Network. Instead he found her a place in the more laid-back Fair
Harbor, right next door.
</P>
<P>
   Most beach areas within weekend driving or train distance are
reporting the same robust business they had last year. Lyn Thomas,
who manages rentals for Prudential Zack Realtors in Ship Bottom, on
New Jersey's Long Beach Island, said that many people book places
for the next summer as they are leaving.
</P>
<P>
   And, as in the Hamptons, so many people have bought in the last
few years, she said, that the rental stock has been cut by as much
as 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 minutes from Manhattan, the island offers housing at
many price levels, Ms. Thomas said, including a four-bedroom house
in Loveladies with ocean views for $7,500 a week in August and a
five-bedroom house with a pool and hot tub for $25,000 a week in
August.
</P>
<P>
   A four-bedroom house with ocean views in Surf City is $4,250 a
week in August, a three-bedroom in Ship Bottom with boat slips is
$2,450-$3,000 a week in August, and a three-bedroom apartment in a
house near the beach in Brant Beach is $885 a week in July and
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very family oriented,'' Ms. Thomas said, with
restaurants, stores, miniature golf, water sports, and fabulous
beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Also about 90 minutes from Manhattan is Bellport, an old village
on the South Shore of Long Island where the few rentals available
have been moving briskly.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petheram, the owner of Old Purchase Properties in Bellport,
said he could show a prospective summer tenant a cottage right in
the village for $7,700 for the season, or a large house on the most
prestigious street with a pool for $66,000 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Listings are fewer this year, he said, because the owners are
using the houses for themselves. Bellport is situated on the bay,
but its residents have rights to an ocean beach across the bay on
Fire island, part of the National Seashore, reached by a
village-run ferry. ``It's a low-key, old-money'' kind of place,
Petheram said. ``They don't drive a Rolls-Royce. They drive a
Taurus.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther away, but still reachable on weekends, is the coast of
Rhode Island, which is more sedate than most of New Jersey and less
expensive, with some exceptions, than the Hamptons. The style is
casual, with the focus on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're living somewhere in the '60s,'' said Tom DePatie, a
sales associate in Westerly at H.D. Randall. ``The early '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his counterparts elsewhere, DePatie said that rental
inventory is down about 10 percent this year, in his case because
of greater demand and less financial need for owners to rent.
</P>
<P>
   In the Westerly area, houses tend to be rented for a week, two
weeks, or a month, but rarely for the season. People who want a
place should start looking in November, he said, because demand is
so great. ``We have 10 calls for every week we can rent,'' he said.
Rates range from a low of $900 a week for a small three-bedroom
house about a half a mile from the beach to a high of $30,000 a
month for an oceanfront house with five or six bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a rental isn't hopeless, he said, but it's not easy.
``There's a week here or there,'' he said. ``There may be someone
penciled in who will fall out.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther up the coast, where rentals really are for vacations,
not weekends, brokers in places like Nantucket, Block Island,
Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod all say that business is strong and
places are going quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Bulger of Country Village rentals in Nantucket said that
prices, which range from about $2,000 to about $15,000 a week, are
up about 10 percent. Last year was a banner year, he said, and he
expected the same in 1999. But despite a construction boom that has
seen workers commuting by plane to jobs on the island every day,
the pace is still slow, with little night life.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, the island's famous code of behavior is still
intact, despite the growth in the year-round population to almost
10,000. ``We still don't have any stoplights on the island,
blinking or otherwise,'' he said, which forces people to use reason
and consideration when traveling. There are also no chain stores,
neon lights or purple houses. Almost everything is cedar shingled,
with beach roses and hydrangeas for color.
</P>
<P>
   On Martha's Vineyard, the cachet of the island has prompted
people from New York and California who may know little of its
charms to request ``Hamptons-style houses'' _ big places on the
water with pools and tennis courts _ which brokers say they have
very few of.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, people use the oceans or the ponds,'' said
Jill Hobby, a realtor with Conroy and Company in Chilmark, in
Martha's Vineyard. The Vineyard, she said, is in the midst of a
very hot rental season, with ``lots of calls, lots of money.''
Rents in the most desired section range from about $8,000 to
$40,000 a week. Renovation is rampant, she said, as owners of
charming older places realize they can take in a lot of money if
they make improvements.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get a carpenter to save your life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing interest in the island has altered the tone, she
said. ``It's a different breed of people coming here,'' she said.
``It's not as laid back as it once was. Now it feels like they're
coming here because they hear they should.''
</P>
<P>
   Block Island, off the coast of Rhode Island, is an easygoing
place with little commercial development but less-expensive rentals
than the more famous islands. Gail Hall, the owner of Ballard Hall
Real Estate, said that two-bedroom rentals start at $900 a week,
and that houses typically only go as high as $3,500. But there are
very few rentals left, she said, as places have been booked very
early. The best time to start looking, she said, is mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   On Cape Cod, more accessible because unlike the Vineyard no
ferry is required, rentals tend to be available for just a week or
two at a time. Susan Peters, rental manager of Cape Shores Real
Estate on Main Street in Wellfleet, said that many houses are
already booked and that what remains is moving quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only tell you what's available today,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who walked in at that moment, she said, could rent a
four-bedroom, three-bath house on the edge of a dune, with steps to
its own beach and panoramic views of the bay from the second floor,
for $3,500 a week in July or August. Or they could rent a
three-bedroom house about a seven-minute walk from Duck Pond for
$3,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other agents in the Northeast, she has some rentals
for less than $1,000 a week, but they go fast. For $875 a week in
July or $925 in August, she could rent a two-bedroom, one-bath
house less than two miles from the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, brokers in the Hamptons sound less harried about
the summer season. ``This year things are happening a little
slower,'' said Newbold of Sotheby's. ``Weather has not been great
on weekends, and the weather has been great in Florida. They're not
focused on summer yet. Around March 1, it goes into full tilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokers say they still have good houses available at all prices,
although inventory is down as much as 25 percent in some towns and
prices are up. In Southampton, brokers from Allan M. Schneider
still have an old two-bedroom arts and crafts-style house on Henry
Street, in the village, for $15,000 for the season, or a
four-bedroom Victorian in town that is $32,500 for the season. At
the higher end, they have a house in the estate section that is a
half mile from the beach, for $95,000 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Although the houses are there, brokers say that customers risk
losing their first choice if they take too long to decide. Ms.
Garrity said that for the first time, she uses her cell phone to
call an owner right away if a customer shows interest, to make sure
the house isn't rented without her having a chance to make a
counter offer.
</P>
<P>
   While tenants come from all over, the ``Hollywood moment'' in
the Hamptons seems to be over, Newbold said. About three years ago,
many celebrities rented homes, he said, but by and large they show
up now just as occasional guests of one of the remaining celebrity
residents, Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The zenith came when Barbra Streisand was looking for a
house,'' he said, ``and then she read that the locals thought she
was paying too much, and they were making fun of her.''
</P>
<P>
   She ended up not buying, but she does visit as a guest of Donna
Karan. In their place, Newbold said, are just very very rich people
from Europe as well as the United States, people of whom most
people have never heard. The tone, too, has changed, he said.
``They used to say, where are the discos,'' he said. ``People
treated this like a motel.'' Now, he said, ``they say they've heard
that the Historical Society has walking tours. Their goal is to
live here. They care more about a sense of place.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that houses were available for the merely affluent, not
just the super rich. He said he could, for instance, provide a
converted 19th century one-room school house overlooking farmland
in Wainscott for $33,000 for the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high prices, though, landlords grow increasingly
careful. Patti Wadzinski, a broker for Cook Pony Farm in East
Hampton, said that many landlords now require tenants to take out a
short-term tenant insurance policy to cover personal injury or
damage. And on extravagantly furnished houses, the security deposit
may be more than the standard 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you evaluate someone who is renting a house for
$150,000 a month? Newbold said that in a surprising number of
cases, you don't have to. ``They usually know each other, or know
people who know them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Through word of mouth, they can be assured that tenants are
appropriate, with a backup letter from a reference or a bank. In
contrast to city rentals, however, it is the owner who pays the
brokerage fee.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, there are those who have reacted to the scene in the
Hamptons, to what some locals call the ``vulgarians on the beach,''
by deciding they have had enough. They opt, Newbold said, for
quieter places, like western Connecticut and Maine. Especially
Maine, where, he noted, Martha Stewart, who owns two houses in the
Hamptons, is now ensconced in the former Edsel Ford mansion on
Mount Desert Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is definitely a migration,'' Newbold said. But, he said,
for everyone who leaves, ``there are three who want to come.''

BOSTON COLLEGE'S FARKAS FOCUSED ON NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   ANDREW R. TRIPALDI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff Farkas readily admits that his ultimate goal is helping the
Boston College hockey program win its first national championship
since 1949. Advancing to the 1998 NCAA title game only to lose,
4-2, to Michigan, Farkas says, has only made him and the Eagles
more determined to take care of last season's unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning a national championship before I graduate is my
biggest goal,'' said Farkas, a junior who leads the Eagles with 26
goals. ``We are really tight at this point in the season and I
think we are gaining momentum as a team right now. We have been to
the national championship game before so we know what it takes to
win. It is a special thing to be a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently third among Division I scorers in goals, Farkas is in
touch with his priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to score 50 goals if my team is not going to win
and be successful,'' Farkas said. ``It's great to put the puck
through the net, but if the goals aren't coming, then a player has
to be disciplined enough not to let the rest of his game suffer and
hurt the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Rated as the nation's top &UR;  &LR; high school recruit by The Hockey
News coming out of the Nicholls School in Buffalo in 1996, Farkas
chose Boston College over Boston University and Michigan State.
Since then, he has never put himself ahead of Boston College's best
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Toronto Maple Leafs drafted the forward 57th
overall in the 1997 NHL draft, Farkas put that enticing possibility
on the back burner to concentrate on the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought of playing in the NHL is exciting, but I don't
think about it too often,'' he said. ``I prefer to concentrate on
playing well for B.C. There are a lot of great players here who are
helping me immensely and are making me look good and perform well.
I'm thrilled to be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto Maple Leaf officials, however, are paying close
attention to Farkas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a player getting better from year to year,'' said
Anders Hedberg, Toronto's assistant general manager. ``Jeff stands
out because of his speed and quickness and the dimensions of his
game. We had him rated a lot higher on our draft board and were
thrilled when he lasted to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps other teams were concerned about his size. When he first
arrived at Boston College, the 6-foot-1-inch Farkas weighed a
modest 160 pounds and was concerned whether his body could take the
daily pounding at the college level, competing against bigger,
stronger players.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer he stayed in Boston to work out and add more muscle
while maintaining his stamina. He now weighs a solid 185 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``His strength is a lot better because he put on a lot of weight
which has helped him immeasurably,'' said the Boston College coach,
Jerry York.
</P>
<P>
   Also, participating in the World Junior Championships for the
third consecutive year last December and January, has helped him
develop as a player. Farkas said that having to adjust to the speed
and wide-open offenses in international competition against the top
amateur players in the world has made him a more complete player on
the ice. York agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff has learned how to involve his teammates in the game,''
York said, ``and utilize the players around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the focus has shifted again to the NCAA tournament. Boston
College (19-11-4) is currently ranked No. 6 nationally. The first
round of the tournament begins March 26-27 in Worcester, Mass., and
Farkas, is pointing toward the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone gets what they deserve,'' he said. ``I feel some
pressure to perform at a high level because I want to come out and
be the best all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that puts more pressure on me, than that's OK'' &QL;

DRUNKEN DRIVERS MAY FIND COST OF RETRIEVING CARS PROHIBITIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Drivers whose cars are seized under the Giuliani
administration's new crackdown on drunken driving face such a long
and costly series of court battles to get their vehicles back that
many may simply decide to give up their cars without a fight,
defense lawyers said last week.
</P>
<P>
   They predicted that a driver who was arrested for the first time
on drunken driving charges, and whose blood alcohol level is barely
over the legal limit could expect to lose the car and pay up to
$1,000 in legal fees. But, judging by the way the authorities have
dealt with car seizures in the past, defense lawyers predicted that
the police may allow these drivers to buy their cars back, at their
trade-in value.
</P>
<P>
   The selling back of seized cars _ frequently done in drug and
prostitution cases _ is not official policy in cases of drunken
driving, but court officials speaking on the condition of anonymity
said it was likely to be an option quietly offered to first-time
offenders.
</P>
<P>
   But drivers who test far above the legal limit or who are
second-time offenders can expect to be mired in criminal and civil
court battles for more than a year, pay up to $10,000 in legal
fees, and lose the cars anyway. The lawyers said these drivers may
find it easier just to plead guilty and surrender their cars.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure how the new system will evolve if it
withstands court challenges on its constitutionality. Some predict
that nearly all drivers will simply give up on getting their cars
back. Others predict an explosion in the number of drivers who
demand trials, a move that would cripple the city's already
overburdened court system and make the crackdown enormously
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But the most likely scenario, according to defense lawyers,
prosecutors and court officials, is that a two-tiered system will
develop. Wealthy first-time offenders who are willing to fight will
be able to buy their cars back from the police. But repeat
offenders and the poor will face such a drawn-out battle that they
will in essence be forced to give up.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell C. Ellman, a lawyer who specializes in drunken driving
cases, said the city faces enormous court costs if the crackdown is
carried out as strictly as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has outlined.
Ellman and court officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity
predicted that the city would allow defendants to settle their
civil cases, in essence, by buying their cars back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is going to have to plea bargain on the civil side,''
he said. ``If even 20 percent of drunk drivers went to trial you're
talking about 1,000 cases. The city does not have the capability to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But city officials say they have the resources to carry out the
crackdown, cars will be taken away from first-time offenders and
they are not bluffing. ``The harm a first-time offender can do on
the road is the same as a second-time offender,'' said Daniel
Connolly, a special counsel in the city law department. ``If it
saves one life, anything that discourages people to drive drunk is
worthwhile.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For those accused of driving drunk, the problems begin with a
stark choice after being pulled over. If the driver refuses to take
a breath test, the driver's license is automatically suspended for
six months. And even drivers who do not take a breath test can be
charged with driving drunk and lose their cars based on how a
police officer assesses their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   If the driver takes the breath test, a blood-alcohol reading of
0.10 or higher will trigger his or her arrest and the automatic
seizure of the car. A lower score can lead to an arrest for driving
while impaired, a traffic infraction, but not the seizure of the
car.
</P>
<P>
   After a night in jail, the driver must appear before a judge, be
arraigned and most likely be told to return to court in a month.
Under the crackdown, the driver now has to resolve two issues
before regaining his or her car _ a criminal drunken driving charge
and the civil action the city has begun to seize the vehicle
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said they would counsel clients to first resolve
their criminal cases. In one of the few pieces of relatively good
news for offenders, officials in district attorney's offices in all
five boroughs this week said that prosecutors were, in essence,
taking no position on the crackdown and would continue to offer
plea bargains in drunken driving cases.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Brooklyn and the Bronx currently allow first-time
offenders who are not involved in accidents and test at .15 or
lower to plead to the lesser charge of driving while impaired, a
traffic infraction.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan and Staten Island, drivers are allowed to plead to
the lesser charge if they test below .12 or .13. Queens prosecutors
said they evaluate each defendant on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, roughly half of the 4,970 people charged with drunken
driving in the city were allowed to plead guilty to the lesser
charge of driving while impaired, according to court records. But
Giuliani administration officials said they would still move to
seize the cars of people who plead to the lower charge.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers were split over whether they would advise their
clients to take the plea or demand a trial. Some said any guilty
plea would bolster the city's case in civil court that the car
should be seized. But others said it was more practical to take the
guilty plea and hope the city quietly allows first time offenders
to buy their cars back.
</P>
<P>
   A police official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that
the ``majority'' of the 1,800 cars seized last year in drug,
prostitution and cases of driving without a license ended in
``settlements'' where the defendants bought their cars back from
the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, the city lawyer, said the city will evaluate whether a
first time offender's car should be seized on a ``case-by-case''
basis. But he and the police official confirmed that the Police
Department has never had a car seizure case go to trial in the
past. Either the defendant gave up the car or the police agreed to
a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials who spoke on condition of anonymity and defense
lawyers said the city could adopt a zero tolerance policy, but the
cost would be enormous. Under a zero tolerance crackdown on drunken
driving, the number of civil actions involving cars filed by the
city could triple from 1,800 last year to nearly 7,000 cases.
</P>
<P>
   For now, most of the 22 drivers who have had their cars seized
appear to be waiting to see if the practice is declared
unconstitutional. As of Friday, only one driver, Pavel Grinberg, a
Polish immigrant from Staten Island, had filed a letter to the
Police Department demanding the return of his car.
</P>
<P>
   Grinberg, a first-time offender who tested just over the legal
limit during the first night of the crackdown, is the test case the
New York Civil Liberties Union hopes to use get the crackdown
declared illegal. Grinberg's lawyers are expected to go to court
next week to demand a court order barring further seizures and the
immediate return of Grinberg's brown 1988 Acura, his family's only
car.

COMMENTARY: YOUNG ACTIVIST FORCES DEBATE ON HOT TOPICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to eliminate art advisory. No changes.)  (lb) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOSHEN, N.Y. _ Hanna Ingber is a senior at Goshen High who
believes, emphatically, that her school should dispense free
condoms to students. The school says this will not happen, and
since Ms. Ingber will be in college in the fall, it is easy to see
that she will not get her way any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Ms. Ingber, who is 17, has Goshen in a dither.
</P>
<P>
   With skill, determination and an instinct for using the news
media, Ms. Ingber has forced Goshen to pay attention to her, just
as she forced the school system to give her the middle school
auditorium for a forum on condoms last week. If her campaign has
brought a blast of unwanted publicity to Goshen, she said, that's
too bad. This town had to wake up.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ingber's panel of experts all turned out to favor providing
condoms to high school students. Several hundred parents showed up
and many objected, but the experts recited statistics to prove them
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, children are going to have sex, with or
without your consent,'' said Bradley Shippee, a panelist who
teaches AIDS prevention in prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ingber added, ``Just as school is a place to get a bagel if
you've forgotten your lunch, or a Band-Aid or a tampon, high school
should be one more place to get a condom.''
</P>
<P>
   Until about a year ago, Ms. Ingber was known mainly as the
founder of Students Advocating Animal Rights, which pickets rodeos
and circuses and holds a vegan Thanksgiving dinner. But then she
developed the condom campaign, and while some classmates think
she's a pain, some grown-ups have developed a frank admiration for
her and her ability to work the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a couple of people say to me that she reminds them
fondly of the '60s,'' said James Langlois, the superintendent of
schools. ``We live in a time of a low level of activism, and I have
at times wished there was more. Not the issues that she is focused
on, but I like the model of political activism that she has put up
in front of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been the one who speaks up, and I've always been
proud of that,'' Ms. Ingber said. Her first experience in
outspokenness came in eighth grade, when, for a social studies
assignment to produce posters about current political issues,
students created art on abortion, animal rights and other topics
that the principal said were too hot to display.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `These are too controversial and we don't want to
upset anybody.' The teacher just stood there cowardly and didn't
say anything, and most of the students just sat there,'' Ms. Ingber
said, recalling the incident. ``I just kept raising my hand and
saying, `Wait a minute, this is our assignment and both sides are
represented and what's going on?'''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, in another school exercise, Ms. Ingber and other
Goshen delegates to an Orange County student convention called
Using Government chose condom distribution as their convention
platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much sex going on that the parents and teachers
refuse to acknowledge, and even though these kids are taught safe
sex, they're not practicing it, and that scares the daylights out
of me,'' Ms. Ingber said. ``Of all the people who I know have had
unprotected sex, I ask, `If you had had a condom with you, would
you have used it?' and the answer is always yes, and that proves
that sex education works and that the problem is availability.''
</P>
<P>
   The student convention rejected the Goshen condom proposal, but
by then Ms. Ingber had turned her attention to a real government _
the Goshen Unified School District. When she decided the school
system was giving her proposal the run-around _ officials kept
talking about advisory committees _ she went to The Times Herald
Record of Middletown, which produced a front-page story about her,
accompanied by a photo of Goshen High students flourishing condoms.
</P>
<P>
   That story drew the attention of a disc jockey named Rockin'
Steve from the Poughkeepsie rock radio station, WPDH. He spent a
morning handing out condoms to students in front of the high school
during his radio show. Some made the condoms into balloons and
kicked them around.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows how to use the media, and she's using you, too,''
Langlois told a certain reporter politely. ``I don't know many high
school kids who would call up The New York Times.''
</P>
<P>
   The local coverage embarrassed a lot of people and angered some
students. ``It's given us a bad name,'' said Matt Quick, a junior
who sat on the panel as an opponent of condom distribution in
school. ``At the home basketball game against Burke, the opposition
fans were shouting `condom kids' at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the key to Ms. Ingber's resolve may lie precisely in her
knowledge that for the insurgent, there is no such thing as bad
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the town were really upset,'' she said,
``but it just brought a lot of attention to the issue, and that is
the most important thing. It was our publicity that got Goshen
awakened to what we were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of Ms. Ingber's parents are lawyers, and Ms. Ingber aspires
to go to Yale and to have a career in the law. ``I guess my
background prepares me for arguing and, you know, logical
thinking,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The parent opposition at the forum had three things to say about
her plan: that teen-agers who are mature enough to have sex are
mature enough to go to Planned Parenthood on Greenwich Avenue to
pick up free condoms, that school condoms send the wrong message,
and that condoms can fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of playing Russian roulette with two bullets in the
gun, you seem to be saying, `Well, let's tell the kids to play
Russian roulette with only one bullet,''' Mike Grady, the father of
a second-grader, told the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father never talked to me about sex,'' Shippee responded,
``but you know what? I think it's time all parents started teaching
their kids about sex.''
</P>
<P>
   That idea, teaching, turned out to be the middle ground on which
both sides could meet. Langlois, who had some apprehension about
the meeting, left it a happy man. ``A community can deal with
condoms on its own,'' he said, ``but education is something we can
all believe in.''

OFFICIALS CONDEMN JURY'S AWARD TO OFFICER'S KILLER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Adding to the crescendo of outrage and disappointment
among many New York City police officers, state and city officials
Saturday condemned a $660,000 federal jury award to a man convicted
of killing a rookie officer in Queens 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The inmate, David McClary, 33, who is serving a 25 years-to-life
sentence for the 1988 slaying of Officer Edward Byrne in Jamaica,
Queens, spent four years in solitary confinement, from November
1989 to March 1994. On Tuesday a jury in Rochester found McClary
had suffered mental distress during the time that prison officials
kept him locked in a tiny cell and that his civil rights had been
violated.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, Jim Flateau, a spokesman for the Department of
Correctional Services who responded to calls to Gov. George E.
Pataki, denounced the jury's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we do not believe that a cop killer should be
getting $660,000 of the taxpayers dollars,'' said Flateau.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Higgins, a spokesman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who
was in Florida Saturday, said Giuliani &UR;  &LR; condemned the jury's
ruling. ``The mayor believes this is an absurd verdict and a
miscarriage of justice,'' Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   The condemnation has not been unanimous, however. Tom Terrizzi,
the associate director of Prisoners Legal Services of New York,
which helped McClary file his case, has defended the verdict as
fair recompense for the debilitating psychological effects of
McClary's forced isolation.
</P>
<P>
   McClary was convicted of shooting Byrne, 22, in the head several
times at close range as he sat in a parked patrol car in the early
morning of Feb. 26, 1988. The officer was guarding the firebombed
home of a man who had complained to the police about drug dealers
in his neighborhood. McClary was one of four members of a drug gang
that, on orders from its boss, Howard (Pappy) Mason, killed officer
Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brown, a spokesman for State Attorney General Eliot L.
Spitzer, who is responsible for defending state agencies against
lawsuits such as the one McClary filed against the Corrections
Department, said Spitzer is planning to ask the judge in the case
to overturn the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the shooting, crack cocaine was ravaging New York
City's poorer neighborhoods like the ones Byrne patrolled at night.
As a result, thousands of criminals were flowing into state and
federal prisons, said Flateau. That forced corrections officials to
place McClary in solitary confinement to protect him from other
prisoners, Flateau said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first concern was that he might not be too popular with
the prisoners,'' he said. ``Our second concern was that someone
might want to have taken him out _ killed him _ because they
thought it might have put them in good stead for taking out a cop
killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, shortly after he went to prison, McClary was being
considered as a possible witness against one of the other gang
members who shot Byrne, said a state law enforcement official
familiar with the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity..
</P>
<P>
   As word of the decision to award McClary $660,000 in damages
spread, police officials expressed bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   James Savage, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, said the jury's verdict was the talk of the annual
Emerald Society dinner Friday in Great Neck, N.Y., attended by more
than 1,000 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was on the lips of just about everybody I spoke to, the
disbelief and the disappointment,'' he said. The 103rd Precinct
station house in Jamaica, where the street out front was renamed
Police Officer Edward Byrne Avenue, the verdict carried a
particular sting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disgusting and ridiculous,'' said one precinct detective
who refused to give his name. ``Anybody you talk to here is going
to say the same thing. ``It's a liberal country and liberal judge,
what can I say?''

 &HT;    Hartwig no longer an afterthought on pole vaulting scene
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes you just know it's going to be your day.
</P>
<P>
   For Jeff Hartwig, it dawned on him when he clipped the pole
vault bar at 19-feet, 1/4 inch and it popped into the air, only to
drop neatly back into place. Hartwig took advantage of his good
fortune and never looked back, taking down his own American record
with a clearance of 19-5 Saturday afternoon at the USA Indoor Track
and Field Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that was a weird deal,'' said Hartwig, smiling. ``That's
the first time I've ever hit the bar that hard, where I didn't put
my hand on it, and it popped right back down.''
</P>
<P>
   But this wasn't all about luck.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Atlanta Olympics, former University of Tennessee
vaulter Lawrence ``LoJo'' Johnson was the talk of the event.
Hartwig was an afterthought, even though he made the Olympic team.
But ever since, Hartwig has been the preeminent American vaulter
and a factor on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   He was a model of consistency last outdoor season, enjoying 22
clearances of 19 feet or better _ including 15 straight at one
juncture. This indoor season he's cleared 19 feet in all six
outings, and needed to be at his best Saturday against a field that
saw four vaulters clear 19 feet and an impressive nine over 18-4.
</P>
<P>
   Hartwig has worked himself into a groove that likes of which
Tony Gwynn enjoys most baseball seasons. ``I feel like I really
have to screw something up not to jump 19 feet,'' Hartwig said.
</P>
<P>
   His season debuted smartly with an American record clearance of
19-4 3/4 at a vaulters-only competition in Reno, Nev. Next up is a
chance to raise the record again at the world indoor championships.
But before leaving the Georgia Dome, Hartwig made three attempts
Saturday at 19-8 1/4 _ the first of which was strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to make it,'' said Hartwig. ``Just a
little timing difference and I go over that bar.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his emergence the last two seasons, Hartwig credits the
arrival on the scene of Johnson _ a black vaulter who broke the
American record while a senior at Tennessee before the Atlanta
Games _ along with his frustration about not getting invited to
major meets in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you see a guy like Lawrence, who obviously has lot of
physical potential, guys are going to step back and say, 'Wow, who
is this guy?'' Hartwig said of Johnson, who finished third. ``He
pushes you. Then, I didn't make the world championship team (in
1997) and I couldn't get into the major meets. I was jumping well,
but in small meets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to beg and plead to get into meets. Now, people are
looking at me as the guy to beat. I enjoy that, cause my confidence
is real high.''

MENIFEE AMONG TOP 10 CANDIDATES FOR KENTUCKY DERBY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla._ Saturday, Act II: In which Menifee, undefeated
in two starts at 2, makes his debut at 3 as one of the top 10
candidates for the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The big, strapping bay colt comes to Gulfstream Park by van from
his training center at Payson Park, 90 miles to the north, and runs
in the eighth race on a program of 12. It is a $34,000 allowance
created to give a horse with the right connections a chance to run
after a six-month layoff prompted by a bone chip in the right knee
_ a deluxe debut in a season of great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no sad twist in the storyline at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Menifee, looking strong and sleek and ranked the 1-2 favorite,
broke slowly from the outside and took maybe half a mile while Pat
Day was positioning him for the run that counts. They turned into
the homestretch, moved up from fourth to second, challenged and
passed Deputy Mac, drew relentlessly ahead in the final sixteenth
of a mile and won by two-and-a-half lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Three up, three down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smart,'' observed Arthur Hancock, the son of the late
Bull Hancock of Claiborne Farm, who owns the colt with Jimmy Stone,
the New Orleans oil and gas executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's honest,'' said Stone. ``He's professional.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also well-bred, a son of Harlan and the mare Anne
Campbell, and a grandson of the celebrated Storm Cat. And, Jimmy
Stone pointed out, in his second start last summer, he outran both
Cat Thief and Lemon Drop Kid, two of the stars of this year's Derby
class.
</P>
<P>
   Eliott Walden, who trains Menifee in a barn that includes
Victory Gallop and Bet Me Best, shepherded his three small children
through the winner's circle and said: ``The way the race looked on
paper, I felt that, if he got beat, it would be because he beat
himself. It's good to know that he is back.''
</P>
<P>
   Menifee was back, all right. He flew the seven furlongs in 1:22
2/5 after they raced the first half-mile in 44 3/5 seconds and
three-quarters of a mile in 1:09 2/5.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, who won the Kentucky Derby in 1982 with Gato del Sol
and in 1989 with Sunday Silence, knows the agony and the ecstasy.
He got a reminder last week when Harlan, the sire of Menifee,
dropped dead on the farm in Kentucky where he stands as a stallion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' he said, ``it's emotional because of Harlan. At 8:15
in the morning, I got a call from my wife in Kentucky telling me
that the worst thing had happened: Harlan fell dead. But you have
to think that in racing, the good follows the bad, so maybe this is
an omen that Menifee will take his place.''
</P>
<P>
   Walden was asked what was next for his prodigy, and replied: ``I
won't bring him back in two weeks for the Florida Derby. We'll look
at either the Tampa Bay Derby or maybe the Rebel Stakes or the
Gotham, something on the weekend of March 20. Then, three weeks
after that, the Blue Grass in Kentucky will be his final prep for
the Kentucky Derby on May 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Menifee was not alone on his comeback day at the races. In two
other allowances, other bright 3-year-old colts also made their
1999 debuts: Shug McGaughey's Treasure Island, who had not raced
since last July, and, one race later, Scotty Schulhofer's Lemon
Drop Kid, who had not raced since running fifth in the Breeders'
Cup Juvenile last November.
</P>
<P>
   In the usual manner of Derby hopefuls, their results were mixed.
Treasure Island, a son of Danzig and grandson of Northern Dancer,
never got untracked and finished fifth. Lemon Drop Kid, after
wasting some ground trying to jump over shadows on the track,
straightened out and finished strongly, three and a half lengths in
front of Cryptodiplomacy. He ran the mile and a sixteenth in 1:44
3/5.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed me what I thought he was _ a good horse,''
Schulhofer said, and then aimed his horse for the herd of hopefuls
headed for Kentucky. ``Next? The Blue Grass, and then the Kentucky
Derby.''

TEXAS-BRED BEGALA COUNTS WHITE HOUSE TENURE AS `EXTRAORDINARY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Come Monday, Paul Begala's toughest problem will be
figuring out how to pack the nine-point buck whose stuffed head
looms disconcertingly out of place in his cramped office in the
White House basement.
</P>
<P>
   Into a box it will go along with his photograph of Barbara
Jordan, his autographed picture of Mickey Mantle, the portrait of
his wife and three sons and the photograph of him holding a trout
he caught last year on vacation just after he learned his boss, the
president of the United States, had been lying to him and the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   Begala, 37, a boyish but scrappy Texan who grew up in Missouri
City, will be leaving his high-powered post as counselor to, and a
top spinmeister for the president to take a teaching position at
Georgetown University and write a monthly column for George
Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to make a difference. I believe I've
contributed to a remarkably successful administration,'' said
Begala, citing accomplishments such as a balanced budget and more
teachers in the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   His departure closes a political circle, bent more like a roller
coaster rail, and leaves the president without one of his most
ardent and earliest supporters. His tenure also is a meditation on
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Begala joined Clinton's presidential campaign in 1991 as a
political strategist with his then-partner James Carville, and
served as an unofficial adviser until 1995. He left for Texas after
a brief falling out with White House officials but returned with an
official appointment in 1997 just in time to help save Clinton from
the biggest scandal of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``To his credit, the president has apologized for the things he
did that set all this in motion,'' Begala said. ``That's all I can
ask. It's up to each individual to decide whether he or she can
find it in their hearts to forgive him. I have and for me it's
easier than most because of this debt of loyalty that I owe him.''
</P>
<P>
   A debt of loyalty?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Lord, look at me,'' he exclaims, arms wide. ``There's a
lot of able, talented, bright people in their early 30s who don't
get to go to work in the White House, who don't get to go to the
state dinner for the prime minister of Great Britain, or meet
Nelson Mandela or Vaclav Havel or Jacques Chirac or the pope
himself. The opportunities he (Clinton) has given me just have been
extraordinary. I can't ever repay him.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming from others, such sentiments might seem disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   But Begala, who wears kangaroo-hide cowboy boots with his suits
and drives a decade-old Ford Bronco, displays such an earnestness
and enthusiasm, whether talking about the Texas Longhorns or the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul is very old school, a very traditional sense of loyalty.
He's from a very traditional form of Catholicism. He has a very
kind of traditional view of the world,'' Carville said of his
former partner.
</P>
<P>
   Carville and Begala first met during the failed 1984 campaign of
Texas Democrat Lloyd Doggett for the Senate. Their informal
partnership lasted through Clinton's election when the eccentric
Carville emerged as a media star.
</P>
<P>
   David Begala, the oldest of five siblings who owns a
construction company in Houston and takes him hunting, calls his
brother a crusader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of Paul's nature is to be a champion of the underdog,''
David Begala said, referring often to his pride in his brother's
public service.
</P>
<P>
   The Begalas attended high school in Sugar Land, home of Clinton
nemesis Tom DeLay, the House majority whip. His mother and
stepfather now live outside of Dallas, and his father is moving to
a new home in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Begala should feel some kinship to the whitetail hanging
over his desk.
</P>
<P>
   From January through August 1998, Begala emerged as Clinton's
most public and most combative defender against charges of a sexual
affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   He jumped from talk show to talk show and absorbed shots from
the media as the most public face among the White House defenders.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated the president's denials of a sexual relationship
with Monica Lewinsky. He attacked independent counsel Kenneth Starr
as corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   But, Begala also joined the camp of advisers calling on the
president to apologize to the nation Aug. 17, the day Clinton
admitted to the affair and defiantly lashed out at Starr without
apologies to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But he stakes no claim to victimhood. ``I refuse to whine,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he does speak of the ``dark moments'' during the scandal.
Begala often could be seen around the White House at the height of
the scandal with his eyes puffy and red from lack of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   After the president's August confession, Begala took his wife
and sons on a two-week vacation in Wyoming. He shaved his beard at
wife Diane's suggestion. He withdrew from television appearances on
Clinton's behalf and pondered his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go through a period to arrive at a place where I
could forgive. But I know I made the right decision,'' Begala said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what the president did was manifestly wrong but what
others tried to do in response to that wrong was even more
outrageous because what they tried to do was attack the
Constitution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the White House and resumed his defense of the
president as Republicans attempted to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal integrity is the essence of Paul,'' said Doug Sosnik,
also a senior adviser to Clinton, echoing the ``old school'' traits
voiced by Carville.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a boyish sweetness to him and a strong belief in right
and wrong,'' Sosnik said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Martin, chairman of Austin-based Public Strategies where
Begala worked from 1995 until 1997, recalled his ``almost childlike
excitement'' at the prospect of returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul is one of the best shapers of a message of anyone I've
ever met, and the ability to do that in a campaign and under fire
is a rare talent,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   But, the high point of his career was not helping Clinton win
the presidency in 1992 but twice meeting Pope John Paul II, for
whom his eldest son is named.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States introduced me to the pope.
I'm a Catholic, and I try to live my faith. I certainly practice
it. There's just nothing professionally that can compare to that.
It speaks to why I have this abiding loyalty for the president. He
didn't need to do that. He didn't need to introduce me and say nice
things to the Holy Father. But he did,'' Begala said.
</P>
<P>
   He's leaving, not because of the scandal but because it's time
to move. He likely will be joined soon by other top Clinton aides
as the exodus that had been frozen by the impeachment trial thaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been unbelievably challenging,'' Begala said of the past
13 months.

 &HT;    Auburn's Ellis best coach; Arizona's Terry best player
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ March Madness is finally here but before we proceed,
let's hand out some regular-season awards.
</P>
<P>
   COACH OF THE YEAR: Despite last Wednesday's loss to Arkansas,
Auburn's Cliff Ellis gets the nod for winning the SEC championship
and getting the Tigers into the NCAA Tournament for the first time
since 1988. Honorable mention: Rick Barnes, Texas; Jim O'Brien,
Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYER OF THE YEAR: 1. Jason Terry, Arizona: The Wildcat point
guard leads the Pac-10 in scoring (22 points a game), assists (5.6)
and free throw percentage (.865). He is a reason a team with five
freshmen in its rotation is ranked in the top 10. Honorable
mention: Elton Brand, Duke; Andre Miller, Utah; Mateen Cleeves,
Michigan State; Chris Porter, Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   TOP CONFERENCE: Big Ten, with seven legitimate NCAA teams
(Michigan State, Wisconsin, Purdue, Ohio State, Iowa, Minnesota,
Indiana).
</P>
<P>
   FRESHMAN OF THE YEAR: Corey Magette, Duke. Averaged 10.6 points
in only 17.3 minutes per game as a reserve on the nation's No. 1
team. DePaul's Quentin Richardson is a close second.
</P>
<P>
   TOP NEWCOMER: A tie between JUCO transfers Chris Porter of
Auburn and Steve Francis of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   MOST DISAPPOINTING TEAMS: Rhode Island, Kansas, Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   GAME OF THE YEAR: Princeton 50, Penn 49 on Feb. 9. Princeton
rallied from a 33-9 halftime deficit to win. Honorable mention:
Duke 92, St. John's 88 in overtime on Jan. 24 at Madison Square
Garden. It had the feel of a regional championship final.
</P>
<P>
   BEST COMEBACK: Texas, which went from 14-17 a year ago to Big 12
champions under first-year coach Rick Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   THE GRAPEVINE
</P>
<P>
   Appalachian State coach Buzz Peterson and Duke assistant Quinn
Snyder are the early favorites to replace Vanderbilt basketball
coach Jan van Breda Kolff, who is resigning after the season.
Peterson is a former North Carolina player and Vandy athletics
director Todd Turner is a Carolina grad.
</P>
<P>
   One hitch if the 'Dores want to hire Peterson, who led the Apps
to a 19-7 record this season. Peterson is tight with former Vandy
coach and Dean Smith assistant Eddie Fogler, now at South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   While at Vanderbilt, Fogler's relationship with chancellor Joe
Wyatt was strained at best. Fogler may advise against a trip to
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Duke sophomore guard William Avery of Augusta says he would turn
pro if he is assured of being a lottery pick. Avery has had a great
season in his first as a starter but he is no lottery pick.
</P>
<P>
   The ACC athletics directors have no plans to boycott Auburn

   Among the changes from the football rules committee this week
was the elimination of all bandanas worn under the helmet. It may
seem trivial, but it became such a problem several years ago that
some of conferences on the West Coast passed a rule to ban them.
Turned out that some of the players were in gangs and using the
bandanas to show their colors. In a survey of coaches, 85 percent
said they wanted the bandanas eliminated, according to Georgia
athletics director Vince Dooley, chairman of the rules committee.
</P>
<P>
   The bandana decision is just part of an NCAA trend toward
consistency in the uniforms. This season, for instance, players
will have to wear jerseys tucked in their pants. No more cut-offs.
Next season, any hand pads or gloves must be gray.

   JASPER, Texas _ When the fog lifted in the Piney Woods on Friday
morning, local churches were preparing for the weekend's
activities: a black history month celebration at Greater New Bethel
Baptist, where James Byrd Jr.'s family worships; a spaghetti supper
at St. Michael's Catholic, which has reached out to his killer's
ailing father.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Joe Bob Golden was relaxing after a chicken
soup dinner brought in by friends the night before, defense lawyers
C. Haden ``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr. and Brack Jones were sleeping for the
first time in days, and Dan Rather was flying back to the East
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to take a little time off,'' said Jasper County
District Attorney Guy James Gray, ``take my wife somewhere, hit a
few golf balls and drink a little whiskey.''
</P>
<P>
   He can because John William ``Bill'' King, convicted last week
of capital murder for dragging Byrd to death behind a pickup, is
headed to death row.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the television satellite trucks have abandoned
their spaces outside the Jasper County Courthouse and city workers
have pulled up the one-hour parking signs around the square, this
timber town of 8,000 knows the quiet won't last long.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Byrd, 20, summed it up when a predominantly white jury
announced the fate of the 24-year-old racist who tortured and
killed his disabled father.
</P>
<P>
   ``One down,'' he said, ``two to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Still to go are King's high school buddy, Shawn Allen Berry, and
his former prison mate, Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., who will be
tried separately in the coming months for Byrd's kidnapping and
murder. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, as word of King's sentence filtered down to
the courthouse lawn, Cribbs and Jones were asked what advice they
could give to the lawyers representing King's co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a job pumping gasoline,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back and go to med school,'' added an exhausted Cribbs.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday morning, Jasper's most famous lawyer, Joe Tonahill,
had some words of his own. Tonahill, who made his name defending
Jack Ruby, is retired now, but even if he hadn't already left the
courtroom behind, he said, ``I would have run away from these cases
as fast as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   And if appointed to represent one of Byrd's killers in the face
of the evidence stacked against them? ``I would have taken him up
to the top of the courthouse,'' he said, ``and told him just to
take a dive straight down, head first.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jasper woke up June 7 to find James Byrd Jr.'s dismembered
remains in the middle of Huff Creek Road, outside the gates to a
rural black cemetery, everyone started talking. Steven Scott
recalled seeing the 49-year-old black man the night before,
climbing into the bed of a gray pickup on Martin Luther King
Boulevard. Three white men, he said, were in the cab.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, Berry, then a 23-year-old manager at the local
movie theater, was in custody, pointing the finger at King and
fellow white supremacist Brewer. Berry later led police to the
murder weapon, a 24 1/2-foot logging chain that had been cleaned at
a Jasper carwash and thrown into a shallow pit outside a friend's
trailer home.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that Berry had his best opportunity to strike a
bargain and save his life. If he would testify against his
co-defendants, painting a picture that minimized his own
participation in the heinous killing, prosecutors said they would
recommend he be spared from the death penalty. Berry declined.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as the jury of 11 whites and one black convicted
King, Gray said his offer was permanently withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a chance, but that was before the DNA results came
back,'' the prosecutor said. ``No sir. A jury is going to decide
all three of these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry's defense attorney, Joseph C. ``Lum'' Hawthorn and
Brewer's court-appointed lawyer, Douglas Barlow, both of Beaumont,
had spent several days in the gallery, watching Gray and assistant
prosecutor Pat Hardy play their hand against King, and by
extension, against their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always to a lawyer's advantage to see a preview of the
evidence and to see the prosecutors before a jury,'' Barlow said.
</P>
<P>
   What they saw could be devastating to their cases: DNA evidence
linking all three suspects to the crime scene, Byrd's blood on
clothing and shoes found at their apartment, and numerous writings
by King, implicating his friends.
</P>
<P>
   King's genetic blueprint was found on a cigarette butt at the
crime scene and a drop of Byrd's blood was recovered from his
sandal, but the physical evidence against Berry and Brewer may be
even more solid.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Baechtel, a DNA expert with the FBI in Washington,
testified at King's trial that the victim's blood was found on
Berry's jeans, shirt and one boot from the apartment where the
suspects were staying, and Byrd's flesh and blood stained the
undercarriage of Berry's 1982 Ford pickup. Berry's DNA was on a
cigarette at the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   That evidence, along with Berry's statement to police, tools
engraved with his name discovered at the crime scene and extensive
tire track prints lifted from Huff Creek Road, doesn't bode well
for Berry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always conceded that he was there,'' Hawthorn said.
``He led police to the chain. It was his cooperation that led them
to King and Brewer. He was there, but he didn't participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot judge Shawn Berry by the evidence presented against
Bill King. Shawn Berry is nothing like Bill King, and anybody in
Jasper who knows Shawn or has heard of Shawn will tell you that.
His case should stand or fall on its own merits.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick DeGuerin, a veteran criminal defense lawyer from Houston
who is not involved in the Byrd case, agreed that the key to
defending Berry and Brewer will be in separating them from King.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can do that,'' he said, ``I don't think they have a
ghost of a chance of escaping conviction, but they might have a
chance to save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blame it all on King,'' DeGuerin advised. ``Berry came forward
first, and he's just a kid. He has a good chance of saying he was
afraid of King and was intimidated into this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, King was the ringleader. You've got to put it all
on him and say, `It's easy to see how Berry could have been
influenced.'''
</P>
<P>
   If that is the defense, Berry could have an easier time in his
hometown than King had, DeGuerin said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn agrees and has not sought a change of venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Jasper know him. They know his family, and they know
his reputation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At King's trial, prosecutors revealed some of the physical
evidence against Brewer as well. Baechtel, the DNA expert,
testified that Brewer smoked a cigarette and drank a Bud Light at
the crime scene. Byrd's blood was found on Brewer's tennis shoe.
</P>
<P>
   King's writings, including a note he passed to Brewer in jail,
also could be introduced against Brewer, 31. In the note, which
jailers intercepted and photocopied for prosecutors, King assured
Brewer that even though Berry had ratted on them, they would escape
the death penalty or die proud, as martyrs for the white
supremacist cause.
</P>
<P>
   DeGuerin said Barlow's challenge will be to distance his client
from King as much as possible, even though the two ex-cons belonged
to the same racist prison gang. ``Try to show that Brewer was
horrified by what King did that night, and shocked when King,
through his writings, tried to implicate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, that could backfire if Brewer responded to the
notes and incriminated himself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer is from Sulphur Springs and was unknown in Jasper before
the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be good for him if his case ends up in Jasper,''
DeGuerin said. ``He basically has a clean slate. You can re-create
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But DeGuerin said moving the case out of Jasper County, as
Barlow has requested, would be his first choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere in that town is, `We've got to redeem the name
of our town and prove we're not racists. The whole world is
watching,''' DeGuerin said. ``All three of these cases should have
been moved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gray is determined to keep the trials right here if he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a bombshell that dropped on our community. It could
have happened anywhere in the country, but it fell in our laps,''
he said last week. ``A horrible thing happened here, and we didn't
want to run from it. It's our responsibility to deal with it. We'll
take care of our own mess.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Byrd family will see that they do. ``We'll be here every
day,'' said Byrd's sister, Mylinda Washington. ``We'll do whatever
it takes to do this for our brother. He would do it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington said it was extremely difficult to listen to the
testimony at King's trial, which was often so chilling and
disgusting that it drove some family members from the courtroom in
tears and made others physically ill. But she said her family's
religious beliefs and love for each other held them together during
the first trial and will see them through two more.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm having a hard time, I just tell myself anything we've
been through is mild in comparison to the torture that my brother
suffered,'' she said. ``We can do this. We'll be here.''

CALIFORNIA GOP GRAPPLES TO PATCH WOUNDS OF DEFEAT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 7th graf to add Lungren quote.)   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Last November, the California Republican
Party suffered its worst defeat in 40 years, losing races for
governor, U. S. Senator and nearly every other statewide office,
and shrinking its minority by five seats in the State Assembly and
two in the Senate. So as party regulars gathered for their winter
convention here this weekend, still licking their wounds and
spoiling for fights over abortion and their future leadership, a
certain gallows humor prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got this circular firing- squad thing just about
perfected,'' said Dan Schnur, once an aide to former Gov. Pete
Wilson and one of the state's snappier wordsmiths, who dryly
referred to the latest round of clashes between the party's
moderate and conservative wings here as an exercise in ``semiannual
self-immolation.''
</P>
<P>
   Because this is California, crucible of trends, with its newly
moved-up presidential primary election on March 7, 2000, there was
no shortage of interested witnesses to the festivities. A parade of
half a dozen presidential contenders arrived to press the flesh and
test the waters in a climate of soul-searching that seemed
emblematic of the party's internal post-impeachment struggles
around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to admit it, but what happens in California happens in
the West; it's the 800-pound gorilla,'' said Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, who warned the delegates on Friday night: ``Scorched-earth
Republican primaries will lead directly to an Al Gore presidency,
and to Democratic control of one or both houses of Congress. Don't
let us go down the road of mindlessly destroying each other.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain made no direct mention in his speech of the California
Republicans' current fight: a rare contested election for party
chairman and vice chairman, driven in large measure by differences
over abortion. But in an interview afterward, he acknowledged that
he was ``keenly aware of the battles that are going on in this
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest battle flared last month when the party's current
vice chairman, John McGraw, a Silicon Valley software executive who
would normally be a shoo-in for the top post, was quoted in a San
Francisco Roman Catholic publication describing ``killing our
babies'' as ``the issue of the century.'' He later said his views
reflected his ``personal moral priorities'' and not those of his
party.
</P>
<P>
   But the party's gubernatorial nominee, former state Attorney
General Dan Lungren, a staunch opponent of abortion, lost to Gray
Davis by 20 points last November. Today, in one of his rare
post-election appearances, Mr. Lungren told the delegates: ``We
ought not to hang our heads in shame.'' But his own campaign
manager has since said that it would be difficult for any
Republican who opposes abortion rights to win the governorship. So
party moderates decided to mount the first challenge in a
chairman's race in 28 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's suicidal,'' said Bob Larkin, an insurance agent from Simi
Valley and former chairman of the Ventura County party, who notes
that the state party has lost 600,000 members since 1990, going
from nearly 40 percent of the state's registered voters to just
under 35 percent. ``The right wing doesn't care if they lose.
They'd rather be right and pure. But we're losing members at the
rate of 415 a day. We'll lose more Republicans over the time of
this convention than will be here as delegates.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin and other moderates are supporting a rump slate of
Nicholas Bavaro, a Modesto businessman, for the two-year term of
chairman, and former Assemblyman Brooks Firestone, a winery owner
and heir to the Firestone tire fortune from Santa Barbara County,
for vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone lost a bitter congressional primary last year to a
fellow assemblyman, Tom Bordonaro, who harshly attacked Firestone's
support for abortion rights and gun control but then went on to
lose the general election to the Democratic candidate, Lois Capps.
</P>
<P>
   ``That showed me an example of a party being ineffective, and,
yes, part of what I'm trying to do is prevent that from happening
to anyone else,'' Firestone said.
</P>
<P>
   Because party rules stipulate that the next chairman must come
from the northern part of the state, Firestone could not run for
chairman this time. But he is given some chance of defeating Shawn
Steel, a conservative lawyer from Beverly Hills, in the voting on
Sunday for vice chairman, thus positioning himself to run for
chairman the next time around. Meanwhile, McGraw and his
conservative faction are still expected to defeat the moderate
Bavaro for the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Friday night, McGraw, 36, said he believed
his remarks on abortion had been misconstrued, but insisted, ``I
have that behind me now,'' and said he was determined to send a
message of tolerance. ``I'm a neophyte at this, and that was not
the most politic statement,'' he said, adding that part of the
party's self-examination was the natural consequence of defeat.
``Hey, we got a whipping,'' he said. ``Nothing easy about it. But
what are you going to do? Quit?''
</P>
<P>
   The party's differences over issues from abortion to gun
control, affirmative action and the environment are nothing new. In
fact, they persisted in the eight-year tenure of Wilson, whose
support for abortion rights and acceptance of a tax increase to
close a crushing budget gap early in his first term bitterly
rankled many conservatives. But because of Wilson's powers as
titular head of the party, he was able to paper over the
disagreements to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always had these problems, but because we had the
governorship and a staff that worked really hard to keep the
tensions below the surface, they haven't popped up,'' said State
Sen. Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, regarded as one of the party's
cannier hands, who has endorsed both Firestone and Steel.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Goodman, a former Wilson aide who is close to Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, a no-show at the gathering here, said the state
party ``has to decide that winning is more important than ideology,
and ultimately, rather than having internal divisive fights, we
ought to be coming together to nominate the strongest possible
national candidate to play and win in California.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone at the convention was singing that tune. The
California Young Americans for Freedom distributed yellow fliers
denouncing ``Vichy Republicans'' for being willing to ``surrender''
on abortion, ``capitulate'' on gun control, ``run away'' from
school vouchers and ``abandon the elephant mascot and replace it
with a mule.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he had tried to communicate to the delegates that
``it isn't just the message; it's the way we deliver the message,''
and in the interview he expressed distress that the party's core
message of lower taxes, smaller government, deregulation and the
like had lately been overshadowed by more divisive issues, and a
lack of feeling for diversity. ``You've got to not only say these
things,'' he said, ``but you've got to say it in an inclusive
way.''

Galen H. Schalk says he has found three deer infected with bovine

END FIGHTING, U.N. COUNCIL TELLS ETHIOPIA AND ERITREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. Security Council on Saturday demanded
an immediate halt to the fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea,
after Ethiopian forces apparently smashed through the defenses
along its disputed 600-mile border with Eritrea and appeared to be
pushing deeper into the country in the direction of the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
   At an emergency meeting here, the council called on both sides
to refrain from further hostilities and resolve their border
dispute on the basis of the peace plan drawn up by the Organization
for African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   It also welcomed Eritrea's decision Saturday to accept the plan,
which calls for the withdrawal of Eritrean forces from Badme and a
redefinition of the disputed border between the two countries by
neutral experts.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, President Clinton also called on both sides to
make peace on the basis of the African organization's plan and said
the United States would continue to work with them ``to achieve a
peaceful resolution of this conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and senior U.N. officials said the Eritrean army
appeared to have suffered a serious reverse. They expressed concern
that Ethiopia _ which has been landlocked since it ceded its Red
Sea ports of Massawa and Assab to Eritrea in 1993, when it granted
it independence _ might be planning to seize one of them back.
Under this agreement Ethiopia was to have use of those ports, but
that has become impossible with the deterioration in relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ethiopians are an ancient and proud nation that is used to
having access to the sea,'' a senior U.N. official said, pointing
out that most of Ethiopia's trade must now pass through the small
Red Sea nation of Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea's immediate reaction to its military setback, officials
here said, was to tell the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, on
Saturday that it now accepted the peace plan, apparently because it
no longer controls Badme.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a letter to Annan calling for a Security Council meeting,
Eritrea's U.N. representative, Haile Menkerios, also said Ethiopian
forces were now occupying ``sovereign Eritrean territory.'' He
called on the council to condemn ``Ethiopia's territorial ambitions
and aggression'' and send fact-finding observers to the area.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said Ethiopian forces appeared to have advanced
about six miles beyond Badme, a barren, rock-strewn area of little
economic value. With the Eritrean Army apparently in poor shape,
the Ethiopians might now push deeper into the country, they said,
or open another front, perhaps in the Zala Ambassa region, and try
to outflank the remnants of the Eritrean Army.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official in Washington said the fighting
had been heavy in the last four days, with substantial casualties
and a total of about 200,000 soldiers deployed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation of officials from the Organization of African Unity
had been due to arrive Saturday in Asmara, the Eritrean capital, to
discuss the peace plan but never left the organization's
headquarters in Addis Ababa, apparently because of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   After an eight-month lull, the border war between Ethiopia and
Eritrea flared up again this month when Ethiopia opened an
offensive in the Badme area.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic fighting has also been reported around Tsorona, south
of Asmara, and Burre, southwest of Assab.
</P>
<P>
   First reports of the fighting from the capitals of Addis Ababa
and Asmara were confused, with both sides claiming to have
inflicted huge casualties on the enemy.

CEO GRAZIANO CONTINUES TO SEE UPSIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ One of the most important decisions about the
1999 Dodgers took place before the 1998 Dodgers finished playing.
</P>
<P>
   It's when Dodgers President and CEO Bob Graziano decided to hire
Kevin Malone on Sept. 11 rather than wait until the end of the
season. It gave Malone the opportunity to assess the on-field
talent first-hand and gave him an understanding of what was
missing.
</P>
<P>
   It's also why there are very few questions _ the bullpen, the
infield defense, a fifth outfielder _ in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was painful in 1998, but I think because we were able to
accept the pain in 1998 we'll see the benefits in 1999,'' said
Graziano, who arrived in Dodgertown on Saturday. ``The downside to
making (change) after the season was too great to do it then.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two weeks between his hiring and the end of the season,
two necessities were evident: the Dodgers needed a center fielder
and a No.1 starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Voila. Once the free-agent market opened, the Dodgers signed
Devon White and Kevin Brown to fill those voids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely put me in a position where I felt like I had a
head start,'' Malone said of his starting date. ``I'm way ahead of
the game. I probably wouldn't be as confident in what we have on
this team if I didn't start then.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear things and you read stats, but when you can
personally evaluate a player, your convictions are stronger.
Because of that, it helped me be prepared when players started to
be available as free agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrying 11: After discussing the matter with his coaches and
general manager Malone, manager Davey Johnson said it's ``80
percent'' he'll go with 11 pitchers on staff instead of 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on a lot of things, but you have more specialty
people now,'' Johnson said. ``You could get by with less. The way
we're set up, I'm thinking we're probably going with 11.''
</P>
<P>
   Side work for Rojas: Johnson said he wants a secondary set-up
man in case closer Jeff Shaw is overworked _ ``that's when I know
we're rockin' and rollin','' Johnson said _ and that could be
right-hander Mel Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rojas needs to work out a few mechanical problems on
the side, which he'll try to do in the next few days with pitching
coach Charlie Hough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it is getting his arm in position a little quicker,''
Johnson said. ``Occasionally, he's not getting on top of his
fastball. Occasionally, he's not getting on top of his slider and
sometimes he throws a whirly-bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting and waiting: Baseball's collective bargaining agreement
states players don't have to report to training camp until March 1,
but don't expect Shaw to be at Dodgertown before Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the team is upset.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger officials have told Shaw to remain at his Ohio home until
his wife, Julie, gives birth to the couple's third child.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Shortstop Mark Grudzielanek was sporting
a cut above his lip after a bad hop caught him flush on the
face.... The evaluation process should accelerate this week with
intrasquad games Tuesday and Wednesday. The most notable pitcher
scheduled to be used is left-hander Greg Cadaret. Right-handers
Chan Ho Park and Brown are slated to pitch simulated games those
days.

16 IS SWEET ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The joke used to be that making it to the Stanley Cup playoffs
was akin to having your name in the phone book. Everyone made it.
Not to be there every spring was somewhat like having an unlisted
number: You had to request to be left out.
</P>
<P>
   Jokes aside, Edmonton boss Glen Sather suggested recently that
the NHL expand the playoff format to include 20 teams, adding four
to the tournament. The six Canadian squads especially, he said,
could use the potential income boost _ a reality emphasized by the
declining value of the Canadian dollar.
</P>
<P>
   When the league consisted of 21 teams, after the NHL-WHA merger,
a 16-team tournament included nearly 80 percent of the clubs. By
the fall of 2000, the league will have expanded to 30 clubs, which
means a 16-team tournament in 2001 will represent just over half
the league.
</P>
<P>
   In those terms, Sather's plot makes sense. The boost to 20 teams
would mean two-thirds of the clubs qualify. It's still a drop from
those Ma Bell sign-up-for-service days of the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But think about it: 20 teams. Stop the insanity. A fifth round
would be added, a best-of-five preliminary series for which some
teams (conference winners, maybe division winners) would receive a
bye. In such a scheme, it's conceivable the Cup winner would have
to win 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   A little perspective on that, here in the Hub of Hockey: The
Bruins have won only 18 postseason games in their nine playoff
series dating back to 1992. Imagine trying to win 19 games within
eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Leave the postseason formula alone. There's a much better
argument to be made against expanding the league to 30 teams. But
it's much too late for that now.
</P>
<P>

   The Leafs and Islanders met Thursday for the first time since
the Bryan Berard-Felix Potvin swap, and the Leafs walked off with a
4-1 victory. Equally chilling for the Islanders had to be the
crowd, announced at 8,355, that media reports estimated to be under
5,000. Coach Bill Stewart: ``I don't like it when we don't put a
product on the ice that's conducive to people paying good,
hard-earned money.'' Stewart is a realist, which is to say he isn't
long for the league. Honesty is the shortest path to unemployment .
. . The Flames presented Theo Fleury with a silver stick last week,
once he became the franchise's all-time leading scorer. The memento
is valued at around $10,000. Upper management in Calgary says it
isn't a fait accompli that they'll lose Fleury as a free agent this
summer. They're willing to offer him big money, probably upwards of
$7 million a year. But if other bidders drive the bidding into the
Pavel Bure range ($9 million-plus per year), their speedy, gritty
winger will be gone. One factor in the Flames' negotiating favor:
Fleury is extremely close to his 13-year-old son, Josh, who also
lives in Calgary, and he doesn't want to be based too far from
southern Alberta . . . Detroit Pistons owner William Davidson _ his
fortune built in the glass (windshield) business _ is poised to buy
the Lightning from Art Williams, who, only weeks after taking
control of the Bolts last spring, proclaimed No. 1 draft pick
Vincent Lecavalier to be the NHL's Michael Jordan (gee, wasn't
Jordan the NBA's Wayne Gretzky?). Davidson was ready to buy the
Lightning last year, but got blindsided by Williams, who swooped in
and signed on the dotted line without knowing the full depth of the
club's debt or ongoing operating expenses. Williams became a quick
study in disaster and now will have to sell to Davidson at a loss _
but at least it will be a hard-number loss (estimated $20 million)
rather than a more devastating drain. The deal could be done as
early as Monday. Rick Dudley, hired last summer as general manager
in Ottawa, was rumored to be hired as Tampa GM when Davidson was
ready to make the deal last year. With Dudley firmly in place in
Ottawa, Davidson is expected to retain GM/coach Jacques Demers and
the rest of the management team, including Jay Feaster and Cliff
Fletcher . . . Actor Tom Hanks and ``Wheel of Fortune's'' Pat Sajak
have signed on for luxury boxes at the Kings/Lakers new arena in
Los Angeles, where one-year leases range from $197,000 to $300,000.
The suites include the usual amenities, including TVs connected to
satellite feeds of any other sports event playing in the country .
. . While on the celebrity beat, singer Celine Dion and actor
Michael Keaton (he of the Batmobile) are just two of the names
linked with Mario Lemieux's possible bid to buy the Penguins. If
nothing else, that would save the Penguins an anthem singer and a
Zamboni driver. But how wise would it be to have a co-owner whose
voice is synonymous with a sinking ship? . . . Edmonton last week
tried another netminder, Steve Passmore, and he played well in a
2-1 loss to the Ducks. ``Years from now,'' he said, ``I can say the
first two goals I allowed were by Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne.''
In depression some three years ago, and tending a bar in Kamloops
(British Columbia), Passmore said he contemplated killing himself,
following the death of his father, a chronic health problem, and
rejection by his girlfriend. He hung in, and after four-plus years
in the minors, finally got his chance. ``I talk to my dad during
every anthem,'' he said. ``Before the game (with the Oilers), I
kind of welcomed him to The Show _ hope he got here on short
notice.''

   He isn't saying this year is the end, but Gretzky has made a
habit this season of presenting friends with autographed sticks as
he's made his way around the league. The Great One handed one to
Sather when the Rangers recently stopped in Edmonton. ``He thanked
me for what I'd done for him,'' said Sather. ``It was pretty
nostalgic. I hope it wasn't his way of saying, `I'm quitting.' ''
Sather suggested that Gretzky should move to Edmonton, put his kids
in school, get his boys in a great hockey program _ and play for
the Oilers. ``But I told him he'd have to play for free, just for
old time's sake,'' said Sather. ``I told it to (Mark Messier) once,
too. I told him he'd be only getting a friend for life.'' . . . The
Canucks finally got Kevin Weekes, their goaltender of the future
acquired in the Bure swap, under contract last week. The pact is
valued around $1.9 million over three years, with the first year a
pro-rated $550,000. There is a chance he'll get his first start
Sunday night against the Sabres, but Garth Snow's revival in net
last week was making it difficult for coach Marc Crawford to make
the switch. Meanwhile, look for Corey Hirsch to be left exposed in
the June expansion draft . . . Mark Tinordi (sprained ankle) isn't
expected back in the Capitals' lineup unless they make the
playoffs, and by that time he may be someone else's property. Many
contenders are looking for help along the back line, prompting
rumors that the Rangers' Ulf Samuelsson and the Oilers' Bo Mironov
will see new environs on or before the March 23 trade deadline.
Dallas and Detroit are especially in need along the Thin Blue Line
. . . A series of injuries behind the Vancouver blue line _ most
notably a Mattias Ohlund shoulder sprain _ prompted the Canucks to
dress ex-Bruin Steve Staios Wednesday night against the Sharks.
Staios promptly wrenched his left knee and won't play for at least
a couple of weeks . . . An Edmonton Sun report Friday had the
Oilers eyeing Boston's Steve Heinze and Don Sweeney for a possible
swap, along with Jim Carey. The only Oiler name brought up in the
report was Mironov, the hard-hitting blue liner who will be an
unrestricted free agent July 1 . . . Word around St. Louis is that
the Blues won't haggle much on contract with Pierre Turgeon, making
$4.6 million this year after winning big in arbitration last
summer, and could just let him walk rather than get slammed again
in arbitration. If so, the slick-but-soft Turgeon, who will be 30
in August, would be free to sign with whomever he pleases. Headed
into the weekend, Turgeon had 43 points in 43 games, leaving him 25
short of 1,000 career points. Let's see, age 30, 1,000 points.
Sounds like a $6 million salary base from here.

   The Blackhawks, who will miss the playoffs for a second year in
a row, finally embraced the inevitable and whacked rookie coach
Dirk Graham only hours after his club lost to the Bruins last
Sunday. Lorne Molleken, former minor league coach for the Oilers,
moved in for relief duty, but the Hawks need a respected, seasoned
coach. They put a feeler out on Terry Murray last year, but club
owner Bill Wirtz swatted that idea away when he heard Murray wanted
real money (upwards of $700,000 a year). It's time to stop the
good-ol'-boy chain and bring in someone like Ted Nolan . . . A
couple of coaching candidates to keep in mind over the next 24
months: Peter Laviolette and Bruce Crowder. Laviolette has worked
wonders with the Baby B's in Providence. Crowder, an ex-Bruin, has
had ample seasoning now with UMass-Lowell and Northeastern. He
doesn't have to go anywhere, and he's never expressed an urge to
return to the pros, but his teams play a professional, smart game.
If he wants it, he should get a shot to return to The Show . . . No
decision yet on whether NHLers will be involved in the 2002 Olympic
mix at Salt Lake City. The subject will be on the top of the agenda
when the International Ice Hockey Federation holds its annual
spring meeting in Norway in mid-May, following the World
Championships. At the same meeting, the IIHF is expected to
finalize plans to slot the World Championship for February in
upcoming years. It would prevent the conflict with soccer in Europe
and not compete for the same sponsorship/TV dollars . . . With
defenseman Darryl Sydor down with a sprained knee, the Stars have
inquired about signing free agent Doug Lidster, the 38-year-old
backliner who finished up last season with the Rangers. How thin is
the market? Lidster, staying in shape with the Canadian national
team, has at least one other club making an offer . . . Anaheim
defenseman Pascal Trepanier, whose uncle is ex-Montreal winger and
coach Mario Tremblay, was headed toward a career as a veterinarian
before turning pro, first with the Colorado organization. ``He's
making more money than fixing sick cats and horses,'' said
Tremblay. With his uncle so much a part of the Habs, Trepanier grew
up with his share of bleu-blanc-et-rouge paraphernalia. ``I'm
embarrassed to say,'' he said, ``I played street hockey with a Guy
Lafleur stick _ I didn't know any better.'' He also wore a pair of
Chris Chelios shoulder pads . . . Ex-Boston University Terrier
Chris Drury has taken to wearing a visor (college redux) after
getting clipped around the eyes three times with sticks. Dave Reid
got him for six stitches. Bryan McCabe cut him for eight. Steve
Washburn carved him for nine. ``He's got more stitches than a
baseball,'' said Avalanche coach Bob Hartley. When Drury was cut by
Reid, referee Kerry Fraser didn't whistle a penalty, contending
that Drury ducked into Reid's shot. ``I'm only 5 feet 7,'' said
Drury, ``I didn't have to duck.'' . . . Hingham's Tony Amonte,
perhaps the Blackhawks' only hope to rebuild the franchise, finally
had his long locks cut last week. He told the hairstylist he wanted
more of the George Clooney look. A few snips later he was Clooned
and groomed.

POWER PLAY TAKES ADVANTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Playing at even strength, the Bruins were a futile lot for much
of Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   When they were on the power play, however, it was a different
story.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins took great advantage of their man-up opportunities,
scoring on three of five chances, and that was enough to propel
them to a 4-3 victory over Washington at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   The power-play snipers were Anson Carter, who tied the game at
1-1 in the second period, and Dmitri Khristich, who scored a pair.
Khristich's first, at 13:10 of the second period, put the Bruins
ahead, 2-1. His second, at 24 seconds of the third period, gave the
Bruins a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Allison got the winner, at even strength, with 4:22
remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The power-play surge couldn't have come at a better time
because, even though the Bruins won, their performance left a lot
to be desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't very nice, but sometimes it's better to win ugly
than lose pretty,'' said Burns. ``It's an ugly win, but we'll
definitely take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Khristich's pair extended his point streak to four games, which
coincides with the current Bruins' roll of 3-0-1. The two goals he
potted Saturday were his 25th and 26th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Khristich said the power-play success, which had been lacking of
late, was the result of keeping it simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power play hasn't done well lately, I think maybe we got a
couple from Joe Thornton's line, but we haven't scored any lately
until today,'' said Khristich. ``It's a real breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did really keep it simple. Just little shots to the net. We
did that and nice things happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bourque echoed those sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're trying to get it to the net and trying to keep
it simple,'' said Bourque. ``Those goals weren't pretty goals. It
just goes to show you that you have to put the puck on net and
things will happen. When you don't, nothing happens. I mean, a shot
on net is never a bad play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see so many weird goals. They're not all highlights or
pretty ones, but getting the puck to the net and crashing the net,
you're going to get opportunities and rebounds. You've got one
extra guy out there so you should outman people in front. Simplest
is always the best way.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the way Burns wants the Bruins to do things when
they're on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand that the power play is only a chance,
it's not a definite goal,'' said Burns. ``Everybody thinks you get
a power play and bang, bang it's in the net. If it was that easy,
we'd have power plays being scored at 50 or 60 percent. Why do we
have power plays _ in the 18 and 19 percent across the board in the
NHL?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's difficult. It's a little bit tougher. You can
have all the patterns you want, but sometimes the simple way is the
better way.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Bruins did it that way and the results were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little bit down and now we're back, we hope,'' said
Khristich. ``The power-play goals were really good for us and
hopefully we'll keep scoring them when we have the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns has been preaching all year that the simple way is the
winning way. Nobody could argue that point Saturday.

PATRIOTS MAY REARM WITH MOBIL QUARTERBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Patriots found out the hard way last season how fragile NFL
quarterbacks are. It hadn't been an issue for them because they had
one of the most durable quarterbacks in the league, Drew Bledsoe,
and a loyal veteran backup, Scott Zolak, who could play in a pinch.
</P>
<P>
   But the ``pinch'' turned into a serious matter when Bledsoe
broke his right index finger late in the season. He won dramatic
games against Buffalo and Miami with the finger heavily bandaged
but wasn't able to play in the last three games of the regular
season or the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   At the most crucial time, the Patriots had to go with Zolak, who
hadn't started a regular-season game for three years. In the end,
the Patriots never really had a chance, and their season ended with
a 25-10 loss to Jacksonville in the wild-card round of the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Now the team's thinking on the quarterback position is changing.
Don't be astonished if the Patriots use one of their two
first-round picks on a quarterback, if the man they want is
available.
</P>
<P>
   That man appears to be Donovan McNabb of Syracuse, a mobile,
strong-armed, athletic quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Would he be available at No. 20 or 28?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question. The other question is, would the Patriots,
who have other needs, use a first-round pick on what essentially
would be a backup player?
</P>
<P>
   Vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier said last week
that the Patriots would draft a quarterback, and he said it may be
early.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's Cade McNown is certainly another quarterback catching
everyone's eye. While originally thought of as an early
second-round pick, McNown has improved his stock with strong
performances at the Senior Bowl and the scouting combine.
</P>
<P>
   He's lefthanded, mobile (4.75 in the 40), escapes pressure, and
can throw. What he doesn't have is great size (though he was
measured at a shade under 6 feet 1 inch). But former Patriots
offensive coordinator Larry Kennan, who is running McNown's
workouts, said, ``He's built a lot like Steve Young. He's a tough
kid with the type of attitude you love to see in a quarterback. He
has a strong arm. I've got to believe people are thinking of him as
a first-rounder now.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier thinks as many as five quarterbacks could go in the first
round, possibly Tim Couch, Akili Smith, Daunte Culpepper, McNabb,
and McNown. Also enticing is Washington's Brock Huard. The Patriots
love Syracuse players and would love to see McNabb fall to them,
but if McNown were there, how could they pass on him?
</P>
<P>
   Grier said he would look for a quarterback who was the opposite
of Bledsoe, which means mobility is important.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget, the Patriots may address their running back
situation with a trade, a free agent, or even a later-round pick
(as they did the year they got Curtis Martin in the third round).
They would love to draft an offensive lineman, a defensive lineman,
a linebacker, and a receiver or tight end fairly high. They have
five picks in the first three rounds, and if they do it right, they
have a chance to fill in most of their needs there.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also are after a veteran quarterback, someone in
his 30s, who can back up Bledsoe and perhaps help during games.
They will see what becomes available after June 1, when teams begin
to cut veterans with big cap numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Free agent Steve Bono would be considered, as would Jeff
Hostetler, who is currenly trying to get work in his hometown of
Pittsburgh behind Kordell Stewart. The Patriots also are intrigued
by Warren Moon, but he would like to go someplace where he can
contend for a starting job. If the Steelers go with Hostetler, then
Mike Tomczak would be available.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Punter/quarterback Tom Tupa, who signed with the New York Jets
as a free agent, never wanted to leave the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best environment I've ever played in,'' he said.
``I've never been around a group of players that liked each other
so much and did things together off the field. That's why it was so
disappointing to me that they didn't make more of an effort to get
a contract done with me. I thought I put up good numbers in my
three years there and I felt comfortable there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tupa said he felt comfortable going to the Jets because of his
relationship with Bill Parcells, his former coach in New England;
Bill Belichick, his coach in Cleveland and a former assistant in
New England; and the many ex-Patriots and ex-Browns who have made
their way onto the New York roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to New England, I didn't know anyone except Coach
Belichick, but it turned out to be a great experience,'' said Tupa.
``I'll miss all of the guys and all of the people my family met and
got to know there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tupa will now get a look at the Jets-Patriots rivalry from the
other side; he never felt the Patriots were ``psyched out'' by the
Jets after Parcells took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think so,'' said Tupa. ``When we played the
Jets, the players in our locker room were always sky-high before
the game. I thought we played good games against them except for
the last one when we had so many injuries. I don't know why we
didn't beat them more because we had so much talent here.''
</P>
<P>
   His assessment of Pete Carroll: ``Pete's a good football coach.
He's always compared to Bill, and that's not fair. Bill is one of
the greatest coaches of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tupa said Parcells has told him he will be the backup to Vinny
Testaverde, which justifies the four-year, $6.1 million contract,
with a $1.8 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa thought he might go to Cleveland, his hometown, because of
his relationship with new coach Chris Palmer. But the Jets' deal
was too good to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   He'll miss Bledsoe, his closest friend and a frequent victim of
Tupa's on the golf course and the pool table. Tupa even offered to
buy Bledsoe's new multimillion-dollar home in Medfield, which
Bledsoe may have to sell with the team moving to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I offered him a million for it,'' quipped Tupa. ``He didn't
like that too much.''
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, the Patriots probably made out well with
the change of punters. For half the money, they signed Lee Johnson,
who is close to Tupa's peer as a punter and also an excellent
kickoff man. The only thing he isn't is a quarterback, but Tupa
threw only two passes for the Patriots in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa's average salary over the length of his deal will be $1.526
million, while Johnson's will be $666,667. Johnson's cap number
will be $633,333 next season and rise to $683,334 by 2001. Tupa's
cap hit is $850,000 in '99 but jumps to $1.6 million in 2000, $1.8
million in 2001, and $1.85 million in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, Johnson has punted 377 times, has placed
101 balls inside the 20-yard line (27 percent), has forced 46
touchbacks (12 percent), and has averages of 43.8 yards gross and
35.9 yards net. In addition, he has kicked off 242 times, with 33
touchbacks (14 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Tupa punted 360 times in the same period, placing 97 inside the
20 (27 percent), with 47 touchbacks (13 percent), a 43.5-yard gross
average, and a 35.8-yard net average.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Johnson had a 44.7-yard gross average and 35.6
yards net, while Tupa was 44.5 gross and 35.4 net.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   From Woolf to Wolf is the best way to describe Andrew Brandt's
journey the past month. A few weeks ago he was Ricky Williams's
agent, working for Woolf Associates in Boston. As Williams moved
away from Woolf and toward rapper Master P, Brandt parted company
with Woolf, and almost immediately was hired by Green Bay Packers
vice president Ron Wolf as director of finance and football
operations. ``It's certainly different being on the other side
having to deal with agents and trying to structure deals based on
the salary cap from this end,'' said Brandt, who has already closed
some big deals and is beginning work on franchise player Antonio
Freeman. Wolf needed a money man and found Brandt impressive in
their past dealings. Maybe this will start a trend of agents being
hired on the other side . . . Chip Myers was a friend to many in
the NFL. The Vikings' new offensive coordinator died at 53 of a
heart attack at his suburban Minneapolis home last week, leaving a
wife, five children, and many grandchildren. As an assistant coach,
Myers had no benefits except a $250,000 life insurance policy
provided by the NFL. Kennan, who is executive director of the NFL
Coaches Association, will fight for more benefits for assistants in
the future. He also said that coaches around the league will likely
put together a fund for Myers's family. ``We'll do whatever it
takes,'' said Kennan. ``This is a tragedy. Chip was loved by all. A
great man and a great football coach.'' The Vikings will likely
replace Myers by promoting Ray Sherman, who was hired to be
quarterbacks coach after being fired as Pittsburgh's offensive
coordinator . . . The NFL almost has to do something to help the
Patriots in the Robert Edwards situation. The team has sent a
letter to the league formally requesting compensation and
salary-cap relief for the loss of Edwards, who may never play
again. The Edwards case almost certainly will kill the ``Beach
Bowl'' game and may have some impact on the future of the Pro Bowl
if the league doesn't do something about the liability issue.
Edwards, meanwhile, has returned to Georgia. It will be five weeks
before he's able to walk again, and then he starts a very long and
probably painful journey back . . . The Patriots quietly
restructured Chris Slade's contract to free up more cap room. By
guaranteeing his 1999 salary at $2 million, they were able to
spread that over a four-year period. That left them about $800,000
under the salary cap, ample room to be able to get Adam Vinatieri's
deal done.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots appear to be serious about Heath Irwin as the
starting center. Enticing, however, is 10-year veteran Mark
Stepnoski, a five-time Pro Bowler who may not return to Tennessee.
Stepnoski started his career in Dallas and said he'd be willing to
return to the Cowboys at a hometown discount. The Patriots have had
preliminary discussions with Stepnoski but they probably wouldn't
pay big money for him . . . Another Syracuse player who might be on
the Patriots' radar screen is fullback/tight end Ron Konrad. He's
the top-rated fullback on most lists, but at the end of his combine
workouts, he gave a private workout for teams as a tight end.
Konrad is 6-4, 251 pounds, and would seem to fit nicely in the
``H-back'' set-up the Patriots use at times. If they lose Lovett
Purnell as a restricted free agent (Baltimore?), the Patriots would
need another pass-catcher type behind Ben Coates. Konrad could be
their man . . . Todd Collins will be in St. Louis Monday for his
second visit with the Rams. It appears the Rams will sign Collins
if they lose linebacker Roman Phifer to the Browns. Losing Collins
would be a bigger blow to the Patriots than they think. ``It would
have been nice to finish my career there,'' said Collins. ``I don't
think they want me back. They haven't even talked to us about
anything. I loved it there, I really did. I thought we had a good
group of linebackers and we'd played together for a long time. It's
a shame to break that up. But the Rams have made me feel like they
want me. I know people think it's all about the money, but for me
it's knowing an organization really wants me. I always felt that in
New England until now.'' Collins wanted to get one more thing off
his chest: He said the reason he took the 1995 season off wasn't
that he wanted to get away from Parcells. ``Bill had nothing to do
with it,'' said Collins. ``It's one of those stories everybody just
ran with and sometimes it's not worth trying to set people
straight. I enjoyed Bill very much. I really enjoyed playing for
Pete as well.'' . . . Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi, who is
representing himself in negotiations, has been offered a four-year,
$7.4 million deal with a $2 million signing bonus . . . Los Angeles
is expected to be awarded the next expansion franchise, even though
there's been no agreement on the stadium site. Houston will have
some support (that stadium deal is even better than Hartford), and
it eventually will get a franchise, either through relocation or
expansion. After Al Davis is told he doesn't own the LA market, he
may wind up in Houston. He's also been talking to people in
Chicago.

<P>
   With wide-brimmed straw hat, hard-set eyes on a sun-spackled
face, Kentucky whiskey drawl, and the dust of countless diamonds on
the soles of his shoes, Eddie Haas is a guy who once played with
Hank Aaron and Ernie Banks and managed Dale Murphy, but the better
part of his days are now spent evaluating talent for Red Sox
general manager Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   During the season, he scouts big leaguers, but it is here,
standing behind a batting cage watching what the Red Sox hope is
their future generation of players, that Haas flashes a rare and
triumphant smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``See the ball come off his bat?'' he said, voice thick with
excitement as line drives as true as summer fly from Mark Fischer's
bat. ``That's the way big leaguers hit the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fischer, like Nomar Garciaparra and Jason Varitek before
him, came to the Red Sox via Georgia Tech, a first-round
``sandwich'' draft pick in 1997 whose progress through the system
was slowed last season by a knee injury that required surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But he worked hard last fall in the team's instructional league,
with Haas taking a special interest. And here, in this
by-invitation-only minicamp of the team's top minor league
prospects, the soon-to-be 23-year-old outfielder has laced a
cloudless morning with sweet promises of the days to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the ticket to a whole lot of money, buddy,'' said Welby
Sheldon ``Buddy'' Bailey, the 42-year-old Virginian and new Sox
minor league field coordinator, as Fischer launched yet another
drive into the left-field screen on a back diamond of the City of
Palms Park complex.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Gardner Jr., the 32-year-old son of the former Sox
infielder and Twins manager whose own managing career is on the
fast track after he was named Midwest League Manager of the Year
last season, had the righthanded-hitting Fischer in Michigan in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn, Fischer, you really hurt that ball,'' he said as
Fischer, whose face is distinguished by eyebrows that belong in the
Politburo, stepped out of the cage.
</P>
<P>
   It is no accident that Duquette, his throat still raw from a flu
that he can't shake, is here this morning, visiting with Kent
Qualls, his new director of player development, instead of a couple
miles up Edison Avenue, where the big leaguers are working out.
Duquette's first job in pro baseball after leaving Amherst College
in 1980 was as an assistant in the Milwaukee Brewers' scouting and
minor league department, and player development remains his first
love.
</P>
<P>
   For Duquette, this is a moveable feast, and not only because of
Fischer. In the infield, the slender shortstop taking ground balls
from Gardner is Adam Everett, the All-American from South Carolina
who was scouting director Wayne Britton's top draft pick last
season. Everett is from Kennesaw, Ga. _ the heart of Newt Gingrich
country _ and was rated the top defensive player in the draft by
Baseball America, the respected trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox gave Everett a $1.75 million bonus to sign, and last
August he played 21 games for short-season Lowell in the New
York-Penn League.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got real smooth action,'' Gardner said of the 22-year-old
who some in the organization believe may be an even better fielder
than Garciaparra. ``The ball jumps into his glove. His feet move
well with the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Garciaparra figures to be the Boston shortstop
for at least a decade, the Sox seem to have an embarrassment of
riches at the position. There also is Julio Guerrero, the brother
of Vladimir Guerrero, the Expos outfielder who Montreal manager
Felipe Alou has said has a chance to be the best player ever to
come out of the Dominican Republic, Sammy Sosa notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Guerrero is just 18, and he is already 6 feet 3 inches
with coltish legs and a torso that hasn't begun to fill out. At
this rate, Guerrero not only will be too big to be a shortstop, he
might be best suited to play small forward. The Red Sox already
anticipate moving him one day to third base or the outfield, just
as they ponder making a third baseman out of Aaron Capista, the
switch-hitting shortstop from Joliet, the Illinois town where Pete
Rose did his prison time.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero may be the rawest of the players here, and as you'd
expect from a Dominican teenager, it's not just his game that needs
work. ``Hello, Julio, how was your winter?'' Duquette said as
Guerrero jogged past. One look at his apologetic smile and a shake
of his head, and it was clear that Guerrero had no idea what his
employer had just said.
</P>
<P>
   It is upon another Georgian, outfielder Dernell Stenson, that
the fondest Red Sox hopes are pinned. Stenson, who was a defensive
lineman in high school in LaGrange, the heart of Georgia football
country, does not turn 21 until June 17, and has just three seasons
of pro ball on his resume since being signed by scouting
cross-checker Kevin Burrell as a third-round pick in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But last season, while playing for the Double A Trenton Thunder,
Stenson hit 24 home runs, which is more than Mo Vaughn ever hit in
the minors. The analogy is not accidental. At 6-1, 230 pounds, with
thighs that resemble redwoods and skin the color of deep mahogany,
Stenson may be the lefthanded power hitter that will most remind
fans of Vaughn while perhaps helping them forget him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Stenson, who figures to play left field for Triple A Pawtucket,
does not hang over the plate the way Vaughn does. Nor is he a
bundle of nervous movement in the batter's box, like Garciaparra.
There is a noticeable trigger mechanism to his swing. Just a
shifting of weight to his powerful back leg, a short stride, and
wrists flashing through the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``His swing is very calm,'' Haas said. ``Very quiet. That's
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The most fragile of all prospects, of course, are the pitchers.
The Sox once thought they had a future Roger Clemens-type in Texas
high schooler Andy Yount, but he shattered a glass in his hand,
cutting tendons in his middle finger, and after numerous
operations, the Sox elected to let him go. Chris Reitsma, the
Canadian kid and second-round pick in 1996, has twice fractured his
elbow; the first time, it snapped like a sapling while he was
delivering a pitch for Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Even 1997's No. 1 draft pick, lefthander John Curtice, already
has undergone shoulder surgery for a frayed labrum, though he is
expected to fully recover. Curtice is the Virginia high schooler
who once dyed his hair green at the suggestion of his mother. Back
then, the Sox knew they were getting a free spirit in the David
Wells mode. What they didn't count on was for Curtice to pack on so
many pounds, his body becoming Wellsian, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been addressed,'' Bailey said, sternness creeping into
his voice. ``He's a gifted guy, and we're not going to send him out
of here, even if his arm is healthy, if he's not in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Peek at the future
</P>
<P>
   Herm Starrette, another Appalachian-bred member of the Sox
instructional staff, was the team's bullpen coach until being
reassigned last season. Now, Starrette, a native of North Carolina,
oversees the in-season rehabilitation of pitchers in Fort Myers. On
this day, he is talking in rapturous tones about Jerome Gamble, a
fourth-round pick last season who turns 19 on April 5.
</P>
<P>
   Gamble is Deep South _ Alexander City, Ala. _ a strapping, 6-2,
200-pounder built like a young Bob Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot,'' said Starrette, ``this kid is better than sex. He's
got everything _ fastball, nasty curveball, changeup. All he's got
to do is pitch. The best thing to do with him is leave him alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pitchers here are the kids who will start in the
lower minor classifications, and Starrette says there are plenty of
good ones. He mentions a couple of college lefthanders, Andy
Hazlett and Mike Maroth, as well as an undrafted sleeper, Mike
Mowel, a 19-year-old Connecticut kid (East Hartford) who showed
some promise at Lowell last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sonofagun is going to be good,'' Starrette said of Mowel.
</P>
<P>
   The hope, of course, is that enough of these kids will indeed be
good enough to make it one day on Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot to look forward to,'' the 60-year-old Starrette
said. ``Barring injury, we should have some good players in
Boston.''

NASCAR ABOUT TO JOIN BIG LEAGUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the heels of the most-watched Daytona 500 in history _ CBS
drew a 9.5 rating and 25 share on Feb. 14 _ NASCAR officials are
taking a bold step to capitalize on the popularity of their Winston
Cup series by consolidating their broadcast rights.
</P>
<P>
   The move, announced Wednesday, will enable NASCAR, the only
sport to see its TV ratings rise each year this decade, to command
a hefty rights fee, more in line with the NFL, NBA, NHL, and Major
League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``By retaining and negotiating the rights, we will be able to
develop new strategic values and new media products that would not
have been possible under our old approach,'' said Mike Helton,
NASCAR's chief operating officer. ``(This) decision will continue
to propel the growth of the sport well into the next century, and
we believe it will significantly benefit the entire industry, and
particularly our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   News of NASCAR's decision was greeted enthusiastically on Wall
Street, as several racing-related stocks traded at near 52-week
highs Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under NASCAR's old approach, track owners were allowed to
negotiate their own television deals, which now generate $100
million in fees for 34 races.
</P>
<P>
   While NASCAR will not approach the NFL's $17.9 billion TV deal,
it could, given its soaring ratings and popularity, land a network
package worth $500 million-$750 million, about as much as ABC paid
for the NHL rights.
</P>
<P>
   But those are conservative estimates.
</P>
<P>
   If a bidding war were to ensue among CBS, which now televises
the Daytona 500; ABC/ESPN, whose network/cable tandem could provide
programming on two fronts; NBC, which would be looking to add a new
sports vehicle after losing the NFL; and Fox Sports, which has
emerged as a significant player, then rights fees could soar.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even as high as $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, by contrast, NASCAR received just $3 million for the
rights to 28 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hell of a deal, and it could be higher,'' said Bob
Bahre, the 72-year-old owner of New Hampshire International
Speedway. ``I thought it was a heck of a good move. Bill France
talked to us about it. NASCAR talked to every track owner about it,
and we all felt the same way. It was a good move.''
</P>
<P>
   Bahre said he negotiated a five-race, $33 million deal for Las
Vegas Motor Speedway ``that was a record at the time, except for
Daytona, but you'll see purses go right to the moon. When this deal
goes into effect, Daytona will probably pay a $15 million purse.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Helton, the changes go into effect in 2000, but
NASCAR will retain the same revenue-sharing formula _ track owners
receiving 65 percent, competitors 25 percent, and NASCAR 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bahre said TV revenue at his track would likely triple from $7
million to more than $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked making my own deals,'' Bahre said. ``But I'm all for
this, because it's good for all of us.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   After plummeting from first to 11th in the Winston Cup standings
following a 39th-place finish that was the result of a a blown
engine in last week's Dura-Lube 400 at Rockingham, N.C., Jeff
Gordon took to the track at Las Vegas for a test session in a Busch
Series car co-owned by his wife, Brooke, and crew chief Ray
Evernham. ``This is truly a test for us,'' said Gordon, who plans
to campaign the No. 24 Pepsi-Frito Lay Chevrolet Monte Carlo for
five Busch races this season. ``This car has never been to a
racetrack. We've really got a lot of things to try and we've got to
try and get a lot of laps on the Busch car. A lot has changed since
I sat in one of them.'' For one, when he starts in the Sam's Town
300 Saturday at Las Vegas, Gordon will likely encounter stiff
opposition from young guns such as Dale Earnhardt Jr. and
18-year-old phenoms Casey Atwood and Adam Petty. ``Ray and I have
talked about getting more involved in NASCAR racing and the Busch
Series is pretty much where we started together,'' said Gordon.
``When I met Ray, it was in a Busch car and we've had a lot of good
times in them. But I really want to stick with five Busch races and
run some other younger driver, but we need to get more
sponsorship.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Although Mark Martin won last week's Winston Cup race, Mike
Skinner also benefitted from Gordon's engine woes by vaulting to
the top of the standings, with 315 points, after finishing sixth .
. . Championship Auto Racing Teams announced an addition to its
1999 schedule, the Hawaiian Super Prix Nov. 13, a $10 million,
pay-per-view, non-points race between the series's top 16 drivers.
It will be staged on a 1.8-mile layout on the tarmac of Barbers
Point Airport near Honolulu. The winner will take home $5 million,
making it the largest single-day payout for any motorsports event.
``A $5 million prize for the winner is awesome,'' said Michael
Andretti. ``There will be a lot on the line and that will be
reflected in the racing. I commend CART for being so progressive
and putting this event together. The race will definitely cap off
the season and give us a nice, happy finish _ especially for the
guy that wins.'' . . . Evidently, two-time CART champion Alex
Zanardi took a hefty pay cut to return to Formula One. In an
interview with Autosport magazine, Zanardi's former team manager
says the Italian star was offered $13 million to remain with Chip
Ganassi's Target team but opted to take a $5 million deal to drive
for Team Williams . . . Racearama '99 will take place at the
Eastern States Exposition in West Springfield Friday through
Sunday. For more information, call Stafford Motor Speedway at
860-684-2783 . . . Officials at Stafford, in Stafford Springs,
Conn., were recently recognized by NASCAR for having the Best 50th
Anniversary Campaign Presentation at the NASCAR Winston Racing
Series promoters meetings at Daytona Beach. ``This is the only
award of its kind ever issued by NASCAR,'' said Stafford track
owner Jack Arute Sr., who credited Cory Posocco, director of
marketing and promotions, for hatching the idea. ``It's something
to cherish throughout NASCAR's next 50 years.''

</P>
<P>
   They were trailing by one goal after the first period. Not a big
gap to make up, but what rankled coach Pat Burns wasn't that the
Bruins were down. In a stretch run where every point counts, his
team didn't come out with the energy, passion, or focus he was
expecting against an opponent _ the Washington Capitals _ who also
were fighting for their lives in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   So Burns let his players know of his displeasure during the
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The troops responded to the wakeup call with a pair of goals in
the second and two more in the third _ including the winner with
4:22 remaining _ to edge the Capitals, 4-3, Saturday at the
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we have to get a kick in the butt to get us going,''
said goalie Byron Dafoe, who stopped 33 shots and was a big reason
the Bruins won. ``Pat came in between periods after the first and
kind of lambasted us a little bit. We weren't hitting, we weren't
skating that hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for people to understand. You have to get up for
every game, but when you're playing 82 games and playing every
second night, sometimes it takes a few minutes or a period to get
into a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a situation where we have to be ready at the drop of
the puck. We can't take shifts off or periods off. That was the
situation in the first and we responded in the second.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's power play, which has been up and down this season,
converted on three of five opportunities. Dmitri Khristich had a
pair of goals, both with the man advantage, and an assist and Jason
Allison had two power-play assists and the winning goal at even
strength. Anson Carter, who has been playing on the top line with
Allison and Khristich, had a power-play goal and an assist.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Ken Klee gave Washington the lead at 9:12 of the
opening period. Carter tied it at 9:04 of the second and Boston
earned its first lead at 13:10 on Khristich's first. Klee tied it
at 18:41 with his second. Khristich, who extended his point streak
to four games (five goals and 10 points) then gave the Bruins the
lead, 3-2, with his 26th of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington wasn't done. During a two-man advantage of 1
minute 28 seconds _ after Don Sweeney was whistled for high
sticking at 2:03 and Tim Taylor was assessed a five-minute major
and game misconduct for boarding Sergei Gonchar at 2:35 _
Washington pulled even again on a goal by Jaroslav Svejkovsky at
3:50, 13 seconds before the two-man advantage expired.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins killed off the remaining 3:33 of the major, the final
minute of which was taken over by Ray Bourque, who skated the puck
around his own zone and the neutral zone, dodging Capitals right
and left.
</P>
<P>
   Allison put the finishing touch on the victory at 15:38 when he
took a backhand pass from Steve Heinze and beat Olaf Kolzig from
the slot. Kolzig was so upset he smashed his stick to smithereens
against the right post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't very nice,'' said Burns of the aesthetics, or lack
thereof, in the win.. ``But sometimes it's better to win ugly than
lose pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first period, we weren't very good. We were emotionless.
For some reason or another, I don't know why. You've got to be up
for every one of these games and I think that has something to do
with experience, when you're not ready to be able to battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we found a way to get around it and get the points and
they're valuable points. It's Dafoe's win, there's no two ways
about that. He really kept us in there.''

TEAMMATES GIVE SHORTSTOP AN ASSIST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ When it comes to talking about himself, the
shortstop is notoriously indifferent. It's part of his charm.
</P>
<P>
   He just doesn't get this whole media thing. He frames it, as he
frames just about everything else, very simply. What, he asks
himself, does this have to do with winning baseball games? Or with
making me a better ballplayer? The answer, of course, is nothing,
and he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   Other guys might at least reason that making nice with the print
and electronic media will put their names before the public and
perhaps lead to endorsements. Garciaparra is not other guys. He
does not care about endorsements or any of the trappings of
celebrity. He is what he is, a baseball player, and what a baseball
player.
</P>
<P>
   Since Nomar is little help when it comes to explaining Nomar,
why not turn to his contemporaries in the clubhouse? I say
``contemporaries,'' because, with the exception of Pedro Martinez,
it would be inaccurate to refer to any of them as his ``peers.'' I
wanted to know what impressed them or fascinated them or intrigued
about their amazing shortstop. So here are the thoughts of five
teammates with the combined wisdom of 43-plus years and 3,168 games
of major league experience.
</P>
<P>
   BRET SABERHAGEN (15 years): ``I don't know if this is an
overused reference, but to me he's a throwback. Old school. A lot
of players come up today and think they are owed, but, if anything,
you owe the game. That's the way Nomar sees it. He's not cocky or
arrogant. He plays the game with intensity and he prepares with
extreme intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is anyone in this clubhouse who is ready to go to
battle every day, it is Nomar Garciaparra. There is talk about him
having to become more of a `leader' now, but, personally, I don't
want him to do anything different. He doesn't have to start
speaking up in the locker room. His leadership is the way he gets
ready for a game and the way he plays. If anyone in this clubhouse
can't see that as leadership, he's wearing a blindfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of like George (Brett). Interesting, he wears the
same number, too (5). George never went around calling team
meetings, but he would speak up when he wanted to. What he did was
lead by everyday example, and I see Nomar very much the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   SCOTT HATTEBERG (two-plus years): ``He has an incredible work
ethic. You watch him every day, and you're amazed. I know he goes
to a facility and works out hard for six weeks before he even comes
here and then he works his butt off once he gets to spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he will ever be satisfied with what he does.
That's what drives him to be a great player, and he will be a great
player because of it. When he didn't make the All-Star team last
year, you'd never know whether or not he was upset. I'm pretty good
friends with him, and he never said a word. That tells you what
kind of guy he is.''
</P>
<P>
   JIM CORSI (eight-plus years): ``When I think of Nomar, I think
of his athleticism in the field, his work ethic, and his
consistency. I'm also fascinated with his rituals. They are what
help keep him strong mentally. We all have our rhythms and our
superstitions, but no one has as many as Nomar.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more thing: He's truly humble. That's why he doesn't want
to talk about himself.''
</P>
<P>
   MIKE STANLEY (11-plus years): ``Nomar is someone who is bound
and determined to be great. Look at the year he had. (.323, 35,
122, as AL MVP runner-up.) Pretty solid numbers, right? So what
does he do? He comes back here with 10 more pounds of muscle,
because he's not satisfied with himself. Other guys would be
basking in the glory, but Nomar is mature and he is someone who
always wants to be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he a throwback? Well, he's not flashy. He's just a guy who
works hard. He gets in his work and then he gets in his extra work.
He never takes anything for granted. Stars and superstars today
often get in some sort of cruise control, but Nomar always kicks it
into another gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of his continued intensity, he reminds me of a guy I
played with _ Paul O'Neill. Paul's the kind of guy who will hit a
ball off the top of the wall for a double and be cursing because
the ball didn't go out. Nomar has that in him. His will to succeed
is so strong that he is never satisfied. He never gives away any
at-bats. There are guys who will say, `I'd like two hits today,'
and if they get two hits the first two times up they settle for 2
for 5. Nomar would never, ever limit himself in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   DARREN LEWIS (seven-plus years): ``First of all, he is a gifted
athlete. More important to me is the way he goes about his daily
work. He works hard and he is never satisfied. He is very humble,
but he's confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``About not making the All-Star team last year, you'd never know
how he felt from looking at his face because of the type of person
he is, but once the game starts, he's gonna let you know. I think
his play proved how he felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``His conditioning is amazing. I know how hard it is to keep in
shape all year round. I get up every day in the offseason at 6:30
and run with Barry Bonds. I lift. I do what it takes. But I don't
look like Nomar. You can't outwork him. He's out there stretching
and working hard every single day. He truly wants to be a great
ballplayer and he truly loves the game. I've been around a while
now and I don't know that I can compare him to anyone else. He has
his own style. He is unique. He is a true original.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the Nomar his teammates see. I'd say that we are lucky to

know.

PREVENTION IS THE PRIORITY

   No bombshells are anticipated when the US Olympic Committee's
report on the Salt Lake City scandal is released Monday in New
York. The special investigative commission chaired by Sen. George
Mitchell is expected to focus on what the USOC and future bid
cities can do to prevent a recurrence. The answer, in a word, is
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC has already drawn up tough new guidelines for the
cities vying for the 2012 Summer Games, strictly limiting gifts and
banning early contact with IOC members. But there also must be much
closer (and earlier) supervision of the bidders. The USOC was
profoundly embarrassed when its international relations director
(Alfredo LaMont, since resigned) was revealed to have sold his
services to Salt Lake as a consultant and to have funneled payoff
cash to the IOC member from Barbados.
</P>

   Eight of the first nine members (all but Steve Smith) named to
the US men's basketball team for this summer's Olympic qualifier in
San Juan were on the original (i.e. pre-NBA lockout) roster for
last year's World Championships. Not coming back are Christian
Laettner, Glen Rice, Chris Webber, and Terrell Brandon.
Conspicuously uninvited were Shaquille O'Neal, Allen Iverson, and
Jason Kidd. So the squad includes Grant Hill, Tim Duncan, Vin
Baker, Kevin Garnett, Tom Gugliotta, Tim Hardaway, Allan Houston,
Gary Payton, and Smith. The rest of the roster will come either
from the CBA or college. If the Yanks qualify for Sydney, though,
it'll be an all-NBA team. Which means that the final three guys
will sweat for a dozen days in San Juan in July to earn Olympic
medals for somebody else . . . Looks like Jean-Claude Ganga, the
disgraced IOC member from the Republic of Congo, will be a one-man
protest march when he contests his expulsion before the full body
in Switzerland next month. Ganga had hoped to get his African
colleagues to fall in behind him, but most refused. Ganga, who got
more than $250,000 in cash, medical care, travel, and gifts for
himself and his family from the Salt Lake bidders, is by far the
worst culprit among the two dozen IOC members implicated . . . The
US women's figure skating champion kept out of the World
Championships? It could happen next year. If Naomi Nari Nam, the
current 13-year-old runner-up, were to win the title (which she
could if Michelle Kwan decides to go to college full-time), she
also would have to win a world junior medal to be eligible. That's
why Nam can't go this year and 13-year-old Sarah Hughes can, even
though Hughes placed two spots below her at nationals. The reason
for the loophole in the 15-year-old age limit ``is because the ISU
didn't want really young skaters competing against ladies,'' says
John A.W. Nicks, Nam's coach. ``Some countries were sending 10- and
11-year-olds. The problem here is, you've got a young lady of 13
performing and interpreting music like a 16- or 17-year-old
skater.'' . . . Even though this isn't an Olympic year, attendance
at the recent US Figure Skating Championships in Salt Lake was
absurdly low. The Delta Center, reduced to 10,000 seats, was less
than half-full for every session but the women's final. Reasons
abounded: not a skating town, just one marquee name (Kwan), poor
promotion, and a touring event coming up . . . If the ISU wants a
better field for next year's Four Continents figure skating
championships, it won't sandwich it between the US nationals and
the Grand Prix final. Last week's event, essentially the World
Championships minus the Europeans, was missing both Kwan and
Michael Weiss. A better time would be mid-December . . . Newest
members of the US Figure Skating Hall of Fame include Burlington
brother-sister pair Kitty and Peter Carruthers, who won Olympic
silver in 1984, and two-time Olympian (and Harvard grad) John Misha
Petkevich.

   Should be a bump-free ride to the semis next week for the US
women's ice hockey team at the World Championships in Finland. The
Americans, who'll suit up 11 Olympic gold medalists, face
last-seeded Russia, then meet Sweden and China (7-1 and 5-0 victims
at Nagano). Odds are they'll face Olympic podium mates Finland and
Canada in the medal round . . . The Austrian men and women have a
chance at grabbing all but one of the titles when the World Cup
Alpine circuit winds up next week in Spain. Besides dominating the
Nations Cup team standings, they've all but clinched the individual
women's title (Alexandra Meissnitzer), have a chance at the men's
(Hermann Maier is a close third behind Norway's Lasse Kjus and
Kjetil Andre Aamodt), are leading six of the eight disciplines, and
have a chance at grabbing the men's giant slalom. The only bauble
out of reach is the men's downhill, which Kjus has in hand . . . No
overall medals (no surprise) for the US long-track speedskaters at
the recent World Championships. KC Boutiette and Jennifer
Rodriguez, both fifth in the all-around last year, were ninth
despite setting American point records. Boutiette did lower his US
mark in the 5,000, though, (to 6:39.34) and Rodriguez placed second
in the 500. Christine Witty (fifth) and Casey FitzRandolph (10th)
were the top Yanks in the sprint event, but both decidedly
underachieved. The Netherlands's Rintje Ritsma and Germany's Gunda
Niemann-Stirnemann (her record eighth) won the all-around titles,
Canada's Jeremy Wotherspoon and Germany's Monique Garbrecht the
sprints . . . Brookline's Dan Weinstein and Natick's Caroline
Hallisey, as expected, made the US team for the world short-track
speedskating championships next month. The men's squad includes
Apolo Anton Ohno, Rusty Smith, Tommy O'Hare, and Ron Biondo; the
women's includes six-time US champ Amy Peterson, Erin Porter, Julie
Goskowicz, and Sarah Williams. The US women are seeded third
(behind China and South Korea) and the men sixth in next weekend's
team event in St. Louis . . . Excellent World Cup luge season for
the US squad. Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin retained their
doubles title, Chris Thorpe-Gordy Sheer and Chris Niccum-Matt
McClain ended up fourth and fifth overall, and 21-year-old Adam
Heidt placed fourth in singles. The rebuilding American women,
though, never managed a medal (and didn't compete in the final two
events).

   Shocking upset in the recent world four-man bobsledding
championships in Italy, where France (piloted by Bruno Mingeon) won
its first title. It was the first time in 30 years that a country
other than Germany or Switzerland had prevailed; Germany's
Christoph Langen, the heavy favorite, placed sixth. The Italians
(with Guenther Huber) had taken the two-man title earlier.
Creditable showing by the Americans: Brian Shimer was fifth in both
events, with Winchester's Jim Herberich 11th in the two-man and
12th in the four-man. Meanwhile, the US women ended up second (Jean
Racine) and fifth (Jill Bakken) in their World Cup standings . . .
Stunning performance by 21-year-old biathlete Jay Hakkinen, whose
fifth place in last week's World Cup sprint at Lake Placid was the
best showing by an American since Josh Thompson's silver medal at
the 1987 World Championships . . . Russia's financial implosion has
whacked its Olympic medalists in the wallet. The bonuses they were
promised for last year's Winter Games (up to $50,000 for a gold)
haven't come through. ``I'm confident our money was stolen,'' says
ski federation president Anatoly Akentev . . . After picking up
Olympic slots in the Europe and women's 470 classes at the World
Championships in Melbourne, the US sailors have qualified for seven
of the 11 events in the 2000 Games. Still to be earned are Finn,
Star, Tornado, and men's Mistral, but the Yanks are expected to run
the table . . . That restraining order keeping her father at bay
for a year apparently isn't enough for Dominique Moceanu. The
17-year-old gymnast, now training in Colorado Springs, has moved
from Houston to Orlando, where she's asking for another restraining
order. Meanwhile, with Moceanu absent, the gym her father built
with money from her trust fund has gone belly-up and is closing . .
. This summer's women's soccer World Cup will double as the
qualifier for next year's Olympics. The eight quarterfinalists will
make it, unless the host Australians aren't among them. Then, it'll
be the semifinalists and the three losing quarterfinalists with the
best records . . . Look for ice hockey and figure skating to switch
venues for the 2002 Games in Salt Lake. The E Center doesn't have
enough seats for the hockey federation's tastes and the Delta
Center, with its sunken ice surface, has lousy sightlines.

THE COUNTRY CLUB WILL BE THE PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The snow was falling in Brookline Thursday, while the world's
best golfers were competing in the World Golf Championships in
Carlsbad, Calif. The game is offering record purses, and match play
has returned to the picture.
</P>
<P>
   So it was appropriate that John Cornish was talking Ryder Cup in
the grill room at The Country Club as the snow fell. The 33d
biennial competition will be contested at the Brookline course some
six months down the road (Sept. 22-24), and it is turning into one
of Boston's grandest and most lucrative sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Brookline will reap benefits, up to $3 million alone
from the rental fees for tables at the adjacent Putterham Meadows.
The 30,000 tickets were gone by last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were working on master planning this morning,'' said
Cornish. ``We were just trying to figure where everything was going
to be located on the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to have seating for about 18,000
spectators in grandstand seats. We're going to have six Jumbotrons.
They had one at Oak Hill. They had two at Valderrama. We're going
to have a big one on our practice range. It's a difficult spectator
event, and it's hard to follow everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornish, who grew up a few paces from the front entrance at The
Country Club and attended Milton Academy, Harvard, and Georgetown
Law School, is a partner in the Boston firm of Choate Hall &AMP;
Stewart. He has good company in major-event organization. Ken
Burnes, who was general chairman of the US Open at The Country Club
in 1988, was with the firm then. Frank Porter, a current partner,
is president of the Boston Athletic Association and oversees the
organization of the Boston Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still moving things around, trying to site all of the
trailers,'' said Cornish. ``It's unbelievable what's going to be
going on here. We're going to have 250,000 square feet of tents.
We're going to have between 60 and 70 trailers. It's amazing the
media interest. This is the biggest event in international golf.
It's the end of the 20th century, and the first was in
Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   The involvement with the Ryder Cup gradually and perhaps
inevitably grew out of Cornish's role as secretary and legal
counsel of The Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the PGA of America offered us the Ryder Cup, I was asked
to negotiate the contract,'' said Cornish. ``Once the agreement was
signed, I was asked by the president of the club if I'd be general
chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Cornish was chairman of administration and finance of the
1988 US Open, he fit into the grand scheme of things. He has Burnes
as one of his vice chairmen, plus Peter Barber, who was a fellow
member of the Owl Club at Harvard. Ed White, a member of the Fox
Club at Harvard, is the third vice chairman. You might say the
Ryder Cup has a little of the town (Brookline) and gown (Harvard)
mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a natural thing,'' said Cornish. ``The US Open was a
big success. The USGA came back to us and asked if we wanted to
host the tournament in 1994 or 1995. Even though we wanted to do
it, we decided it was too soon. We decided to get out of the public
eye, and our history has not been to have major tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the 1913, 1953, and 1988 US Opens. The majors we were
doing were major amateur events. We always viewed ourselves as a
club that wanted to host the amateurs. To do something on a large
scale like this was unprecedented. We hosted the US Women's Amateur
in 1902. The only professional events were the three US Opens, so
it was a major step for us to move out of the USGA and MGA arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ultimately decided we should. The principal reason was it
was so much fun doing the 1988 US Open. It wasn't a financial
thing. We felt the US Open really brought this club together.''
</P>
<P>
   Though being general chairman of the Ryder Cup takes
considerable time, Cornish relishes the assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is extremely time-consuming, and I find myself
working nights and weekends,'' he said. ``But I don't have any
regrets. Managing a $50 million-$60 million operation is not
something your normal Boston lawyer has a chance to do in a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people here who are working so hard. It's by
no means one person. It's an executive committee of 20 people plus
another 30 chairmen. I think when we first started thinking Ryder
Cup we thought it would be pretty easy to do. What we found is the
Ryder Cup is the 1988 US Open times 10. We had 33 corporate tents.
This year we will have 59 corporate tents and 300 corporate tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of 33 corporate customers we have 250 corporate
customers. The corporate tables are tables of 10. There's 100 at
Putterham Meadows. They're all sold out. We've donated 300 tickets
to the city of Boston. It's going to be packaged up in corporate
sponsorship at Franklin Park. The net proceeds will go to support
youth programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited about creating a fund that will be a
lasting legacy of the Ryder Cup for the Greater Boston community.
The Ryder Cup is going to be a celebration about the game of golf.
We really wanted to do something that will last a long time. We
entered into a community partnership with Brookline, and we're
anticipating it's going to generate $3 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget the residual benefits, forget baseball's All-Star Game at
Fenway Park in July. The Ryder Cup is going to generate huge sums
of money for the town of Brookline, even though some continue to
criticize the membership policies at The Country Club. After all,
how many Irish are members of Belmont CC or Pine Brook?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unprecedented what we're doing,'' said Cornish.
``To run a professional golf tournament, you have to be a
contributor. We view that not only as our obligation, but it's
something we really want to do.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   A two-hour documentary called ``The Story of Golf'' will air
March 7 at 4:30 p.m. on WGBH-TV (Channel 2). It is a sensitive,
delightful look at the game's history. As Jim McKay says in the
narration, ``Some say it's only a game, and an odd one at that
involving a stick, a ball, and a hole in the ground. Where it began
no one knows. Its origin is lost in the midst of time. This is a
game shared by fathers and sons, on fields touched with beauty by
the hands of God. Its lure is difficult to define, impossible to
define, an obsession that can last a lifetime.'' The documentary
was produced in part by Cramer Productions, whose founder and
president, Tom ``Red'' Martin, captained the 1960-61 Boston College
hockey team and is one of the region's top senior amateur players,
out of Woodland GC . . . The forthcoming issue of Golf Digest has
an article by Dean Knuth, who created the course rating/slope
rating system for the US Golf Association. For the magazine, he did
a statistical examination of the World Golf Rankings that now
determine who plays in three of the majors and two of the rich
World Golf Championships events. Some feel that many players are
ranked higher than they should be, but when it all comes out in the
wash, he still has Tiger Woods No. 1, David Duval No. 2, and Mark
O'Meara No. 3 . . . The Massachusetts Golf Association has
announced its final tournament schedule, with the State Amateur at
The Kittansett Club July 12-16 and the State Open at Wellesley CC
June 21-23.

HARDAWAY DOING THINGS THE HARD WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those anticipating an available and eager-to-relocate Penny
Hardaway this summer, be advised the Magic's magna cum guard is not
eager to leave Orlando, even though there appear to be many reasons
why he could be.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, who stopped by last week and submitted his first
scoreless game in memory, made it clear he is expecting to be an
Orlando lifer. That proclamation came even as he talked about
having minimal communication with head coach Chuck Daly and
nonrefundable disenchantment with the team's front office over the
way it handled his injured status a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a charming work environment, right?
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway said he has little if any rapport with Daly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know me to this day, as a person or a player,''
Hardaway said. ``He doesn't communicate with me, and I don't
communicate with him. He doesn't really talk to anybody. You can go
around this room and ask anybody if they've talked with Chuck one
on one, where he says what he really wants from you. They'll say
no. He just doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Hardaway's comments, Daly shrugged and said, ``I
talk to him on the floor. I talk to him about things necessary to
talk about. He's different about his approach to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway knew Daly was disappointed that he was unable to play
last season and said that upper management even questioned whether
he was hurt, which prompted him to have his situation, and
rehabilitation, handled in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't change my outlook on wanting to be here for the rest
of my career,'' Hardaway said. ``It just changed some relationships
with the general manager and the president, some of those guys.
Once you've been put out on an island by yourself, and no one comes
to your rescue, not even the head coach . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The head coach is supposed to be a guy that comes through for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway mentioned Kenny Anderson's injury of last year and Rick
Pitino's decision not to play Anderson until Anderson got healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever said that for me,'' Hardaway said. ``And I had
definitely been there a lot longer than Kenny had been here. Your
head coach has to stick up for you. With (Daly's) frustrations at
me for not playing, it was like, `You're getting what you deserve.'
''
</P>
<P>
   So he doesn't have a relationship with the coach and he's angry
with the suits for trashing him and for questioning his grit. Why
on earth wouldn't he put a ``For Sale'' sign on his house and get
out this summer under his opt-out clause?
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the things, you'd figure as soon as my contract was
up, I'd be bailing out of there,'' he said. ``But I made
commitments to guys like Bo Outlaw, Ike Austin, Nick Anderson,
Darrell Armstrong, guys that just re-signed their contracts, that I
was going to be here for the rest of my career. So I can't be
selfish and think about myself. I have other guys to think about. I
brought those guys here and I can't just leave them. That's the
reason why I'll be in Orlando. It's not about the money. It's about
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway and the Magic got off to a great start, so, for now,
all is harmonious. Daly, of course, is not the least bit content,
par for the course for the Prince of Pessimism. He quoted a line
from ``Tender Mercies'': ``I don't trust happiness; I never have,
and I never will.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that long ago that Hardaway was getting gold in
Atlanta and was first-team All-Pro for consecutive seasons. Then
came the injuries, which happened to coincide with Shaquille
O'Neal's decision to leave Hooterville and play for the Lakers.
Hardaway played 59 games in 1996-97 and only 19 last season. He had
a couple ill-fated comebacks last season, and Daly was pretty blunt
about his absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't know me, and he was going around saying negative
things about me,'' Hardaway said. ``With my injury, I couldn't run
and I couldn't jump. He thought I was out there dogging. All he
wants me to do is go out there and perform, and all I want to do is
go out there and win games. We both have the same thing in common,
and winning cures everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you win, you have great chemistry; when things slip
a little, that's when the test comes,'' said the coach. ``I've
found over the years that as teams get better and improve, they
kind of take on their own direction, internally. I also found when
you have good teams, they start believing how good they are and
they have to come back to you a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the mediocrity in the East, Orlando could just as
easily slide as stay where it is. The Magic have been one of the
surprise teams of this young, down-is-up season. They've got a good
mix, they've got two promising rookies and draft picks down the
road. And, if we believe him, they've also got Hardaway, even if it
sometimes pains him to say so.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to look at the Lakers from afar with anything
other than morbid fascination. Maybe the coaching change to Kurt
Rambis will calm things; it worked the last two times they switched
early in the season. In fact, the last team to make an in-season
coaching change and win the title was the 1982 Lakers, who fired
Paul Westhead (who had won five straight games at that point) and
replaced him with Pat Riley. Since the beginning of the 1981-82
season, there have been 63 in-season coaching changes; only two
teams, the Hawks and Celtics, have not made one. Seven of the
changes, two of them featuring Larry Brown (San Antonio and New
Jersey), removed a head coach with a winning record. But the
Lakers' situation appears to be more than the coaching, and more
than the addition of Dennis Rodman, whom Hardaway lobbied for in
Orlando. ``I really wanted him,'' Hardaway said. ``We have a
veteran team and we could really handle what he had to offer. I
don't know how the Lakers are going to handle it because they have
no control. Rodman isn't going to respect that assistant or whoever
comes in. He needs a veteran coach. You have Kobe (Bryant) and Shaq
(O'Neal), but Shaq is the man on the team. Eddie Jones? If you're
hearing trade rumors three years in a row, and your teammates start
talking about how they can't wait for the trade deadline to get him
out of here, how would you feel? He's one of the best players in
the league and he's out there among some guys that just care about
their numbers.'' . . . Former University of Rhode Island star
Cuttino Mobley has emerged from the flotsam in the Houston
backcourt, relegating onetime starter Matt Maloney to the pine. The
Rockets signed Maloney to a seven-year deal after the lockout, so,
as agent Keith Glass put it, ``That certainly soothes the pain a
little. Eventually, though, Matt is going to start getting a little
antsy. They told him it was a temporary thing and maybe he'll be
back when (Charles) Barkley comes back because with that front
line, the last thing they need is another scorer. They're going to
need a real point guard.'' . . . You're Not in Kansas Anymore
Dept.: The since-injured Raef LaFrentz had a Jayhawk Moment against
the Lakers Monday that could have been a monumental boo-boo. The
Nuggets, leading by 3 in the closing seconds of overtime, had the
ball at halfcourt. LaFrentz went into the backcourt to get free for
a pass from Eric Williams, but Williams was smart enough to know
that that is a violation in the NBA. Williams called time.
LaFrentz's season-ending injury is a killer for the Nuggets, and
given the normal time frame for recovery from a torn anterior
cruciate ligament, he may miss a lot of next season, too. Williams
went through this last year and has recovered. But he's been
bothered by a hamstring problem and didn't play against the Jazz or
Mavericks. ``He tried to play through it,'' said his agent, Mark
Bartlestein. ``He thought it better to take some time out and let
it heal.''
</P>

   Red Auerbach says he won't be visiting the FleetCenter soon, but
he offers this thought on the Celtics: ``We're just actually two
players away from being a highly competitive team. We need a tough
guy, a big banger.'' Someone like Jim Loscutoff? ``Nah, someone
like (Bob) Brannum. He was tougher than Loscutoff.'' . . . Chris
Webber returned with a vengeance to MCI Center Thursday,
registering a triple-double in Sacramento's victory over
Washington. Webber has eight triple-doubles in his career and four
have come against teams that traded him. The other three were
against the Warriors, who, of course, traded him to Washington. And
considering that Golden State and Washington play only twice a
season, Webber didn't have all that many chances to wreak havoc
against his former team. He won't see the Wizards again until next
season. The game, incidentally, did not sell out . . . Separated at
birth: Paul Gaston and Michael Doleac . . . The Clippers' home game
against the Lakers Thursday was played at the Pond in Anaheim and
drew a sellout crowd. Speaking of the Clippers, their winless start
is still not near the NBA record, which is 0-17 by the Miami Heat
in their first year, 1988-89. However, the Clippers did start 0-16
under Bill Fitch in 1994-95 . . . Going into Saturday night, the
Bulls were winless at home, where, against all logic and wisdom,
they continue to draw huge crowds. They also lost their final game
in the United Center last season, Game 5 of the NBA Finals . . .
Chicago coach Tim Floyd was tossed for the first time Thursday,
which also happened to be his 45th birthday. Watching from the
sidelines was Bulls assistant Tex Winter, who was celebrating his
77th, from somewhere, we presume, was Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf,
who celebrated his 63d Friday and, perhaps, on the dish, was
Rambis, who was celebrating his 41st . . . The Suns are averaging
97 points a game, which, if maintained, would be the lowest in
franchise history. Right now, however, that's good for third in the
league.

JASPER BREATHES A SIGH OF RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ The relief was palpable for Jasper's 8,000
residents, who had weathered almost nine months of intense media
scrutiny since the dismembered body of James Byrd Jr. was
discovered and three white men were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   TV crews had packed their gear and rolled out of town as a
light, cleansing rain fell on this weary East Texas community the
day after a jury sentenced a young white man to die for the torture
slaying of a middle-aged black man.
</P>
<P>
   Also gone are the unmarked Suburbans with heavily armed officers
that patrolled the courthouse square during the trial, and the
helicopters that noisily circled the city while students struggled
with their TAAS tests below.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is emotionally drained,'' said City Councilwoman
Nancy Nicholson. ``We're just grateful to God for bringing us
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt ending of the closely followed trial of John William
King, the first of three defendants to be tried in Byrd's death,
prompted King's 67-year-old father to call the town's main radio
station, KJAS-FM, to urge Jasperites to ``fill the void made by
this mess with love and tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the respite might be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, and Shawn Berry, 24, are yet to be
tried. One of them might face a jury as early as the first week of
May.
</P>
<P>
   Berry's attorney said he'd prefer to keep the trial in Jasper
where his client was born and, before Byrd's dragging death, was
generally well-liked by blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer's attorney said he'd continue to push for a change of
venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons are more compelling following (King's) trial, with
the community bombarded by publicity and the local media saying
it's experienced a sense of being purged by the trial,'' said
attorney Douglas Barlow of Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the divisive issue of a 14-year-old middle school
student suspended five times for wearing a Confederate belt buckle
to class. Principal Gwen Gilford said it was insensitive, if not
disruptive, for the boy to wear such a symbol during the King
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The youth's parents say they will protest the suspensions at a
March 8 school board meeting. The Knights of the White Kamellia, a
Vidor-based Ku Klux Klan group, warned that they would demonstrate
in Jasper on March 12 if the buckle matter isn't resolved by then.
</P>
<P>
   But the community has handled both the Klan and the New Black
Panthers before without allowing their public posturing to foment
racial discord.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a unity here,'' said Clyde Williams, 49, a City
Councilman who is African-American. ``It's sort of like a secret
code. We can bicker, we can fight, but don't let any stranger come
in and mess with either one of us because then we'll join forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Byrd's slaying, even the town's oldest residents could not
recall a major racial incident in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Still, white civic leaders who considered themselves racially
sensitive were taken aback by comments raised in a series of town
hall meetings called by Jasper's black mayor to examine community
relations. Some black residents spoke of whites being oblivious to
words and actions that wound African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this murder has heightened the awareness of cultural
differences,'' said Gilford, the middle school principal, who is
black.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with outsiders is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to where people wouldn't say they were from Jasper,''
said H.B. ``Little Boy'' Neal, the 6-foot-4, 84-year-old owner of a
jukebox and billiard table business. ``I'm glad it's over. Of
course, we have two more (trials) to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Even children weren't spared the stigma that the community
carries from its association with Byrd's dragging death.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our cheerleaders went to camp last summer, other girls
said, `Oh, you're from Jasper,' '' said Gilford. ``They were
treated like lepers, in effect saying, `You're white, and that's
where a white man did this to a black man, so you must be mean.'
But once they got to know them, everyone became friends.''
</P>
<P>
   John H. Matthews, 56, spent his earliest years in Jasper, then
came back each summer to stay with grandparents during his youth
and finally returned to live after 26 years as a science teacher in
Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described yellow dog Democrat of the liberal persuasion,
Matthews said that, in one sense, it was almost providence that
such a heinous crime was carried out here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, it's a good thing this tragedy occurred in
Jasper because we're better able than other small towns in East
Texas to cope with it,'' he said. ``And that's mainly because we
have been racially integrated at various levels of government.''
</P>
<P>
   In a town that is 45 percent African-American, its mayor is
black, two of its five council members are black, as are the
director of the Deep East Texas Council of Governments and the
administrator of the largest hospital. A black retired Army
lieutenant colonel, Herman Wright, served 17 years as the school
board president and remains one of the county's most admired
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a small, atypically redneck town can find a white man
guilty of killing a black man, then the message should go out that
racism will not be tolerated,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews readily concedes that Jasper is not perfect. Before
Byrd's June 7 slaying and the subsequent flurry of biracial,
interfaith prayer vigils, he was the sole conspicuous white
marching in the Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade after moving back
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jasperites known to be unapologetic racists have kept a low
profile since June, ]But even they were outraged by the dragging
and dismemberment of Byrd, many residents said.
</P>
<P>
   The only sympathetic note sounded on the killer's behalf was the
grudging respect one man paid John King for standing by his beliefs
_ white supremacist and Norse pagan _ and not feigning a sudden
religious conversion just to save his own neck.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the community has emerged from the ordeal with new
pride and a new, street-level friendliness. Before, he was more
guarded, he said. ``I wouldn't say hello to whites I didn't
personally know. Now I greet everyone, and I am greeted in
return.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole situation arising from the murder could have played
out differently if not for two men, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The black city councilman credited the white sheriff, Billy
Rowles, for ``making the right calls.''
</P>
<P>
   After arresting the suspects within 24 hours, Rowles immediately
requested expert forensic help from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black community saw there was no hidden agenda _ like
other cases before Rowles came to office,'' Williams said.
``Everything was out in the open.''
</P>
<P>
   The other key personality was Mike Lout, he said. The station
manager and main reporter for the 6,000-watt KJAS, Lout kept the
community indoors and informed during the Klan and Black Panther
rallies, then during all of the developments before and during the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   From the tiny station housed in his small ranch home in a mixed
neighborhood, the 43-year-old Lout filled a vacuum that otherwise
would have been filled by rumor and insecurity, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The town got through without an angry backlash because of the
city's even-handed policies and Lout's reporting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listening to Mike's news reports was almost a religious act
for Jasper,'' he said. ``Everyone would say, `Did you hear what
Mike Lout said?' The whole community relied on him.''

BAPTIST LEADER FOUND GUILTY OF SWINDLING AND THEFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for complete writethru to add detail and reporting
throughout.) 
(ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARGO, Fla. _ The accused, one of the most powerful ministers in
the country, asked God to influence the jurors' hearts and minds.
But the minister, the Rev. Henry J. Lyons, who used the trust given
him as a man of God to steal millions, found himself without divine
help in a Florida courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   In Pinellas County Circuit Court on Saturday, Lyons, president
of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Inc., the nation's
largest black religious organization, was convicted of racketeering
and grand theft, including charges that he had stolen money that
was donated to a fund to rebuild black churches destroyed by arson.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, who had used the money to live a lavish lifestyle that
included a $700,000 waterfront home, a time-share condominium in
Lake Tahoe, Nev., luxury cars and expensive jewelry, stood still as
the verdict was read. The only thing that moved was his Adam's
apple as he swallowed hard when the clerk of the court read
``guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who had once punctuated his sermons against sin with
cries of ``I'm doing some preaching now!'' walked quietly from the
courtroom, saying only that he was ``going to my church,'' to pray.
Lyons, 57, faces a sentence of five to eight-and-a-half years in
prison on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a month, prosecutors tried to convince a jury that
Lyons had, with the help of his aide Bernice Edwards, used the good
name and bogus membership lists of the 100-year-old National
Baptist Convention to bilk millions from companies wanting to do
business with black customers.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against the minister ``was overwhelming,'' one
juror, Shannon Byrd, told reporters as she left the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   But the same jury that found Lyons guilty of racketeering would,
just moments later, acquit Ms. Edwards, who, prosecutors asserted,
had worked hand in hand with Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards, 42, sobbed quietly into the shoulder of her lawyer
when the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been so long,'' she said of the 28-day-trial, her voice
just above a whisper. ``I thank God and I thank my lawyer. It's
been very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards had faced one racketeering count, and had not been
charged in the scheme to steal money from the fund for burned black
churches.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were happy with the verdict for Lyons, who, they
asserted, betrayed the faith that he used, as his cover, to make
money.
</P>
<P>
   The National Baptist Convention describes itself as the
country's largest black religious organization, with more than 8.5
million members. It was access to that membership, which
prosecutors asserted was grossly inflated, that companies wanted so
they could peddle life insurance, burial plots and even credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Lyons, who is out on bond while he awaits sentencing, is
scheduled to stand trial in April in federal court on 54 counts of
tax evasion, extortion and money laundering. Ms. Edwards also faces
similar charges in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, which the jury reached Saturday morning, was
delayed until the afternoon when two Tampa Bay television stations
gave defense lawyers copies of e-mail messages from a man who said
a juror, Ms. Byrd, had discussed the jury's deliberations with a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Lyons and Ms. Edwards requested a mistrial. But the
trial judge, Susan Schaeffer, skeptical that something as flimsy as
a mysterious e-mail message could negate a jury's verdict,
questioned the juror, Ms. Byrd.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, m'am,'' Ms. Byrd said, when asked whether she had
discussed the case.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she told reporters, ``I didn't do any of that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was just the latest development in a case that often strayed
outside the norm of criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the two defendants were charged on a single count
of racketeering, involving several instances, prosecutors said, in
which they promised to sell bogus lists and access to the National
Baptist Convention's supposed membership of 8.5 million.
Prosecutors said the figure was probably closer to 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons was also charged with grand theft, with stealing most of
the some $240,000 donated to his organization by the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, money that was supposed to
be distributed to black churches that had been destroyed by arson.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trial in which the name of God was evoked again and
again, mostly by lawyers for Lyons and Ms. Edwards, whom they
described as His servants.
</P>
<P>
   But as the two defendants tried to cloak themselves in religion,
and as their lawyers tried to convince jurors that when money was
floated into Lyons' personal account, it was just the way that
black churches ``do business,'' prosecutors hammered again and
again at the defendants' credibility with bank statements, letters
and other hard evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, prosecutors documented specific instances
of what they said was theft. The prosecution produced two letters
from Lyons to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, falsely
reporting that the money it had donated to the burned black
churches had been distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors produced a document in which the National Baptist
Convention had estimated its state-by-state membership _ a list
that Lyons had used in his scheme, the prosecution said. In some
states, the organization reported a black membership that exceeded
the number of black residents in those states.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the documents and other evidence piled up around
them, Lyons and his lawyers predicted that God would deliver him
and Ms. Edwards from what they called the persecution of the state.
</P>
<P>
   As the jury, five white women and one white man, began
deliberations on Thursday afternoon, the two defendants and a group
of about 25 close associates joined hands in the courthouse hallway
and sang ``What a Friend We Have in Jesus.'' Then a supporter and
member of the Baptist organization, the Rev. Charles Emery of Gary,
Ind., led the group in a rousing prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Father, we need your intervention,'' Emery said, asking
God to help the jury make the ``right'' verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need you to work on their hearts,'' Emery said as the
people in the circle shouted ``Yes, Jesus!'' and one man loudly
stomped his feet. ``We need you to work on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as tears filled the eyes of some in the circle, Emery made
a prediction: ``We claim the victory right here.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was done, Lyons' wife, Deborah, hugged a weeping Ms.
Edwards. It was Mrs. Lyons who began the investigation into her
husband's business dealing and lavish lifestyle, when, in July
1997, she set fire to a $700,000 waterfront home he had bought with
Ms. Edwards. Mrs. Lyons was convicted of arson and was sentenced to
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Mrs. Lyons would say she did not suspect her husband of
having an affair with Ms. Edwards and stood by her husband
throughout the trial. Ms. Edwards denied having an affair with Mr.
Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   Others stood by him, as well. His church, Bethel Metropolitan
Baptist Church in nearby St. Petersburg, retained him as pastor,
and leaders in the National Baptist Convention voted to keep him as
president, even as some members worried that he would drag the
organization's reputation down with him.

ROCKY ROAD LEADS TO COP'S HOME

<P>
   PHOENIX _ They met at a crack house near Eighth Street and
Hatcher one cold night in February 1998. &QL; 
Police had been watching dealers and users and hookers come and go
for weeks, and now were hoping to shut down the operation, at least
for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Once on the property, they noticed a one-room addition tacked
onto the main building, little more than an storage room with a bed
in it, and decided to check it out. Sgt. Bob Cahill remembers
knocking on the door. A man and woman answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't say much. Then this little guy comes out from
behind them,'' Cahill says. ``He was 3, then, and looked like he
hadn't had a bath in . . . forever. And all he had on was a pair of
shorts.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy said his name was Rocky. The woman, whom police knew
from other busts, was his mother. The man with her wasn't the
father. The boy's father, they were told, was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill has been on the job since 1977. He's a solid brick of a
man who looks like he could play pulling guard for the football
team in his home state, Nebraska. He got a blanket and wrapped it
around Rocky, asking him when he'd eaten last. When Rocky said he
was hungry, Cahill went to McDonald's and bought him a Happy Meal.
</P>
<P>
   That night after work, Cahill told his wife, Tanya, about the
boy. The next day, she bought clothes in Rocky's size and had her
husband drive her, on his day off, to the crack house.
</P>
<P>
   Officers busted the same residence only a week later. The day
after that, Rocky's mother was picked up during a prostitution
roundup on Cave Creek Road. Child Protective Services was notified,
but the boy wasn't removed from the home.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April, officers stopped a suspicious car leaving the
crack house. Two men were inside, each of them wanted by police. In
the back seat, by himself, was Rocky. &QL; 
`BROUGHT TOGETHER'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you're a religious person or not,'' Cahill
said, ``but I believe sometimes we are brought together with people
for a reason. I felt like that about this little boy.''
</P>
<P>

   This time, though, he couldn't. He found out that Rocky had been
removed from the crack house by CPS and was living in a group
foster home. He and Tanya visited him, finding a friendly,
intelligent boy who knew too much about drug use and women who
entertain men in motels.

file it, lock it up, forget about it. Or it'll overwhelm you.

lives. Luckily for a kid named Rocky, and for all of us, there's
one cop in town who decided to bring his work home with him. &QL;

 &HT;    A tired Devers finds homecoming sweet
 &HT;    By Steven Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gwen Torrence has faded from the competitive scene,
but it seems that Atlanta is not out of the women's sprint business
just yet.
</P>
<P>
   In a pinch, Gail Devers will do. A two-time Olympic gold
medalist in the 100 meters makes a passable substitute. This isn't
exactly some near beer or imitation soy patty kind of deal.
</P>
<P>
   Having moved into some new suburban Atlanta digs less than four
months ago, Devers established residency just in time to add to the
local domination of the 60-meter dash in the USA Indoor Track and
Field Championships. She and Torrence have titles in five of the
six championships held at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's race was not the most convenient Devers ever ran,
even if it did mean coming home. Competing in Europe this winter,
she only arrived back in Atlanta from Sweden late Friday afternoon.
Her internal clock all gummed up, she got only a little more than
an hours sleep before reporting to the Dome the next morning. She
came with a pillow and a blanket, but never found time for a good
lie-down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to get through this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the reports of her strong showings in Europe were not
exaggerated. So strong, Devers could return and win a major U.S.
championship in her sleep. Her time of 7.04 seconds was off a 6.98
she ran last week in France but good enough to hold off Inger
Miller (second at 7.15).
</P>
<P>
   Devers chose Atlanta because it seemed so many of her friends
already were here, including Brian Jordan, the former Falcon and
current Brave. The two knew each other from St. Louis, where Jordan
played with the Cardinals and Devers trained with coach Bob Kersee.
''So, I've still got my training partner,'' Deevers said.
</P>
<P>
   She shopped for a new hometown by feel. ''I've lived in
California and St. Louis. Anywhere I go, I look around and see if
it's somewhere I'd like to be. I just liked it here. The people are
great, very kind. Southern hospitality and all that. It feels like
home,'' Devers said.
</P>
<P>
   And a new civic motto is born: Atlanta _ A Great Place to Hang
your Spikes.
</P>
<P>
   Devers already has a feel for what sells in this area. Her
theory for growing track? ''Bobby (Kersee) is always saying, 'Why
can't track and field be more like NASCAR?' And why not?'' She
means the whole production, from the marketing of personalities to
the courtship of all things corporate.
</P>
<P>
   Could track and field really go for STP decals on the rear
quarterpanel? ''Decals, yeah, everything. It would be cool,'' she
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   As she looked around a Georgia Dome sparsely populated by an
announced audience of 9,810, Devers was struck by a wild fantasy.
''I want to fill up this stadium one day,'' she said. The field
Saturday was excellent, and still the draw was modest. She'll learn
in time that Atlanta is like many other American cities with a long
tradition of resisting track during non-Olympic years.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out 1998, Devers has stridently announced her
return. There will be no simple handing over of the sprint title to
young Marion Jones. Devers even looks forward to resuming her
career in the 100-meter hurdles saying, ''It's ironic that I had
thought of myself more as a hurdler than a sprinter, and yet all my
medals are in the sprints.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens from here, Atlanta will be happy to hang onto a
piece of it.

ROCKY ROAD LEADS TO COP'S HOME

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ They met at a crack house near Eighth Street and
Hatcher one cold night in February 1998. &QL; 
Police had been watching dealers and users and hookers come and go
for weeks, and now were hoping to shut down the operation, at least
for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Once on the property, they noticed a one-room addition tacked
onto the main building, little more than an storage room with a bed
in it, and decided to check it out. Sgt. Bob Cahill remembers
knocking on the door. A man and woman answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't say much. Then this little guy comes out from
behind them,'' Cahill says. ``He was 3, then, and looked like he
hadn't had a bath in . . . forever. And all he had on was a pair of
shorts.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy said his name was Rocky. The woman, whom police knew
from other busts, was his mother. The man with her wasn't the
father. The boy's father, they were told, was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill has been on the job since 1977. He's a solid brick of a
man who looks like he could play pulling guard for the football
team in his home state, Nebraska. He got a blanket and wrapped it
around Rocky, asking him when he'd eaten last. When Rocky said he
was hungry, Cahill went to McDonald's and bought him a Happy Meal.
</P>
<P>
   That night after work, Cahill told his wife, Tanya, about the
boy. The next day, she bought clothes in Rocky's size and had her
husband drive her, on his day off, to the crack house.
</P>
<P>
   Officers busted the same residence only a week later. The day
after that, Rocky's mother was picked up during a prostitution
roundup on Cave Creek Road. Child Protective Services was notified,
but the boy wasn't removed from the home.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April, officers stopped a suspicious car leaving the
crack house. Two men were inside, each of them wanted by police. In
the back seat, by himself, was Rocky. &QL; 
`BROUGHT TOGETHER'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you're a religious person or not,'' Cahill
said, ``but I believe sometimes we are brought together with people
for a reason. I felt like that about this little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cahills have two children, one hers from a previous
marriage, one of their own. On the job, the sergeant often sees
kids in crisis. The rule is: Block it out.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, he couldn't. He found out that Rocky had been
removed from the crack house by CPS and was living in a group
foster home. He and Tanya visited him, finding a friendly,
intelligent boy who knew too much about drug use and women who
entertain men in motels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided this kid needs a chance,'' Cahill said. They
applied to be Rocky's foster parents.
</P>
<P>
   There were background checks and classes and paperwork,
paperwork, paperwork. But in time, the boy who once slept on a
crate with a rug on top came to live in a real house and to have
his own bed. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   At first, Rocky's peculiar brand of English was suited more to

</P>
<P>
   He's moved up to kindergarten, and, at age 5, is thriving. He's

LATE RODMAN MIGHT BE FINED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The new power forward with the flaky
reputation became an instant issue for the new coach setting a
no-nonsense tone in their first day of practice together.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman was 20 minutes late to practice Saturday _ his
first full, off-day practice with the Los Angeles Lakers _ and
coach Kurt Rambis said he might dole out a fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily cool. I told the players he's going to be
fined accordingly,'' Rambis said. ``I will find out what's going on
and if it's legitimate, then no harm. And if he was just late, then
he's fined. And I'm fine with the fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's ``Dennis is Dennis'' mantra notwithstanding. But
Rambis said that while the rules apply to Rodman, he will ``have
leeway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a free thinker, and if he wants to do things differently,
I do not have a problem with that, as long as it's within the
structure and the guidelines and the rules that we have set for the
team,'' said Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   Co-captain Shaquille O'Neal had little comment on Rodman's
tardiness, other than to say it was Rambis' problem and that Rodman
``worked hard in practice'' once he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodman's been relatively normal so far. His wackiest move
has been to ask for a stationary bike that he can ride during games
to stay loose when he's not on the floor. He did the same in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're gonna try to get a place for him to put a stationary
bike and ride, which doesn't bother me at all,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   The coach is still mulling whether to start Rodman immediately
or continue using him off the bench and is struggling to find
playing time for everyone now that there are five power forwards on
the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry might start sharing small forward duty with Rick
Fox and Kobe Bryant, while Elden Campbell will probably become
exclusively a backup center.
</P>
<P>
   Rambo rules: Rambis used Saturday's brief practice to establish
his coaching style immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like things are different,'' O'Neal said. ``We had a
no-nonsense practice today. Running, running, running. Wasn't much
conversation. Do I like it? Yeah. Great practice. Looks like Kurt
is gonna be a great one. As long as I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis said he wants an environment of ``intense competition and
work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We went at it today,'' he said. ``As a player I wanted to come
in and get my job done. I wanted to work hard and get out. And
that's how I'm gonna approach it as a coach. I want to keep them as
short as possible, still accomplishing all the goals we want to as
a coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting: Rambis found out he was the head coach about 2 p.m.
Friday and had difficulty with some of the subtler changes come
game time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I wanted to sit down there was no place to sit,''
he said in mock complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Del Harris never sat down.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Assistant coach) Bill Bertka was complaining he was looking
at my (butt) the whole time. After a while he just said, `Look,
Kurt, when you come back here just stop right here, don't keep
walking in front of me.' I'm gonna have to get some tape or
something ... so I won't cross that line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there's a coach's box, too. The referees were telling
me that. I gotta figure out wherever the hell that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Campbell became the fourth Laker to catch the flu
in the past two weeks and missed Saturday's practice.

AN UNLIKELY FIELD OF TWO: IT'S MAGGERT VERSUS MAGEE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ Jeff Maggert and Andrew Magee had overcome
difficult odds all week, and they did it again Saturday. Moving one
step closer to the biggest payday of their careers, Maggert and
Magee overcame deficits and advanced to Sunday's 36-hole final
match of the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's semifinals, Maggert defeated Steve Pate, 1 up,
after Pate led, 3 up, with seven holes to play. Magee was also a
comeback winner, losing the first three holes to John Huston but
storming back for a 3 and 1 victory in the second semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   So Maggert, seeded 24th in the 64-player tournament, and Magee,
seeded 50th, will meet Sunday at La Costa Resort and Spa for $1
million, more money than either player has ever won during a PGA
Tour season. It has been an improbable week for both players, and
for one of them, it will end in glorious fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Others may be unhappy that more recognizable names did not
advance to the finals. But for Maggert and Magee, the week was
fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great win yesterday, but that was just one of the
hurdles to have a chance to win this golf tournament,'' said
Maggert, who defeated top-seeded Tiger Woods in Friday's
quarterfinals to advance to Saturday's match. ``When I got here
Monday, Sunday is where I wanted to be. Winning the golf tournament
is going to mean a lot more to me than the million dollars. I want
the victory more than putting a few more dollars in my account.''
</P>
<P>
   As he had all week, Maggert showed poise and determination
against Pate, turning the tide when it appeared that Pate might be
in command. With Pate holding a 3-up lead after 11 holes, Maggert
started his comeback with an eagle at the par-5 No. 12 to win the
hole, reaching the green in two shots, then making a 25-foot putt.
Then Maggert won No. 13 as well, when Pate hit a poor approach shot
into a greenside bunker and failed to get up and down for par.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the turning point,'' said Pate, who will
face Huston in Sunday's 18-hole consolation match for third place.
``I never felt I was in control, but I stopped making birdies, he
started making birdies, and I made some mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggert evened the match at No. 15 with a 9-foot birdie putt,
and the momentum had clearly swung in his favor. Pate fell behind
for good at No. 16 with another mistake, three-putting for a bogey
when he missed a 5-foot putt for par. ``I misread both putts
badly,'' Pate said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pate did not fold, and it took superb play by Maggert on
Nos. 17 and 18 to close the match. Pate hit a nice third shot at
the par-5 No. 17 that landed 12 feet below the hole, but Maggert's
approach was even better, landing 5 feet from the pin. Pate knew
that if he missed his putt, Maggert would probably end the match on
his next putt. But Pate made the 12-footer for birdie. Maggert
followed by making his 5-footer for birdie as well.
</P>
<P>
   So the match moved to the par-4 No. 18 with Maggert still 1 up,
and there it ended. After both players reached the green in two
shots, Pate had about a 30-footer for birdie that he missed 3 feet
to the right. Maggert putted next from about 28 feet, and after
leaving the putt about 4 feet short, he made the next putt to
clinch the match. Maggert has not won on tour since 1993, but he
has 12 second-place finishes in his career, and he said he had the
confidence to win on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been frustrating to be in situations to win golf
tournaments and not win,'' said Maggert. ``That's what I judge
myself on, being able to win. I know that I'm a good enough player.
I can't look back and say, `Gosh, I've come up short so many
times.' I'm out here to prove a lot of things to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Magee showed resolve as well, after starting his match against
Huston by losing the first three holes. But Huston bogeyed No. 4,
leaving him with a 2-up advantage and giving Magee hope. Before the
match, Magee had run out of clean socks, and so he purchased two
pairs at the clubhouse. Thanks to his comeback, Magee will wear the
second pair during Sunday's match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to be here,'' said Magee, one of the tour's
funniest players. ``I packed for the L.A. Open, and I packed to get
maybe halfway through this week, then I was going home. But I've
got to play now. I'm thrilled about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Magee won Nos. 9 and 10 to even the match, then took the lead
for good with a 10-foot birdie putt at No. 12. Magee took a
commanding 2-up lead at No. 16, when Huston hit his approach shot
into the bunker and failed to get up and down for bogey. The match
ended at No. 17, when Huston hit his second shot into the hazard
near the water, and Magee chipped in for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Sunday's championship match, Magee said: ``Yeah, I
like money. Money is a motivating factor. I'm sure it's going to
make all the other guys who didn't qualify very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maggert and Magee earned their way to Sunday's payday.
Maggert defeated Fred Funk, Nick Price, Bernhard Langer, Woods and
Pate. Magee defeated Darren Clarke, Thomas Bjorn, Bill Glasson,
Shigeki Maruyama and Huston. So the first event in the new World
Golf Championships series, one that has been unpredictable, will
end with either Maggert or Magee as the champion. It is not the
final that was expected, but Maggert was thrilled to be in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for Tiger, or Ernie Els and David Duval, our
sport wouldn't be what it is, and those guys deserve credit,''
Maggert said. ``They have played better than I have over the last
three or four years. But unlike other sports, the No. 50 or No. 60
best player is not that far from being No. 1. On any given day, he
can be the best player in the world. I think everyone has witnessed
that this week.''

 &HT;    CHANGING ATTITUDES ON RACE HOLD HOPE FOR BETTER RELATIONS
 &HT;    950&AMP;add. With BLACK-DATA. For release Sunday, Feb. 28.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``The problem of the twentieth century is the
problem of the color line,'' educator W.E.B. DuBois wrote in 1903.
Will that still be true in 21st-century America, when whites are no
longer a majority and Hispanics replace blacks as the country's
largest ethnic minority?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may lie in the attitudes of the ``Millennium
Generation,'' Americans under the age of 18. This demographic tidal
wave has already eclipsed the baby boomers in numbers, and there is
no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation is going to redefine American society in ways
much more profound than the boomers,'' said Ronald Franklin, a
Detroit advertising executive who is analyzing the generation for
Connecticut-based Yankelovich Partners Inc., one of the foremost
trackers of changing American lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   There are already signs that race relations are changing. White
kids want to ``be like Mike.'' ``Urban attitude'' colors the music
and fashion favored by ``Millenniums'' of all races. Colin Powell
and Oprah Winfrey are consistently among the most admired
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millenniums'' are the most racially and ethnically diverse
generation in the country's history, with a proportion of nonwhites
60 percent larger than that of the two preceding generations. Polls
show that its members are more relaxed in their attitudes about
race and more optimistic about the future of race relations than
previous generations were.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation is re-creating America's racial identity every
single day,'' said Farai Chideya, an ABC News correspondent and
author of ``The Color of Our Future,'' a new book about individuals
coping with the country's changing racial terrain. ``And if anybody
is going to erase the color line, it's going to be them.''
</P>
<P>
   Such optimism is tempered by government data suggesting that
even after a century of civil rights progress, deep problems
remain.
</P>
<P>
   Black families still earn 40 percent less than comparable white
families and have 90 percent less family wealth. Less than half own
their home, compared to 70 percent of whites. Blacks are half as
likely to attend college as whites. A majority of black births
occur out of wedlock. Black men are incarcerated at a rate of
nearly 8 times that of whites. And blacks' life span averages six
years less than whites'.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it costs to be black in America in 1999,'' said
Joe Feagin, a sociologist at the University of Florida. ``That is
what 400 years of oppression means today.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the ``Millennium Generation'' leading the way, it's
far from clear that future Americans will live as ``neighborly
citizens of a common country,'' as Frederick Douglass, the runaway
slave turned abolitionist leader, predicted just five months after
the President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863.
</P>
<P>
   Along with their wealth, whites enjoy disproportionate political
power that gives them a great deal of control over the pace of
social change. For example, while blacks make up 12 percent of the
population, they hold only about 8 percent of the seats in the U.S.
House and none in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the talk about demographics really obscures a more basic
point _ that for all the gains of minorities, there is very little
sharing of power by the white establishment,'' said Chideya.
``Already, we see a backlash against racial diversity in an attempt
to keep America fixed in time.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the battle is affirmative action, the concept
that the victims of discrimination should be given special
consideration in employment and college admissions. Political
conservatives counter with a call for a ``color-blind society''
that grants racial preferences to no one.
</P>
<P>
   This struggle will affect race relations well into the next
century, complicated by the growing number of Americans who have no
personal knowledge of state-imposed segregation of blacks through
most of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``As new generations of whites are born and raised, the memories
of Jim Crow will fade, along with the guilt,'' said Richard
Kahlenberg, a researcher at the Center for National Policy in
Washington and author of ``The Remedy: Class, Race and Affirmative
Action.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite its experience with integrated schools and
neighborhoods, the ``Millennium Generation'' is not some racial
utopia. In a ``Class of 2000'' poll of 11th graders by CBS News,
one-fourth admitted having made racist remarks, a the group was
less likely to approve of interracial dating than older Americans
are of interracial marriage.
</P>
<P>
   According to experts, ``ground zero'' for the future of race
relations will come after the year 2050, when the youngest of the
``Millennium Generation'' will be 70 years old. Not long after,
race in America will have been turned upside down, with whites in
the minority and blacks, Hispanics and Asians constituting a
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Paula D. McClain, a civil rights expert at the University of
Virginia, sees two prospects: one of increased racial tensions, the
other of unprecedented racial understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whites who have never experienced minority status will battle
to maintain their privileged position in the face of changing
demographics,'' McClain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand,'' she added, ``it is possible that the
reversal in status for many white Americans will eventually bring
about improved race relations as they begin to understand the
situation in which black Americans have found themselves for the
last 400 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Feagin is in the pessimistic camp.
</P>
<P>
   The ``most likely choice'' for whites in the second half of the
next century is ``building more private schools, more guarded,
gated communities, moving to 'white states' in the Rocky Mountains
and Midwest, buying guns and more police _ basically the old South
African apartheid system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the color line begins to evolve into a color matrix, whites
may also try to co-opt some lighter-skinned, more assimilated
Asians and Hispanics into 'honorary white' status,'' another tactic
used in South Africa, Feagin said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Mary Thornberry, an expert on racial politics at Davidson
University, is suspicious of any predictions about the second half
of the next century. But she believes two trends will signal
whether ``race is disappearing as a central factor in identity'':
the level of support for public education and the frequency of
interracial dating and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   A number of experts, noting the increase in interracial
marriages over the past decade, have suggested that this trend will
ultimately break down America's color line.
</P>
<P>
   But Yvonne Scruggs-Leftwich, executive director of the Black
Leadership Forum, an umbrella group for dozens of civil rights
groups, notes that ``out-marriages'' occur more often among
Hispanics, who can be of any race, than African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Only 8 percent of black men and 4 percent of black women marry
outside their race, while 31.6 percent of native-born Hispanic men
and 31.4 percent of Hispanic women do, according to an analysis of
Census Bureau data by the Russell Sage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the process of racial convergence to beige ``a myth,''
Scruggs-Leftwich said that ``it will be a very long time before the
overwhelming number of African Americans will appear to be anything
other than African Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``We must go on with the business of racial
reconciliation, we must dump the useless concept of
color-blindness, and we must value each other for exactly who we
are, not who we are fading into.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Drivers whose cars are seized under the Giuliani
administration's new crackdown on drunken driving face such a long
and costly series of court battles to get their vehicles back that
many may simply decide to give up their cars without a fight,
defense lawyers said last week.
</P>
<P>
   They predicted that a driver who was arrested for the first time
on drunken driving charges, and whose blood alcohol level is barely
over the legal limit could expect to lose the car, pay at least a
$300 fine and have their license suspended for at least 90 days. If
they are lucky, such drivers could eventually buy back their cars
from the Police Department at their approximate trade-in value, the
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of seized cars are sold back to defendants in drug
and prostitution cases, a police official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said. Selling the cars back is not official
policy in cases of drunken driving, but court officials speaking on
the condition of anonymity said it was likely to be an option
quietly offered to first-time offenders.
</P>
<P>
   But drivers who test far above the legal limit or who are
second-time offenders who choose to fight the charges can expect to
be mired in criminal and civil court battles for more than a year,
pay up to $10,000 in legal fees, and lose the cars anyway. The
lawyers said these drivers may find it easier just to plead guilty
and surrender their cars.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure how the new system will evolve if it
withstands court challenges on its constitutionality. Some predict
that nearly all drivers will simply give up on getting their cars
back. Others predict an explosion in the number of drivers who
demand trials, a move that would cripple the city's already
overburdened court system and make the crackdown enormously
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But the most likely scenario, according to defense lawyers,
prosecutors and court officials, is that a two-tiered system will
develop. Wealthy first-time offenders who are willing and able to
fight may be able to quickly settle the criminal charge and the
civil case by buying their cars back from the police. But repeat
offenders and the poor will face such a drawn-out battle that they
will in essence be forced to give up. While in criminal court
defendants who cannot afford lawyers are represented by
court-appointed lawyers, in civil court they are on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell C. Ellman, a lawyer who specializes in drunken driving
cases, said the city faces enormous court costs if drivers fight
and the crackdown is carried out as strictly as Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has outlined. Ellman and civil court officials who spoke
on the condition of anonymity predicted that the city would allow
some defendants to settle their civil cases, in essence, by buying
their cars back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is going to have to plea bargain on the civil side,''
he said. ``If even 20 percent of drunk drivers went to trial you're
talking about 1,000 cases. The city does not have the capability to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But city officials say they have the resources to carry out the
crackdown, cars will be taken away from first-time offenders and
they are not bluffing. ``The harm a first-time offender can do on
the road is the same as a second-time offender,'' said Daniel
Connolly, a special counsel in the city law department. ``If it
saves one life, anything that discourages people to drive drunk is
worthwhile.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For those accused of driving drunk, the problems begin with a
stark choice after being pulled over. If the driver refuses to take
a breath test, the driver's license is automatically suspended for
six months. And even drivers who do not take a breath test can be
charged with driving drunk and lose their cars based on how a
police officer assesses their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   If the driver takes the breath test, a blood-alcohol reading of
0.10 or higher will trigger his or her arrest and the automatic
seizure of the car. A lower score can lead to an arrest for driving
while impaired, a traffic infraction, but not the seizure of the
car.
</P>
<P>
   After a night in jail, the driver must appear before a judge, be
arraigned and most likely be told to return to court in a month.
Under the crackdown, the driver now has to resolve two issues
before regaining his or her car _ a criminal drunken driving charge
and the civil action the city has begun to seize the vehicle
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said they would counsel clients to first resolve
their criminal cases. In one of the few pieces of relatively good
news for offenders, officials in district attorney's offices in all
five boroughs this week said that prosecutors were, in essence,
taking no position on the crackdown and would continue to offer
plea bargains in drunken driving cases.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Brooklyn and the Bronx currently allow first-time
offenders who are not involved in accidents and test at .15 or
lower to plead to the lesser charge of driving while impaired, a
traffic infraction that carries a $300 fine and 90-day license
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan and Staten Island, drivers are allowed to plead to
the lesser charge if they test below .12 or .13. Queens prosecutors
said they evaluate each defendant on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, roughly half of the 4,978 people charged with drunken
driving in the city were allowed to plead guilty to the lesser
charge of driving while impaired, according to court records. But
Giuliani administration officials said they would still move to
seize the cars of people who avoid conviction on drunken driving
charges by pleading guilty to the lesser charge of driving while
impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers were split over whether they would advise their
clients to take the plea or demand a trial in the criminal case.
Some said any guilty plea would bolster the city's case in civil
court that the car should be seized. But others said it was more
practical to take the guilty plea and hope the city quietly allows
first time offenders to buy their cars back.
</P>
<P>
   A police official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that
the ``majority'' of the 1,800 cars seized last year in drug,
prostitution and cases of driving without a license ended in
``settlements'' where the defendants bought their cars back . The
police official said that the Police Department goes to trial in
civil court over car seizures in less than 1 percent of cases. In
the vast majority of cases, either the defendant gave up the car or
the police agreed to a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials who spoke on condition of anonymity and defense
lawyers said the city could adopt a zero tolerance policy, but the
cost would be enormous. The problem for the city is not storing the
cars, they said, it is the cost of fully litigating the lengthy
civil cases where drivers fight them. Under a zero tolerance
crackdown on drunken driving, the number of civil actions involving
cars filed by the city could triple from 1,800 last year to nearly
7,000 cases.
</P>
<P>
   For now, most of the 22 drivers who have had their cars seized
appear to be waiting to see if the practice is declared
unconstitutional. As of Friday, only one driver, Pavel Grinberg, a
Polish immigrant from Staten Island, had filed a letter to the
Police Department demanding the return of his car.
</P>
<P>
   Grinberg, a first-time offender who tested just over the legal
limit during the first night of the crackdown, is the test case the
New York Civil Liberties Union hopes to use get the crackdown
declared illegal. Grinberg's lawyers are expected to go to court
next week to demand a court order barring further seizures and the
immediate return of Grinberg's brown 1988 Acura, his family's only
car.

 &HT;    Baptist leader is convicted
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARGO, Fla. _ Forgiveness for embattled Baptist leader Henry
Lyons will have to come from somewhere other than a jury of his
peers.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, an all-white jury convicted the leader of one of
the nation's largest African-American denominations of racketeering
and grand theft, saying he financed a lifestyle of luxury with more
than $4 million stolen from corporations that wanted to do business
with members of the National Baptist Convention. He also was found
guilty of stealing a $250,000 donation intended to help black
churches burned out by arsonists.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons' co-defendant, Bernice Edwards, was acquitted of
racketeering, the sole charge she faced. Edwards broke down in
tears at the verdict, while Lyons sat stoically at the defense
table, hands clasped.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, 57, will remain free on bond pending a presentence
investigation, which should take several weeks. He faces up to
seven years in prison, although under Florida guidelines he is more
likely to receive three to five years. Both Lyons and Edwards face
a federal trial later this spring on charges of tax evasion,
extortion and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons' attorneys said they believe he will remain president of
the convention until his term ends in September. But a rival within
the group called for Lyons to resign immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The day of drama began with a bizarre wrinkle. A Tampa-area news
station reported receiving an electronic message from a viewer who
stated that one of the jurors had been overheard discussing the
case outside the courtroom _ a violation of the judge's orders.
Pinellas Circuit Judge Susan Schaeffer questioned the juror, who
denied any such conversation. Schaeffer then denied the defense's
request to declare a mistrial. Lyons came under scrutiny in July
1997 when his wife set several small fires in a $700,000 waterfront
home Lyons purchased with Edwards in an upscale St. Petersburg
neighborhood. Deborah Lyons first told police she suspected her
husband was having an affair, but quickly changed her story and has
since stood by him.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident triggered state and federal investigations that
found Lyons had negotiated several lucrative deals with
corporations that wanted to market credit cards, insurance and
funeral services to the convention's membership. Although most of
the money went into convention accounts, Lyons spent it on luxury
items for himself, Edwards and a California woman who told
convention colleagues she was having an affair with Lyons. The
grand theft allegations were related to money Lyons took as a
donation for his church group.
</P>
<P>
   When a string of black churches across the South were set ablaze
by arsonists in the early 1990s, the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith, a Jewish group, stepped forward with nearly $250,000
in donations.
</P>
<P>
   While telling the ADL that all of the money went to the
churches, Lyons put at least $60,000 into his personal accounts,
prosecutors said. He eventually repaid the $250,000, but not until
the criminal investigations were under way.

BUSS NEEDS TO BE SEEN AND HEARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A young brunette at his elbow, a purple-and-gold
leather jacket on his back and a relieved smile on his lips, Jerry
Buss showed up outside the Los Angeles Lakers' locker room Thursday
in Anaheim to congratulate coach-for-a-night Bill Bertka on a
spirited victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. Buss was
immediately cornered by reporters hungry for his opinions on Del
Harris' firing and Dennis Rodman's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers owner makes few such appearances and rare public
proclamations nowadays. He did sit down with the beat writers
before the opening-night game at the Forum and promised to be
``accessible.'' But in recent months he was absent from news
conferences to announce vice president Jerry West's new contract,
Kurt Rambis' promotion to head coach and Harris' dismissal, after
having said nothing to clarify Harris' status during the extended
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Though Buss remains the Lakers' chief executive, at 66 he is
less and less the club's ceremonial leader, increasingly content to
let West and general manager Mitch Kupchak speak for the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The effect, far from cosmetic, has been to encourage the rampant
speculation that Buss and West are at odds over trades and
signings, that there is confusion in the front office and that the
Lakers are closer to implosion than an NBA championship. The
silence has been filled by laughter from Lakers-haters everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Buss's short, mostly glib, largely unrealistic answers to the
reporters' questions Thursday were hardly reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Lakers' 6-6 start, which preceded the coaching
change, ``hasn't disappointed me at all. I think we're the envy of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He claimed that, contrary to every report, West did not oppose
the acquisition of Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   And after saying ``I don't know'' if the Lakers needed ``more
energy or a disciplinarian'' in a new coach, he said the decision
would be his and it would probably take more than another day to
make.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did that contradict his staff's announcement of a
Friday press conference to introduce a new coach, it contradicted
Kupchak's assertion _ after Rambis was introduced at a Friday
evening press conference _ that the choice had been made Thursday
and only contractual details then remained to be settled.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen some of this before from the popular Dr. Buss, a
brilliant man but an uneasy speech-maker, during his nearly 20
years as Lakers owner.
</P>
<P>
   Most memorable, there was the bungled 1981 press conference at
which Buss seemed to appoint special consultant West and assistant
coach Pat Riley as co-head coaches to replace Paul Westhead.
</P>
<P>
   That worked out all right after Riley and West agreed that Riley
would be the head coach, and he led the Lakers to four NBA titles.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, when the question is not who's in charge on the
bench but who's calling the shots upstairs, Buss' failure to put
the issue to rest causes deeper damage to the franchise's precious
image.
</P>
<P>
   Did Buss veto a proposed trade involving Lakers guard Eddie
Jones and then-Sacramento sharp-shooter Mitch Richmond last season,
prompting West to nearly quit?
</P>
<P>
   Did Buss overrule his vice president in order to pursue Rodman,
or was West merely leery of taking on the unpredictable forward?
</P>
<P>
   Did Buss sour on Harris, leaving it to West to decide when to
fire his friend, or was that a unanimous decision?
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, at the height of worry about West's future with the
Lakers, it was up to the employee to tell reporters that he and the
boss had never quarreled. If Buss had been there too, elaborating
on the state of the Jerry-Jerry relationship, everybody might have
felt more confident they'd heard the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Buss's role in player and coaching personnel decisions has
increased in the past decade or two. In which case, he must be
willing to step forward more often to explain his pivotal choices.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Buss's role remains safely within the prerogative of a
man who has committed nearly $200 million in salary to Shaquille
O'Neal and Kobe Bryant alone. In which case, he should reaffirm
West's authority and expertise for the sake of West's sanity and
the fans'.
</P>
<P>
   Buss will never be called reclusive. On his most private day, he
makes Peter O'Malley look like a monk. But his lower profile is
hurting the Lakers and he'll have to change if he wants to turn the
laughter back into envy.

3 NEW COMMUNITIES HOPE TO LURE 100,000 TO EDGE OF VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dozens of towering saguaros dot the hillsides along Carefree
Highway near Interstate 17, and they always catch the eye of Edward
Cramer.
</P>
<P>
   For two years now, his drive to and from home has included sweep
ing views of mountains, raw desert land and these saguaros. In
another two years, much of what he sees from his car window will be
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about it all the time when I drive by,'' Cramer said.
``It's like our own little Saguaro National Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Developer Mark Voigt thinks about the saguaros, too.
</P>
<P>
   The desert land where they sit, he said, is ideal for homes,
businesses, a community center, school and park _ a virtual city
within a city that blends with the area's natural features, and a
concept that is being pushed by Phoenix planners to manage growth
that is exploding along I-17 in the north Valley.
</P>
<P>
   As for the saguaros, some will be saved and moved, but others
will remain where they have been for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique piece of property. You need to preserve open
space to create the value,'' said Voigt, president of Communities
Southwest. ``That's where Mr. Cra mer and I really see eye to
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The far north Valley is headed for phenomenal growth, starting
with the new, Flagstaff-size, master-planned community of Anthem
that opens Saturday near New River. The scale of the developments
in the region is massive, even in a metro area that's used to homes
popping up by the thousands virtually over night. In a decade,
100,000 more people could be living in one of the fastest growing
areas in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Just what impact will it have on the area? It depends on whom
you ask.
</P>
<P>
   It's a golden opportunity to shape a mostly untouched area. A
chance to bring jobs and houses to an area at the same time. A
threat to vulnerable desert wildlife and plant life. A traffic and
pollution head ache waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the answer, city offi cials, developers and residents
agree that growth is inevitable and brings with it enormous
challenges. That has city officials vowing to plan every step of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't do it now, there is going to be no opportunity to
do it in the future,'' Mayor Skip Rimsza said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The North Black Canyon Corri dor _ which straddles I-17 and
runs from about Happy Valley Road to the city's northern limits _
is one of six areas in the city that is expected to see phenomenal
growth, according to city planners.
</P>
<P>
   By 2020, at a 2 percent growth rate, an estimated 600,000 more
people will call Phoenix home. Of those, as many as 150,000 could
settle in the corridor.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 50,000 could live just outside the city's northern
boundary even sooner in Anthem, a master-planned community by Del
Webb Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Anthem project, and three others in development now, com
prise about 9,000 acres _ more than half the size of the
16,000-acre South Mountain Park.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem, which spreads out over 5,800 acres, sits on Maricopa
County land on the east side of the freeway. Eventu ally it could
have as many as 10,000 homes. Other projects are on the drawing
boards in the corridor. A handful are being talked about, but
three, all east of the freeway, are taking shape.
</P>
<P>
   They are Tramonto near Carefree Highway; Dynamite Mountain Ranch
near the Central Arizona Project canal; and an unnamed Sunbelt
Holdings community in between.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the projects comprise more than 3,000 acres. Plans
vary, but they include homes and apart ments, community centers,
parks and some commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   Home buyers could begin moving into the corridor by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   All of the projects wind through land being eyed by Phoenix for
a 15,000-acre desert preserve _ with scenic hillsides and washes, a
mix of plant life and wildlife, and trails for hikers and others.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the area is largely untouched desert, there are many
hands hoping to shape all or part of it. As one person works to
preserve an old unpaved path for horses another maps out a new
six-lane roadway for cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   For almost every supporter of a plan, there is a critic; for
every optimist with a vision, there is a doubter.
</P>
<P>
   All of which, planners say, leaves them with opportunities and
chal lenges. Among them are:
</P>
<P>
   Balancing housing with employ ment to avoid creating a bedroom
community that has people commut ing across the city and Valley to
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Blending houses, businesses and desert.
</P>
<P>
   Adding infrastructure _ water, sewer and roads _ in an area that
has none. That includes accommo dating added traffic on I-17, al
though there are no immediate plans by the state to widen the
freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Providing schools in the already crowded and financially
strapped Deer Valley Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the issues are being addressed in a proposed North Black
Canyon Corridor Plan developed by the city. It calls for changes to
the city's general plan, which would require approval from both the
Plan ning Commission and City Council. A third public hearing
before the commission is scheduled next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area is prime, so prime,'' said Clancy Jayne, a north
Valley resident and chair of the North Gateway Village Planning
Commit tee. ``We've got a blank sheet of paper but we've got to
stay on track.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some who are critical of developing the area.
</P>
<P>
   Some fume about more traffic in the area, and the tax dollars
needed to eventually widen I-17 because of it.
</P>
<P>
   Others are skeptical about pairing master-planned communities
with desert landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really not compatible,'' said Ray Griswold, who lives
just north of Happy Valley Road. ``It's just not economical to put
in something without bulldozing the desert off.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as Chris Gehlker of the Sierra Club suggests, why not
promote more in-fill in the Deer Valley area before opening the
door to development to the north?
</P>
<P>
   ``My immediate reaction is, `Didn't your mother teach you to
clean up one mess before you start another?,' '' said Gehlker, who
works and lives in the north Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's willing to give the development a chance, saying the
city's proposals to manage growth are ``frankly pretty
attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, city officials want growth in the north Valley
to take shape much differently than it has in other parts of the
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see the air quality, the (traffic) congestion and
there's just been such dynamic growth that they say, `How can we do
this better?' '' said Planning Director David Rich ert. ``It is one
of those situations where you have the ability to get ahead of it
or wait and have a crisis situation.''
</P>
<P>
   One key to managing the area, Rimsza notes, is the high impact
fees in the area, which could be up to $10,000 per home. Businesses
also pay impact fees. Such fees are used to offset the cost of
adding infrastruc ture _ which will be a major undertaking in the
north Valley.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the city plans to have a new water treatment plant
near Lake Pleasant, with the first phase open by 2004. The cost of
the first phase, excluding water lines, is more than $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   A water reclamation plant near I-17 and the CAP is planned for
2004. The price tag: $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   The city also wants to add Parkway A, a six-lane, north-south
street at about 27th Avenue, from roughly the CAP to Carefree High
way.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arizona Public Serv ice Co. is counting on new substa
tions and power lines, and will be picking future sites with the
help of residents and others.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix officials, as part of the corridor plan, ultimately want
to limit how far they extend infrastruc ture.
</P>
<P>
   A line could be drawn around 8,600 acres from I-17 to Seventh
Avenue and the CAP to the northern city boundary. Infrastructure
wouldn't go past that line for 10 years, or until 65 percent of the
area is developed to discourage hop-scotch growth.
</P>
<P>
   And city planners say they won't allow unlimited rooftops
either. They are pushing for a regional job and housing center that
would keep residents from clogging the freeway and adding to air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't build a bedroom community,'' said Jayne, who lives
near 19th and Beardsley avenues. ``That can't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   To get a balance, the number of jobs in the area would
ultimately be equal to 75 percent of the residen tial population.
</P>
<P>
   Richert said access to the freeway and Deer Valley airport is
key to attracting employers, as is establish ing a housing base
with the three projects in the works now.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he said, the city can help market the area, as well
as work with local universities and schools to provide a labor
force. By tying housing growth to employ ment, developers may even
be prompted to help bring in jobs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether employers will come is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   One business may look for a remote location _ high-tech firms in
the past have chosen such sites, said Tom Rex, a research manager
for ASU's Center for Business Research.
</P>
<P>
   Another business will need to be closer to a large population
base and a big airport like Sky Harbor International. Yet another,
such as a call center with lower-paid employ ees, could be
interested but find that housing is too expensive for the staff.
</P>
<P>
   While planners tackle growth, some land owners are taking issue
with certain recommendations by the city to manage it.
</P>
<P>
   One sticking point is a proposal in the corridor plan to
restrict development in the floodplain and leave washes natural.
</P>
<P>
   When Lynn Johnson bought his 14-acre parcel 10 years ago, the
city's stance was to restrict develop ment in the floodway rather
than the entire floodplain. Now, Johnson fears losing about 80
percent of his property.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my retirement,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Another land owner, Plateau Ven ture, with about 120 acres, has
about half its land in the floodplain.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Quay, the city's assistant planning director, said the
proposal to restrict development in certain areas is needed for
flood control.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're saying is, we don't want to allow you to encroach
on the floodplain knowing that we would have to do some structural
solution downstream to solve flood ing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the city's corridor plan, officials say it's critical
to blend development with the area's natural features.
</P>
<P>
   The city's ideas?
</P>
<P>
   Build homes facing the preserve, instead of having them back up
to it. Wind roads along the preserve. Keep washes natural. Build
tradi tional parks near the preserve, giving easy access to the
desert while creating a buffer zone be tween development and the
desert.
</P>
<P>
   Such guidelines are critical for the area, Robin Mofford said.
</P>
<P>
   Mofford holds titles like planning commissioner and Deer Valley
Vil lage Planning Committee chair woman, but she's also a longtime
resident who remembers taking her kids on rides through the desert
on all-terrain vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could go to the end of the street, go across the desert
into Cave Creek Wash and just take off,'' she said. ``Now we have
to hitch everything up and find out where we're allowed to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But she's not anti-growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know all of us hate to lose our desert or our natural
areas,'' Mof ford said. ``We're saying, `If you're going to develop
your land, we would like to see it fit into the picture.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And that's possible, according to Bruce Swanson, the city's
Sonoran Preserve manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a way that you can meet in the middle on this
and really do a nice development that is sensitive to the land
around it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Griswold isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-year-old Arizona native was raised on a 25-acre spread
north of the CAP canal. He now lives on 2.5 acres north of Happy
Valley Road, and frets about losing the desert land and its
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a deer herd, lots of javelina and bobcats,'' Griswold
said. In his own backyard, he's spotted ``all three foxes that live
in Arizona . . . they're just beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, Pam Letner has called home a one-acre lot in the
county near Jomax Road. She's also seeing the world around her
change from rural to what-the-heck-is-coming-now?
</P>
<P>
   Letner wonders how planners will balance it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The land is part of us. We want someone to make sure it's done
right.'' &QL;

CAN INTERSTATE 17 SUPPORT MAJOR DEVELOPMENT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the predictions come true, tens of thousands more people
could be moving into new homes in the far north Valley _ bringing
with them cars and the need to get up and go.
</P>
<P>
   Just how far, and how often, is the question for traffic
planners.
</P>
<P>
   City officials vow to balance the homes with jobs, while
developers hope to create minicommunities complete with schools,
parks and businesses. All of which, they say, will help keep people
from making long commutes, and avoid traffic snarls and added air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that happens remains to be seen. But even if it does,
some are looking for major improvements in an area they say is
already burdened without the added rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   The city has dubbed the area the North Black Canyon Corridor,
which straddles I-17 and runs from about Happy Valley Road to the
city's northern limits.
</P>
<P>
   At least three master-planned communities are being developed in
that area; Del Webb's 5,800-acre Anthem project sits to the north,
just outside the city's limits.
</P>
<P>
   The focal point of traffic worries is Interstate 17. The Arizona
Department of Transportation is currently widening a portion
between Thomas and Peoria roads from six to eight lanes, which
includes two HOV lanes. Between Peoria and Deer Valley road, it's
six lanes plus HOV lanes, then four lanes north to the city's
limits.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 200,000 vehicles travel on I-17 daily, with more in
some spots, according to 1997 ADOT figures, the most current
available.
</P>
<P>
   Some want I-17 widened in the north Valley, but that's not
likely before 2020, according to ADOT plans. And that has some who
live and work in the area asking, ``Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic on I-17 is bumper-to-bumper now and on the weekends,''
said Clancy Jayne, a north Valley resident and chair of the North
Gateway Village Planning Committee. ``This is not rocket science.
2020? Give me a break.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is funding, ADOT spokesman Bill Rawson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is certainly aware that I-17 is going to be at
capacity in the future, particularly as development starts to pick
up there,'' he said. But ``we can't do it if we don't have the
funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about significant, significant expenditures.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a current ADOT study, state planners would like to
see I-17 widened from Loop 101 as far north as New River.
</P>
<P>
   They envision eight to 10 lanes, including HOV or toll express
lanes. Two new interchanges would be needed between Happy Valley
Road and Carefree Highway, and a third between Carefree Highway and
Desert Hills Road, recently renamed Anthem Way.
</P>
<P>
   Park-and-ride lots could be added along the way, with direct
ramps to and from the freeway's HOV or express lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Rawson called the number of projects planned along the freeway
``staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the city is planning for three major roadways as
development begins to fill in the corridor in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Parkway A would run to the east of I-17 and Skunk Creek Wash. It
would begin at Happy Valley Road, at about 19th Avenue and then
curve slightly to follow the 27th Avenue alignment up north almost
a mile past Carefree Highway. Eventually, it could go farther
north.
</P>
<P>
   City planners envision a six-lane parkway, with a landscaped
median. Only four lanes may be built initially.
</P>
<P>
   The parkway is key, planners say, to help develop the central
part of the corridor, alleviate traffic on I-17 and provide another
north-south route in case of accidents or other problems on the
freeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city sees that as an employment and retail core,'' said
John Siefert, a city traffic engineer. ``We don't want people
living up near Carefree Highway having to commute to Phoenix and
get caught up in that ornery I-17 traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other six-lane streets would run east-west, with one along
Dove Valley Road and the other at Lone Mountain Road.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, planners could consider building the streets as
far east as Cave Creek Road, Siefert said. But as the streets
entered a proposed desert preserve area, they would be joined so
that only one goes through the preserve. The streets could then be
split at the eastern edge of the preserve and continue on. &QL;

U.S.-CHINESE TENSIONS GROW ON EVE OF VISIT BY ALBRIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS lede and 2nd graf to emphasize Albright's upcoming visit to
China and to refine prose.)  (rk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A day before the arrival of Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright, the Chinese government Saturday night
expressed ``strong resentment'' in a predictably tart response to
the lambasting of its human rights record in a State Department
report on Friday. The official Chinese statement, read on the
state-run television, accused Washington of meddling in China's
internal affairs by ``fabricating unwarranted charges'' while
ignoring serious rights violations in its own country.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, however, did not mention the detention for
questioning on Friday of Wu Yilong, one of the founders of a banned
alternative political party, in the eastern city of Hangzhou. Nor
did it note the sentencing without trial Friday of Peng Ming, a
liberal intellectual who had attempted to run an independent
discussion forum in Beijing, and who was given one-and-a-half years
in a labor camp.
</P>
<P>
   These latest developments only add to the pressure on Ms.
Albright to take a strong line on human rights in the talks she
will hold here with Chinese leaders on Monday. While both sides are
hoping to nurture common ground in the meetings, Albright will
undoubtedly prod China over other perennial American concerns, such
as weapons sales and a widening imbalance of trade.
</P>
<P>
   But she is likely to get an earful in return from the Chinese,
who are worried and perplexed by the seeming nose dive in relations
with the United States, which only last summer pledged to work for
a ``strategic partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent American policies and statements, Chinese foreign policy
experts assert, have been insensitive to China's legitimate needs
on several matters. These include the administration's decision
last week to bar sale of a satellite to a company with indirect
ties to the Chinese military, its sharp criticism on human rights,
its demands for a rapid opening of markets and talk of a possible
missile defense system for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China tends to see specific setbacks, such as the barred
satellite sale, as the work of deeper, hostile political forces.
``We interpret the satellite dispute as a reflection of strategic
thinking that regards China as a threat and an adversary,'' said
Chu Shulong, director of North American studies at the China
Institute for Contemporary International Relations, a government
research organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk in America of a `China threat,''' Chu said, ``is
something we really worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Chinese view, their country is no threat to world peace,
but is simply taking its rightful place as one of the world's great
powers. Many of the strongest American concerns about China,
analysts here tend to believe, reflect a desire to keep China in a
second-class status.
</P>
<P>
   Among officials and even many liberal intellectuals, there is
deep resentment of what they see as a foreign caricature of an
increasingly diverse and vibrant Chinese society as a grim police
state.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, some people who actively threatened Communist Party rule
have been jailed. But at the same time, people here constantly
note, Chinese have more personal choices than ever, private
business is booming and the rule of law is starting to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's visit, and another later in the week by the American
trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, are intended in part to
prepare for a high-profile visit to the United States in April by
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   Trade officials are negotiating furiously over China's desired
entry into the World Trade Organization. A breakthrough would crown
Zhu's American trip and give a needed boost to bilateral relations.
But chances appear slim that China, grappling with a major
restructuring of industry and soaring unemployment, can make enough
trade concessions now to satisfy American demands.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the festering problems, both governments seem to
hope that Zhu's visit can rekindle some of the glow that emanated
from the exchange of presidential summits in late 1997 and last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Though they will not concede their own principles to achieve it,
the Chinese leaders are anxious to sustain friendly ties: They know
that American technology and cooperation are vital to their
economic progress and besides, most Chinese admire American
culture. Just last week, the Grammy Awards ceremony was broadcast
live on state-run radio.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Chinese are smarting over what they see as
worrisome trends in American policy. They fear that the decision to
bar a commercial satellite sale portends new, broader curbs on
transfers of advanced technologies. In public, at least, officials
scoff at the notion that they are stealing secrets for military
application.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the Chinese point of view, this decision is very hard to
understand,'' said Jia Qingguo, a professor of international
studies at Beijing University. ``The Americans complain about a
trade gap, but then they don't want to sell what China wants to
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   On human rights, China will vehemently urge the United States
not to sponsor a resolution criticizing China at the annual U.N.
conference on human rights, to begin in Geneva in late March. In
the wake of stiff sentences China has dealt to several democracy
activists, Congress is pressuring the administration to act.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese government, which argues that society is
gradually loosening, sees such resolutions as gross intrusions on
its sovereignty. ``China feels very strongly about this,'' said Chu
of the government research group.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has made a commitment to change its human
rights practices gradually, said Jia, but it also must worry about
social stability as it tackles severe economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do Americans wish China to do, unleash a wave of
political unrest?'' Jia asked. ``Political instability here is not
in the interest of the United States.''

</P>
<P>
   In meetings Monday with Albright, China is also sure to register
its adamant opposition to proposed research by the United States
and Japan on a ``theater missile defense'' system. The technology
remains hypothetical, but discussions of missile defenses were
quickened by North Korea's test of a long-range missile _ seen
especially as a threat to Japan _ as well as by China's buildup of
missiles on its coast facing Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China has warned that introducing missile defenses to Asia will
only trigger a regional arms race. But the basic idea of using such
weapons to shore up American power in Asia _ and possibly blunt
China's _ is anathema here. And what most outrages the Chinese is
the speculation that such a shield might be extended to Taiwan,
which is considered a renegade province. Providing missile defenses
to Taiwan, Jia said, ``would not only damage China's sovereignty,
but also pose an obstacle to unification of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders know that these issues and others will
inevitably divide China and the United States. But they had hoped,
especially after Clinton's glittering visit here last June, that
disagreements could be boxed off as the countries pursued their
``partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   As an overarching goal of this week's meetings and the prime
minister's April visit, Chu said, ``China wants to reconfirm the
positive trend in relations.''

WILL BUYERS SALUTE FOR NEW TOWN? 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   You've probably seen the child's smiling face on the billboards
as you drive on the freeway. Maybe you've seen the baseball game
and water sports on the television ads in your living room. Or
glimpsed the paintings in the newspaper ads, of a bicycle and golf
tee, schoolbook and baseball gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem is coming.
</P>
<P>
   Far in the northwest Valley, emerging in the midst of a desert,
on the northern fringe of the Valley, a new community is emerging.
</P>
<P>
   And Del Webb, the developer that built its reputation on the
foundation of the Sun Cities retirement communities, is hoping that
residents will flock to what it billing as its first fully equipped
master-planned community for families.
</P>
<P>
   Ken and Mary Miller are on a waiting list that's 1,000 names
long with people from around the country who are willing to give up
time, gas money, and wear and tear on their cars in exchange for
living in development they hope will offer a city-full of places to
work, shop and play. Ken Miller says he wants to live there, even
though it means driving 46 miles a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to have everything. It will be like living in a
brand new town, and that's worth a longer drive,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Within a decade, Anthem is expected to have 50,000 residents,
making it a community the size of Flagstaff. The first buyers may
come Saturday, at an opening to tour the development.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem will have the basic offerings of a small city, including
a school, fire station, large central park and community center,
grocery store and health center, all done before the first resident
moves in late this summer. That's a rarity for most developments,
which usually build homes first and bring in the amenities later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthem is the antithesis of sprawl. It's the best researched
and planned community in the Southwest,'' analyst R.L. Brown said.
``Del Webb is building a new town, and it's paying for all the
infrastructure and creating all the amenities it takes to make it a
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is as ecstatic. A few year ago, when the
development was proposed, critics crowded planning hearings to say
it would destroy the desert, drain water resources, strain already
overcrowded schools and further clog traffic-jammed roads.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb has tried to counter some of that criticism by
shouldering some of the financial burden.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lucas, general manager of Del Webb, said the company will
spend $180 million on construction and communities before the first
resident moves in.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb is spending $66 million on the project's
infrastructure. It is building a water-treatment plant for the
project, funding the $12 million construction of a freeway
interchange off I-17 and donating the land and $9 million to build
Anthem's first K-8 school.
</P>
<P>
   The developer also is donating 50 acres for a high school and
will provide land for two elementary school sites at 50 percent of
the appraised value to the Deer Valley district. Developers' paying
for school construction is highly unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Deer Valley school officials are thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthem has truly raised the level of what developer commitment
to the community is all about,'' said Gerald Cuendet,
superintendent of the Deer Valley district.
</P>
<P>
   But Barry Disimone of the Save New River Coalition said he's
``horrified'' by the small number of schools planned for the
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``A community the size of Anthem should have nine schools,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   New River is the nearest neighbor to the project. It's a town
known for attracting rugged individualists and quirky characters
and an area where the biggest business is a nudist colony and
plumbing is usually a septic tank.
</P>
<P>
   Monty Gregory doesn't care that Del Webb will bring groceries or
doctors closer to his home in New River, which he built himself
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I built a home out here to get away from that kind of stuff,
and now they are destroying the desert and bringing it all to my
front door,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't give a hoot about how nice the houses are supposed to
be or how much stuff it will have,'' said the self-employed plumber
who came here from New York to live in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   But others in New River welcome Anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up here, and when I first heard about Del Webb's plans
I was a little apprehensive,'' said Mary Beth Baker, outgoing
president of the Desert Hills Improvement Association and vice
president of Desert Hills Water Co.
</P>
<P>
   But it's obvious that growth is heading north, she said, and a
master-planned community is one of the best ways for the land to be
developed.
</P>
<P>
   However its neighbors feel about it, Del Webb is intent on
attracting potential buyers by trying to provide them with
everything they may ever need.
</P>
<P>
   It has lots of competition for home buyers' dollars: Of the
36,000 new homes to sell across metro Phoenix last year, more than
40 percent were in master-planned communities.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem comes at a time when Valley home buyers are choosier.
Home building analysts say buyers want a lot more than what they
got from a new master-planned community five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Golf courses used to be the top amenity, but now those have
taken a backseat to open space, hiking trails, workout rooms and
schools.
</P>
<P>
   In Anthem, there also will be swimming pools and water slides, a
rock climbing wall, a mini railroad, a catch-and-release fish pond
and an intricate trail system reaching out to every home.
</P>
<P>
   For jobs that residents may fill, about 30 companies have
contacted the developer about moving operations to Anthem, said
Anne Mariucci, senior vice president of Del Webb. The first ones
are expected to be announced within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Del Webb also is partnering with Samaritan Health to provide
health-care services.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Samaritan will set up a temporary site, but as the
community grows, a free-standing health center offering a range of
medical and urgent-care services will be built.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem also will offer a range of home styles so that a glance
down a street reveals something more than a row of pink stucco.
Homes will range from $100,000 to more than $500,000 gated homes,
complete with wine rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem near New River is the second of the company's
``multigenerational'' projects, but the first to be designed from
the ground up. An Anthem community opened outside Las Vegas last
year, but it originally was designed as a retirement community and
doesn't include all of the family-oriented draws designed for
Anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Anthem is downplaying the traffic concerns, billing it as only a
20-minute drive from central Phoenix. But it usually takes twice
that long in non-rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   There are plans to widen I-17 as the community grows over ten to
20 years, but road and freeway improvements are expected to lag
behind the residential buildup.
</P>
<P>
   The longer drive or potential traffic jams don't deter Miller.
He counts it almost as another amenity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be that far out. It'll be like being a modern-day
pioneer in an area that some day will be huge,'' he said. &QL;

`STAND FIRM' TO CORE VALUES, QUAYLE URGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Former Vice President Dan Quayle urged California
Republicans on Saturday to stick to their core values on economic
and social issues, saying calls by other candidates to soften those
ideas is ``a recipe for disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle had harsh words for those who have suggested that the GOP
moderate its message, particularly on social issues, to give the
party broader appeal with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the delegates at the California GOP convention are
despondent over the drubbing the party took at the hands of
Democrats in November, and some have suggested the party's
positions on abortion, gay rights and immigration contributed
greatly to the losses.
</P>
<P>
   But where fellow Arizona presidential candidate John McCain on
Friday evening invoked the names of Republican Presidents Abraham
Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, Quayle called on his party to
revitalize the coalition of economic and social conservatives that
elected Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should stand firm for what we believe in. We are the ones
that want to cut taxes and promote freedom,'' Quayle said in an
interview before his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not back down. Now is not the time to be timid. Now is
not the time not to have a backbone. Now is not the time to run
away from our core principles that have done rather well over the
years, especially for Ronald Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited tax cuts, smaller government, education reform, and
``sanctity of life'' as issues Republicans should support.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle singled out GOP congressional leaders for criticism,
blasting their decision to backtrack on tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed from what I read and hear coming out of
our Washington leadership. They appear to be walking away from the
10 percent, across-the-board tax cut, and that's a mistake,'' said
Quayle, who is pushing a 30 percent across-the-board tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look like they are going to increase federal spending,
which is a mistake. If in fact the Republican leadership runs away
from a tax cut and increases spending, they're going to create a
trust deficit with the American people _ I'm saying, `Don't back
down. Get a backbone. Hang in there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bill Clinton vetoes these bills, so what? That's what it's
all about in divided government. Try to override his veto.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle dived headlong into the issue of abortion, which has
ripped apart the California GOP in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated calls for a ban on so-called ``partial-birth''
abortions, which he said is supported by 85 percent of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's start with that. There should be consensus on that
issue, and it should not be a divisive issue in the Republican
party. Let's get on with it. It's an important issue.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's speech was a sharp contrast to Friday's address by
McCain, who avoided thorny issues like abortion but emphasized the
need for the party to be inclusive, particularly in welcoming
Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's speech drew a generally tepid response from the
predominantly conservative delegates at the California Republican
Convention. His strongest applause lines came when he called on
Republicans to refrain from attacking each other in the primaries
and when he blasted President Clinton's plans for Social Security
reform.
</P>
<P>
   But he raised eyebrows by declining to talk about abortion,
which is dominating the convention as moderates and conservatives
battle for control of the party.
</P>
<P>
   His pledge to campaign for the Latino vote also received a cool
response, especially when he suggested that the ``politics of
division'' had cost the California party Hispanic voters in recent
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a well-crafted speech, but not for this audience,''
said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior associate at the School of
Politics and Economics at Claremont Graduate School. She added that
McCain may have erred by not talking about abortion and other
favorite conservative issues, such as gun rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a response of polite acceptance to the speech,''
Bebitch Jeffe said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fact that McCain may not have helped himself with the
party's conservative base became more evident Saturday when
delegates staged a rally urging Texas Gov. George W. Bush to enter
the race. If Bush decides to run, McCain will likely have to wrest
control of the political center away from Bush to win the race.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pacheco, who became the first Hispanic to win a
California Assembly seat in the 60th District in November, remains
convinced that Bush is the candidate that best understands Latino
issues, despite McCain's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Pacheco is one of four Latino Republicans in the California
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   McCain vowed to fight for the Latino vote in California,
pointing out that he received 55 percent of the Hispanic vote in
Arizona in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their support is my honor. They believe in me, and I believe
in them. I want their help to build a better country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pacheco says it's Bush who has the better record on Latino
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have met Senator McCain. . . . I admire the man. He is a
very fine gentleman. He has a lot of great qualities,'' said
Pacheco, who signed a letter with 25 other Assembly members last
month urging Bush to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think we have a contest for president that is going to
require the very best candidate, and I think Governor Bush is the
guy. The reason for that is, he's established a record already.
It's more than just saying, `I'm going to reach out.' That's what
the Republican party has been saying for years. Governor Bush now
has a track record in doing it. That's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Sanchez of Alameda, Calif., said he liked McCain's message.
But he still prefers Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't mind seeing McCain on the ticket,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't know if he's the man to lead it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to McCain's speech seemed to break along the battle
lines of the fight for control for the party. Moderates gushed,
while conservatives were more reserved.
</P>
<P>
   Selevendra Thurairajah, a conservative delegate from Los
Angeles, called McCain ``out of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurairajah is a strong supporter of California's Proposition
187, an anti-immigration measure, and he was critical of McCain's
comments on Latino issues.
</P>
<P>
   Another delegate, Bob Strawn of Pleasanton, Calif., said McCain
should have talked more about social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Gillette, a self-described moderate from San Diego, said he
was thrilled to hear McCain's inclusive message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been disenfranchised for the last 10 years, so I am
delighted to see a rational voice emerge,'' Gillette said. &QL;

MISSOURI QUIETS PUNCHLESS TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Missouri and the coach who most likes to rag on
the Lone Star State's additions to the Big 12 wiped the
championship smile off the face of the Texas Longhorns yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers (20-7, 11-5) took advantage of Texas' punchless
offensive performance to hand the regular-season champs a 54-47
loss before an announced Erwin Center-sellout crowd of 16,175.
</P>
<P>
   The loss proves little more than an irritant as far as next
week's Big 12 tournament is concerned, but made for a somewhat
hollow postgame trophy presentation for the No. 22 Longhorns
(18-11, 13-3), who retain the No. 1 seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing to lose this game, but the Big 12
championship makes up for that,'' said forward Kris Clack, who
scored seven points and had four turnovers. ``It does let us know
we can't let up; that we've got to continue to play the way we have
all year. Let down a little bit and someone can take it from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri did just that from the outset, when all-conference
forward Albert White poured in 13 of his game-high 23 points in the
first eight minutes. The Tigers also clogged the middle with
6-foot-11, 335-pound center Monte Hardge and forced Texas to
generate offense from outside. The Longhorns couldn't do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud of our defense all day long. That was the
difference in the ballgame,'' said Missouri coach Norm Stewart,
whose team enhanced its NCAA at-large attraction and assured itself
of a first-round bye in the Big 12 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to congratulate Texas on winning the championship. I'm
sure today was a disappointment for them, but . . . they'll get
ready for the tournament. They're an NCAA ballclub and will be a
great representative as will other teams in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas committed 21 turnovers and reached the foul line only nine
times, robbing the Longhorns of their characteristic free-throw
advantage. Gabe Muoneke led with only 11 points. Center Chris Mihm
scored 10 and had 16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team these are the kind of basketball games you see
this time of year when teams are equally matched,'' UT coachRick
Barnes said. ``You'll see games slowed down like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play excellent defense and don't give up easy baskets in
transition. But you've got to execute and have guys making shots
when the defense is on them. And you absolutely cannot make 21
turnovers. We did turn it over a couple of times trying to force it
in, but you can't go away from what you need to do. But we do need
to knock down our shots from the perimeter.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas was only 10-for-26 in the second half and led only twice,
the last at 45-44. But Missouri's John Woods knocked down a
deciding 3-pointer with 1:53 to play and the Tigers went up 50-45
before Texas scored again.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes did not express undue concern about the
less-than-championship performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll fix it,'' he said. ``They'll do what they've done all
year _ learn from their mistakes. I told them, better today than
later.''

DUKE MAKES THINGS CLEAR IN THE ACC 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Duke, bidding to become the first Atlantic Coast
Conference team in a dozen years to go through the league without a
loss, took little more than a half to seize control during a visit
to North Carolina's Dean E. Smith Student Activities Center Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a crushing 81-61 victory, the first by the Blue
Devils at Chapel Hill in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Duke pushed its record to 29-1 and became the first team to go
16-0 during the ACC regular season. The league expanded to nine
teams in 1991-92.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember a team that has been such an odds-on favorite
to win the national championship as they are,'' said Bill
Guthridge, the North Carolina coach. ``They're just really, really
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the 24th in a row for the Blue Devils since they
lost to Cincinnati in late November in the finals of the Great
Alaska Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   No. 14 North Carolina, the ACC's third-place team, dropped to
22-8 and 10-6 in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina started the second half as it had the first,
getting the ball inside to center Brendon Haywood, whose basket
tied the score at 35-35 after just 43 seconds had elapsed.
</P>
<P>
   But that proved to be the closest the Tar Heels would come.
</P>
<P>
   Duke immediately responded with a lay-in by its center, Elton
Brand. The Tar Heels scored a single basket over the next
six-and-a-half minutes as the Blue Devils pushed their lead to
46-37 with 13 minutes 41 seconds to go on a layup by guard William
Avery off an inbound pass.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina responded with two baskets, cutting the margin to
5 points barely a minute later on a tap-in by guard Ed Cota.
</P>
<P>
   Unruffled, the Blue Devils went on a 22-6 run, controlling the
boards at both ends as they pushed the lead to 68-47 with 5:25
remaining. Duke cruised the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Duke used its superior quickness to dissect the Tar Heel defense
and to win a decisive edge in rebounds. The bigger North Carolina
team increasingly resorted to jumpshots, with diminishing returns.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils, who inflicted the most decisive home defeat on
the Tar Heels since they opened the Smith Center in 1986, won
without Shane Battier, one of their top rebounders and defenders.
The sophomore starting forward sprained his ankle in Duke's
previous game, a victory over DePaul. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither team led by more than one basket through the first 12
minutes of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then, breaking the fourth tie of the game, 19-19 at 9:42 of the
first half, Duke mounted a 10-1 run. Most of the damage was done
inside by Brand and the freshman wing Corey Maggette, each of whom
had had 4 points during the spurt.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 29-20 with 5:30 left in the half, North Carolina
Coach Bill Guthridge called a 20-second timeout, which seemed to
settle his squad.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels scored 7 unanswered points in the next two
minutes, capped by a jumper in the lane by Cota that cut the Duke
lead to 29-27. Cota led the Tar Heels with 10 points in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Maggette immediately responded with a long 3-pointer, and the
Blue Devils pushed the lead back to 35-29 on a Maggette follow-up
shot with 1:21 remaining in the half. He had 9 points in the
period.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina closed with a rush, and nearly took the lead
before halftime. But Cota's 3-pointer with 0.6 seconds left was
ruled to have come after he stepped out of bounds, and Duke
retained its 35-33 edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils had the advantage in rebounds, 24-19, and led at
the half despite only 7 points combined from Brand and Trajan
Langdon, their leading scorers.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, North Carolina got most of its scoring from Haywood,
the Tar Heels' 7-foot, 263-pound center who dwarfed Duke's
defenders. The Blue Devils relied instead on their 3-point shooting
and the interior scoring of Chris Carrawell, the 6-6 forward.
</P>
<P>
   Duke entered the game on a 23-game winning streak, matching the
longest undefeated run in school history. The Blue Devils beat
North Carolina in their previous meeting this season, 89-77.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils are among the most dominant Atlantic Coast
Conference squads ever. Bidding to become just the eighth team to
go through the league undefeated, they've won conference contests
by an average margin of 24.6 points. Duke is fueled by the nation's
most potent offense _ it leads Division I in scoring (93.7) and
scoring margin (25.7), and is second in field goal percentage
(.517).
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, in contrast, has been erratic this season,
relying heavily on young players and enduring a series of injuries
that disrupted the lineup. The Tar Heels survived overtime to win
their two previous games, against Virginia and Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   But an ankle injury that sidelined the 6-8 forward Shane
Battier, Duke's best off-the-ball defender, significantly reduced
the Blue Devils' edge. Post defense is perhaps Duke's only
consistent weakness, and interior scoring is North Carolina's
greatest strength. &QL;

TUZLA CRUISES TO VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ Trainer Julio Canani is the excitable type. His prize
mare, Tuzla, suffers from ulcer problems.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Canani or Tuzla had any reason to be nervous on
Saturday as Tuzla cruised to an easy victory in the $150,000 Buena
Vista Handicap at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even you could have ridden her today,'' joked Canani to a
passenger on the elevator taking the trainer down to track level
after Tuzla won for the fifth time in her last six starts.
</P>
<P>
   Canani was just stating the facts, not taking anything away from
Corey Nakatani's ride. The jockey dropped Tuzla into perfect
position _ third most of the way _ before making his move midway
through the final turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a good (mare) and a great miler,'' said Canani of Tuzla,
which went off a 3-5 favorite in the 1-mile Grade II race on the
turf.
</P>
<P>
   Tuzla, which paid $3.40, $2.60 and $2.10, handed defending
champion Dance Parade her first defeat in four races on the Santa
Anita turf course.
</P>
<P>
   Dance Parade finished fourth in the five-horse field in her
first start since finishing sixth in the Hong Kong International on
Dec. 13, the same date Tuzla won the Grade II Dahlia Handicap at
Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Supercilious finished second, 2 1/2 lengths behind Tuzla and a
neck in front of Green Jewel. Supercilious paid $4.60 and $2.40.
Green Jewel $2.40 to show.
</P>
<P>
   Green Jewel led the majority of the race, but the result was
never in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mile is her best distance,'' said Canani. ``Today there was
no pace, but she showed she was the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuzla is good enough that Nakatani got out of his sick bed to
ride the 5-year old.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a special filly and Julio has done such a great job with
her,'' said the jockey, who has been suffering from the flu. ``He
really knows her game, and whenever she's fresh she runs very big
races.''
</P>
<P>
   Canani says Tuzla enjoys long breaks between races and he has no
plans to change his methods. The trainer hopes to run Tuzla 6-8
times this year. He wouldn't be specific about any of his plans,
but admitted that a 1 3/8-mile race wouldn't be a good distance for
his mare. That might rule Tuzla out of the new $1 million Breeders
Cup Fillies and Mares Turf which will be run at that length.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to play it by ear,'' said Canani. ``We don't have
to run too much early in the year, you don't want to cook them this
early.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, Canani has a good thing on his hands, especially
since he and Nakatani have calmed Tuzla down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in her career she was really high-tempered and tough to
rate ... I've taken a lot of time and tried to get her to rate,''
said Nakatani of Tuzla, who is on medication for her ulcer and now
has a goat (Vincente) to pal around with. ``But one of the big
things is Julio has taken so much time with her ... I think she'll
definitely be the top turf mare in the country.''

<P>
   Or else. That is what the West told the Serbs and ethnic
Albanians gathered in the French chateau of Rambouillet for an
extended fortnight of negotiations this month: agree to the West's
plan for NATO-policed autonomy for Serbia's southern province of
Kosovo, or else.
</P>
<P>
   Or else what? Well, if the Serbs say no, we'll bomb them. And if
the Kosovars say no? Er, well, they won't. And if both say no? Er,
well, awkward that. Then we'll all have to meet again in three
weeks' time. And so they will.
</P>
<P>
   This episode, so embarrassing to the West after all its
ultimatums, should be a reminder that no diplomat has ever lost
face by underestimating the conciliatory nature of the Balkan
politician.
</P>
<P>
   Not, it should be said, that on this occasion it was the Serbs
who took the prize; their dilemma _ whether to yield to western
pressure just before or just after NATO started bombing _ was
miraculously solved for them by the Kosovars' refusal to put their
signature to the western plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the outside world should by now know that, however
appallingly the Serbs behave, the political leadership of those
they oppress is seldom wise, and almost never admirable.
</P>
<P>
   If a three-week delay results in a few more Serb atrocities in
Kosovo, whether provoked or unprovoked, that may suit some
ethnic-Albanian politicians: they will calculate that another
massacre or two can only strengthen their claim to outright
independence for the province.
</P>
<P>
   But such a reckoning can hardly suit the slaughtered Kosovars,
or those who are trying to bring peace to this wretched region.
</P>
<P>
   For the West, the loss of face must be counted an unfortunate
cost of trying to reach a settlement, but that does not mean the
effort should never have been made.
</P>
<P>
   No peace will be won without risks, and the risks _ and
embarrassments _ involved in doing nothing outweigh those of trying
to find a solution and, in the process, suffering rebuffs.
</P>
<P>
   To let the Serbs continue their brutal treatment of the ethnic
Albanians would be to declare that the western democracies, for all
their talk of human rights, would do nothing to end an egregious
example of oppression on their doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   What hope then for those farther afield? And what of the dangers
to neighboring countries should the fighting spread?
</P>
<P>
   So, if good is to come of this setback, it may be in the opening
of western eyes and the stiffening of western spines. Bringing the
two sides to an agreement may not, in the end, involve air strikes,
but it will certainly involve a large deployment of troops on the
ground, probably for an extended period.
</P>
<P>
   Those troops may be attacked, and some may lose their lives:
better to say it now, and be prepared for it, than to exclaim at
some later date that such an eventuality was never part of the
commitment, and the troops must come home.
</P>
<P>
   Western Europe's interest in this is clear. America's may be
less so. Yet America has a powerful interest, not just in peace in
Europe, the home of its traditional and still strongest allies, but
also in seeing democratic values upheld.
</P>
<P>
   In places like the Balkans, that means not only conventional
diplomacy but also the threat of force, and therefore, if that
threat is to be credible, a readiness to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, even in an age of technological wizardry, force
cannot be assured of success without the possibility of suffering
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   How much better, however, if the threat of attack is not put to
the test. When the parties reassemble on March 15, the best outcome
would be a swift agreement all around that made air strikes
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   To get the Serbs to accept that may mean persuading the Russians
to cajole them to agree to a NATO-led force in Kosovo with a big
Russian contingent. To get the Kosovars to accept may mean
explaining that they will get no western help if they do not take
what is on offer now: that is the ``or else'' for them.
</P>
<P>
   For the West, however, the ``or else'' will be an even bigger
loss of face. With NATO approaching its 50th-anniversary party in
April, that would be serious. &QL;

FROGS FALL TO TULSA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU coach Billy Tubbs bristled, his patience
finally stretched too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to know how I feel right now, about me or my
basketball team or anything else,'' Tubbs said. ``I'm not a real
happy fella.''
</P>
<P>
   Two numbers _ 82 and 73 _ brought about his less-than-chipper
mood.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa defeated the Horned Frogs by that score yesterday at
Daniel-Meyer Coliseum, bumping them from a No. 3 to a No. 4 seed in
the Western Athletic Conference Tournament and leaving their hopes
for an at-large berth in the NCAA Tournament very much up in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely played a team that is very capable of going and
winning the WAC Tournament or at least winning two games,'' Golden
Hurricane coach Bill Self said. ``But I think TCU has probably got
to win a couple of games out in the WAC Tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU (19-9, 7-7 WAC) begins by playing Pacific Division No. 5
seed BYU or San Jose State at 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, pending the
results of last night's games. If TCU wins, No. 12 Utah will be
waiting in the second round Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two victories in the WAC Tournament coupled with its Ratings
Percentage Index of 28 will likely get the Horned Frogs an NCAA
Tournament berth.
</P>
<P>
   RPI is a computer-generated rankings system that factors in
Division I winning percentage, schedule strength and opponents'
schedule strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a strange year. I'm going to quit trying to
figure things out,'' Tubbs said. ``The \RNCAA Tournament selection
committee\S has a very tough job this year because there are too
many teams like TCU.''
</P>
<P>
   And TCU has had too many games like yesterday's.
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs started slowly, trailed by as many as 16 points
in the first half and were behind 43-33 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Tulsa's lead was only 76-73 with 43 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa's Greg Harrington let loose a wild attempt that bounced
high off the iron. Hurricane forward Eric Coley, despite giving
four inches to Marquise Gainous, came down with the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of 39 Golden Hurricane rebounds. The Frogs had 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a good boxing-out team,'' Coley said. ``We just went
out and wanted it a little bit more, I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Coley led Tulsa with 20 points and 11 rebounds while Michael
Ruffin contributed 17 points, nine on free throws. Tulsa (21-8, 9-5
WAC) was 19-of-21 from the free-throw line. The Frogs attempted
only 16.
</P>
<P>
   It was a difference that didn't go over too well on the Frogs'
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to let us play physical, let us play
physical,'' Frogs guard Prince Fowler said. ``It should go both
ways, not one way.''
</P>
<P>
   WAC supervisor of officials Bobby Dibbler was at the game, and
afterward, TCU assistant coach Brian Fish approached him and said:
``Coach wants to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   Dibbler and Tubbs had a postgame chat in Tubbs' office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be in El Paso this summer, and we were wanting to
play some golf,'' Tubbs deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   TCU coaches had been screaming at Dibbler all game, upset that
play had become too physical, and that the referees were letting it
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't one of the more physical games that we played
in,'' Self said. ``The way I'm sure Billy sees it differently is
you have to guard Nailon by laying on him because he's great at
laying on you. ... Whoever is guarding Lee is going to have
contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said: ``Knock the hell out of him is the way they guard
him. That's exactly what they did. But hey, what's new?''
</P>
<P>
   Nailon finished with 20 points to lead TCU.
</P>
<P>
   He rested his head on his hand during postgame interviews. His
voice was low and unemotional. He looked very much like a player
resigned to the fact that the Frogs can't seem to catch a break
this season.
</P>
<P>
   He assured that wasn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost some games and turned around and won some games. A
loss doesn't stop us from making our run,'' Nailon said. ``As long
as we take care of business, it shouldn't matter about this game.''

<P>
   If Nigeria were a sprinter, it would long since have been out of
the race. Its four decades of independent existence have been
punctuated by false start followed by false start.
</P>
<P>
   When its voters go to the polls this weekend to choose a
civilian president, they will be starting once again. This time,
they had better make a success of it. One more failure would
probably put Nigeria out of the race for good.
</P>
<P>
   Would that matter? Maybe not in the long run. But in the short
run it would cause an upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   With 115 million people, Nigeria is much the most populous
country in sub-Saharan Africa. If Nigeria is ill governed, then
almost a quarter of non-Arab Africa is ill governed. If it were to
break up, then one African in four would become a citizen of a new
state.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, if Nigeria were well governed, then a force for good
could become influential throughout a region still cursed, much of
it, with poverty, instability and outright warfare.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the omens are good. The two candidates for
the presidency, Olusegun Obasanjo and Olu Falae, are both decent
men.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the winner, unlike the winner of Nigeria's last free
presidential election, will probably be allowed to take office: the
signs are that the military men _ who have ruled the country for
all but ten of its 39 years of independence, and who locked up
Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of the 1993 vote _ really do
intend to hand over this time.
</P>
<P>
   And Nigeria is not all dust and desert. It is potentially rich.
Oil gurgles beneath it, and Royal Dutch/Shell, which already pumps
about half the country's production of 2 million barrels a day, has
recently said it will invest $8.5 billion to get more out.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad vote of confidence for a poor country in a continent
habitually short of investment.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, other signs are less favorable. Nigeria is not an
easy place to govern.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since it was cobbled together by the British at the
beginning of the century, it has been a country divided: divided
between north and south (the north indirectly governed through
feudal rulers, the south directly by the British colonists),
between religions (Muslim northerners and westerners, Christian
easterners), between language groups (250 or so, according to some
counts), between rich and poor and, more recently, between civilian
and military.
</P>
<P>
   So profound were these divisions in the 1960s that the country
fought a long civil war in which the eastern region, under the name
of Biafra, tried to secede. More than 1 million people died.
</P>
<P>
   Successive governments' response to so many divisions has been
to offer the illusion of greater local autonomy by creating, within
a federal framework, more and more states: the original three have
grown to 36.
</P>
<P>
   The large administrative cost might have been worth paying had
the stratagem bought contentment. It has not.
</P>
<P>
   True, the country is more mixed than ever before, and many of
the old animosities have diminished. But the peoples of the
oil-producing Niger delta feel perpetually exploited; and the
Yorubas of the west are smarting at what they consider to be years
of exclusion from power.
</P>
<P>
   Though Nigeria may not be in imminent danger of breaking up, its
new rulers will have to deal with these discontents. They will also
have to watch their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers foresee not just a loss of power but also a loss of
income. They, especially the younger ones, may yet attempt another
coup if they come to feel their prospects for enrichment have
disappeared. Before that, however, they will surely try to
manipulate the civilian politicians without formally taking over.
</P>
<P>
   The new government will anyway have to live with the awful
economic legacy of the generals. Over the years, and despite huge
oil earnings, Nigeria's infrastructure has collapsed and decayed.
Manufacturing industry and agriculture have likewise degenerated.
</P>
<P>
   And, because its refineries have been so poorly maintained, the
world's 11th-biggest oil exporter has had to import petrol to meet
the needs of its own people.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more serious is Nigeria's other curse, the culture
of corruption. Successive military governments have kept themselves
in power through a system of institutionalized theft that has
inculcated the habit into soldiers, civil servants and ordinary
people alike. Even under the purest of governments, it will take
years to eradicate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the effort has to be made. If matters do not improve, the
place will either sink, Zaire-like, into chaos, or break up, as
individual parts decide to go their own way.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do not want to see a grand Nigerian breakup, or
total collapse, this latest start had better turn out to be a good
one. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Time for Japan to prime its weapons and sail out into the world
again? The idea brings howls of protest, not least in Japan itself,
where popular attachment to the country's post-war ``peace''
constitution is strong.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Japan's parliament will soon consider a series of bills to
allow its modestly named Self-Defense Forces to give America a bit
more support in regional hot spots and to play a more active part
in U.N. peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   There is even serious talk of revising the constitution itself,
though that is for the longer term.
</P>
<P>
   More immediately, the planned new role is limited _ no combat
duty involved _ but useful in a region with an awkward balance to
keep between America, China, Japan, a still-divided Korea, and
Russia, and no crisscrossing alliances to take the strain.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if a shooting war ever breaks out in this uneasy
neighborhood, Japan will need to stand ready to do a lot more than
pass the ammunition, unless it is ready to bid farewell to its
security alliance with America.
</P>
<P>
   Although Japan's peacekeeping plans may be trickier to reconcile
with its current reading of the constitution _ self-defence is an
inherent right of all countries, but collective military action is
still deemed unacceptable for Japan _ few outsiders would balk
these days at Japan doing more for the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   Its soldiers will not be looking for front-line trouble; they
will merely be better equipped and authorized to defend themselves
(and therefore less of a burden to their comrades) if attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Japan knows that, if it wants a permanent Security
Council seat, it needs to share in the responsibilities _ and risks
_ of upholding the council's decisions. But, such U.N.-approved
duties aside, is it so obvious that a militarily more active Japan
would be a boon to East Asia?
</P>
<P>
   Those with bitter memories of Japanese aggression during the
1930s and the Second World War were understandably reassured by the
old Cold-War arrangement: America promised to defend Japan (thereby
removing the need for Japan to beef up its own armed forces too
much) in return for the right to station American troops
deterringly close to potential conflict zones.
</P>
<P>
   The one-sided nature of this alliance rankled little when Japan
could shelter, one among many, behind America's global shield. As
Japan prospered under America's protection, it prided itself on
being a ``civilian'' power: using its trade and aid to encourage
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But such Cold-War comforts are no longer on offer. With the
threat of Soviet aggression long gone, America has justifiably lost
interest in bearing Asia's many military burdens alone to the
benefit of others, including Japan. Hence the need for Japan to be
seen to be doing more to support its chief ally.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed new guidelines would enable Japan to assist more
with repairs and logistics (including helping to deliver American
ammunition, but not to supply its own) in regional conflicts beyond
Japan's own waters, though not directly in combat zones.
</P>
<P>
   Its warships could help with sanctions-monitoring and
mine-sweeping. Its ships and aircraft would be able to rescue
stranded nationals.
</P>
<P>
   This is scarcely blood-curdling stuff, and the least Japan can
do, given that much of its trade passes through the sea-lanes close
to East Asia's trouble spots, from North Korea and Taiwan to the
disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's proposed new duties also fall far short of the
``militarism'' with which China likes to charge Japan. China is
angry that America might call on Japan for such help in a future
tiff over Taiwan, which China claims as its own.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not Japan that has been flexing its military muscle.
Three years ago some of the missiles China fired into the shipping
lanes near Taiwan to intimidate the islanders before their first
democratic presidential election landed worryingly close to
outlying Japanese islands.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the military threats spat out by a hostile North Korea
are directed at Japan, not just South Korea and the American troops
there.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, in a real shooting crisis, Japan's planned new
role would scarcely suffice. If China and America were to come to
blows over Taiwan, or North Korea were to lash out militarily at
South Korea, Japan would still be able to do little more than hold
America's coat and help cart away its casualties.
</P>
<P>
   That experience could well shatter support in America for an
alliance that provides the cornerstone both of Japan's security and
of East Asia's stability. Which is why Japan's parliament needs to
pass the new guidelines and then take a fresh look at the ban on
collective defense.
</P>
<P>
   It would take years to redraft the constitution. However, the
relevant war-renouncing parts rightly did not stop Japan building
its Self-Defense Forces and, if its politicians so decide, need not
bar Japan from playing a more active role in collective
self-defense (a right of sovereign states under the U.N. charter).
</P>
<P>
   Might such a rethinking of Japan's military role someday be
taken as a license to maraud? Put it another way: if Japan were in
marauding mood, no weasel words in its constitution would deter it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it would reassure the neighbors if Japan were more
open and contrite about its military past, as Germany has been.
Meanwhile, precisely because of Japan's military past, its
government needs to explain to opponents at home, as Germany's did,
that defending democratic values sometimes, regrettably, requires
military means.
</P>
<P>
   Most Japanese would rather put off such difficult issues until a
mind-clearing crisis comes along. But, as Germany has found, doing
more dangerous military duties takes careful peacetime preparation
and practice. By crisis time it is already too late.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be understandable doubts about a militarily
more active Japan. But there are two greater dangers.
</P>
<P>
   One is that, come the next real crisis, one of East Asia's
best-equipped armed forces will mostly stand aside and watch. The
second is that if, as a result, Japan's alliance with the United
States did fall apart, Japan would have little choice but to arm
itself more aggressively, including possibly with nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Better for Japan to learn to work more closely with the
Americans than to sail forth alone. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Its soldiers will not be looking for front-line trouble; they
will merely be better equipped and authorized to defend themselves
(and therefore less of a burden to their comrades) if attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Japan knows that, if it wants a permanent Security
Council seat, it needs to share in the responsibilities _ and risks
_ of upholding the council's decisions. But, such U.N.-approved
duties aside, is it so obvious that a militarily more active Japan
would be a boon to East Asia?
</P>
<P>
   Those with bitter memories of Japanese aggression during the
1930s and the Second World War were understandably reassured by the
old Cold-War arrangement: America promised to defend Japan (thereby
removing the need for Japan to beef up its own armed forces too
much) in return for the right to station American troops
deterringly close to potential conflict zones.
</P>
<P>
   The one-sided nature of this alliance rankled little when Japan
could shelter, one among many, behind America's global shield. As
Japan prospered under America's protection, it prided itself on
being a ``civilian'' power: using its trade and aid to encourage
stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But such Cold-War comforts are no longer on offer. With the
threat of Soviet aggression long gone, America has justifiably lost
interest in bearing Asia's many military burdens alone to the
benefit of others, including Japan. Hence the need for Japan to be
seen to be doing more to support its chief ally.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed new guidelines would enable Japan to assist more
with repairs and logistics (including helping to deliver American
ammunition, but not to supply its own) in regional conflicts beyond
Japan's own waters, though not directly in combat zones.
</P>
<P>
   Its warships could help with sanctions-monitoring and
mine-sweeping. Its ships and aircraft would be able to rescue
stranded nationals.
</P>
<P>
   This is scarcely blood-curdling stuff, and the least Japan can
do, given that much of its trade passes through the sea-lanes close
to East Asia's trouble spots, from North Korea and Taiwan to the
disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's proposed new duties also fall far short of the
``militarism'' with which China likes to charge Japan. China is
angry that America might call on Japan for such help in a future
tiff over Taiwan, which China claims as its own.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not Japan that has been flexing its military muscle.
Three years ago some of the missiles China fired into the shipping
lanes near Taiwan to intimidate the islanders before their first
democratic presidential election landed worryingly close to
outlying Japanese islands.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the military threats spat out by a hostile North Korea
are directed at Japan, not just South Korea and the American troops
there.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, in a real shooting crisis, Japan's planned new
role would scarcely suffice. If China and America were to come to
blows over Taiwan, or North Korea were to lash out militarily at
South Korea, Japan would still be able to do little more than hold
America's coat and help cart away its casualties.
</P>
<P>
   That experience could well shatter support in America for an
alliance that provides the cornerstone both of Japan's security and
of East Asia's stability. Which is why Japan's parliament needs to
pass the new guidelines and then take a fresh look at the ban on
collective defense.
</P>
<P>
   It would take years to redraft the constitution. However, the
relevant war-renouncing parts rightly did not stop Japan building
its Self-Defense Forces and, if its politicians so decide, need not
bar Japan from playing a more active role in collective
self-defense (a right of sovereign states under the U.N. charter).
</P>
<P>
   Might such a rethinking of Japan's military role someday be
taken as a license to maraud? Put it another way: if Japan were in
marauding mood, no weasel words in its constitution would deter it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it would reassure the neighbors if Japan were more
open and contrite about its military past, as Germany has been.
Meanwhile, precisely because of Japan's military past, its
government needs to explain to opponents at home, as Germany's did,
that defending democratic values sometimes, regrettably, requires
military means.
</P>
<P>
   Most Japanese would rather put off such difficult issues until a
mind-clearing crisis comes along. But, as Germany has found, doing
more dangerous military duties takes careful peacetime preparation
and practice. By crisis time it is already too late.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be understandable doubts about a militarily
more active Japan. But there are two greater dangers.
</P>
<P>
   One is that, come the next real crisis, one of East Asia's
best-equipped armed forces will mostly stand aside and watch. The
second is that if, as a result, Japan's alliance with the United
States did fall apart, Japan would have little choice but to arm
itself more aggressively, including possibly with nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Better for Japan to learn to work more closely with the
Americans than to sail forth alone. &QL;

Rice's second-half salvo frustrates SMU
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Reviewing a 66-57 loss to Rice at Moody Coliseum
yesterday, SMU's Chad Elsey identified a rather obvious point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't keep coming out and giving people 15-point leads
and expect to come back and pull it out in every game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a postscript, he added, ``This team should just feel
humiliated and upset that we gave that kind of effort and they
kicked our butts.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no argument from coach Mike Dement, who watched the
Mustangs (13-14, 7-7) lose for the second time at home in three
days and settle comfortably into a fifth-seed position in this
week's Western Athletic Conference tournament in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two games ... we didn't play well until late in the Tulsa
game,'' he said, ``and we didn't play well until too late in this
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice coach Willis Wilson, however, was positively effusive after
the Owls (17-9, 8-6) nailed down the third seed in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever believed we would end up being the third seed,''
he said. ``Nobody ever believed we would even be in the tournament.
We proved a lot of people wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Owls' most significant labor in this one came at the outset
of the second half, which they opened with a 14-0 run, wiping out a
three-point deficit. With 11:58 left it had grown to 20-2, and SMU
was down by 15 points (50-35).
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out flat in the second half, with no defense,'' said
Jeryl Sasser, who had 18 points and 10 rebounds in a losing effort.
``It seemed like we were satisfied just being in the tournament and
figured all we had to do to beat Rice was show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have been hungry, because getting the three-seed was
our goal, but it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For SMU, a 38-28 edge on the boards was almost useless because
of poor shooting. In the second half, the Mustangs shot 26 per cent
from the floor and 43 per cent from the free-throw line. For the
game, they were 34.5 percent from the floor and made barely half
their free throws.
</P>
<P>
   With 4:20 remaining, Elsey hit back-to-back 3-point shots that
cut a 56-44 Rice lead in half, but SMU could not sustain the
momentum. Elsey cut it to six again with another 3-pointer with
1:12 left, but it was the last gasp for the Mustangs.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls shot a blistering 59 percent in the second half and 52
percent overall, prompting Dement's assessment that ``they just
pretty much scored on us at will.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on a disappointing week that began with the Mustangs
entertaining hopes as high as a Mountain Division championship,
Sasser noted that only one option remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win the tournament,'' he said. ``With our record,
we're sure not going to any NCAA or NIT as an at-large team.''

PATAKI PROPOSES LIMITS TO STATE SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   RAYMOND HERNANDEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki has quietly moved to make
far-reaching changes in the state's special education program,
which has been long criticized as a dumping ground for children who
should be in standard classrooms. He is by seeking to limit aid,
and thus enrollment, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Momentous as it is, the governor has not trumpeted his plan.
Instead, it is buried in an arcane passage deep in his 1999-2000
budget proposal, suggesting that the governor may intend to link
the plan to negotiations over other educational initiatives that
the Legislature wants in the final budget.
</P>
<P>
   The state's special education program has been widely assailed
for consigning far too many children, a disproportionate number of
them black and Hispanic boys in New York City, into separate
classrooms with little prospect of getting out and graduating with
a regular diploma.
</P>
<P>
   A broad range of critics _ from state education officials to
academics to lawmakers _ say this is partly because schools get
additional money from the state for each child in special
education. The financing formula, these critics contend, has led
educators to find disabilities in children who are merely troubled
or underachieving _ subverting the state's intent of giving extra
care to the severely handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   And the system is growing ever costlier: The amount New York
spends on special education has risen to roughly $1.4 billion in
the current school year from $527 million in the 1985-86 school
year, making it one of the fastest-growing parts of the state
budget and consuming 12 percent of all the money the state spends
on aid to schools.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is proposing to replace the old formula with a system
that gives districts a fixed sum of money for special education,
based on their overall student population and level of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also limit the year-to-year growth of the
program by no more than 2 percent per school district, thereby
forcing school administrators to limit the number of children they
refer to special education.
</P>
<P>
   Aid for the small number of children with profound disabilities,
like cerebral palsy, would not be affected by the new limits.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Pataki's proposal is critical. The federal
government has repeatedly warned that New York state could lose
more than $300 million if it does not reduce the number of
children, particularly black and Hispanic students, who are shunted
into special education classrooms away from other students.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials contend that a student should be educated in
the ``least restrictive setting'' _ ideally a regular classroom _
unless that student cannot succeed there even with additional
specialized services, like individual tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, federal officials have questioned the placement of
thousands of black and Hispanic students in special education in
New York City schools. The officials challenged New York City
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew in a letter in November to show
evidence that the students were being properly placed in special
education.
</P>
<P>
   The letter cited a federal analysis of data submitted by Crew
showing that even among districts with the same rates of poverty,
there were wide discrepancies in special education placements that
appeared to be based on race or ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner, recently
cautioned lawmakers during a hearing that officials in Washington
could begin withholding aid as early as this July if the state
fails to comply with their request.

 ALBANY, N.Y.: their request.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an interview on Friday, Mills reiterated the warning. ``I
think it should be taken seriously,'' he said, adding, ``I think it
is unfortunate that New York state would have to be threatened by
the federal government to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's special education system dispenses aid to schools
using a formula that covers a broad range of disabilities, from
deafness and blindness to more ill-defined conditions like
emotional disturbances and learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But that system has come under intense attack from critics who
say it has provided districts with a financial incentive to place
children with relatively minor problems into expensive special
education classes.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, for example, most special education students
do not have readily defined disabilities like deafness or
blindness. Instead, they are classified as being ``learning
disabled'' or ``emotionally handicapped.'' Education experts
contend that such labels are often loosely applied, particularly in
cases in which teachers want to rid themselves of disruptive
students.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's proposal differs from previous plans to overhaul the
state's special education program in one key way: it would continue
to fully pay for children with severe disabilities. As a result,
the plan avoids any confrontation with a highly organized group of
parents, teachers and other experts who work with these children
and who have helped to defeat changes to the special education
program in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Pataki's plan has its critics. The governor wants
to have it implemented by the 2000-2001 school year. That timetable
has caused even the fiercest critics of the current program to
complain that he is not giving school districts enough time to
prepare for the changes he is seeking. By contrast, a similar plan
being proposed by state education officials would gradually phase
in changes to special education over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   More important than that, though, is the fact that Pataki's plan
does not include additional money to provide services to help
moderately disabled children compete in regular classroom settings,
a primary goal of some educational experts and the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the governor's plan note that teachers in regular
classes often lack the time or resources to deal with basic
problems like poor reading skills, one of the main factors driving
special education referrals.
</P>
<P>
   The state has roughly 400,000 children in special education now,
up 100,000 in 13 years, with most of the growth in children
identified as having learning disabilities like reading problems or
attention deficit disorder. The critics of Pataki's plan are urging
him to divert some money from the state's special education program
into mainstream classrooms so that such patterns of referral are no
longer necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The critics note that the proposal being advanced by state
education officials would spend, by contrast, at least $25 million
more than the state currently spends to help moderately disabled
children function in mainstream classes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Gloekler, a deputy commissioner with the state
Education Department who helps administer the state's special
education program, said that while he applauds the overall goal of
Pataki's plan, he believes that school districts need additional
time and money to help moderately disabled children adapt in
regular classroom settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest concern with the governor's proposal is that it
happens too quickly and doesn't give districts enough time to
adjust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's proposal is the opening bid in what will surely
be a lively debate with members of the Legislature, where similar
proposals have died in the past amid fierce lobbying from a
powerful coalition of teachers and school administrators worried
that any changes would decrease resources in the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In the end though, Pataki may provide the additional money his
critics desire in exchange for the enactment of the overall changes
he is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Lovell, the governor's deputy secretary for educational
policy, said it was crucial for the Legislature to act now. ``The
drumbeat from the federal government is growing louder,'' he said.
``The governor views this as a critical issue for the legislative
session.''

   MILL VALLEY, CALIF. _ National attention may be fixed on Jasper,
Texas, where on Feb. 23 a white supremacist, John King, was
convicted of dragging a black man to death behind his truck; but to
residents of Marin County, Calif., what has been happening in their
part of the world seems almost as disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the parents of four black students from Tamalpais High
School, in Mill Valley in the southern part of the county, filed
suit against officials of the Novato school district in the
county's northern half.
</P>
<P>
   The suit followed an incident last winter in which white
students from Novato's San Marin High School wore afro wigs and
taunted black players from Tamalpais while the players warmed up
for a basketball game at San Marin.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Price, a civil-rights lawyer representing the parents,
said that Novato district officials are not doing enough to change
an atmosphere of intolerance at San Marin High.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier an openly gay San Marin student, Adam Colton,
was admitted to hospital unconscious. He had been beaten up, and
the letters FAG had been scratched into the skin of his stomach and
arms with a ballpoint pen.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second such ambush Colton has suffered in a single
school year at San Marin High; he was beaten up last September just
after he had set up a Gay-Straight Alliance at his school. Although
no one has come forward and confessed, most suspect that San Marin
students were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Marin is a small, diamond-shaped county just north of San
Francisco; its southern tip touches the north tower of the Golden
Gate Bridge. Nearly half of Marin's rolling, sea-edged landscape is
held in public trust within the Golden Gate National Recreation
Area.
</P>
<P>
   The urban problems of San Francisco, where a gang of white
youths recently beat up a black teenager after a basketball game,
seem quite distant.
</P>
<P>
   The county's 275,000 inhabitants, who are overwhelmingly white,

</P>
<P>
   The city manager of Novato, Rod Wood, says that the continuing
attacks at San Marin High are caused by a small group of ``socially
maladjusted'' students who call themselves white supremacists. Like
others, he has no idea where such notions have come from.
</P>
<P>
   The county's economy, increasingly service-based, is thriving,
and there is little displacement of workers of one culture by
workers of another. A great deal of the personal wealth in the
county is in the form of hyper-costly property.

<P>
   One Marin County supervisor, Cynthia Murray, who represents
Novato on the county's governing board, points out that Novato

confrontations over difference, especially racial difference.
</P>

vandalized with spray-painted racial slurs, and was also briefly

   After Colton's second beating, San Marin's principal was
``reassigned'' elsewhere in the county. After the basketball
incident, the team was put on probation and its games against
Tamalpais have been cancelled for a year to allow a cooling-off
period.
</P>
<P>
   In any other country, this would have been enough. But because
no other disciplinary action was taken against the basketball team
or its chanting fans, Price has filed suit on behalf of the parents
of the taunted players. It is hard to see what good such overkill
can possibly do. &QL;

   MILL VALLEY, CALIF. _ National attention may be fixed on Jasper,
Texas, where on Feb. 23 a white supremacist, John King, was
convicted of dragging a black man to death behind his truck; but to
residents of Marin County, Calif., what has been happening in their
part of the world seems almost as disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the parents of four black students from Tamalpais High
School, in Mill Valley in the southern part of the county, filed
suit against officials of the Novato school district in the
county's northern half.
</P>
<P>
   The suit followed an incident last winter in which white
students from Novato's San Marin High School wore afro wigs and
taunted black players from Tamalpais while the players warmed up
for a basketball game at San Marin.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Price, a civil-rights lawyer representing the parents,
said that Novato district officials are not doing enough to change
an atmosphere of intolerance at San Marin High.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier an openly gay San Marin student, Adam Colton,
was admitted to hospital unconscious. He had been beaten up, and
the letters FAG had been scratched into the skin of his stomach and
arms with a ballpoint pen.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second such ambush Colton has suffered in a single
school year at San Marin High; he was beaten up last September just
after he had set up a Gay-Straight Alliance at his school. Although
no one has come forward and confessed, most suspect that San Marin
students were involved.
</P>
<P>
   Marin is a small, diamond-shaped county just north of San
Francisco; its southern tip touches the north tower of the Golden
Gate Bridge. Nearly half of Marin's rolling, sea-edged landscape is
held in public trust within the Golden Gate National Recreation
Area.
</P>
<P>
   The urban problems of San Francisco, where a gang of white
youths recently beat up a black teenager after a basketball game,
seem quite distant.
</P>
<P>
   The county's 275,000 inhabitants, who are overwhelmingly white,
pride themselves on their wealth (Marin is among the three
wealthiest counties in the country), their tolerance, and a quirky
but sincere dedication to New Age world views.
</P>
<P>
   It is a laid-back place; hence the tag ``Mellow Marin.'' This is
where George Lucas, director of ``Star Wars,'' lives and where
Robin Williams, the actor, grew up; but it is also where Tupac
Shakur, a murdered rap-artist, attended Tamalpais High School.

ACCESSORIES ARE HOT AT LOCAL GUN SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ It doesn't matter to Josie Garcia if President Clinton
wants to require background checks on everyone buying firearms at
gun shows. After all, the Glendale legal secretary browsing a
weekend gun show already owns a revolver.
</P>
<P>
   She was more interested in the purses, holsters and everything
else at one of the state's biggest gun shows of the year, the
Crossroads of the West Gun Show at the Arizona State Fair Park and
Exposition Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, look how cute it is,'' she squealed, sounding as if helium
leaked from her mouth, as she tried out a black leather purse.
``It's got a hidden compartment for your gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia peered across the rows of tables, with 1,200 vendors
selling everything from a standard .22-caliber Ruger to
night-vision goggles to beef jerky.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 6,000 people simply came to ogle the accessories.
Two-thirds of the exhibitors displayed something other than guns.
Rows of videos filled a table _ ``A Family Guide to Handgun
Safety,'' or ``Handguns and Home Survival,'' even ``Sexy Girls,
Sexy Guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone peddled the ubiquitous pink underwear from Sheriff Joe
Arpaio's jails. Then there was a lady selling golden Buddhas and
another with Beanie Babies and fancy candles.
</P>
<P>
   They paid $7 to browse; kids under 14 got in free with adult.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters looked for polar fleece beds and foldaway chairs.
History lovers combed the tables for ammunition for antique guns,
and those with permits to conceal weapons searched for special
pouches in which to hide their handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Many mentioned the Y2K bug, fearing some kind of chaos, as they
plunked down cash for handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They worry about some kind of trouble,'' says Jacque Harrison,
owner of Guns-R-Us. ``They think they need protection. I don't
know. I personally don't buy it. But if it makes them feel better .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   Her voice trailed off as she showed a man a .38-caliber Taurus
for $269.99.
</P>
<P>
   And those buying guns didn't seem to mind the background checks,
taking about 15 minutes by cellular phone, at the roughly 320
federally licensed dealers at the show. Licensed dealers are
required to conduct such checks on all gun buyers.
</P>
<P>
   At private tables, where background checks are not required, it
took only as long as it did to negotiate the cost of an 1876
Winchester or a 9mm Ruger.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this new Clinton thing stinks,'' said Bob Brown, 54, who
tried to unload a hunting rifle for $150. ``There's already enough
guns laws. We don't need this, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown voiced a concern of many at the gun show, who worry about
government clamping down on gun owners ever more. Clinton said last
month that he plans to ask Congress to require background checks on
people who buy guns at shows and flea markets, even if the sellers
are private citizens. He called the shows ``arms bazaars.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 1993 Brady Act only requires firearms dealers licensed
by the federal government to check the backgrounds of potential
buyers to make sure they aren't felons, fugitives or illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Templeton, who sponsored the weekend show, pointed to a
government statistic that showed that only 2 percent of firearms
used by criminals came directly from gun shows. Phoenix police say
gun shows aren't a big concern, that most of the guns bought there
are purchased legally, as they are at local stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to take away the rights of our hobbyists,'' said
Templeton, wearing a pin that read, ``If guns are outlawed, who
will shoot the liberals?'' on his pink button-up shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd didn't look much different than those attending a high
school cheerleading competition at the nearby coliseum. But the
bumper stickers on their cars generally told which direction they
headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they come for your guns, give 'em the bullets first'' was
on an old Chevy truck with a gun rack in the back. ``You can have
my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead hands'' graced a Ford
Explorer. ``Register voters, not guns'' read a Honda Accord.
</P>
<P>
   Across the parking lot: ``I'm a proud parent of an honor student
at Cortez High School,'' proclaimed a white minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Bobby Luna slung a newly bought AR-15 rifle over his
shoulder and carried a box of ammo in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good place to find what you need,'' said the
25-year-old from Glendale. He owns six guns now, mostly to take out
on the range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a collector yet,'' he said, ``but someday I hope to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on, people browsing the show bundled rifles in
their arms and attached multiple pistols to belts along with their
digital phones.
</P>
<P>
   Carly Miller pushed a stroller overflowing with four rifles and
boxes of ammunition, her 2-year-old son, Tyler, resting on her hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier than carrying the guns,'' she said. ``My husband's
around here somewhere.'' &QL;

FORT WORTH MARATHON WINNER VOWS NOT TO RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLES CLINES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Agustin Hernandez beat the wind, shrugged
off the warm temperatures and easily outdistanced the field in
yesterday morning's Cowtown Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he might have been the least happy men's Cowtown Marathon
winner in the race's 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who was runner-up last year, said goodbye to Cowtown
after winning in 2 hours, 34 minutes, 8 seconds. Even though he
beat second-place Chuck Weidner of Arlington by more than 14
minutes, Hernandez was unhappy that officials didn't waive his $35
entry fee. He did win an expense-paid trip to either the Boston or
New York marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez and his coach, Carmelo Pena of Dallas, said they had
talked to ``someone'' about a complimentary entry but were refused.
Then, even though Cowtown never has been a money race, they had
hoped to have some of Hernandez's expenses to Fort Worth from
Apaseo El Grande, Mexico, defrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Race director Jim Gilliland said it's the first he had heard of
Hernandez trying to have his entry waived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on who he asked,'' Gilliland said. ``I would have
given him permission. What they have to realize is they should ask
in plenty of time, not the day of the race. And not everyone can
give them permission.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez won his second marathon in eight tries, though his
winning time was far off his best of 2:16.
</P>
<P>
   Pena said this would be the last time for any of the runners
sponsored by El Conejo, a bus company, to come to Cowtown. They
also didn't run at White Rock in December for the first time in
several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good to mile 23,'' Hernandez said. When the
construction worker hit the Trinity Park trails and bucked a
20-plus mph headwind, he tired, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He and his coach expected to win because last year's winner,
teammate and countryman Remedios Ramirez, didn't return, opting to
run in Guadalajara last week, where he won $3,000 for a
fourth-place finish, Pena said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't in shape to run that,'' said Hernandez, who used
Cowtown as a training run. He plans to run in New York in November.
</P>
<P>
   He had no company after the first 10 miles, which he ran with
James Newsom, a Fort Worth runner on the first leg of his
three-person relay team.
</P>
<P>
   When he reached 10 miles in 54:08, Hernandez was almost a mile
ahead of his nearest challenger. He reached the 20-mile marker in
1:49:08, meaning he ran a pedestrian 45 minutes in the final 10K.
The warm temperatures, hitting the mid-60s during the race,
hampered times.
</P>
<P>
   Weidner, 35, ran his fourth Cowtown and has improved his
position each year; he was 22nd, seventh and fourth previously. His
time this year, 2:47.47, though, was almost seven minutes slower
than last year. He already was 25 seconds behind Hernandez when he
reached the first mile in 5:47.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind was terrible,'' he said. ``We had it with us about
mile 18 to 19, and then ran against it coming in. I had to bend
over, duck my head and pump my arms on the trails'' from mile 23 to
25.
</P>
<P>
   Weidner, a 171/2-year Navy veteran, said he had trained hard for
Cowtown ``because it's a tough marathon. It's maybe the toughest
course I've run.''
</P>
<P>
   Weidner, who has run 17 of the 26.2-mile races, was third until
a runner identified as Neal Johnson dropped out at 20 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised I finished second,'' Weidner said. ``I didn't
see him drop out. He looked strong when I saw him at a
turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   The masters division (40-and-over) winner was Adam Cohen of
Norman, Okla., who finished in 2:49:39.45, third overall.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The extraordinary bull market in shares has diverted
attention from the traditional indicator of irrational exuberance,
a booming housing market. But sales of both new and existing homes
are up over 10 percent on a year ago, at levels last seen in the
1970s, and average house prices are well above what they were in
1989, the previous peak in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually, the housing market _ especially at the high end,
$200,000 and up _ is strong all over the country, not concentrated
in a few ``hot'' areas. New building is also at record levels, much
of it financed by bank lending _ which may be ominous, given how
fast consumer sentiment can turn in the housing market.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for housing has been fuelled, as usual, by the strong
economy. But as well as rising incomes, three unfamiliar forces
have been at work.
</P>
<P>
   Soaring share prices have made consumers feel much wealthier.
Mortgage rates have fallen sharply: indeed, taking into account
America's generous mortgage-interest tax breaks, real mortgage
rates may be negative.
</P>
<P>
   New financing techniques have made it easier for homeowners to
refinance mortgages and borrow against any equity locked up in
their property, and have made it possible for people who would
previously have been denied financing to get a mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Is there now a housing bubble? If there is, its bursting could
have a nasty impact on consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Property remains a huge part of the assets of most families, and
past falls in house prices have had a much greater ``wealth
effect'' than comparable falls in share prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Craig Thomas, an economist at RFA, a research firm, reckons
that there is no bubble. The 1980s housing bubble was reflected in
prices rising much further than was justified by changes in what
the land would be worth if it was put to some other use, such as
business.
</P>
<P>
   Now, rapid growth in business productivity has pushed up the
alternative value of land in tandem with house prices, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dudley, an economist at Goldman Sachs, sees no evidence
that the high price of shares has fed through to inflation in the
price of other assets, such as houses.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers seem to have learned from the last property crash, and
are not too carried away this time. How long before they have to
learn a similar lesson about shares? &QL;

FERRARO CLOSES IN ON MILESTONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
DALLAS _ Ray Ferraro said this week that he never forgets for a
moment that he is a relative Lilliputian skating in a landscape
increasingly populated by giants.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Every step of the way,'' the Los Angeles Kings' 5-foot-8
center said. ``And every time someone mentions it, I want to prove
them wrong. I'd like to be 6-3 some days, too. I don't think it's
going to happen. I think I'm out of my growth years.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's still proving people wrong. And when he steps on the
Reunion Arena ice this afternoon for the Kings' game against the
Dallas Stars, he will become only the 136th player in NHL history
to appear in 1,000 games in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, 34, also will become the fourth King this season to
reach the 1,000-game mark, joining defensemen Doug Bodger and Garry
Galley, and winger Russ Courtnall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not very many have done it,'' said Ferraro, whose role with
the Kings has increased from minimal to significant as the season
has progressed. ``The fact that I've been consistent enough to be
in the league 15 years is something I'm pretty proud of. Ever since
I was a little kid, I was told I was too small.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, who has 10 goals and 20 points in 44 games this season,
has not decided whether this will be his final season. When he
retires, a career in broadcasting may await him, and there's always
the family concrete business in his native Trail, British Columbia.
But any role in that enterprise will not include heavy lifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you pile 3,200 blocks a day when you're 16 years old, you
get a sense what you don't want to do,'' said Ferraro, who is in
the final year of a contract that will pay him $1.75 million this
season. ``It's a long eight hours at the end of a chain. I was just
trying to get money to put gas in my car.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, who made $7 an hour back in those days, is scheduled to
wear a microphone during today's telecast, with his comments to be
heard during the regional telecast on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't going to go on live,'' said Ferraro, who has scored
343 NHL goals. ``I wouldn't wear it if it did. I'm not going to
think about it, either. I'm not going to say something just so
they'll play it. I talk a lot anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nice Guy: Ferraro takes no offense at his nickname: Little
Ball of Hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came from the guys in New York,'' said Ferraro, who played
for the Rangers before joining the Kings three years ago. ``The
guys in New York gave the name to Pat Verbeek (now with Dallas) and
myself, two little guys who were aggressive and seemed combative to
everything going on, so before long, it came along that we were
these two little balls of hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, Luc (Robitaille) came here (from the Rangers) and it
didn't take long to get picked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what it's like being a little ball of hate, Ferraro said,
``I like it. It means I'm feisty. I don't know if my wife likes
that I'm a little ball of hate, though. I try to be better than
that at home.''
</P>
<P>
   What, me worry?: Friday night, Kings president Tim Leiweke
guaranteed that Coach Larry Robinson and his staff will finish the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Saturday for his reaction, Robinson said, ``It doesn't
affect me at all. Whether my job is on the line or not, I'll still
do my job until they tell me I don't have a job anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is in the final year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Bad ice: Stars players are blaming ice conditions at Reunion
Arena for the hamstring injury Wednesday that is expected to
sideline right wing Brett Hull for at least two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a surprise, getting a skate caught in a rut in this ice
surface,'' said Hull's linemate, Mike Modano. ``The weather is only
going to get warmer, the ice stickier and the puck bouncier. I
think one of the reasons why we skate much better on the road is
because we play on superior ice surfaces.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars - whose 37-11-9 record is the best in the NHL - are
20-6-4 at home, 17-5-5 on the road.

MICHIGAN LAWYER WINS WOMEN'S MARATHON

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Her self-deprecating humor and aw-shucks
nature fit perfectly with the laid-back mentality at Fort Worth's
Stockyards, where the 21st running of the Cowtown Marathon started
and ended yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is why Lori Stich, who won the Cowtown women's
division for the second consecutive time and third in five years,
loves the city so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spectators here are great,'' Stich said. ``I will always
have a special place in my heart for Fort Worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Stich took a commanding lead early and won easily in 2 hours, 56
minutes and 38 seconds on a warm day. Kelli Lusk of Denver was
second in 3:01.11.
</P>
<P>
   Stich said the unseasonably mild day led to tough running.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the humidity more than anything else,'' the Michigan
native said. ``I'm a northern wimp. Early on, I was glad when the
wind came, so it would cool things off. I run better when it is
about 20 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Stich, a 28-year old lawyer from Stanwood, Mich., won her first
Cowtown Marathon in 1995. She was in Houston, working as a clerk
for a federal judge, and decided to run the race at the urging of a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   But with one catch.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing she would not do well at the race, Stich registered as
Gloria Slight. To her surprise, ended up winning.
</P>
<P>
   For Slight, uh Stich, running has become more than a hobby. She
recently qualified for the Olympic trials by running a personal
best of 2:48.41 at the California Invitational in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   But her achievements have not taken away from her love of
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any delusions about myself that I will make the
Olympic team or anything like that,'' Stich said. ``It would be
nice to run my PR (personal record) at the Olympic trials and not
embarrass myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Stich said the only drawback to competing in the
Olympic trials, scheduled for Feb. 26, 2000, in Columbia, S.C., is
that she will miss the Cowtown Marathon next year.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Stich automatically qualifies for either the
New York or Boston Marathon. She said she expects to compete in
both races this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at marathons as a great excuse for a weekend trip,''
Stich said.
</P>
<P>
   Lusk, despite having her slowest time in a marathon since 1996,
managed to place second. She had to stop after 20 miles and walk
around a bit.
</P>
<P>
   But Lusk had reason to not be in tip-top shape. She learned
three weeks ago that she is expecting her first child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been fatigued the past few weeks, and I knew I would be
tired coming into today,'' Lusk said. ``I thought the temperature
was great. The humidity didn't bother me at all. But once we got
into the race, there were quite a few head winds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Denver native said that she was prepared to drop out at any
time but that after the 20-mile mark she felt much better than she
expected and decided to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The expectant mother flew back to Denver last night. Stich
stayed. She likes to make a habit of seeing the sights of the
different cities where she competes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Bob's, I'm going there tonight,'' Stich said.
</P>
<P>
   One more reason for the Michigan native to love Fort Worth.

   ARBIL, NORTHERN IRAQ _ Nobody wants to change the regime in Iraq
more than the Iraqis themselves. They indicated as much when they
rose up in suicidal rage after the murder of Iraq's most prominent
Shia Muslim leader, Grand Ayatollah Muhammad el Sadr, on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of spontaneous protests emerged not just from the
southern half of the country (where Shias make up perhaps
two-thirds of the population), but also from Sunni Muslim areas
north of Baghdad, usually loyal to the Sunni-dominated government.
</P>
<P>
   These disorganized demonstrations were quickly and ruthlessly
quelled _ illustrating the immense difficulty of changing anything
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The assassination of the ayatollah and his two sons was not the
first attack on Iraq's Shia clerics. Last year, two prominent
ayatollahs were shot dead in Najaf, a center for Shia scholarship
and pilgrimage. In January, another was shot at and a fourth
detained by police.
</P>
<P>
   In a state so tightly controlled by the secret police, the
government must, at least, have connived in these attacks.
</P>
<P>
   According to Iraq's opposition groups, the latest killings
unleashed a mini-insurrection. They say the security services
killed 300 civilians in Baghdad during three days of protests last
weekend and claim the army besieged Najaf and shelled the southern
town of Nasiriyah.
</P>
<P>
   This is an exaggeration. United Nations observers, monitoring
food distribution in Iraq, passed through Najaf on the day of the
supposed siege and noticed nothing unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Information-ministry officials took journalists to Nasiriyah,
where they found no trace of bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans put the death toll in Baghdad at not more than 25.
But, whatever the scale of the demonstrations, the subsequent
clampdown was ferocious. Within two or three days all was quiet.
</P>
<P>
   So how, with anti-government feeling running so high, and
America three months into its latest scheme to arm and train the
opposition, could so many protests have come to so little?
</P>
<P>
   In part because, for all America's public expressions of
support, the opposition says it detects ``no sign whatsoever'' that
it means what it says.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration long resisted the idea of arming
Iraqi dissidents or fostering insurrection, insisting that the best
hope for change lay in a coup from within.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress pushed through a $97 million package for the Iraqi
opposition last year, the government produced a list of eligible
groups, but it has not yet handed over any aid.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, American officials admit they went along with the
scheme to appease impatient congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics have a point. There are 100-odd Iraqi opposition
groups, most of them at each other's throats. The most formidable,
the two Kurdish militias that run an autonomous zone in northern
Iraq, have reached an understanding with Saddam Hussein that they
do not want to jeopardize.
</P>
<P>
   Shia groups also have a toehold in the vast southern marshland.
Of these, one of the biggest has been ruled out by the Americans
for being too fundamentalist, leaving only the marginally more
palatable Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Although Muhammad al-Hakim, its leader (and the son of a
well-known grand ayatollah), claims to have a significant guerrilla
network inside Iraq, last week's events show he cannot capitalize
on Shia unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurds and Shias scoff at ``hotel'' opposition groups based
outside Iraq, such as the Iraqi National Congress (INC) and the
Iraqi National Accord (INA).
</P>
<P>
   Both claim to have agents in Iraq, but the INC, once an umbrella
group for several parties, lost most of its network when Hussein's
troops overran its base in northern Iraq in 1996. The INA, which
specializes in defections from the regime, has been thoroughly
infiltrated, say critics.
</P>
<P>
   No opposition group wants to look like a lackey by taking
American cash. Until the Americans get serious, they argue, why
should they stick their necks out?
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for America's allies in the region. The INC, for
example, wants a border enclave from which it could mount attacks
on Baghdad. But Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the likeliest candidates
to provide it, will not risk it without firm American backing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the daily duels between Iraq's armed forces and
American aircraft grow ever more fierce. They could go on for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon reckons it has destroyed only a fifth of Iraq's
anti-aircraft missiles. And its planes have recently extended their
targets to cover other military installations.
</P>
<P>
   Escalation, but to what end? &QL;

<P>
   This week Boeing's bosses swapped the mists of Seattle for the
sunshine of Florida as they tried to reassure investment analysts
and fund managers that the world's biggest aerospace company can
pull its shares out of the descent that began when it announced its
merger with McDonnell Douglas two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over that period, despite a few short rallies, the shares have
lost a third of their value and Boeing has been the dunce of the
Dow.
</P>
<P>
   At present levels, Boeing's capitalization on some days dips
below the value of its assets ($36.7 billion at the end of last
year). That makes it vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, last month Phil Condit, the firm's chairman, tried to
shake the complacency out of 280 top Boeing executives by telling
them that the company was a takeover target. He said that if they
did not fix things soon, somebody else would come in and do it for
them.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that a predator could swoop on America's preeminent
national champion might seem outlandish. Here, after all, is a
company that still makes two-thirds of the big airliners in the
sky, and is America's biggest exporter and its second-biggest
defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing's new chief financial officer, Deborah Hopkins,
reckons that, although the chances of a hostile bid are small, the
company cannot be complacent until its shares are back nearer $60.
Whether it likes it or not, Boeing is in play.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing was vulnerable before, when T. Boone Pickens, a corporate
raider, suddenly bought 15 percent of the company back in 1987. He
soon melted away, but in the early 1990s there was speculation
about a bid by General Electric (GE).
</P>
<P>
   It never happened. Instead Boeing has since turned predator,
buying two defense groups, Rockwell Aerospace and McDonnell
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing made a meager profit last year of $1.1 billion on sales
of $56 billion, after a loss the previous year. According to
Hopkins, only a quarter of its products _ mostly military projects
_ are making decent returns.
</P>
<P>
   Most of its problems are in the civil-jet business. Boeing
embarked on an expensive price war with its only rival, Europe's
Airbus Industrie consortium, but Airbus still grabbed about half
the orders last year.
</P>
<P>
   Because Boeing failed to make the 25 percent improvements in
productivity that it sought, price-cutting led to losses on
hundreds of deals.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, higher volume brought production lines to a halt,
necessitating expensive overtime to unclog them and triggering
penalty payments for late deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   In the last quarter of 1998, Boeing, with its
commercial-aircraft side under new management, started to recover,
turning in a net profit of $465 million. Around 50,000 workers are
being shed.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the aviation cycle is now turning down; and
Boeing is heavily exposed to the depressed Asian market. Condit
declared in early December that this year's profits might be as
much as 25 percent short of the $2 billion that the market
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also has a couple of awkward products in its locker. Its
smallest jet, the 717, is unlikely to sell any better under that
label than it did when it was called the MD-95. It looks an early
candidate for the chop.
</P>
<P>
   And its long-serving 747 jumbo jet is coming to the end of its
life. Boeing needs soon to replace it with an ultra-long-range
version of its successful 777 aircraft. Otherwise it might have to
spend more than $10 billion to develop a totally new replacement
for the jumbo, whose operating costs are now too high.
</P>
<P>
   If Airbus were to proceed with its giant A3XX (the launch of
which has been put back again, supposedly because of the Asia-led
slide in the jet market) Boeing would be forced to invest heavily.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean to any predator? Here is a world-class
company, with a brand name that is the best in the business and
which has made three-quarters of the big jets flying today.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the aging 747 and the ailing 717, it has a healthy
product range and two main businesses that are complementary
(defense and civil jets), plus various space and
information-systems activities, which have big growth potential.
</P>
<P>
   All it has lacked recently is the ability to extract value from
this winning combination.

   Until now, analysts have thought that Condit's job was on the
line unless he improved Boeing in the first half of this year
(despite the unfavorable turn of the civil market). But now he
himself, to put the wind up his top managers, has raised the
spectre of a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The new finance director has already commissioned a study which
shows that about a quarter of Boeing product lines fail to create
value.
</P>
<P>
   Top of the list, which has not yet been published, are probably
the troubled 717 100-seater jet and the latest version of the
big-selling 737, whose production was most disrupted two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Out of $13 billion of investment, she has identified about $2
billion that makes insufficient returns, and a further $1.3 billion
that actually makes losses. More detail may be given in July, or
whenever Boeing cancels programs or sells something. &QL;

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 875. 300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The man at the amiable Condit's side, laboring to get Boeing's
head up again, is Harry Stonecipher, his chief operating officer.
He is an altogether tougher nut, coming from GE's aero-engine
division via McDonnell Douglas, and imbued with the ``fix it, sell
it or close it'' mentality that GE's boss, Jack Welch, has
instilled in the company.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what lies behind the latest scrutiny. Intriguingly,
GE is seeking to do a deal that would bind the companies closer
than they have ever been.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's problem with a long-range 777, the product it needs
most, is the huge engines required to power it. GE is offering to
build such an engine in return for an exclusive contract to supply
it. To land the deal, GE could offer to finance sales of 747s to
hard-up Asian airlines.
</P>
<P>
   GE would be sharing some of the risks at the tail-end of the
jumbo's career, but also helping Boeing to make the transition to a
life without the aircraft that has made the bulk of its profits
over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   It may be this degree of cooperation that has led to rumors of
GE launching a new bid for Boeing. For Welch, it would be a
dramatic finale to a stellar business career.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 24 Condit testily refused to comment on such
suggestions. For its part GE flatly _ and unusually _ denied having
any designs on the company.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors may have arisen only because GE is one of the few
firms that could take on such a huge acquisition as Boeing. But
they are also a comment on Boeing's management.
</P>
<P>
   GE's success is based on its ability to make assets sweat harder
for shareholders. A Welch-like ax wielded over Boeing's
wealth-consuming projects is just what is needed to chop away
Boeing's loss-makers. &QL;

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week Boeing's bosses swapped the mists of Seattle for the
sunshine of Florida as they tried to reassure investment analysts
and fund managers that the world's biggest aerospace company can
pull its shares out of the descent that began when it announced its
merger with McDonnell Douglas two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over that period, despite a few short rallies, the shares have
lost a third of their value and Boeing has been the dunce of the
Dow.
</P>
<P>
   At present levels, Boeing's capitalization on some days dips
below the value of its assets ($36.7 billion at the end of last
year). That makes it vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, last month Phil Condit, the firm's chairman, tried to
shake the complacency out of 280 top Boeing executives by telling
them that the company was a takeover target. He said that if they
did not fix things soon, somebody else would come in and do it for
them.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that a predator could swoop on America's preeminent
national champion might seem outlandish. Here, after all, is a
company that still makes two-thirds of the big airliners in the
sky, and is America's biggest exporter and its second-biggest
defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing's new chief financial officer, Deborah Hopkins,
reckons that, although the chances of a hostile bid are small, the
company cannot be complacent until its shares are back nearer $60.
Whether it likes it or not, Boeing is in play.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing was vulnerable before, when T. Boone Pickens, a corporate
raider, suddenly bought 15 percent of the company back in 1987. He
soon melted away, but in the early 1990s there was speculation
about a bid by General Electric (GE).
</P>
<P>
   It never happened. Instead Boeing has since turned predator,
buying two defense groups, Rockwell Aerospace and McDonnell
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing made a meager profit last year of $1.1 billion on sales
of $56 billion, after a loss the previous year. According to
Hopkins, only a quarter of its products _ mostly military projects
_ are making decent returns.
</P>
<P>
   Most of its problems are in the civil-jet business. Boeing
embarked on an expensive price war with its only rival, Europe's
Airbus Industrie consortium, but Airbus still grabbed about half
the orders last year.
</P>
<P>
   Because Boeing failed to make the 25 percent improvements in
productivity that it sought, price-cutting led to losses on
hundreds of deals.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, higher volume brought production lines to a halt,
necessitating expensive overtime to unclog them and triggering
penalty payments for late deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   In the last quarter of 1998, Boeing, with its
commercial-aircraft side under new management, started to recover,
turning in a net profit of $465 million. Around 50,000 workers are
being shed.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the aviation cycle is now turning down; and
Boeing is heavily exposed to the depressed Asian market. Condit
declared in early December that this year's profits might be as
much as 25 percent short of the $2 billion that the market
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also has a couple of awkward products in its locker. Its
smallest jet, the 717, is unlikely to sell any better under that
label than it did when it was called the MD-95. It looks an early
candidate for the chop.
</P>
<P>
   And its long-serving 747 jumbo jet is coming to the end of its
life. Boeing needs soon to replace it with an ultra-long-range
version of its successful 777 aircraft. Otherwise it might have to
spend more than $10 billion to develop a totally new replacement
for the jumbo, whose operating costs are now too high.
</P>
<P>
   If Airbus were to proceed with its giant A3XX (the launch of
which has been put back again, supposedly because of the Asia-led
slide in the jet market) Boeing would be forced to invest heavily.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean to any predator? Here is a world-class
company, with a brand name that is the best in the business and
which has made three-quarters of the big jets flying today.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the aging 747 and the ailing 717, it has a healthy
product range and two main businesses that are complementary
(defense and civil jets), plus various space and
information-systems activities, which have big growth potential.
</P>
<P>
   All it has lacked recently is the ability to extract value from
this winning combination.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, analysts have thought that Condit's job was on the
line unless he improved Boeing in the first half of this year
(despite the unfavorable turn of the civil market). But now he
himself, to put the wind up his top managers, has raised the
spectre of a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The new finance director has already commissioned a study which
shows that about a quarter of Boeing product lines fail to create
value.
</P>
<P>
   Top of the list, which has not yet been published, are probably
the troubled 717 100-seater jet and the latest version of the
big-selling 737, whose production was most disrupted two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Out of $13 billion of investment, she has identified about $2
billion that makes insufficient returns, and a further $1.3 billion

   This week Boeing's bosses swapped the mists of Seattle for the
sunshine of Florida as they tried to reassure investment analysts
and fund managers that the world's biggest aerospace company can
pull its shares out of the descent that began when it announced its
merger with McDonnell Douglas two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Over that period, despite a few short rallies, the shares have
lost a third of their value and Boeing has been the dunce of the
Dow.
</P>
<P>
   At present levels, Boeing's capitalization on some days dips
below the value of its assets ($36.7 billion at the end of last
year). That makes it vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, last month Phil Condit, the firm's chairman, tried to
shake the complacency out of 280 top Boeing executives by telling
them that the company was a takeover target. He said that if they
did not fix things soon, somebody else would come in and do it for
them.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that a predator could swoop on America's preeminent
national champion might seem outlandish. Here, after all, is a
company that still makes two-thirds of the big airliners in the
sky, and is America's biggest exporter and its second-biggest
defense contractor.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing's new chief financial officer, Deborah Hopkins,
reckons that, although the chances of a hostile bid are small, the
company cannot be complacent until its shares are back nearer $60.
Whether it likes it or not, Boeing is in play.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing was vulnerable before, when T. Boone Pickens, a corporate
raider, suddenly bought 15 percent of the company back in 1987. He
soon melted away, but in the early 1990s there was speculation
about a bid by General Electric (GE).
</P>
<P>
   It never happened. Instead Boeing has since turned predator,
buying two defense groups, Rockwell Aerospace and McDonnell
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing made a meager profit last year of $1.1 billion on sales
of $56 billion, after a loss the previous year. According to
Hopkins, only a quarter of its products _ mostly military projects
_ are making decent returns.
</P>
<P>
   Most of its problems are in the civil-jet business. Boeing
embarked on an expensive price war with its only rival, Europe's
Airbus Industrie consortium, but Airbus still grabbed about half
the orders last year.
</P>
<P>
   Because Boeing failed to make the 25 percent improvements in
productivity that it sought, price-cutting led to losses on
hundreds of deals.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, higher volume brought production lines to a halt,
necessitating expensive overtime to unclog them and triggering
penalty payments for late deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   In the last quarter of 1998, Boeing, with its
commercial-aircraft side under new management, started to recover,
turning in a net profit of $465 million. Around 50,000 workers are
being shed.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the aviation cycle is now turning down; and
Boeing is heavily exposed to the depressed Asian market. Condit
declared in early December that this year's profits might be as
much as 25 percent short of the $2 billion that the market
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also has a couple of awkward products in its locker. Its
smallest jet, the 717, is unlikely to sell any better under that
label than it did when it was called the MD-95. It looks an early
candidate for the chop.
</P>
<P>
   And its long-serving 747 jumbo jet is coming to the end of its
life. Boeing needs soon to replace it with an ultra-long-range
version of its successful 777 aircraft. Otherwise it might have to
spend more than $10 billion to develop a totally new replacement
for the jumbo, whose operating costs are now too high.
</P>
<P>
   If Airbus were to proceed with its giant A3XX (the launch of
which has been put back again, supposedly because of the Asia-led
slide in the jet market) Boeing would be forced to invest heavily.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean to any predator? Here is a world-class
company, with a brand name that is the best in the business and
which has made three-quarters of the big jets flying today.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the aging 747 and the ailing 717, it has a healthy
product range and two main businesses that are complementary
(defense and civil jets), plus various space and
information-systems activities, which have big growth potential.
</P>
<P>
   All it has lacked recently is the ability to extract value from
this winning combination.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, analysts have thought that Condit's job was on the
line unless he improved Boeing in the first half of this year
(despite the unfavorable turn of the civil market). But now he
himself, to put the wind up his top managers, has raised the
spectre of a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The new finance director has already commissioned a study which
shows that about a quarter of Boeing product lines fail to create
value.
</P>
<P>
   Top of the list, which has not yet been published, are probably
the troubled 717 100-seater jet and the latest version of the
big-selling 737, whose production was most disrupted two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Out of $13 billion of investment, she has identified about $2
billion that makes insufficient returns, and a further $1.3 billion
that actually makes losses. More detail may be given in July, or
whenever Boeing cancels programs or sells something. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 875. 300-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   The man at the amiable Condit's side, laboring to get Boeing's
head up again, is Harry Stonecipher, his chief operating officer.
He is an altogether tougher nut, coming from GE's aero-engine
division via McDonnell Douglas, and imbued with the ``fix it, sell
it or close it'' mentality that GE's boss, Jack Welch, has
instilled in the company.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what lies behind the latest scrutiny. Intriguingly,
GE is seeking to do a deal that would bind the companies closer
than they have ever been.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's problem with a long-range 777, the product it needs
most, is the huge engines required to power it. GE is offering to
build such an engine in return for an exclusive contract to supply
it. To land the deal, GE could offer to finance sales of 747s to
hard-up Asian airlines.
</P>
<P>
   GE would be sharing some of the risks at the tail-end of the
jumbo's career, but also helping Boeing to make the transition to a
life without the aircraft that has made the bulk of its profits
over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   It may be this degree of cooperation that has led to rumors of
GE launching a new bid for Boeing. For Welch, it would be a
dramatic finale to a stellar business career.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 24 Condit testily refused to comment on such
suggestions. For its part GE flatly _ and unusually _ denied having
any designs on the company.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors may have arisen only because GE is one of the few
firms that could take on such a huge acquisition as Boeing. But
they are also a comment on Boeing's management.
</P>
<P>
   GE's success is based on its ability to make assets sweat harder
for shareholders. A Welch-like ax wielded over Boeing's
wealth-consuming projects is just what is needed to chop away
Boeing's loss-makers. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The current scientific assault on Mars is an unashamed
celebration of modern technology. The first of an armada of
spacecraft is already on its way to map the planet's surface,
analyze its weather and shoot probes into its soil.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years a dozen or so others will follow,
carrying all manner of sensors, scanners and increasingly clever
robotic rovers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to make it easier to send the results back to Earth,
NASA, America's space agency, has started planning the first
permanent interplanetary data-link _ Mars Network. This will
require a communications satellite to be put into orbit around the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   Orbiting satellites are good at providing information about the
planet as a whole, and crawling rovers can yield extreme close-ups
of individual rocks. But there is a gap in the middle, covering
such activities as looking for groundwater, charting magnetic
anomalies and scouting out future landing sites.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the high-tech paraphernalia, therefore, one group of
researchers wants to revive a distinctly old-fashioned form of
travel.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 years after a cockerel, a duck and a sheep were
first sent aloft in France by the Montgolfier brothers, there are
plans to dispatch a balloon to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The modern-day Montgolfiers are Jim Cutts and his team at NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif. Admittedly,
their proposed Mars balloon bears little resemblance to the huge
paper bag that floated over Versailles in 1783.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, instead of being a hot-air balloon, it will be
filled with helium _ a light gas that will enable it to float in
Mars's mainly carbon-dioxide atmosphere. And rather than being
constructed of paper, the JPL balloon will be made of such
space-age fabrics as mylar and kevlar.
</P>
<P>
   These strong materials are required by the balloon's
``super-pressure'' design. This means that its volume (and thus its
density) is fixed, no matter what the temperature of the gas
inside. That will ensure that it maintains a constant altitude at
the point where its density equals that of the air outside,
irrespective of the amount of sunlight falling on it.
</P>
<P>
   Most terrestrial balloons, by contrast, expand (and thus rise)
during the day in response to solar heating, and shrink and sink at
night.
</P>
<P>
   Super-pressure balloons have already been used to explore Venus,
where two short-lived versions were set adrift by the
Franco-Russian Vega missions in 1985. But the Mars balloon would be
a much more serious affair.
</P>
<P>
   As it drifted over the planet's surface during the course of
several weeks, it would be able to determine its position by
observing the sun and the stars, and to decide, as a result of
those observations, whether or not to take photographs or
atmospheric readings.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this combination of clever technology with an aerial
platform, the JPL researchers prefer to talk of their balloon as an
``aerobot.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, Dr. Cutts and his team will drop a prototype out of
a conventional balloon at an altitude of 35 km (22 miles) _ the
point at which conditions most closely resemble those high up in
the Martian atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to test the novel rapid-inflation technology that is
needed to ensure that the aerobot will inflate and attain a stable
altitude within 60 seconds or so of its arrival in the Martian
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from that uncertainty, according to Dr. Cutts, the
balloon's technology is relatively mature. He hopes that the first
aerobot will reach Mars in 5-7 years.
</P>
<P>
   But another flying machine looks likely to beat it there. Just
as Dr. Cutts and his team have been inspired by the Montgolfiers,
the promoters of this second school take their lead from the Wright
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   If the thin atmosphere of Mars can support a balloon, why not an
airplane?
</P>
<P>
   The idea of sending an unmanned airplane to Mars has been around
for a number of years, but it is taking off, as it were, as the
100th anniversary of the Wright brothers' first powered flight
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   With its characteristic flair for publicity, NASA proposes to
mark the occasion (Dec. 17, 2003) with the first powered flight on
Mars. The agency's budget for 2000, published on Feb. 1, includes a
request for $50 million to finance a Mars airplane.
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture of international solidarity, however, the
spacecraft carrying the plane would actually be sent up by the
French space agency, CNES, as a secondary payload on a
commercial-satellite launch by an Ariane 5 rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial satellite would go into an Earth orbit, while the
smaller scientific payload would continue on to Mars. If
successful, this project would pave the way for NASA and CNES to
collaborate on a number of other small, cheap ``micromissions'' to
Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The Martian airplane proposal has been criticized, with some
justification, for lacking scientific rationale. Tellingly, the
money for the project has been requested even though the plane's
design and scientific mission have still to be defined. (The design
will be put out to competitive tender in a few weeks' time.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet in many ways planes would be just as good as balloons for
exploring Mars; they, too, could take atmospheric readings and
conduct medium-range ground surveys. And in one respect they would
be far better. Unlike free-floating balloons, they could be
dispatched to investigate particular places without being at the
mercy of the winds.
</P>
<P>
   According to Scott Hubbard of NASA's Ames Research Center, also
in California, the anniversary flight would mainly be a
demonstration of technology.
</P>
<P>
   The plane would be dropped into the Martian atmosphere, deploy a
parachute, unfold its wings and, driven by an electric motor, a
hydrazine-fuelled engine or a rocket thruster (depending on who
wins the competition), would fly a few hundred meters above the
surface for up to four hours.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of things it could do in that time. Dr.
Hubbard suggests that it might, for example, investigate the region
around a landing site to put a rover's findings into a broader
context.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility would be a flight along Valles Marineris, an
enormous Martian canyon, to look at the cliff faces for evidence of
long-vanished Martian oceans _ something only a plane could do
relatively easily.
</P>
<P>
   Balloons still have the advantage that they could stay aloft for
weeks at a time, compared with at most a few hours for a plane. But
since they are less able to compete on the public-relations front _
unfortunately, there is no suitable ballooning anniversary in the
near future _ they might have to wait their turn.
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, the first flying machines were balloons, followed by
planes and then spacecraft. On Mars, they will probably arrive in
reverse order. &QL;

<P>
   The current scientific assault on Mars is an unashamed
celebration of modern technology. The first of an armada of
spacecraft is already on its way to map the planet's surface,
analyze its weather and shoot probes into its soil.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years a dozen or so others will follow,
carrying all manner of sensors, scanners and increasingly clever
robotic rovers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, to make it easier to send the results back to Earth,
NASA, America's space agency, has started planning the first
permanent interplanetary data-link _ Mars Network. This will
require a communications satellite to be put into orbit around the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   Orbiting satellites are good at providing information about the
planet as a whole, and crawling rovers can yield extreme close-ups
of individual rocks. But there is a gap in the middle, covering
such activities as looking for groundwater, charting magnetic
anomalies and scouting out future landing sites.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the high-tech paraphernalia, therefore, one group of
researchers wants to revive a distinctly old-fashioned form of
travel.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 years after a cockerel, a duck and a sheep were
first sent aloft in France by the Montgolfier brothers, there are
plans to dispatch a balloon to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   The modern-day Montgolfiers are Jim Cutts and his team at NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, Calif. Admittedly,
their proposed Mars balloon bears little resemblance to the huge
paper bag that floated over Versailles in 1783.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, instead of being a hot-air balloon, it will be
filled with helium _ a light gas that will enable it to float in
Mars's mainly carbon-dioxide atmosphere. And rather than being
constructed of paper, the JPL balloon will be made of such
space-age fabrics as mylar and kevlar.
</P>
<P>
   These strong materials are required by the balloon's
``super-pressure'' design. This means that its volume (and thus its
density) is fixed, no matter what the temperature of the gas
inside. That will ensure that it maintains a constant altitude at
the point where its density equals that of the air outside,
irrespective of the amount of sunlight falling on it.
</P>
<P>
   Most terrestrial balloons, by contrast, expand (and thus rise)
during the day in response to solar heating, and shrink and sink at
night.
</P>
<P>
   Super-pressure balloons have already been used to explore Venus,
where two short-lived versions were set adrift by the
Franco-Russian Vega missions in 1985. But the Mars balloon would be
a much more serious affair.
</P>
<P>
   As it drifted over the planet's surface during the course of
several weeks, it would be able to determine its position by
observing the sun and the stars, and to decide, as a result of
those observations, whether or not to take photographs or
atmospheric readings.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this combination of clever technology with an aerial
platform, the JPL researchers prefer to talk of their balloon as an
``aerobot.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, Dr. Cutts and his team will drop a prototype out of
a conventional balloon at an altitude of 35 km (22 miles) _ the
point at which conditions most closely resemble those high up in
the Martian atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to test the novel rapid-inflation technology that is
needed to ensure that the aerobot will inflate and attain a stable
altitude within 60 seconds or so of its arrival in the Martian
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from that uncertainty, according to Dr. Cutts, the
balloon's technology is relatively mature. He hopes that the first
aerobot will reach Mars in 5-7 years.
</P>
<P>
   But another flying machine looks likely to beat it there. Just
as Dr. Cutts and his team have been inspired by the Montgolfiers,
the promoters of this second school take their lead from the Wright
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   If the thin atmosphere of Mars can support a balloon, why not an
airplane?
</P>
<P>
   The idea of sending an unmanned airplane to Mars has been around
for a number of years, but it is taking off, as it were, as the
100th anniversary of the Wright brothers' first powered flight
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   With its characteristic flair for publicity, NASA proposes to
mark the occasion (Dec. 17, 2003) with the first powered flight on
Mars. The agency's budget for 2000, published on Feb. 1, includes a
request for $50 million to finance a Mars airplane.
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture of international solidarity, however, the
spacecraft carrying the plane would actually be sent up by the
French space agency, CNES, as a secondary payload on a
commercial-satellite launch by an Ariane 5 rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial satellite would go into an Earth orbit, while the
smaller scientific payload would continue on to Mars. If
successful, this project would pave the way for NASA and CNES to
collaborate on a number of other small, cheap ``micromissions'' to

$13. Set in the 1970s, this first novel is narrated by a thoughtful
8-year-old girl who struggles to make sense of her family's chaotic
life on the road after her abandoned mother is lured to Big Sur by
an itinerant therapist to the well-to-do. The result is ``a hard
and shining artifact of personal and social upheaval,'' Walter Kirn
wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONFEDERATES IN THE ATTIC: DISPATCHES FROM THE UNFINISHED CIVIL
WAR &LR;  By Tony Horwitz. Vintage Departures, $14. A former Wall Street
Journal reporter and Civil War buff takes up with a troop of
hard-core battle re-enactors, toughing it out in the field and
tracking down secession-related controversies and die-hard keepers
of the faith throughout the South. Last year the reviewer Roy
Blount Jr. found this to be a ``splendid commemoration of the war
and its legacy'' as well as ``an eyes-open, humorously no-nonsense
survey of complicated Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONCEIVED IN LIBERTY: JOSHUA CHAMBERLAIN, WILLIAM OATES, AND
THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR &LR;  By Mark Perry. Penguin, $15.95. This
focuses on the eventful careers of two rival commanders at
Gettysburg _ one from Maine, the other from Alabama _ who started
as poor farm boys and wound up in politics. The result is ``an
ambitious ... history of the North and South from before the war to
the end of Reconstruction,'' Frederick Allen wrote in 1998. ``The
author reaches far beyond their own lives to capture the complex
spirit of the times.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AN INSTANCE OF THE FINGERPOST &LR;  By Iain Pears. Berkley, $7.99.
This intricate literary thriller about the murder of an Oxford don
in Restoration England _ and the far greater crime to which it is
linked _ unfolds through the voices of four very different
narrators. ``Pears, with a painstaking, almost forensic attention
to detail, constructs his world like a master painter of trompe
l'oeil,'' Andrew Miller wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE EDGE OF THE SEA &LR;  By Rachel Carson. Mariner/Houghton
Mifflin, $14. Seven years before the classic ``Silent Spring,'' the
author turned her formidable gaze on the narrow strip of sea bottom
that ebbs and flows with the tides, and the rich web of life
thriving along the Atlantic coastline. ``Carson's book is
beautifully written,'' Jonathan N. Leonard wrote in 1955. ``People
who get bored by too much lolling on beaches should read it as a
guidebook.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RACHEL CARSON: THE WRITER AT WORK &LR;  By Paul Brooks. Sierra Club,
$18. This book uses hefty selections from Carson's published and
unpublished writings to track her career as both a pioneering
environmentalist and a dedicated writer. In 1972 the reviewer
Josephine Johnson called this a ``rich and readable work.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A PATCHWORK PLANET &LR;  By Anne Tyler. Fawcett/Ballantine, $12.95.
Barnaby Gaitlin is a chronic underachiever who is estranged from
his family and driven by a hunger to peer into other people's
lives. Yet his inner turmoil is accompanied by sudden attacks of
clarity. Last year the reviewer Carol Shields called this a
``wonderful novel ... that repays our always delighted attention.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TENDER AT THE BONE: GROWING UP AT THE TABLE &LR;  By Ruth Reichl.
Broadway, $13. In recalling how a life of eating, waitressing and
cooking led her to become a food writer, the departing restaurant
critic for The New York Times (soon to be editor in chief of
Gourmet) focuses on the characters of those she loves: mainly her
flamboyant mother and her mild-mannered father. Praising this
``effortlessly entertaining'' memoir last year, Paul Levy wrote
that ``Reichl is ... witty, fair-minded, brave and a wonderful
writer.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NIGHT LETTERS &LR;  By Robert Dessaix. Picador USA, $13. In a hotel
room in Venice, a middle-aged Australian with a terminal illness
writes to a friend about his meandering journey through Europe and
his search for meaning. Last year the reviewer Patrick Farrell
admired ``the wry, chatty, surprisingly cheerful voice in which he
discourses on heaven and hell, seduction and sex.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DAY OF CREATION &LR;  By J.G. Ballard. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
$13. In a parched central African nation, an obsessed British
doctor fulfills his dream of creating a ``third Nile.'' ``Ballard
constructs a moody and well-modeled landscape with as fine a
writerly intelligence as we might hope for,'' Samuel R. Delany
wrote in these pages in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WAR FEVER &LR;  $10. In this collection of Ballard's short fiction
reissued by the same publisher, Beirut becomes a laboratory for the
study of warfare and Ronald Reagan is recalled to the White House,
only to have news reports about his health overshadow World War
III. ``Far more rigorous and fastidious than Jorge Luis Borges or
Italo Calvino, Ballard keeps impeccably cool,'' Ursula K. Le Guin
wrote in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BONOBO: THE FORGOTTEN APE &LR;  By Frans de Waal. Photographs by
Frans Lanting. University of California, $24.95. A primatologist
explores the striking differences between these so-called pygmy
chimpanzees, who freely use sex to resolve tension, and their more
familiar cousins. In 1997 David Papineau called this an ``elegant
photo-essay.''

<P>
   It is just as well that American author Elinor Burkett is
neither fainthearted nor afraid of flak (``I thrive on it
actually'') because it seems that she has started a civil war in
the U.S. workplace with a book she hasn't even finished writing
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Procreation Privilege'' _ a working title _ will give a voice
to what she sees as the last minority group in America: the
childless working woman.
</P>
<P>
   According to Burkett, women who choose not to have children are
increasingly furious about tax and time concessions being given to
those who do.
</P>
<P>
   Childless workers, she says, feel discriminated against like
never before: punished for their lack of parental status in terms
of both policy and perception.
</P>
<P>
   Her theories began during the Clinton/Dole campaign of 1996.
Both political parties were pitching at the so-called ``mythic
soccer mom'' and pushing family-friendly policies to win votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they said the word `family,' at first I thought they
meant me. I'm a member of a family,'' she says. ``But `family'
turned out to be a euphemism for `parent,' which I'm not because I
don't want to be. Then I started to wonder about stuff like why
parents get tax breaks that aren't income-sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, my brother-in-law earns $145,000 a year and yet
he still gets $3,000 in tax breaks because he's a parent. Even he
admits he doesn't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   The more research she did, the more convinced she was that she
had a case. American couples with children, she discovered, are
allowed up to 12 days of extra holiday a year, as well as parents'
evenings and sports days.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't want to offend the people they worked with, but
single people were starting to feel like second-class citizens in
much the same way that working mothers felt relegated by their male
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But when Burkett wrote a piece about the subject for the New
York Times, there was outrage. ``They freaked when they read it and
wouldn't print it,'' she says. ```Atlantic Monthly' magazine didn't
believe my findings and just about every other publication I write
for _ except `Mirabella' magazine _ got hostile. That's when I knew
there was a book in it.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the book proposal was strong too. ``I received a fax
from one publisher saying it was the most selfish thing he had ever
read. I asked the assistant to my literary agent what she thought
of it. She said that I came across as a Nazi bitch. Me. I've been a
feminist all my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Betty Friedan for a comment and she screamed at me,
at the top of her lungs, that she didn't believe this sort of bad
feeling existed in the workplace. I told her that my job was merely
to report what was going on and she hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that I'm not causing women to turn against each
other; it's policy that's doing that.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During research, Burkett interviewed many childless women in the
workplace. She wasn't short of anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   There was the copy editor at the New York Times who was forced
to work every Christmas because she had no family ties.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the female construction worker in Baltimore who
did all the early-morning and late-evening shifts because the men
she worked with were fathers.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the shift worker who, when she requested to work
days, was told it would never happen because ``we give first choice
to parents.''
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't just women. ``A guy I interviewed in New York is
thinking of suing his company because, out of a team of three, he
always does all the foreign travel and extra hours because the
other two are mothers,'' she says. ``Flexitime isn't available to
the childless in the way that it is to parents.''
</P>
<P>
   All this, Burkett points out, is at a time when more women than
ever before are choosing to be childless.
</P>
<P>
   While she knows that parents have to be able to work she ``wants
to frame things in a different way; from the point of view of the
childless worker.'' In her view, people are being punished for
their lifestyle choice while others are given ``every break going''
for theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction in Britain to Burkett's arguments has been as outraged
as in America. Marcelle D'Argy Smith, editor of ``Woman's
Journal,'' actively chose not to have children but says she is
``absolutely furious'' with Burkett's suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last thing we need, and I think that the childless
women who say that they are unhappy about working mothers are the
ones that really want children themselves _ they're bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know mothers work very hard indeed and yes, it is unfair,
but you have to cover for them sometimes _ I've covered maternity
leave three times for pregnant women. They're continuing the human
race, for God's sake, so you have to do it. I'm thrilled not to
have children but I know someone's got to and we have to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Natasha Walter agrees: ``Children are not just the
responsibility of the individual, they are a collective
responsibility for society as a whole. And anyway, this support
doesn't go on forever; children are only young for a very few
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a work colleague being frowned upon when he took
two weeks' paternity leave. I find that pathetic, as if it's
``bunking off.''
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., the argument has begun to move on. Democrats are
suggesting that companies exchange maternity and paternity leave
for ``benefits accounts,'' so all employees can take time off.
</P>
<P>
   Those who start a family can spend time with the new baby, while
the childless have the opportunity to fulfil some other kind of
ambition, like going travelling. It's an idea with which Natasha
Walter agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very unhappy about the idea of a fight between
childless women and working mothers,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That said, I think our aim should be for more flexibility in
the workplace for everyone, including the childless who may want
the opportunity to go off and be educated or do voluntary work. But
at the moment we're right to prioritize the needs of parents.'' &QL;

   ``For example, my brother-in-law earns $145,000 a year and yet
he still gets $3,000 in tax breaks because he's a parent. Even he
admits he doesn't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   The more research she did, the more convinced she was that she
had a case. American couples with children, she discovered, are
allowed up to 12 days of extra holiday a year, as well as parents'
evenings and sports days.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't want to offend the people they worked with, but
single people were starting to feel like second-class citizens in
much the same way that working mothers felt relegated by their male
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But when Burkett wrote a piece about the subject for the New
York Times, there was outrage. ``They freaked when they read it and
wouldn't print it,'' she says. ```Atlantic Monthly' magazine didn't
believe my findings and just about every other publication I write
for _ except `Mirabella' magazine _ got hostile. That's when I knew
there was a book in it.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the book proposal was strong too. ``I received a fax
from one publisher saying it was the most selfish thing he had ever
read. I asked the assistant to my literary agent what she thought
of it. She said that I came across as a Nazi bitch. Me. I've been a
feminist all my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Betty Friedan for a comment and she screamed at me,
at the top of her lungs, that she didn't believe this sort of bad
feeling existed in the workplace. I told her that my job was merely
to report what was going on and she hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that I'm not causing women to turn against each
other; it's policy that's doing that.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During research, Burkett interviewed many childless women in the
workplace. She wasn't short of anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   There was the copy editor at the New York Times who was forced
to work every Christmas because she had no family ties.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the female construction worker in Baltimore who
did all the early-morning and late-evening shifts because the men
she worked with were fathers.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the shift worker who, when she requested to work
days, was told it would never happen because ``we give first choice
to parents.''
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't just women. ``A guy I interviewed in New York is
thinking of suing his company because, out of a team of three, he
always does all the foreign travel and extra hours because the
other two are mothers,'' she says. ``Flexitime isn't available to
the childless in the way that it is to parents.''
</P>
<P>
   All this, Burkett points out, is at a time when more women than
ever before are choosing to be childless.
</P>
<P>
   While she knows that parents have to be able to work she ``wants
to frame things in a different way; from the point of view of the
childless worker.'' In her view, people are being punished for
their lifestyle choice while others are given ``every break going''
for theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction in Britain to Burkett's arguments has been as outraged
as in America. Marcelle D'Argy Smith, editor of ``Woman's
Journal,'' actively chose not to have children but says she is
``absolutely furious'' with Burkett's suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last thing we need, and I think that the childless
women who say that they are unhappy about working mothers are the
ones that really want children themselves _ they're bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know mothers work very hard indeed and yes, it is unfair,
but you have to cover for them sometimes _ I've covered maternity
leave three times for pregnant women. They're continuing the human
race, for God's sake, so you have to do it. I'm thrilled not to
have children but I know someone's got to and we have to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Natasha Walter agrees: ``Children are not just the
responsibility of the individual, they are a collective
responsibility for society as a whole. And anyway, this support
doesn't go on forever; children are only young for a very few
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a work colleague being frowned upon when he took
two weeks' paternity leave. I find that pathetic, as if it's
``bunking off.''
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., the argument has begun to move on. Democrats are
suggesting that companies exchange maternity and paternity leave
for ``benefits accounts,'' so all employees can take time off.
</P>
<P>
   Those who start a family can spend time with the new baby, while
the childless have the opportunity to fulfil some other kind of
ambition, like going travelling. It's an idea with which Natasha
Walter agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very unhappy about the idea of a fight between
childless women and working mothers,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That said, I think our aim should be for more flexibility in
the workplace for everyone, including the childless who may want
the opportunity to go off and be educated or do voluntary work. But
at the moment we're right to prioritize the needs of parents.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Americans who travel abroad have become wearily
accustomed to accusations that they are responsible for ``dumbing
down culture,'' otherwise known as the Disneyfication of _ well _
pretty much everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Small matter that one of the fiercest rearguard actions against
colonization by Disney was fought not on the poppy-strewn fields of
the Ile de France but on the (real) battlefields of Manassas,
outside Washington, D.C. _ and won.
</P>
<P>
   Small matter, too, that Euro-Disney, known as Disneyland Paris,
is now a commercial success and that Disney's profits at its U.S.
sites have taken a (shallow) dip.
</P>
<P>
   Most astonishing of all, perhaps, might be the discovery that if
you are looking for sophistication in food and drink, you stand a
better chance of finding it these days in the themed restaurants of
a Disney park than in most American cities, with the possible
exceptions of Manhattan, San Francisco and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Even San Francisco, though, has its limits, exemplified in the
decision of the renowned Chinese chef and gourmet, Kenneth Hom, to
hang up his toque and head to France.
</P>
<P>
   Hom's departure should have been shocking to any American fan of
Chinese food. First, because _ despite being lionized in Europe _
he is actually an American-Chinese born and bred.
</P>
<P>
   Second, because world-ranking chefs _ if they travel _ tend to
go to the vast American market, not away from it.
</P>
<P>
   And third, because he left with a degree of disillusionment,
shaking the crumbs of what he regarded as bastardized
Chinese-American food from his shoes as he went.
</P>
<P>
   Hom's complaint could be summed up as the dumbing down of
America's tastebuds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't appreciate Chinese food,'' he said recently.
``The perception is that Chinese food is cheap grub.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the scale, he says that when Americans buy
themselves a wok and set out to prepare Chinese food, they wanted
nothing less than a banquet _ and exhausted themselves in the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   His last book published in the U.S. was based on
simple-to-prepare family food using accessible ingredients. But he
still could not crack the American market.
</P>
<P>
   A recent random survey of ethnic cooking confirmed much of what
Hom said. Americans will eat anything and everything, so long as it
tastes and looks passably familiar.
</P>
<P>
   And for all their embrace of ``lite'' this and ``healthy'' that,
if it's not big and beefy, it is unlikely to pass muster. Foreign
food is very quickly submerged into the mainstream of American food
and loses much of its character.
</P>
<P>
   While no news at all to the ranks of first-generation immigrants
or frequent travellers, such observations often shock
restaurant-going Americans, who are under the impression that veal
parmigiana, spaghetti with meatballs, and other American culinary
delights are genuine imports rather than mutants catering to the
convention that any self-respecting dish must have meat and
vegetables and bulk.
</P>
<P>
   Such meals, if well prepared, may have merits _ just as Chicago
pizza pie has merits _ but they bear no resemblance to anything on
a menu in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate and most frequently encountered mutant is ``French
dressing,'' which comes thick, heavy, creamy, stuffed with
preservatives and _ like every American salad dressing in a bottle
_ completely dominates what it is supposed to complement.
</P>
<P>
   But salads were not Hom's chief complaint. His was a spice and
texture problem. On the one hand, Chinese food was seen as
``cheap,'' on the other hand, when a particular restaurant becomes
fashionable, Americans will pay whatever it takes, ordering off the
top of the menu without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   But if the food does not then taste vaguely familiar, they will
complain it is inedible. That means easy on the spices, heavy on
the portions, and let the customer mix and match the ``sides''
(trumping the chef and letting one hundred flavors fight).
</P>
<P>
   That Americans could be shocked to find out that their favorite
``ethnic'' dishes are not genuine may, in fact, be a small sign of
change.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the past year, quite ``ordinary'' restaurants will
produce a tray of olive oil and vinegar if you ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers are publishing letters from returning American
tourists expressing amazement that what they ate ``over there''
tasted nothing like its counterpart ``over here.'' And classes have
been started in New York where ``grandmas'' are recruited to teach
second and third generations in preparing the food of their
homeland, lest the art _ and the tastes _ be lost.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for the grannies to have an effect, though, you
could do worse than to order a hamburger. Its ambitions are few and
it tastes as it should. Just hold the French dressing. &QL;

UCLA ROLLS PAST WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He dazzled, he dunked, he dunked again, and then
sophomore guard Baron Davis waved goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   After two spectacular plays, Davis asked to be removed from the
final seconds of UCLA's 79-62 victory Saturday over Washington. He
walked to the bench and waved his index finger in the air as UCLA
students chanted ``one more year'' and 11,465 in Pauley Pavilion
roared their approval. He hugged his coaches and his teammates,
then turned and waved to friends and relatives across the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absorbing everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the locker room, with wide eyes and a playful grin, Davis
refused to acknowledge what his actions indicate and everyone
believes: that he has played his last game in Pauley and will enter
the NBA Draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do, this would be a great way to go out,'' he said. ``But
I haven't made a decision at all.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've got to search for a new roommate,'' sophomore
Rico Hines said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows it,'' freshman JaRon Rush said. ``This is the
last time he'll play here. He wanted to go out with a bang.''
</P>
<P>
   That he did _ with two plays he can carry forever.
</P>
<P>
   Leading a two-on-one break with 1:50 remaining, Davis maneuvered
the ball as if to throw a behind-the-back pass. Instead, he pushed
it all the way around and back in front of himself, faking Huskies
defender Bryan Brown to Fullerton and flying in for a dunk.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, he grabbed a lead pass from Rush _ a goodbye
present? _ and flushed a double-pump, windmill jam that would make
Kobe Bryant proud.
</P>
<P>
   The memorable sequence capped a 14-point, six-assist performance
that, ironically, wasn't one of Davis' best. He has played like an
All-American and carried the Bruins in recent weeks. Saturday, he
didn't have to, for UCLA won its fourth consecutive game with a
pace so frenzied it flustered the Huskies right out of their game
plan.
</P>
<P>
   As they did Thursday against Washington State, and will do for
the duration without injured center Dan Gadzuric, the Bruins
pressured Washington until it choked. UCLA dashed to an early
10-point lead, extended it to 21 midway through the second half,
then repelled a brief Washington rally with seven minutes
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Uncomfortable playing at warp speed, the Huskies committed 29
turnovers and shot 39.6 percent from the field. Their high-scoring
guards, Senque Carey, Donald Watts and Deon Luton, were out of sync
and made 10 of 31 shots. The tempo also prevented Washington from
exploiting 7-foot center Todd MacCulloch, who managed a meager five
shots. Big but cumbersome, MacCulloch is ineffective in chaos, and
chaos was UCLA's theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned the ball over so many times that we eliminated Todd
ourselves,'' Huskies coach Bob Bender said. ``The challenge is not
just to get Todd the ball, but not to turn the ball over. UCLA's
trapping was not a surprise. We were prepared for that. We just
handled it poorly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (21-7, 11-5) were effective but not efficient. They
did not repeat the deft execution and blinding ball movement of
Thursday night. They were impatient, they overpenetrated, and they
took wild shots _ especially guard Earl Watson, whose 13 attempts
were about five too many.
</P>
<P>
   But pressure defense and Rush's fanatical rebounding _ he had
15, a career-high and two more than MacCulloch _ compensated for
the mistakes. It was rec-league ragged from the start, and no one
does ragged better than the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   In two games since Gadzuric's season-ending knee injury, UCLA
has forced 60 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the tempo in our favor,'' Davis said. ``It's not
attack, attack, attack. It's more of a baiting press. Our big guys
can guard, so it doesn't matter where they are. We're creating a
lot of turnovers, and we're not fouling.''
</P>
<P>
   They are hobbling, however. While Jerome Moiso (11 points in 25
minutes) continues to recover from tendinitis in his feet, other
Bruins are hurting.
</P>
<P>
   Watson bruised a muscle in his thigh and did not play the final
10:30, although he expects to be ready for Arizona State on
Thursday. And with a few seconds remaining, Rush was hit in the
head and knocked unconscious. Motionless for a few minutes, he
eventually walked off and, in the locker room, claimed full
recovery.

   Maybe money can't buy you love, but perhaps it can buy you
happiness.
</P>
<P>
   The shop-till-you-drop, ``retail therapy'' culture may have
become more dominant in the last few years, particularly in the
U.S. and U.K., which have seen seven or eight years of solid
consumer growth. But are we really any happier for it?
</P>
<P>
   One person who thinks we are not is Robert Frank, a U.S.
economics professor whose new book, ``Luxury Fever,'' has been
causing a bit of a stir in the States.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that we live in an age of ``profound waste.'' The
very rich spend their money on Cartier watches, Lexus sports cars,
Prada trousers and, at the top of the range, Gulfstream jets. Yet
they are still dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The world's industrial moguls are dreaming up yet more
sophisticated objects for the new super-rich to buy (I heard the
other day from a Gulfstream executive that they are looking at a
supersonic executive jet that will fly faster than Concorde), to
the general detriment of Western societies as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is nothing new in this. A hundred years ago the
economist Thorstein Veblen drew attention to the ``conspicuous
consumption'' of the rich, and the social damage it caused.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, in the Sixties, the British economic journalist
Fred Hirsch identified ``positional goods'' _ goods by their nature
rare, such as Impressionist paintings, or a Queen Anne house _ and
worried about the way in which the rich bid up the prices for them
and so add to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless the burst of consumerism in the U.S., which has
pushed the saving rate into negative territory, gives a new bite to
these well-rehearsed concerns, which is probably why Professor
Frank's book has attracted such attention.
</P>
<P>
   His solution, insofar as there is one, falls into two parts.
First, we should all try to focus attention more on ``inconspicuous
consumption,'' spending time with family and friends, going for
walks in the country, being free from traffic congestion, and so
on.
</P>
<P>
   Second, he believes public policy could help to shift this
balance by scrapping income tax and imposing a progressive
consumption tax on families: the more they spent in any one year,
the higher the tax rate would be. If additional money were raised,
it could be used to fund government investment in public goods.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to buy the whole thesis to feel that there is
something a touch distasteful about excesses of consumption. Not
many of us would like to see a family consumption tax, particularly
if it were used to fund public projects such as the Millennium
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, most of us would accept that, despite the enormous
rise in living standards of most people in developed countries over
the last 40 years, people are not much happier as a result.
</P>
<P>
   This common-sense judgement is supported by academic evidence.
Economists now study happiness, trying to measure how happy people
are and what makes them happier.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly for shopaholics, it seems that ``retail therapy'' is not
particularly effective. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   It may have some slight effect: Warwick University's Andrew
Oswald, a leading authority on the economics of happiness, found
that between 1970 and 1990 there was a slight relationship between
wealth and happiness. But it seems that it is really only at the
very bottom of the income scale that the amount of money people
have influences how happy they are.
</P>
<P>
   Relative wealth, how rich people are compared with the people
around about them, seems to matter more than absolute wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of many people to this will be to say: ``Hold on a
moment, how do they know whether people are happy or not?'' In fact
it is possible to make some measurements, partly by asking people
whether they feel happy, but also by measuring things such as
stress levels.
</P>
<P>
   You can also look at suicide and attempted suicide rates _
apparently attempted suicide is much more common than is generally
appreciated _ and make some judgements from that.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we know about happiness? One of Professor Oswald's
latest findings is that in relative terms the young are becoming
happier, which is great for the (relatively youthful) readers of
this newspaper. Not so good news is the finding that all other
groups are becoming less happy.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployed tend to be unhappy, which is a powerful moral
argument not just for encouraging general economic growth, but also
for encouraging people into jobs where possible.
</P>
<P>
   And _ a particularly troubling finding _ it seems that black
people are less happy than white people.
</P>
<P>
   Any pointers to policy? If relative wealth were more important
than absolute wealth, you might imagine that societies that are
more egalitarian are happier than those that are not. But in fact
that does not seem to be the case, either here in the U.K. or
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Thus international studies suggest that Japanese people are not
particularly happy, despite the small income differentials there,
while Brazilians are relatively happy despite their very large
differentials. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So is there nothing that governments can do to make their
citizens happier? Well, there is one very interesting study about
to come out, by Professor Bruno Frey, of Zurich University.
</P>
<P>
   He has found that the more democracy there is _ and remember
that Switzerland is strong on that _ the happier people become. We
cannot do anything about our age or our race, but if we become
happier the more democratic control we feel we have, then that is
something to hang on to.
</P>
<P>
   Given that any individual's control over the level of democracy
is minimal, and given that spending money does not seem to bring
more happiness, what should we all do to make ourselves happier?
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago David Lykken, a psychologist at the
University of Minnesota, wrote a book called ``Happiness,'' in
which he studied a large group of identical twins who had been
separated at birth.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he concluded that happiness was genetically
determined: people were either born happy or not. ``Trying to be
happier is as futile as trying to be taller.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to a recent article in ``The New Yorker,'' he
thinks he was wrong. People still have set points of happiness,
but, he believes, they can lift their level of happiness above
those points by learning some new habits, such as keeping busy,
taking regular exercise and, apparently, getting married.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what his advice would be for people who are already
frantically busy, who go to the gym three times a week, who have
been married for years, and despite all that are still profoundly
miserable.
</P>
<P>
   However, put together his view that people can lift their
happiness and the evidence that young people are becoming happier,
and there may be a clue. We cannot, of course, become any younger,
but we can perhaps think younger.
</P>
<P>
   That, plus just a little bit of retail therapy, a few drinks, a
few parties... doesn't it sound more fun? &QL;
