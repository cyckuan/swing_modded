<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will release
guidelines Wednesday allowing scientists to conduct federally
funded research on human embryo cells -- work opposed by
anti-abortion groups.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines set out the criteria that the National Institutes
of Health will use to consider applications for federal grants to
study embryonic stem cells, according to an advocate who had been
briefed on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe the cells could be invaluable in treating many
serious diseases, such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. But some oppose
the research on the grounds that to get the cells, scientists must
destroy human embryos -- fertilized eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines, federal research may be conducted only on
cells taken from frozen embryos from fertility clinics -- already
destined to be discarded. Also, federal funds could not be used to
destroy the embryos in order to obtain the cells -- privately funded
researchers will have to pass them on to federally supported
scientists. Opponents criticize this separation as meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, first reported on The Washington Post's Web site, are
scheduled for release Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   They will outlaw payments to embryo donors and keep donors from
specifying who should receive their embryo's stem cells. These
provisions aim to discourage a market for stem cells and block a
woman from creating embryos just to provide treatment for a sick
relative.
</P>
<P>
   Patient support groups applauded the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Perry, chairman of the Patients' Coalition for Urgent
Research, said the federal rules are the safest way to have to
conduct research, ''rather than being driven solely by commercial
interests outside of public purview.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said the stem cells had little more value than adult
cells, and threatened to stop the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's becoming harder and harder to argue that embryonic cells
have uses that adult cells do not,'' Richard Doerflinger, associate
director of the Secretariat for Pro-life Activities at the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, told the Post.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the decision to release this during (congressional)
recess is deliberate.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress opposed to the research said they would take
up the issue once they returned.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that they by law should be allowed to do this,''
Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., told the Post.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking about dismembering a living being, according to
our interpretation,'' said Dickey, who has introduced legislation
banning the destruction of human embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists dispute his interpretation, saying that the retrieval
is conducted when an embryo is only a week old, and still a
microscopic ball of identical cells.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, applications for research would have to
pass a committee of scientists and ethicists before being forwarded
to an NIH scientific review committee, said the advocate, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   That review committee is scheduled to have its next meeting in
January, so the first awards would not be awarded until late in
2001, at the earliest -- assuming that Congress or the next
administration does not interfere.
</P>
<P>
   The research in question involves what are called pluripotent
stem cells, the foundation cells that give rise to all of the other
cells, tissues and organs in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe it may be possible to use these cells to grow
new organs to replace ailing hearts, treat brain disorders, to
restore severed nerves in spinal injuries, and perhaps even cure
diabetes by growing new insulin-producing cells.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Clears Way for Colombia Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton cleared the way for a $1.3
billion anti-drug package for Colombia Tuesday, signing a waiver
that allows the money to be distributed even though the Colombian
government has not met all the human rights conditions set by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers imposed the conditions out of concerns that the U.S.
tax dollars would aid a military with an embarrassing human rights
record.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration argues that Colombia's president, Andres
Pastrana, is on his way to improving human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the legislation is fairly recent, it's understandable
the Colombian government has not had sufficient time to meet all
the conditions and establish a record of compliance,'' said P.J.
Crowley, spokesman for the National Security Council. ''That
required the president to waive some of these criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has been progress and we recognize more needs to be
done,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The aid is meant to help Colombia fight drug traffickers and
includes money to train and equip the army and police, along with
18 Black Hawk helicopters and 42 Huey 2 helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is set to visit Colombia next Wednesday, demonstrating
support for President Andres Pastrana's efforts to fight drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of cocaine consumed in the United States is grown
or passes through Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   There were seven criteria that Colombia was to have met before
getting the anti-drug money.
</P>
<P>
   One was met last week when Pastrana ordered that military
personnel accused of human rights violations would be tried in
civilian courts, so that military courts cannot be used as a
shield.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has obviously not had time to show it is
complying with that directive, Crowley said.

<HEADLINE> Governor offers $75 million for new arena infrastructure  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Proponents of a sports arena for downtown
Newark see Gov. Christie Whitman's offer of $75 million toward
infrastructure improvements as a starting point for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   They are optimistic even though the governor maintains that any
more money would require a public referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The sum would be available for a new sports arena, either at the
Meadowlands Sports Complex or in Newark, according to a letter from
Whitman's chief of staff dated Monday and released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sum is well below the $123 million now sought by those
seeking to build downtown, but represents the first time Whitman
has suggested an amount that could be available to help build a new
arena.
</P>
<P>
   The offer is contingent on both the New Jersey Nets and New
Jersey Devils playing in the new arena and is subject to the
approval of the state Legislature, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The arena developers originally wanted $75 million, which
eventually rose to $150 million, Chief of Staff Michael P. Torpey
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman thinks $75 million ''is an appropriate level of support
given the financing requirements of the Meadowlands alternative and
a review of governmental support of other two-team venues,'' he
wrote to Raymond Levy, president, Newark Sports &AMP; Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The $75 million represents ''all governmental contributions from
state, county and/or city agencies'' and ''the governor does not
want the state or any other public entity to be in an ownership
position for the project, nor does she support implementing the
private financing through any government agencies,'' the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
   A message left for Levy was not immediately returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Newark Sports &AMP; Entertainment LLC is an offshoot of YankeeNets,
the merged operations of the NBA basketball team and baseball's New
York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   YankeeNets president Harvey Schiller said the letter is ''a
starting point for the discussion.'' He emphasized that the group's
goal is to bring both teams to downtown Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's Devils were sold Tuesday for a reported $175 million
to a YankeeNets affiliate, Puck Holdings LLC, an affiliate of
YankeeNets. YankeeNets principals are Yankee owner George
Steinbrenner and Nets owners Lewis Katz and Ray Chambers.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils and Nets consider their present home, Continental
Airlines Arena at the sports complex in East Rutherford, to be
outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   The complex operator, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition
Authority, has offered to build a new arena near the Continental
venue. The cost is estimated at $250 million, with completion by
the end of 2003, Torpey wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman and the authority believe that arena should be owned and
operated by the teams. The state is offering to lease land at the
Meadowlands to the teams for ''nominal consideration'' and provide
a building pad at that site, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A downtown arena would cost $325 million and could be completed
by the fall of 2004, he said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Codey, D-Essex, a Newark arena proponent,
said Whitman should offer more aid for that site because it offers
more growth potential.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you build in Newark, there is a domino effect, for the city
and the region, economically,'' said Codey, Senate minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, it's important to the project that she has at least
acknowledged she would support it in some fashion,'' Codey said.
''She has opened the door, but not fully.''
</P>
<P>
   The Whitman administration, however, is not sure an arena would
revitalize Newark, the state's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   ''The jury is still out on whether or not downtown arenas are
actually responsible for economic development,'' Torpey said.
</P>
<P>
   Newark Mayor Sharpe James, a supporter of a downtown arena,
said, ''I would hope that the governor will continue the good faith
efforts she has exhibited to date and improve the state's offer so
that it is more comparable with the Meadowlands.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision on where to build is best left to the sports teams,
not the state, Whitman spokesman Pete McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   State government will help with an arena that will ultimately
support its operations, McDonough said. The state is not going to
build homes for private businesses, such as professional sports
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're getting out of the arena business,'' McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Meadowlands proposal would end nearly two decades of
state-owned housing for the NBA and NHL teams, which now lease the
building. Sports authority chairman Ray Bateman said he hopes the
letter ''starts some serious dialogue,'' and maintained that the
Meadowlands proposal has advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's significantly less expensive. It's quicker to do; it's a
recognized property,'' Bateman said.

<HEADLINE> Warrant Issued for Fred Lane's Wife  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Police issued a murder warrant late Tuesday
night for the wife of Fred Lane in last month's shooting death of
the NFL player, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The murder warrant was issued for Deidra Lane, Mecklenburg
County Sheriff's Deputy K.B. Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's true. Warrants have been signed for her arrest,'' said
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Capt. Kathy Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Lane, the former Carolina Panthers running back traded to
Indianapolis during the offseason, was shot to death in the
couple's suburban Charlotte home the afternoon of July 6.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, 24, was shot in the chest and in the head at close range
about an hour after arriving from Nashville, Tenn. Police said
Deidra Lane shot him during a domestic dispute.
</P>
<P>
   A woman answering the telephone late Tuesday at the home of
Henderson Hill, Deidra Lane's attorney, refused to allow a reporter
to speak with him.
</P>
<P>
   WSOC-TV in Charlotte reported Tuesday night that Deidra Lane was
to turn herself in to authorities Wednesday morning. Television
cameras were posted outside the county's arrest processing center
early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mecklenburg County assistant district attorney Marsha Goodenow
authorized police Tuesday to obtain a warrant charging Deidra Lane,
25, with murder, The Charlotte Observer reported in Wednesday's
editions.
</P>
<P>
   Goodenow, who reviewed the police investigation into the
shooting, declined to talk about the authorities' findings or why
she approved the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Phone messages at the home of Fred Lane's father in Tennessee
were not immediately returned Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting came only a week after the birth of their daughter,
and the Charlotte home was decorated with pink balloons and a pink
stork.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Lane had been staying with relatives in Tennessee after
training with Indianapolis, which acquired him from Carolina in a
trade in April.
</P>
<P>
   Deidra Lane filed a complaint against her husband in March,
saying he snatched a necklace from around her neck during an
argument, causing her to fall. She did not press charges and later
said she only called police because she was locked out of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury in Jackson, Tenn., indicted Lane three days before
his death on misdemeanor drug charges stemming from a Feb. 3
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, a 5-foot-10, 205-pound running back, played for three
seasons with Carolina and became the Panthers' leading career
rusher in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers re-signed Lane before the 1999 season to a
two-year, $1.276 million contract with a $300,000 signing bonus.
Lane shared rushing duties with Tshimanga Biakabutuka but played
largely as a backup late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Lane is one of two former Panthers to face legal troubles in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Rae Carruth, the Panthers' top 1997 draft pick, was charged last
fall with fatally shooting his pregnant girlfriend, Cherica Adams.
Carruth is being held without bond in Charlotte, while he awaits
trial.

NTSB: Fuel Tank Explosion Caused TWA Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top federal investigator on Tuesday said an explosion of
vapors in a fuel tank is what brought down TWA Flight 800 four years ago at a
loss of 230 lives. Bernard S. Loeb, aviation safety director of the National
Transportation Safety Board said investigators ''cannot be certain'' what
ignited the blast, but the most likely cause was an electrical short in wiring
inside the tank. The physical evidence, he said, ''leads to the inescapable
conclusion'' that the plane was brought down by a fuel-air explosion inside the
center wing tank.

Reducing Kids' Fat Intake OK for Their Brains
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Reducing children's fat intake to prevent heart disease later
in life can start before age 2 without harming their brains, Finnish researchers
say. U.S. guidelines recommend against restricting fat before age 2, largely out
of concern that fat deficiency could impair proper development of children's
rapidly growing brains. The study of 496 Finnish children who were followed from
7 months of age to 5 years ''goes a long way to laying that question to rest,''
said Dr. Gilman Grave, chief of endocrinology, nutrition and growth at the
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Federal Reserve Keeps Current Rates

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing strong productivity growth and a moderating

a seventh time in its campaign to fight inflation. While still warning about the
dangers that tight labor markets might spark inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan and his colleagues included more upbeat language about the
economy in explaining their latest decision. It marked the second meeting at
which the central bank has left rates alone.

<HEADLINE> Durazo To Undergo Wrist Surgery  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona first baseman Erubiel Durazo will undergo
surgery Thursday to remove a bone chip from his right wrist and
will be out the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo, who is on the disabled list for the third time this
season with pain in the wrist, decided to have the surgery rather
than receive a cortisone injection in an attempt to make it through
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's had several cortisone injections already and sometimes
multiple injections in the same spot can cause damage to the
wrist,'' team physician Don Sheridan said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan also said the chance that the injection would provide
long-term relief is low.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo was hitting .265 with eight home runs and 33 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he was one of baseball's biggest surprises. He
climbed quickly from Double-A El Paso, through Triple-A Tucson to
the Diamondbacks, where he hit .329 with 11 homers and 30 RBIs in
just 53 games to help Arizona win the NL West title.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter said Greg Colbrunn will become the team's
full-time first baseman for the rest of the season, with Alex
Cabrera as his backup.
</P>
<P>
   Colbrunn, who was batting .491 in his previous 13 starts going
into Tuesday night's game, has been a pinch-hit specialist most of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's playing well. He's swinging the bat well,'' Showalter
said. ''Colby's going to play over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the location of Durazo's bone chip, which is about
the size of a pea, arthroscopic surgery is not possible, Sheridan
said. An open incision will be required. Durazo should be ready to
participate fully in spring training next year.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair torn cartilage
in the wrist early this season and was on the disabled list from
May 30 to June 23. Four days later, on June 27, he went back on the
DL with wrist pain.
</P>
<P>
   Durazo was activated July 12, and went back on the disabled list
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan believes that the bone chip has been present for some
time but separated further after Durazo came back from the original
surgery. He said that for a left-handed batter, the force applied
to the right wrist while swinging a bat is considerable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Especially for someone who swings the bat as hard as Erubiel
Durazo does,'' Sheridan said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan said he knew the bone chip was there at the time of the
initial surgery but didn't believe it was a factor in the wrist
pain Durazo had at the time. His opinion is supported by the fact
that Durazo initially felt no pain as he came back from the
operation.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 4, Diamondbacks 3  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Jeff D'Amico won his eighth straight decision,
giving up six hits in 8 2-3 innings Tuesday night as the Milwaukee
Brewers beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Sexson and Tyler Houston homered for the second night in
a row for the Brewers. Houston had two homers Monday night when
Milwaukee snapped Arizona's seven-game winning streak 16-8.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell drove in two of Arizona's runs with doubles in the
third and eighth innings.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico (10-4), the NL pitcher of the month in July, struck out
five and walked one. He was pulled after Greg Colbrunn doubled with
two outs in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Leskanic relieved and gave up Damian Miller's RBI single
before getting his seventh save.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico has a 1.36 ERA in the 10 starts since his last loss on
May 5. After that defeat, he was on the 15-day disabled list with
tendinitis in his right rotator cuff.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning, he's gone 8-0 to break the club record for the
National League version of the Brewers of seven straight victories
set by Steve Woodard last year. The Brewers are 10-0 in the games
D'Amico has started since coming off the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs accounted for all four runs allowed by Geraldo Guzman
(3-4), who gave up four runs on six hits in five innings. He struck
out five, walked two and hit two batters.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Loretta singled with two outs in the third, then Geoff
Jenkins was hit by a pitch. Sexson homered to left-center to make
it 3-1, his seventh homer in 21 games since coming to Milwaukee
from Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   After Arizona cut the lead to 3-1, Houston led off the fourth
with his career-high 15th home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks closed to 4-2 after Danny Bautista led off the
eighth with a broken-bat single. He advanced to second and third on
a bunt and groundout, then scored when Bell doubled down the
left-field line. The threat ending when Luis Gonzalez struck out on
three pitches. Gonzalez was 0-for-4 to end his 14-game hitting
streak.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Arizona 1B Erubiel Durazo will undergo season-ending
surgery on Thursday to remove a bone chip from his right wrist. He
underwent arthroscopic surgery earlier this season to repair torn
cartilage in the same wrist. ... D'Amico has allowed three or fewer
earned runs in 14 of his 16 starts. ... D'Amico singled in the
seventh, only his third hit in 34 at-bats this season. ... The
Diamondbacks will try to salvage a game in the three-game series by
sending Curt Schilling to the mound two wrap up the six-game
homestand on Wednesday night. ... Arizona is 3-2 in the homestand,
the Brewers are 3-2 with one to play on a six-game road trip.

<HEADLINE> Fox's Opens Border Vision Clashes  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To some, the political winds that swept
underdog Vincente Fox into Mexico's presidency last month are a
fresh breeze wafting across the Rio Grande, carrying promises of
better days for Mexico and its relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But, analysts say, the good will could blow away just as
suddenly if Fox, who takes office Dec. 1, insists on a freer flow
of Mexican workers into the United States. Fox is expected to bring
up the issue later this week in separate meetings with President
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore in Washington and with Gov.
George W. Bush in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Fox defeated the seemingly invincible PRI party -- which ruled
Mexico for more than 70 years -- in elections on July 2. In his
campaign he talked of Mexico and the United States becoming
''partners,'' and he is an unabashed globalist. He vows to create
conditions for a doubling of American investment in Mexico and to
wage an all-out war on corruption in his country.
</P>
<P>
   He also pledges to allow the extradition of Mexican drug
traffickers to the United States, something Mexico traditionally
has been reluctant to do. All of this delights American officials,
who say they expect the gains in cross-border ties of recent years
to continue under Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some U.S. reservations about Fox, especially his
fierce opposition to the U.S. policy of spending billions of
dollars each year to keep undocumented Mexicans off U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   Fox wants eventually to do away with border controls. He
envisions the transformation of the three countries of North
America into a kind of European Union, where the citizens of one
can work in any other member nation.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that open borders among EU countries have brought
Portugal and Greece much closer to economy parity with other EU
members.
</P>
<P>
   But critics argue the two situations are not comparable, noting
that Portugal and Greece have populations much smaller than Mexico
and that their migrant workers were dispersed throughout EU
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the number of poor Mexicans is large, an estimated
40 million, and the great majority who are inclined to migrate look
to the United States -- and no other country -- for their economic
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is not looking to the United States to solve Mexico's
population surplus. Rather, he would offer incentives for Mexicans
to stay at home, including an economic program that would create
jobs on a scale far greater than what is being done today.
</P>
<P>
   He is adamant about doing away with the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ''By building up walls, by putting up armies, by dedicating
billions of dollars like every border state is doing to avoid
migration, is not the way to go,'' Fox says.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans obviously disagree and believe existing barriers
are inadequate. Six weeks before Fox's election, the House approved
a bill sponsored by Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, to allow
deployment of U.S. troops along the border to protect a variety of
U.S. interests, including the curbing of drug trafficking and of
weapons smuggling. The vote was 243-183. The sentiment reflected in
the vote was diametrically opposed to Fox's vision.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill has been approved by the House on two previous
occasions but died in negotiations with the Senate both times.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith, director of public policy for the AFL-CIO, says
open borders are impractical with two countries at such different
stages of development.
</P>
<P>
   A guest worker program favored by Fox would pit arriving Mexican
workers against American workers, resulting in a ''race to the
bottom'' between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   George Garrison, a Mexico expert at the College of William and
Mary, agrees. ''The chances of an American floor sweeper in a
Houston high-rise to get a raise are greatly diminished when there
is a squadron of immigrant job seekers waiting outside,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Willard Workman, a vice president at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, says he believes the issue is worthy of official
discussions but in the meantime, ''We're going to keep the border
policed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just as we don't want goods dumped, we don't want labor
dumped,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Typhoon Bilis Slams Into Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS CALO MEDINA
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Typhoon Bilis roared across Taiwan
Wednesday, killing three people, bowling over power lines and
trees, and forcing thousands from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful winds ripped off electrical wires that killed a
woman outside the capital, Taipei, and a construction worker died
when a retaining wall collapsed in the suburbs, the government
said. Another man died after he was hit by a door knocked down by
wind.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers equipped with cranes and tractors were scrambling to
dig out nine farmers buried by a landslide in the central village
of Jenai, Interior Minister Chang Poh-ya said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not optimistic about the situation,'' Chang said about
the farmers, trapped for more than seven hours.
</P>
<P>
   In eastern Hualien county, about 250 houses collapsed in the
strong winds, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An earthquake of a preliminary magnitude of 5.7 also struck
Hualien at 8:40 a.m. Wednesday, but no immediate damage was
reported, weathermen said.
</P>
<P>
   Bilis was an especially powerful storm, but there were differing
reports of its strength. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Pearl
Harbor, Hawaii, said it had sustained winds as high as 161 mph,
making it a Category 5 hurricane capable of causing catastrophic
damage. The Taiwan Central Weather Bureau measured the storm at 118
mph. Officials there said the discrepancy in wind speed was
partially the result of Taiwan measuring the storm's intensity over
a longer period.
</P>
<P>
   Bilis lost some of its strength as it left Taiwan, heading
toward southern China's Fujian province. At 8 a.m., Taiwan
forecasters said its winds had dropped to 102 mph and was centered
50 miles west of Taiwan's outlying Penghu islands traveling at a
speed of 12 mph.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600,000 homes had lost power during the height of the
storm, and tens of thousands across the island were moved from
their homes into typhoon shelters set up by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Local and international carriers canceled 76 flights to southern
Taiwan and abroad. In southern Taiwan, Kaohsiung harbor -- one of
the world's busiest ports -- remained closed as waves battered the
sea walls.
</P>
<P>
   Government offices, banks and Taiwan's stock market were closed
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The government began issuing warnings on Saturday against
massive landslides in mountainous regions all over the island and
urged residents to remain indoors. Hospitals extended hours at
emergency rooms and trauma units.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's Defense Ministry and state-run electric company Taiwan
Power set up disaster relief centers in southern Taiwan to assist
in emergencies. Premier Tang Fei said that Taiwan's army was on
alert.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been vigilant in handling natural calamities
following the 7.6-magnitude earthquake in September 1999 that left
2,400 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the duty of all local officials to stay as prepared as
possible for the typhoon,'' Vice President Annette Lu told
officials at a meeting late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bilis was the second strong typhoon to hit Taiwan this year.
Last month, Typhoon Kai Tak swept through southern Taiwan with
winds of up to 93 mph, leaving one dead and five others injured.

<HEADLINE> Reno Decides Against Probe of Gore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno has decided not to
name a special prosecutor to investigate the 1996 fund-raising
activities of Vice President Al Gore, the New York Times reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has rejected the recommendation of the head of the Justice
Department's campaign finance unit, Robert J. Conrad Jr., which
marks the third time that Reno has rejected such a recommendation
to investigate Gore, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The Times reported on its Web site that Conrad was the only
prosecutor in the department who thought there would be a need for
an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has repeatedly maintained that he didn't know
he was attending a fund-raiser when he visited a Buddhist temple in
California where $60,000 in illegal donations were funneled to the
Democratic National Committee during the Clinton-Gore re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was questioned April 18 by Conrad, and Gore released the
transcript of the interviews in June after word of Conrad's
recommendation was disclosed to the press by Sen. Arlen Spector,
R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ''You were aware in late February, were you not, that there was
a goal of raising $108 million by the DNC?'' Conrad asked Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes,'' the vice president replied.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then a couple of months later there is a DNC-sponsored event
at the temple and it didn't raise any fund-raising issues in your
mind?''
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not know this was a fund raiser,'' Gore answered. ''And
I do not to this day know that it was a fund raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also testified, ''I sure as hell don't recall having -- I
sure as hell did not have any conversations with anyone saying this
is a fund-raising event. As to whether or not I had any follow-up
conversations that said, were we able to set up this event or not,
I don't think I did. But I may have.''
</P>
<P>
   In another exchange, Conrad confronted Gore with an e-mail
exchange with an aide in which Gore referred to a fund-raiser in
Los Angeles on April 29, the same day as the temple event.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that, from this e-mail, that she has told me in
this e-mail that we've confirmed the fund raisers for Monday, April
29,'' Gore acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning also dealt with the White House coffees that
both President Clinton and Gore hosted for big-money donors.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the vice president's answers were reminiscent of
legalistic answers Clinton gave in the Monica Lewinsky scandal,
with the president saying one answer depended on the definition of
the word ''is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, when asked the role coffees would play in raising money,
replied, ''Let me define the term 'raising.' ... If you mean by it,
would they be events at which money was raised, the answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he hosted 23 White House coffees, Gore said ''that
seems inaccurate to me.'' Two days after the interview, Gore's
lawyer clarified his client's answer, saying Gore had hosted 21
coffees for donors in the Old Executive Office Building -- next to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did not understand your question to include OEOB coffees,''
Gore's lawyer wrote Conrad. The lawyer said Gore thought Conrad was
referring to coffees at the White House hosted by Clinton. Gore had
not reviewed the records of coffees before the interview, the
lawyer wrote.

<HEADLINE> The Birds: A key to tracking West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELMAR, N.Y. (AP) - Dead birds are piling up at Ward Stone's
door by the van load - a blue jay in a picnic cooler, frozen crows
packed in dry ice, sparrows, hawks and warblers.
</P>
<P>
   The birds are potentially infected with the deadly West Nile
virus, and Stone, New York state's wildlife pathologist, will pluck
some out for examination. Organs of sick-looking birds will then
receive a final diagnosis at a lab nearby, where Dr. Laura Kramer
and her staff are already inundated with hundreds of bird parts and
thousands of mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the West Nile virus is being tracked.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito-borne virus, which can cause encephalitis, a brain
inflammation, killed seven people in the New York City area last
year during its first known appearance in the United States and has
become a public health threat this summer, too.
</P>
<P>
   Three elderly New York City residents tested positive for the
disease in the nation's only confirmed cases this summer. All three
are recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who contract the disease experience flu-like
symptoms. But the virus can be dangerous in children under 5, the
elderly and people with compromised immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Given that threat, New York is among 44 states, along with the
District of Columbia and New York City, getting funding from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for surveillance of
mosquito-borne diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Infected birds and mosquitoes can serve as an early warning
system for the presence of the West Nile virus. So at the urging of
New York health officials, counties and private citizens have been
sending dead birds to Stone's wildlife pathology lab just outside
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   So far this summer, scores of infected birds have been found in
New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island,
with nearly 300 in New York state alone, most of them crows
discovered in the New York City area.
</P>
<P>
   The findings have prompted insecticide spraying in New York City
and other regions.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing the dead birds is a huge and exhausting job.
Researchers at the New York state Health Department's West Nile
virus lab, which Kramer heads, work weekends and the office is
running out of space for specimen jars. Stone starts at 3 a.m. and
puts in 16-hour days to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I go five minutes in a day without thinking of
West Nile,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone and his small staff perform triage on the hundreds of
bagged and boxed birds arriving daily. They must decide which birds
to perform a necropsy on - fresh carcasses are better than old
ones, crows are better indicators than some other birds.
</P>
<P>
   Stone looks for West Nile symptoms such as lesions on the birds'
hearts or enlarged livers and spleens. If he finds symptoms in a
bird, four specimen jars are shipped to the state Health
Department's nearby Griffin Lab - one jar each for a bird's brain,
heart, spleen and kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer's staff, working in the tight confines of a converted
horse stable, performs molecular tests on the tissue for a final
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer's lab receives about 200 birds a week. On top of that,
tests are done each week on some 600 pools of mosquitoes shipped in
on dry ice from around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer came out from California in May to head the lab and has
been hustling to keep up since.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really am amazed at the level to which the virus has
spread,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have also kept busy. For instance, Connecticut has
trapped and tested 104,000 mosquitoes. But New York is believed to
be doing more testing than any other state.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said the work may not let up until a little after Labor
Day. With luck, disease-carrying mosquitoes will perish with the
first frost.	   The would give Stone a chance to get back to his other pathology
work, such as checking contaminated turtles and diseased ducks.
Kramer wants to spend the winter researching West Nile research,
instead of reacting to it.
</P>
<P>
   And after that?
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Andreadis, chief medical entomologist for Connecticut's
Agricultural Experiment Station, offered this gloomy assessment:
''Next year, we're going to be doing this all over again.''

<HEADLINE> Sub Officer's Wife Urges Rescue Op  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) -- Sergei Dudko had just received a
stunning promotion, granted the same day his son turned 10, when he
headed out for maneuvers aboard the Kursk nuclear submarine.
</P>
<P>
   He put off celebrations until his return, thinking it would be
just a matter of days before he was back from the routine mission.
</P>
<P>
   Dudko's wife, Oksana, was basking in joy over his swift ascent
through the Navy's ranks. At only 30, Dudko was the No. 2 man
aboard one of Russia's newest and best submarines, and Oksana was
becoming a prominent figure at the naval facility in Vidyayevo, a
Northern Fleet base on the Barents Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he would return and we would celebrate everything,''
Oksana said Tuesday in nearby Murmansk, her face pale and drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Their plans collapsed in tragedy when the Kursk suffered a huge
explosion and sank Aug. 12 with 118 officers and sailors aboard. On
Monday, rescuers managed to open an escape hatch and determined
that the submarine was completely flooded, with no chance of any
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Oksana, a look of torment in her large gray eyes, refuses to
believe her husband is dead. She is appealing to naval authorities
and foreign rescuers, urging them to continue searching in case
anybody remains alive in compartments rescuers have not reached.
</P>
<P>
   ''Knowing my husband, who would hang on as long as possible, I
hope he is still alive,'' she said. ''And everything inside me
tells me he is still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has abandoned the rescue operation and says it will
takes weeks or months to retrieve the submarine and the bodies
inside, if autumnal storms in the Barents Sea allow.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't even bury them properly,'' Oksana said. ''They say:
Wait for a year, the sea is now getting stormy.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities have given slow, conflicting reports about
the disaster and the agonizing rescue effort. The Russian military
command initially refused foreign help -- a delay that many naval
experts say may have cost the lives of some crew members.
</P>
<P>
   Further stoking public outrage, President Vladimir Putin
remained on vacation for days while the tragedy unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Dudko's 10-year-old son, Kostya, is taking his father's death so
hard he has to be treated by a psychotherapist, Oksana said.
</P>
<P>
   She is trying to keep the news from her 3-year-old daughter,
Sofia. ''She loves her father so much, I haven't been able to tell
her yet,'' Oksana said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday before, Oksana cut short her vacation and rushed to
Vidyayevo after the military announced the Kursk had sunk.
</P>
<P>
   On a plane from Moscow to Murmansk, Oksana looked worried but
still hopeful. Sofia was twisting around in her airplane seat and
smiling at other passengers. Kostya was discussing a book about
submarine rescue he had just read.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say there have been no casualties, and we believe that,''
Oksana told The Associated Press at the time.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, she looked crushed, a shell of her former self.
''The naval command doesn't want to do anything any more,'' she
said. ''They are burying our husbands alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most people in Murmansk and surrounding military
facilities, Oksana blames the Russian command for refusing foreign
help for days.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they had started immediately, maybe half the crew would
already be on land,'' said Oksana's sister, Alyona Vershinina.
</P>
<P>
   Oksana is still hoping her husband will come home for a double
celebration of his promotion and Kostya's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not put on the widow's black headscarf until I see his
corpse,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Pres. Elect Visits Canada  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Vicente Fox sounded like a president, and his
Canadian hosts treated him like one.
</P>
<P>
   With more than three months to go before he formally assumes
power on Dec. 1, the Mexican president-elect began a four-day trip
to Canada and the United States on Tuesday to express his vision of
how relations among the North American neighbors can expand.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien rejected Fox's
vision of a European Union-style grouping in the hemisphere, Fox
stuck to his theme of working together with his larger, more
powerful partners to promote human and economic development in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   By winning the July 2 election to topple 71 years of
single-party rule in Mexico, Fox inspired hopes for a new era of
democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   A former Coca-Cola executive, Fox said last week he wanted the
United States and Canada to help Mexico become an equal partner in
a stronger, expanded version of the North American Free Trade
Agreement that eventually could grow into a hemispheric version of
the EU.
</P>
<P>
   Fox met for an hour Tuesday with Chretien, who then said he
believed the EU concept was unfeasible in North America.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot establish relations between Canada, the United
States, and Mexico in the same type of situation as in Europe,'' he
said, adding that Canada wanted to maintain its own currency and
refused to consider a common currency like the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Fox insisted the idea was to promote prosperity, no matter the
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not proposing a common currency here. We don't think
that would work,'' he said. ''We're proposing to work together --
work on human development, economic development -- to narrow the
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting in Toronto on Wednesday with business leaders and
social groups, Fox travels to the United States for talks with
President Clinton and Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore and
Republican candidate George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   His trip has the look of an official presidential visit, with
Mexican and Canadian flags adorning every venue and well-wishers
shouting ''Viva Fox.'' Chretien even referred to him as ''Mr.
President.''
</P>
<P>
   Chretien said Canada wanted to improve direct trade corridors
with Mexico, implying that the presence of the United States
between them inhibited the flow of goods back and forth. He also
said the two countries could work together to solve problems with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fox sounded the same hopeful themes of his successful election
campaign, repeatedly referring to opportunities for Mexico and its
NAFTA partners to promote human and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Mexico's reputation for human rights violations, Fox
promised his government would have an ''active, dynamic policy
respecting human rights and democracy.''

<HEADLINE> NTSB Rules on TWA Jet Crash Cause  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal investigators say an explosion of
vapors in the fuel tank caused TWA Flight 800 to plunge into the
ocean, killing all 230 passengers aboard, but four years after the
crash they are still unable to pinpoint what ignited the blast.
</P>
<P>
   A solid body of circumstantial evidence points to an electrical
short as the cause, but there was not enough wire recovered from
the wreckage to know for sure, said Robert Swaim of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would love to walk in here with a molten piece of wire and
say, 'Here it is.''' said Swaim, who spent four years looking for
the source of the ignition.
</P>
<P>
   Swaim's conclusions came Tuesday on the first day of a two-day
meeting to study investigators' reports on the crash and its cause.
The hearing will continue Wednesday with a discussion on
maintenance of the nation's aging fleet of aircraft and the
observations of witnesses who claim they saw Flight 800 explode and
crash into the waters off Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A number of possible causes of the explosion were considered,
including problems with the main landing gear, static electricity,
a small explosive charge, a missile and a meteorite strike, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators zeroed in on the short circuit because of a
combination of factors which, taken together, were telling. A crew
member was recorded on the cockpit voice recorder remarking on the
fuel flow indicator swaying crazily shortly before the crash. A
buzz on the cockpit voice recorder went silent in the moments
before the crash. Additionally, there had been recent problems with
lights on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   While wiring inside the fuel tank is very low voltage those
wires are bundled together with higher voltage wires and a short
could have been carried into the fuel tank, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Air and fuel had been heated by an air conditioner positioned
underneath the tank while the plane was delayed for three hours
prior to takeoff. That helped to make the tank volatile when it
climbed in altitude, NTSB investigator Joseph Kolly said.
</P>
<P>
   Given those conditions, a spark as weak as the static
electricity transferred between a person's hand a metal doorknob
would have been sufficient for an explosion, Kolly said.
</P>
<P>
   TWA Flight 800 went down shortly after leaving New York's John
F. Kennedy Airport on July 17, 1996, bound for Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The crash has spawned a host of conspiracy theories, the most
prevalent being that a bomb or a missile brought down the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Some still contend the government is trying to cover up the real
cause, and one group, calling itself the TWA 800 Eyewitness
Alliance, ran a full-page ad in Tuesday's Washington Times
insisting missiles were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB Chairman James Hall on Tuesday chastised those who continue
to push those theories. The FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms and his investigators all failed to find evidence of a
bomb or missile blast, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Loeb, aviation safety director of the National
Transportation Safety Board, said that bomb and missile blasts
leave distinct patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ''High-energy explosions leave distinctive damage signatures
such as severe pitting, cratering, hot gas washing, and petaling.
No such damage was found on any portion of the recovered airplane
structure,'' Loeb said.
</P>
<P>
   The physical evidence ''leads to the inescapable conclusion that
the cause of the in-flight breakup of TWA Flight 800 was a fuel-air
explosion inside the center wing tank,'' Loeb said.
</P>
<P>
   John Seaman of Albany, N. Y., who lost his 19-year-old niece
Michelle Becker of St. Petersburg, Fla., was at the hearing in
Washington, along with more than 75 relatives of victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''This speculation still that this was a missile is making all
of us crazy,'' Seaman said. ''It makes us feel like there is
someone walking around today laughing about the death of our loved
ones. If all they can come up with is a probable cause then that is
all that can be done.''

<HEADLINE> Primary Fight Over Okla. House Seat  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the fight for an open House seat in Oklahoma, Republicans
settled Tuesday upon a car dealer as their nominee while Democrats
split and sent two candidates to a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbents, however, easily won their nominations in primaries
in Oklahoma, Wyoming and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   And in a municipal election in Selma, Ala., longtime Mayor Joe
Smitherman -- a white former segregationist who was in office during
the civil rights violence of 1965 -- was sent into a runoff against
a black businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's open seat drew the attention of the national parties
fighting for control of the House, with each party hoping to win
the seat held since 1994 by GOP Rep. Tom Coburn. He kept a campaign
promise to retire after three terms and is returning to his medical
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn's retirement set off a scramble in a district where
Republicans are outnumbered 5-to-2.
</P>
<P>
   With 94 percent of the precincts reporting, Coburn's chosen
successor, car dealer Andy Ewing, won with 15,374 votes, or 60
percent of the vote. Rancher Jack Ross, had 7,096 votes, or 28
percent, while none of the remaining five GOP candidates broke
double digits.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats went to a runoff, with law professor Brad Carson
receiving 36.547 votes, or 45 percent, and state Rep. Bill Settle,
head of the state House Budget Committee, getting 32,581 votes, or
40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Oklahoma, incumbent Reps. J.C. Watts, Ernest Istook
and Steve Largent all easily beat back primary challenges from
political novices. Each faces opposition in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma voters, by a margin of 4-1, approved a referendum to
lower the cost of car tags, cutting taxes by $22.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Wyoming, first-term GOP Sen. Craig Thomas faced no primary
opposition. Mine worker Mel Logan won the Democratic nomination to
challenge Thomas in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Three-term Wyoming Rep. Barbara Cubin easily won her nomination
against two poorly funded fellow Republican challengers. She faces
general election opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's lone House member, GOP Rep. Don Young, had no
challengers for his party's nomination. He has represented the
state since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The election in Selma again tested Smitherman, 70, who barely
won re-election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He received 46 percent of the vote, while businessman James
Perkins -- who nearly beat him four year ago -- got 43 percent. Two
other candidates divided the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people voted along racial lines,'' Smitherman said. ''I
needed to get some black votes and I didn't get them.''
</P>
<P>
   First elected in 1964, Smitherman once supported segregation.
During his first term the city became infamous for the armed
response to the Selma voting rights march. Later, he welcomed
blacks into his government and has won nine consecutive elections
in a city that is now 65 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   Most opponents criticized him for his management of the city.

Dinosaurs Footprints Found in Italy

   ROME (AP) -- The discovery of as many as 60 dinosaurs footprints in the
''spur'' of the Italian peninsula has added new evidence to the theory that
Italy was once part of a land mass attached to the African continent, geologists
said Tuesday. The three-fingered footprints, some as long as 18 inches, were

Puglia, said Alfonso Bosellini, a geology professor and the head of the group of

Reducing Kids' Fat Intake OK for Their Brains
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Reducing children's fat intake to prevent heart disease later
in life can start before age 2 without harming their brains, Finnish researchers
say. U.S. guidelines recommend against restricting fat before age 2, largely out
of concern that fat deficiency could impair proper development of children's
rapidly growing brains. The study of 496 Finnish children who were followed from
7 months of age to 5 years ''goes a long way to laying that question to rest,''
said Dr. Gilman Grave, chief of endocrinology, nutrition and growth at the
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

<HEADLINE> Man and teen die in separate Riga crashes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIGA, N.Y. (AP) - Two unrelated accidents have claimed the lives
of a 21-year-old man and a teenage boy.
</P>
<P>
   The man was identified as Erik D. Tangent, 21, of Le Roy in
Genesee County. Monroe County sheriff's deputies have not released
the names of the boys - both 14 - pending notification of their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The teens were riding together on a dirt bike from one property
to another Tuesday. While attempting to cross a blind spot, they
were struck by a passing southbound car, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The operator of the dirt bike was pronounced dead at the scene;
his teen passenger suffered severe leg injuries and was taken to
Strong Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Both boys were students at Churchville-Chili High School and
they broke no laws by riding on the private property. The male car
driver was not charged and was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   Tangent, manager of the Golf Repair Shop at Chili Country Club,
was westbound when he lost control of his car, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   Tangent's vehicle went on the right shoulder of the road; he
then overcompensated, headed to the left, skidded sideways, went
into a ditch and struck a tree. He was pronounced dead at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's Accident Reconstruction Team determined that
Tangent had been traveling at high speed. His body was taken to the
Monroe County Medical Examiner's Office, where an autopsy was to be
performed.

<HEADLINE> 15 Cities Decry Virginia Census Law  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal court is considering whether 15
cities and counties across the country can join a suit against a
Virginia law barring the use of statistically adjusted census data
for political redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   The statute requiring the use of nonsampled numbers went into
effect in April, but Virginia is one of 16 states covered under the
federal Voting Rights Act that must still get approval from the
U.S. Justice Department before changing affected state laws.
</P>
<P>
   The state has asked a three-judge panel of the U.S. District
Court of the District of Columbia to rule that the law does not
violate federal regulations and should not be subject to Justice
approval.
</P>
<P>
   State with laws similar to Virginia's are watching the case,
figuring its outcome will be one step in determining the
constitutionality of sampling. Proponents say sampling presents a
more accurate total of populations undercounted by the 10-year
door-to-door census, typically poor, minority or inner-city
populations that vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Virginia is obligated to move forward with swift, timely
elections for 2001,'' David Botkins, spokesman for Republican
Virginia Attorney General Mark Earley, said Tuesday. ''The census
should be a real count, not statistically adjusted data, which is
nothing more than guesswork.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Even though it's all taking place around Virginia's
redistricting requirement, if that kind of decision came down
(approving the law), it would affect the whole country,'' Jessica
Hines, assistant city attorney for Los Angeles, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles and other cities and counties concerned with the
case all suffered undercounts in the last census in 1990, she said.
They include Richmond, Va.; Houston; Denver; Inglewood, Calif.;
Oakland; San Francisco; San Antonio; Dearborn, Mich.; and Dade
County, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Census figures are used to reapportion billions of federal
dollars among the states. The Constitution also calls for census
data to be used every 10 years to reapportion the 435 House seats
among states, and to redraw political district lines within states.
</P>
<P>
   ''The efforts to keep that law from being utilized are very
critical to Richmond,'' the city's Democratic mayor, Timothy Kaine,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more like if there's a way we can undercount Democrats,
let's do it,'' Kaine said about his state's law.
</P>
<P>
   Raw census data is due to be released by Dec. 31; sampled
numbers by April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court last year said that reapportionment must be
based solely on raw population totals. It left open to states the
option of using either set of numbers for redistricting,
heightening the importance of statehouse elections in the years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's important is that everybody be counted and the most
accurate, responsible way to do that is through an actual head
count,'' Botkins said.

<HEADLINE> NIH To Consider Stem Cell Research  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is releasing
guidelines Wednesday that will allow scientists to conduct
federally funded research on fertilized human eggs -- work opposed
by anti-abortion groups.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines set out the criteria that the National Institutes
of Health will use to consider applications for federal grants to
study embryonic stem cells, according to an advocate of the
research who was briefed on the standards and the schedule for
issuing them.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe the cells could be invaluable in treating many
serious diseases, such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. But some oppose
the research on grounds that to get the cells, scientists must
destroy human embryos -- fertilized eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The research involves what are called pluripotent stem cells,
the foundation cells that give rise to all of the other cells,
tissues and organs in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe it may be possible to use these cells to grow
new organs to replace ailing hearts, treat brain disorders, to
restore severed nerves in spinal injuries, and perhaps even cure
diabetes by growing new insulin-producing cells.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines, federal research may be conducted only on
cells taken from frozen embryos from fertility clinics -- already
destined to be discarded. Also, federal funds could not be used to
destroy the embryos to obtain the cells -- privately funded
researchers will have to pass them on to federally supported
scientists. Opponents criticize this separation as meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   They outlaw payments to embryo donors and keep donors from
specifying who should receive their embryo's stem cells. These
provisions aim to discourage a market for stem cells and block a
woman from creating embryos just to provide treatment for a sick
relative.
</P>
<P>
   The advocate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday
evening that the rules would more strenuously ensure that donors
understand that their embryos will not survive the extraction
process and that the stem cells could be transplanted into
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Patient support groups applauded the new rules, which were first
reported in Wednesday editions of The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Perry, chairman of the Patients' Coalition for Urgent
Research, told The Associated Press that the federal rules are the
safest way to have to conduct research, ''rather than being driven
solely by commercial interests outside of public purview.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents threatened to stop the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that they by law should be allowed to do this,''
Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking about dismembering a living being, according to
our interpretation,'' said Dickey, who has introduced legislation
banning the destruction of human embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists dispute his interpretation, saying the retrieval is
conducted when an embryo is only a week old, and is still a
microscopic ball of identical cells.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, applications for research would have to
pass a committee of scientists and ethicists before being forwarded
to an NIH scientific review committee, said the advocate.
</P>
<P>
   That review committee is scheduled to have its next meeting in
January, so the first awards would not be awarded until late in
2001, at the earliest -- assuming that Congress or the next
administration does not interfere.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said that there's bipartisan support for pursuing the
benefits of the research, while addressing the legal, ethical and
moral issues, as he said the rules cover.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best way to do that is to have the federal government get
behind an advance such as the culturing of human stem cells and to
allow the broadest number of scientists to participate and
furthering the insight,'' he said. ''It would be bad public policy
to wall off by congressional action any avenue that science might
find cure the patient's needs.''

<HEADLINE> Survivor: The Secret That Survived  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Thanks, ''Survivor.'' It's been real!
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not quite real life. But real involving. Real amusing. And
real tantalizing each week for viewers trying to predict who gets
tossed off that tropical island.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, CBS' adventure-game mystery gives up its
greatest secret: the identity of the lone remaining
million-dollars-richer survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've sort of been chuckling,'' CBS president Leslie Moonves
said with satisfaction, and perhaps relief, that the secret has
remained intact. ''Obviously, there were people running around
trying to figure it out, and some of the Internet break-ins made us
feel uneasy.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest threat, he said, came early on, when a tabloid
publication pursued ''Survivor'' staffers offering them money to
tell all.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that there were no traitors was remarkable,'' Moonves
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even more remarkable was the fact that information-crazy
Americans endorsed information restraint. Since ''Survivor''
premiered on May 31, it has raised the question: In the information
age, are secrets possible? Evidently so -- at least, when the public
decides that secrecy can serve its needs.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 p.m. Eastern, the ''Survivor'' grand finale rallies the
last four castaways from the original tribe of 16: devious
corporate trainer Richard Hatch, 39, of Newport, R.I.; wishy-washy
Kelly Wiglesworth, 23, the river guide from Las Vegas; grumpy Rudy
Boesch, 72, the retired Navy SEAL from Virginia Beach, Va., and
rock-ribbed trucker Susan Hawk, 38, of Palmyra, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   They will be winnowed down to three, then to two -- from whom the
champion will be picked by a jury of seven ex-castaways.
</P>
<P>
   Although the whole thing was actually settled four months ago,
the winner's identity has remained a well-kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there haven't been lapses in security. For instance,
several hours before Episode 8 aired, CBS' ''Survivor'' Web site
prematurely posted -- oops! -- that fancy-free journeyman Greg Buis
was voted off the island on that evening's broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' viewers with too much time on their hands spent the
summer in search of more elusive tip-offs, scrutinizing
''Survivor'' tapes like assassination theorists poring over the
Zapruder film.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder. You really could find telling clues if you looked
hard enough. You could even find a bombshell revelation:
</P>
<P>
   From a closeup of Sue inadvertently edited into a past episode,
you could catch in her eyes the reflection of Rich saying something
to Rudy and Kelly, just moments after what is clearly the final
vote. Through laborious, frame-by-frame analysis, you could read
Rich's lips. You could tell that he was saying, ''Wow! I can't
believe the winner of the million bucks is -- ''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he was sneezing. You can figure it out for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Protonesis claims to have figured it out last month. The
Atlanta-based security company did computer analysis on each
contestant's voice. With the tone of his voice, Protonesis claimed,
Rudy unwittingly exposed himself as the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves doesn't sound worried by the guessing games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I loved the people who were so certain Gervase was it,'' he
said, referring to the bum steer CBS planted in its Web site,
hinting that youth basketball coach Gervase Peterson would go all
the way. In fact, he was gone after the Aug. 2 broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, what the audience at large seems to understand is
that, with ''Survivor,'' the build-up is everything. Finding out
who wins is like the moment after fireworks: Such knowledge, once
attained, will be as worthless as a puff of smoke. The winner of
''Survivor'' gets a million bucks. The audience's payoff is the
summer-long diversion. Not a penny more.
</P>
<P>
   Moonves likened ''Survivor'' to moviegoers' code of silence
after seeing ''The Crying Game'' with its shock ending. ''They knew
how people who hadn't seen it yet would feel: Don't tell me what
you know, because it will ruin my surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there's still one opportunity for viewers to jump the
gun, to undercut their surprise with premature intelligence.
Viewers, that is, in the Mountain and Pacific time zones.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. Pacific time, can fans in Los Angeles resist the urge
to phone a chum in Manhattan for the scoop?
</P>
<P>
   Can antsy viewers in the West withstand the temptation to log on
to the Web, which will swarm with spoilers once ''Survivor'' airs
in the East?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they can! On Wednesday night, wherever you live, log
off your computer and unplug the phone. That's your reward
challenge. The tribe has spoken. Months ago.

   REAL SURVIVORS: The impetus for ''Survivor'' is the oldest of
all adventure races, the Raid Gauloises. ''Survivor'' creator and
executive producer Mark Burnett is a three-time Raid veteran whose
participation in these races led him to create Eco-Challenge and,
after that, the hit CBS series. This year's Raid competition is
covered in a two-hour special airing on Outdoor Life Network that
tracks 69 teams bold enough to challenge a 500-mile course through
the rugged, mountainous terrain of the Himalayas. Even bolder: The
telecast goes head-to-head with ''Survivor,'' from 8 to 10 p.m.
Eastern.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Mad About Mambo'  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   A movie called ''Mad about Mambo,'' centered in Belfast,
Northern Ireland?
</P>
<P>
   Sounds weird, but this Irish import proves to be a delight, a
romantic comedy about dance and soccer and lots of other things. It
could be a sleeper of ''The Full Monty'' caliber.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Mitchell (William Ash), an 18-year-old in working-class
West Belfast, plays soccer for a Catholic high school. He dreams of
playing professionally for the Belfast United team, but his skills
aren't quite equal to the task. Besides, United is all-Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   When United hires a Brazilian star (and a Catholic), Danny
figures to copy the Brazilian's technique of employing Latin dance
rhythms in his game. The boy enrolls in a dance studio where he
sees Lucy McLoughlin (Keri Russell of TV's ''Felicity''), a beauty
from the right side of the tracks. She has her own ambition: to win
the Latin Dance Finals and prove to her rich, domineering father
(Brian Cox) that she can achieve something on her own.
</P>
<P>
   As in so many movies, Lucy starts out loathing Danny, especially
when he disables her dance partner in a soccer match. Desperate,
she agrees to pair with Danny. And of course, as they sway to the
insinuating rhythms, romance ensues.
</P>
<P>
   With Hollywood having virtually abandoned the musical, other
countries have filled the gap: ''Strictly Ballroom'' from
Australia, ''Shall We Dance'' from Japan, and now ''Mad About
Mambo'' from Northern Ireland. (Coincidentally, all three are
centered in dance schools.)
</P>
<P>
   The duets of Ash and Russell are as seductive as Latin dances
can be. They can even be sensual while dancing in their underwear
waist-deep in a swimming pool. Now that's something Fred and Ginger
never tried.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland's John Forte displays a delicate touch in his
screenwriting-directing debut.
</P>
<P>
   Except for an English roadblock and a few sly remarks, the
Troubles scarcely figure in the movie. Forte can poke harmless fun
at both Protestants and Catholics (the priest-headmaster of the
boys' school scorns soccer as ''a British imperialist sport'').
</P>
<P>
   The cast is impeccable. Ash, from England, captures all the
ambition and angst of a teen-ager on the brink of manhood. Russell,
the only American in the cast, shows she can act. And Cox, who
played Hermann Goering in TNT's recent ''Nuremberg,'' commands the
screen as a bombastic car dealer with a soft spot for his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The USA Films release was produced by David P. Kelly. Rated
PG-13 for mild swearing. Running time: 92 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Game Show Model's Case Is Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge says there's insufficient evidence to
prove discrimination claims by a former ''Price is Right'' model
who sued Bob Barker and the show's producers.
</P>
<P>
   Barker sued Holly Hallstrom after she left the show in 1995,
denying claims she made to the media that she was fired because she
had gained too much weight. His lawsuit is scheduled for trial
Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Hallstrom filed a countersuit, claiming she was fired
unjustly after 19 years on TV's longest-running game show.
</P>
<P>
   ''After full consideration of the evidence ... the court finds
there is no triable issue of material fact in this action,''
Superior Court Judge Paul Gutman ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled the added weight had not caused Hallstrom to be
''substantially impaired in any major life function or activity.''
Gutman dismissed Hallstrom's age and sex discrimination claims,
saying the show employed a model 10 years older than her and noting
all the show's models are women.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am delighted,'' Barker said in a statement, adding both he
and the show's producers felt vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom's lawyer, Nick Alden, said they were disappointed by
the ruling.

duties -- the most since 1994 when seven military task forces
totaling 3,500 soldiers were used.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a battalion of about 560 soldiers from the 101st
Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Ky., are scheduled to deploy
for firefighting duty in the Bitterroot National Forest in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Army battalions already are battling wildfires at
Burgdorf, Idaho, and the Upper Nine-Mile Complex near Huson, Mont.
Those battalions are from field artillery and engineering units at
Fort Hood, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 79 fires are burning on 1.4 million acres in
Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah
and Wyoming, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in
Idaho.

<HEADLINE> Damaged Wiring Found in Older Planes  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wiring damage of the type that could have
caused the TWA Flight 800 disaster has been found in other aging
aircraft, federal investigators said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A four-year investigation of the crash of the Boeing 747 New
York-to-Paris flight led to a conclusion that it was caused by an
explosion of vapors in a fuel tank of the 25-year-old plane.
Although a solid body of circumstantial evidence points to an
electrical short as the cause of the explosion, insufficient wire
was recovered to know for sure, said Robert Swaim of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigation led to discovery of damaged wiring in
other older planes, Swaim told a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We looked at other planes from other carriers and other
countries,'' Swaim said. Inspectors found worn insulation, improper
wiring repairs, opened splices that should have been sealed and
lint on circuit breakers.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, he added, wiring had been damaged by chemicals
such as anti-corrision spray and overflow from lavatories.
</P>
<P>
   Wiring checks in 25 airlines -- some old, some new -- found that
''all had some kind of foreign material except for one new 737,''
Swaim said.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said the longer a plane files, the more
changes and modifications it needs. He said he is not sure the
industry is paying enough attention to that issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Bernard Loeb, aviation safety director for NTSB, cautioned
that investigators are ''not saying the problem has reached the
level of planes being unsafe. ''We found problems and they need to
be addressed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the TWA crash, Swaim said, the Federal Aviation
Administration has formed a task force to develop improved
maintenance procedures for aging aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Swaim's conclusion that a fuel-tank explosion destroyed TWA
Flight 800, killing all 230 people abroad off Long Island, N.Y.,
was announced at the first day of the hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He spent four years looking for the source of ignition of the
explosion. ''I would love to walk in here with a molten piece of
wire and say, ''Here it is,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of possible causes of the explosion were considered,
including problems with the main landing gear, static electricity,
a small explosive charge, a missile and a meteorite strike, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators zeroed in on the short circuit because of a
combination of factors which, taken together, were telling. A crew
member was recorded on the cockpit voice recorder remarking on the
fuel flow indicator swaying crazily shortly before the crash. A
buzz on the cockpit voice recorder went silent in the moments
before the crash. Additionally, there had been recent problems with
lights on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   While wiring inside the fuel tank is very low voltage those
wires are bundled together with higher voltage wires and a short
could have been carried into the fuel tank, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Air and fuel had been heated by an air conditioner positioned
underneath the tank while the plane was delayed for three hours
prior to takeoff. That helped to make the tank volatile when it
climbed in altitude, NTSB investigator Joseph Kolly said.
</P>
<P>
   Given those conditions, a spark as weak as the static
electricity transferred between a person's hand a metal doorknob
would have been sufficient for an explosion, Kolly said.
</P>
<P>
   TWA Flight 800 went down shortly after leaving New York's John
F. Kennedy Airport on July 17, 1996, bound for Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The crash has spawned a host of conspiracy theories, the most
prevalent being that a bomb or a missile brought down the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Some still contend the government is trying to cover up the real
cause, and one group, calling itself the TWA 800 Eyewitness
Alliance, ran a full-page ad in Tuesday's Washington Times
insisting missiles were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Hall on Tuesday chastised those who continue to push those
theories. The FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and
his investigators all failed to find evidence of a bomb or missile
blast, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Loeb said that bomb and missile blasts leave distinct patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ''High-energy explosions leave distinctive damage signatures
such as severe pitting, cratering, hot gas washing, and petaling.
No such damage was found on any portion of the recovered airplane
structure,'' Loeb said.
</P>
<P>
   The physical evidence ''leads to the inescapable conclusion that
the cause of the in-flight breakup of TWA Flight 800 was a fuel-air
explosion inside the center wing tank,'' Loeb said.
</P>
<P>
   John Seaman of Albany, N. Y., who lost his 19-year-old niece
Michelle Becker of St. Petersburg, Fla., was at the hearing in
Washington, along with more than 75 relatives of victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''This speculation still that this was a missile is making all
of us crazy,'' Seaman said. ''It makes us feel like there is
someone walking around today laughing about the death of our loved
ones. If all they can come up with is a probable cause then that is
all that can be done.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 12; Nasdaq Drops 22  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell in early trading today as investors
took some profits following two days of gains that preceded the
Federal Reserve Board's decision to leave interest rates stable.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 11.72 at 11,127.43, after falling by more than 50
points earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 1.30 at 1,496.83, and
the Nasdaq composite index fell 21.57 to 3,936.64.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw some very normal profit taking early in the session. It
was simply investors responding to the Fed's decision not to raise
interest rates,'' said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysts
at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman noted also that the Dow index had risen 640 points in
the past two and a half weeks in anticipation of the Fed's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had predicted for weeks that the Fed would leave
interest rates alone Tuesday, and traders responded to that
forecast with optimism, buying stocks in the sessions leading up to
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Economic indicators have signaled for several months that the
Fed's 14-month policy of raising interest rates to cool the economy
and ease inflationary pressures has been successful.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 264.62 million
shares, up slightly from Tuesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 2.36 at 515.10.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Touts Stem Cell Study Rules  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Wednesday touted new
federal guidelines allowing scientists to conduct federally funded
research on human embryos, saying they offer ''potentially
staggering benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines for the research are vehemently opposed by
anti-abortion groups. They set out the criteria the National
Institutes of Health will use to consider applications for federal
grants to study embryonic stem cells, according to an advocate who
was briefed on the standards and the schedule for issuing them.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe the cells could be invaluable in treating many
serious diseases, such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. But some oppose
the research on grounds that to get the cells, scientists must
destroy human embryos.
</P>
<P>
   At an impromtu news conference, Clinton acknowledged the
controversy surrounding this new scientific initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But he said: ''I think that if the public will look at first of
all the potentially staggering benefits of this research,
everything from birth defects to Parkinson's, certain kinds of
cancer, diabetis, spinal cord injuries ... it's a potential change
for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the prospect for helping Americans and people around the
world ''is breathtaking. These guidelines are not put out without a
rigorous scientific research.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said it would deal only ''with those embryos that
are collected in in-vitro fertilization.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we cannot walk away from the potential to save lives
and improve lives,'' he said, ''to help people get up and walk ...
as long as we meet rigorous ethical standards, and I am convinced
and (Health and Human Services) Secretary (Donna) Shalala is
convinced that has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   The research involves what are called pluripotent stem cells,
the foundation cells that give rise to all of the other cells,
tissues and organs in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe it may be possible to use these cells to grow
new organs to replace ailing hearts, treat brain disorders, to
restore severed nerves in spinal injuries, and perhaps even cure
diabetes by growing new insulin-producing cells.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines, federal research may be conducted only on
cells taken from frozen embryos from fertility clinics -- already
destined to be discarded. Also, federal funds could not be used to
destroy the embryos to obtain the cells -- privately funded
researchers will have to pass them on to federally supported
scientists. Opponents criticize this separation as meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   They outlaw payments to embryo donors and keep donors from
specifying who should receive their embryo's stem cells. These
provisions aim to discourage a market for stem cells and block a
woman from creating embryos just to provide treatment for a sick
relative.
</P>
<P>
   The advocate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday
evening that the rules would more strenuously ensure that donors
understand that their embryos will not survive the extraction
process and that the stem cells could be transplanted into
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Patient support groups applauded the new rules, which were first
reported in Wednesday editions of The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Perry, chairman of the Patients' Coalition for Urgent
Research, told The Associated Press that the federal rules are the
safest way to have to conduct research, ''rather than being driven
solely by commercial interests outside of public purview.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents threatened to stop the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that they by law should be allowed to do this,''
Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking about dismembering a living being, according to
our interpretation,'' said Dickey, who has introduced legislation
banning the destruction of human embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists dispute his interpretation, saying the retrieval is
conducted when an embryo is only a week old, and is still a
microscopic ball of identical cells.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, applications for research would have to
pass a committee of scientists and ethicists before being forwarded
to an NIH scientific review committee, said the advocate.
</P>
<P>
   That review committee is scheduled to have its next meeting in
January, so the first awards would not be awarded until late in
2001, at the earliest -- assuming that Congress or the next
administration does not interfere.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said that there's bipartisan support for pursuing the
benefits of the research, while addressing the legal, ethical and
moral issues, as he said the rules cover.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best way to do that is to have the federal government get
behind an advance such as the culturing of human stem cells and to
allow the broadest number of scientists to participate and
furthering the insight,'' he said. ''It would be bad public policy
to wall off by congressional action any avenue that science might
find cure the patient's needs.''

   ''The Complete Hot Five and Hot Seven Recordings'' (Columbia
Legacy) -- Louis Armstrong
</P>
<P>
   This beautifully packaged four-disc box set is about as vital a
document in the history of jazz as there is. Louis Armstrong was a
jazz revolutionary in the late 1920s, when these 89 songs were
recorded. He helped move jazz away from New Orleans-style ensemble
playing toward an emphasis on soloists, established the trumpet as
a solo instrument and introduced scat singing. Modern jazz soloists
and singers all owe him a debt.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's groundbreaking work with his Hot Five and Hot Seven
have never before been available in one package. The sound has been
cleaned up, the notes and essays are excellent and informative, and
the booklet is rich with photos of Armstrong and old New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, though, these songs are a joy to listen to.
''Weather Bird,'' a duet with Earl Hines, is as full of life today
as when it was recorded in 1928. Other songs remain classics, as
well -- ''Potato Head Blues,'' ''Cornet Chop Suey'' and ''West End
Blues'' among them. Much has been written about Armstrong this
year, the centennial of his birth. Anyone who only remembers him as
the popular entertainer he was at the end of his career would do
well to invest in this collection

   ''Shake Hands With Shorty (Tone-Cool Records) -- North
Mississippi Allstars
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, it makes perfect sense for three kids from the
hill country of Mississippi to be playing the music of native sons
such as R.L. Burnside or Fred McDowell. In an earlier time, that's
all they would have heard. But in an era when music from every
corner of the globe is a click away and everyone can imitate
anyone, you'd better have some chops to show for the temerity to do
the rawest of blues.
</P>
<P>
   Brothers Cody and Luther Dickinson (sons of producer/player Jim
Dickinson) and their buddy Chris Chew more than do justice to the
boogie style. They filter it through 40 years of rock 'n' roll. You
can hear Luther Dickinson, a hellish slide player himself, paying
tribute to the Allman Brothers on guitar solos throughout the disc.
Comparisons to early jam bands, such as Cream, are merited -- a
guitar, a bass, drums and a groove.
</P>
<P>
   Their vocals mainly kill time in the groove until the next solo
but add to the overall effort in a way that says this is music from
the soul.

<HEADLINE> E Street Band? Or E Street Banned?  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It was the last night of Bruce Springsteen's
triumphant world tour -- 16 sold-out months on the road with the
reunited E Street Band. The Boss and his sidekicks, teary-eyed,
held hands as the Madison Square Garden crowd screamed wildly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll be seeing you!'' Springsteen proclaimed after playing
their last song -- quite appropriately, ''Blood Brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   But when?
</P>
<P>
   Where?
</P>
<P>
   How?
</P>
<P>
   On a live album? A new studio album? A DVD of the Garden shows?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? When it comes to Springsteen, who ever knows?
</P>
<P>
   ''Springsteen is certainly known for taking his time, changing
his mind frequently while he's at it, and often doing the last
thing you'd expect,'' says editor Chris Phillips of Backstreets
Magazine, which chronicles all things Springsteen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judging by all the song debuts toward the end of the tour,
he's certainly got some great material.''
</P>
<P>
   That material includes ''American Skin (41 Shots),'' the Amadou
Diallo-inspired song that prompted the silliest Springsteen
controversy since Ronald Reagan interpreted ''Born in the USA'' as
a paean to patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   There were other new songs, too: the nightly show-closer ''Land
of Hope and Dreams,'' and three rockers -- ''Further On Up the
Road,'' ''Code Of Silence'' and ''Another Thin Line.''
</P>
<P>
   Five songs, for most artists, is the start of a new album. For
Springsteen, it could become the start of ''Tracks II'' -- a
follow-up to the boxed sets of rarities and unreleased gems that he
put out (to critical acclaim) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen, through his publicist, has said nothing about
what's next. The lone hint about the future emanating from the
notoriously tight-lipped Springsteen camp came courtesy of Little
Steven Van Zandt, who took questions from fans on his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 1: Would you like to see the E Street Band become a
recording act again?
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes,'' Van Zandt replied.
</P>
<P>
   Question No. 2: What are the chances of that happening?
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd take the odds,'' said Van Zandt.
</P>
<P>
   There were no more queries fielded about the subject, no more
clues offered. But given Springsteen's track record in the '90s,
anything seems possible.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking up the E Street Band in 1988, Springsteen
disappeared until releasing two albums simultaneously in 1992 --
''Human Touch'' and ''Lucky Town.''
</P>
<P>
   He then launched a tour with a new band, leaving fans to lament
the absence of the E Streeters. He dabbled in hip-hop music (the
result was ''Streets of Philadelphia''), and began writing music
strictly on his bass.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen returned in 1995 -- but as a solo act, touring small
theaters in support of his mostly-acoustic ''Ghost of Tom Joad''
album.
</P>
<P>
   The acclaimed tour featured Springsteen channeling the spirits
of John Steinbeck and Woody Guthrie: He occasionally read an
excerpt from ''The Grapes of Wrath,'' and performed Guthrie's
''Plane Wreck at Los Gatos (Deportee).''
</P>
<P>
   Mixed in was a brief reunion with the E Streeters to record four
songs included on a greatest hits package, followed by the
''Tracks'' collection. Fans were left wondering if Springsteen and
the band would ever get together for a larger-scale project.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce &AMP; Co. emphatically answered the question with their tour
of Europe and North America, selling out virtually every stop.
</P>
<P>
   The North American leg of the tour began with an unprecedented
15 shows at the Meadowlands in New Jersey, and closed with 10
sold-out nights in Madison Square Garden. On July 1, after playing
the tour-closing set, Springsteen delivered his cryptic comment
about the future.
</P>
<P>
   During the Garden shows, director Jonathan Demme -- a Springsteen
pal -- reportedly filmed some shows for possible release.
Springsteen, obviously aware of the filming, uncharacteristically
asked the audience to keep the noise down during the slow songs.
</P>
<P>
   But getting the band back together again is not as simple as it
was in the days when everybody was a Jersey guy.
</P>
<P>
   Drummer Max Weinberg has a regular job as band leader for Conan
O'Brien, while bassist Garry Tallent is a respected Nashville
record producer. Guitarist Van Zandt has become an actor on the hit
HBO series ''The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   Guitarist Nils Lofgren and sax man Clarence Clemons have solo
careers. And there are wives and kids and commitments that once
were not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who knows?'' asked Backstreets' Phillips. ''It's a wait and
see game at this point, and we're taking everything we hear with a
grain of salt.''

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Music Row  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The first time George Strait heard the
song ''Murder on Music Row,'' he wasn't supposed to take it
seriously. MCA Records head Tony Brown played it for the star as an
amusing curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Strait took it seriously. He recorded the song -- which is about
Nashville losing touch with its musical roots -- as a duet with Alan
Jackson and put it on a hits album. It climbed the country charts
to No. 37 with no promotion, or even an official release as a
single.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the country music industry -- the very industry the song
criticizes -- has given ''Murder on Music Row'' two nominations for
its prestigious Country Music Association Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the kind of tune that makes an impact,'' Brown said. ''It
was a cool event, and we had no idea that people would think it was
industry-bashing.''
</P>
<P>
   But songwriters Larry Cordle and Larry Shell said their message
was clear. Sitting in Shell's office a block from the skyscrapers
of Music Row, the duo shouted with evangelical fever.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want our country music back, man!'' Shell said. ''There
always comes a time in your life when you have to stand up for
something or not be counted. We want to be counted that we are
trying to stand up for country music with this song.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair believes such artists as Shania Twain, Faith Hill and
Lonestar have threatened traditional country music with crossover
hits that are pulling Nashville away from some of its musical and
lyrical signposts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of divorce and drinking songs with steel guitars and
fiddles, many Nashville artists now strive to reach younger
listeners with pop songs about first love.
</P>
<P>
   From ''Murder on Music Row'': ''The almighty dollar, and the
lust for worldwide fame/Slowly killed tradition and for that
someone should hang/Oh they all say not guilty but the evidence
will show/That murder's been committed down on Music Row.''
</P>
<P>
   The version by Strait and Jackson is nominated by the CMA for
best vocal collaboration, and Cordle and Shell are nominated for
best song. The winners will be revealed Oct. 4 at the Grand Ole
Opry House, broadcast live by CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should be song of the year, there's no doubt about that,''
said Ricky Skaggs, a traditional artist who has abandoned
mainstream country and gone back to bluegrass.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think it's almost like a mirror that Nashville ought to
hold up and look at itself. That is exactly what's happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Shell and Cordle credit the nominations to CMA's secret
balloting process.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one knows you're voting for the song,'' Shell said. ''So
consequently, you can't be chastised for your vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The duo acknowledges that things aren't quite as dire as the
song indicates.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional artists Brad Paisley and Lee Ann Womack are having
success, Jackson and Strait soldier on, and the Dixie Chicks have
brought banjo back to mainstream country.
</P>
<P>
   Shell came up with the title ''Murder on Music Row'' and took
the idea to Cordle. They finished the song together.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it'd make a great album title,'' Cordle said.
</P>
<P>
   So it became the title track of the latest bluegrass album by
Cordle and Lonesome Standard, complete with album cover art showing
a steel guitar being loaded into a hearse.
</P>

   ''The main thing (Nashville producers) want from songs today is
'I love you and you love me 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365

out last night with another woman, not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''So the thing is, that hasn't changed, and it's not going to.
It hasn't changed since the beginning of time. I can still write
about it, and guess what? There's a guy or woman out there that can
relate to it, if I write it right.''

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Ozzy Osbourne  </HEADLINE>
By GERARD O'LEARY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Heavy metal vocalist Ozzy Osbourne is dressed in
a blue pinstriped suit with his eyes ghoulishly covered in black
mascara. It's a look that crosses business with shock rock.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I want to wear a pinstriped suit, I wear one. Nobody tells
me how to dress,'' the 51-year-old singer said. ''When someone
tells me I can't do something, that just gives me the drive to want
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Osbourne was one of the original members of Black Sabbath.
During the early '70s, the band's exploits became synonymous with
the hard-rock lifestyle of all-night parties, groupies and
exhausting tour schedules. He left in 1978 to form his own band.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most notorious stunts was biting off a bat's head
during a 1982 concert in Des Moines, Iowa. It wasn't planned.
Osbourne thought it was a rubber toy a fan had tossed onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter what achievements I make in my career, I will always
be known as the guy who bit the bat's head off,'' he says. ''Even
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame considers my career a joke because
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Osbourne launched Ozzfest, heavy metal's answer to
Lollapalooza. The bands on this year's tour include Pantera,
Godsmack, Static-X, Incubus, Methods of Mayhem and P.O.D.
</P>
<P>
   What they play is not necessarily music to Osbourne's ears.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing wrong with the stuff they play, but I could
never sing like that,'' said Osbourne, referring to the singers'
growling tones. ''I like some melody in my music.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozzfest's final date is Sept. 2 in San Bernadino, Calif. The
questions below came from an interview with Osbourne:
</P>
<P>
   1. How have you maintained your success?
</P>
<P>
   Osbourne: I can't explain it, I'm not the greatest singer in the
world. ... The fans have always supported me all these years. If it
wasn't for them, I wouldn't have a career.
</P>
<P>
   2. You look much healthier now than you did years ago. What's
the secret?
</P>
<P>
   Osbourne: I don't drink or do drugs anymore. I used to drink a
couple of bottles of Dom Perignon, lines of coke and bags of pot,
then fall down the steps of the tour bus when I arrived in the next
town. I just got tired of waking up in my own urine or with a cold
pizza stuck to my face. ... I'm not perfect, you know. I have a
glass of wine once in a while or a joint to relax. ... If you
walked in my shoes, you would be doing smack.
</P>
<P>
   3. How would you describe Ozzfest?
</P>
<P>
   Osbourne: Ozzfest is the alternative to alternative music. It's
where heavy bands can get recognition. It's the meat and potatoes
of all package tours. I try to put together a show that's
entertaining to the kids. They work hard to save for the tickets,
and I want to give them the best performance I can.
</P>
<P>
   4. In 1998, you reunited with your former Black Sabbath
bandmates at Ozzfest to do a set with them in addition to your own
band. This year, it's just you and your band. How do you feel?
</P>
<P>
   Osbourne: I'm getting too old to sing and run around the stage
for 3&AMP;frac12; hours a night with two different bands. Now, I'm just
playing with my band every other night to give my body and voice a
rest.
</P>
<P>
   5. How are your kids?
</P>
<P>
   Osbourne: Being a parent to teen-age girls is a life-changing
experience in itself, but my kids know I'm still out of my mind.

<HEADLINE> Garrett Book To Set Record Straight  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- His name wasn't really Billy, and he
wasn't ''The Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't seek vengeance for his fallen mentor, and he wasn't a
champion of the downtrodden during one of New Mexico's bloodiest
conflicts, the Lincoln County War (1878-1881).
</P>
<P>
   Much of what people hear about Billy the Kid is wrong. And, says
British writer Frederick Nolan, much of that bad information can be
traced back to one source -- a book published the year after Billy
was killed. It was partly authored by the man who shot him, Sheriff
Pat Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pat F. Garrett's The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid'' has
been reissued in an annotated format by the University of Oklahoma
Press. It is now two books in one -- schismatic, self-lacerating,
funny, thanks to Nolan, who has been tracking Billy the Kid, or
BTK, almost 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the page is the original rambling, flowery yarn
mostly ghostwritten for Garrett in 1882 by former Roswell
postmaster Marshall Ashmun ''Ash'' Upson. Reminiscent of a W.C.
Fields narrative style, it intersperses ill-fitting quotes from
Tennyson, Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott in a Wild West literary
butchery worthy of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Right beside it on the other half of the page are the austere,
biting corrections of the exasperated Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, I don't think Garrett's book is a worthwhile document
at all,'' Nolan said in an interview from his home in Chalfont St.
Giles, between London and Oxford, England. Garrett's version of
Billy's death ''may have been the biggest lie of all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't just read Nolan's half of the book; both halves
are needed to make sense of nonsense. It's a fine kettle of pickles
he's gotten himself in.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan's BTK journey began in the 1950s scouring the London phone
book for people named Tunstall, who might be related to the young
Englishman whose murder started it all. Since then, Nolan has
written several books about the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   John Henry Tunstall, who had overseen his father's business in
British Columbia, headed south seeking new opportunities around
1876. In Lincoln County, which then nearly filled the southeastern
quadrant of New Mexico Territory, Tunstall found a vulnerable
monopoly supplying beef to the Mescalero Apaches and offered what
he thought would be healthy competition.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Tunstall, with BTK among his employees, was up against the Santa
Fe Ring, which ran the territorial government. The ring was headed
by U.S. Attorney Thomas B. Catron, an investor in the monopoly.
After it became clear that legal machinations wouldn't shut him
down, Tunstall was shot in 1878.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Tunstalls Nolan found listed in London in 1955 was
Tunstall's sister, Mabel, then in her mid-80s, who had her
brother's documents, diaries and voluminous correspondence.
Tunstall had sent home dozens of pages every week.
</P>
<P>
   In all that, Nolan says, ''not one mention of our Bill; no, not
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The scraggly lad -- born Henry McCarty, later called Henry
Antrim, then Billy Bonney -- has been romanticized beyond all
recognition. Garrett shooting him certainly did not hurt BTK's
image, either.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan has a theory about how Garrett knew where to find and kill
BTK on July 14, 1881, in Fort Sumner.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Maxwell, scion of the vast Maxwell Land Grant dynasty and
brother-protector of Paulita Maxwell, did not want his 17-year-old
sister eloping to Mexico with Billy, Nolan suggests.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole relationship was utterly unacceptable, and Maxwell
determined a way to ensure that it did not continue. He sent a
messenger to Garrett telling him where the Kid was,'' Nolan says in
his introduction.
</P>
<P>
   The fugitive BTK had killed two Garrett deputies three months
earlier escaping from the Lincoln lockup.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan identifies myths traceable to or perpetuated by the
Upson-Garrett collaboration, including:
</P>
<P>
   --The name Billy the Kid. ''Billy'' was an alias, and BTK
objected to being called ''the Kid,'' as though he were the only
one.
</P>
<P>
   --Early killings. Nolan suggests several killings reported by
Upson are fiction, filling blank spots in BTK's life.
</P>
<P>
   --Mentor loyalty. Tunstall was 24 when he died, not the graying
father figure often portrayed. A likelier motive for BTK's violence
was the loss of income Tunstall's death would mean for him.
</P>
<P>
   --BTK's supposed leadership of the gunslinging ''Regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   --Birth. Billy was given Upson's own birthday, Nov. 23, and an
arbitrary birthplace, New York, for which there was no
documentation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Little could he (Upson) have realized how firmly these myths
would fix themselves in the public consciousness,'' Nolan writes.
</P>
<P>
   All those books and movies. All those actors who played Billy --
Johnny Mack Brown, Paul Newman, Kris Kristofferson, Peter Deuel,
Emilio Estevez, Val Kilmer ...
</P>
<P>
   While Upson wrote most of the book, Garrett dictated the calmer
final chapters and commented on criticism against him for shooting
Billy in Maxwell's darkened bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is said that Garrett did not give the Kid a fair show,''
Garrett wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The book, he hoped, would improve his image and yield some of
the bounty that other writers enjoyed from BTK dime novels. But the
abuse only intensified, Nolan says.
</P>
<P>
   Loren D. Estleman, whose novel, ''Journey of the Dead,'' deals
with the post-BTK haunting of Pat Garrett, says there was a real
effort to elevate Billy to mythological status.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's everything to be celebrated about an attempt to set
the record straight,'' Estleman says of Nolan's effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln County War was a small-time business dispute that
got out of hand because of ethno-political bigotry,
still-smoldering Civil War hatreds, macho vanity, greed and liquor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Lincoln County War proved nothing and established
nothing,'' Nolan says. ''Practically everyone who shouldered arms
ended up either dead or dead broke.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did light a path toward better law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   When the war started in 1878, Nolan says, ''Lincoln County was
as big as Ireland, and it had one sheriff (William Brady), and he
was a drunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they cut Lincoln County into several smaller counties, it
began ''to make social sense and become civilized,'' he says.

<HEADLINE> Growing Up Black in Nazi Germany  </HEADLINE>
By F.N. D'ALESSIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- In 1933, when he was a second-grader in his
native Hamburg, Hans J. Massaquoi wanted to show what a good German
he was, so he cajoled his baby sitter into sewing a swastika onto
his sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Massaquoi's mother spotted the Nazi emblem that evening and
promptly snipped it off, but a teacher had already taken a school
yard snapshot of the boy wearing the badge. The other children in
the picture are typical fair-haired north Germans, but young Hans --
the only child with a swastika -- is dark-skinned and has kinky
hair.
</P>
<P>
   The startling photo appears on the dust jacket of Massaquoi's
autobiography, ''Destined to Witness: Growing Up Black in Nazi
Germany,'' published in the United States by William Morrow &AMP;
Company Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Massaquoi, now 74, retired three years ago after more than 30
years as managing editor of Chicago-based Ebony magazine, a post
that gave him access to statesmen, leaders of the Civil Rights
movement and the stars of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   But in writing his autobiography, Massaquoi chose not to deal
with his decades of success in the United States or with the famous
people he has known. He told instead the story of his life as a
young man in the working-class neighborhoods of Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   He credits the late Alex Haley, author of ''Roots,'' with
convincing him of the importance of sharing his experience of being
''both an insider in Nazi Germany and, paradoxically, an endangered
outsider.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I left Germany in 1948, and since then I have met only two
German-born blacks of my generation,'' Massaquoi said in an
interview from his home in New Orleans. ''There weren't many to
begin with, and most probably died in the (concentration) camps.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other black Germans were the children of French and Belgian
colonial troops from Africa who occupied the Rhineland after World
War I. Massaquoi, though, was from a more privileged background --
at least at first. His mother, Bertha, was a German nurse and his
father, who did not marry Bertha, was the playboy son of a former
tribal king who served as Liberia's first consul general in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Massaquoi's earliest years were spent at his grandfather's
villa, where white German servants waited on African dignitaries. A
few days before his fourth birthday, however, his grandfather was
recalled to Liberia in a political shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   The grandfather and father wanted Massaquoi and his mother to
come to Liberia with them, but she refused, saying that Hans, who
had been born prematurely, was too delicate for the African
climate. And so she chose to keep Hans in Hamburg, although it
meant returning to work as a single parent. (Hans' father did not
contribute to his son's support.)
</P>
<P>
   It was 1929, and the district they moved into was the scene of
frequent street brawls between Communists and members of the
emerging Nazi party.
</P>
<P>
   To young Hans, those Nazis were less fearsome than the
occasional sadistic teacher or the neighborhood bullies who
tormented him by chanting ''Neger, Neger, Schornsteinfeger!''
(''Negro, Negro, chimney sweep!'').
</P>
<P>
   That painful taunt provided the title for the German translation
of Massaquoi's book.
</P>
<P>
   ''That title was not my idea,'' Massaquoi said. ''I agonized
over it for quite a while before letting them use it, but it seems
to have caught on. The book is selling very well in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-July, nine months after publication, ''Neger, Neger'' was
still on the best-seller lists in Germany, and Massaquoi said it
was being adapted there for use as a public school text. Movie
plans are also in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had expected some interest there, but this has surpassed all
my expectations,'' he said. ''I think the Germans want to get some
closure about those years.''
</P>
<P>
   For Massaquoi, those years were filled with restrictions,
rejections and even a certain fascination with Nazism --
particularly the Hitler Youth. One of the saddest moments of his
childhood, he writes, was when his homeroom teacher told him he
couldn't join -- and explained why.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, I wanted to join,'' he said. ''I was a kid and most
of my friends were joining. They had cool uniforms and they did
exciting things -- camping, parades, playing drums.''
</P>
<P>
   With adolescence, Massaquoi faced more limitations. He learned
to dance but could only dance in private; he learned to box but was
not allowed to box Aryan opponents. Although he was a good student,
higher education was forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time Massaquoi was in his teens and growing more
aware of the Nazi regime's true nature, Germany was at war.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most harrowing pages in Massaquoi's book tell of the
near-destruction of Hamburg during the Operation Gomorrah bombing
attack in the summer of 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Massaquoi also tells stories of the ''swingboys,'' disaffected
youths like himself who took great risks by playing and dancing to
their own version of American swing music -- something condemned by
the regime as ''Negermusik.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There really wasn't anything political about it,'' he said.
''It was more a manifestation of the normal rebellion of young
people toward regimentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Massaquoi's ''swingboy'' credentials came in handy after
Germany's collapse and the occupation of Hamburg by British troops.
He was able to save his mother and himself from starvation by
playing saxophone in clubs that catered to members of the American
Merchant Marine.
</P>
<P>
   Those sailors included the first American blacks Massaquoi ever
got to know. They schooled him in American ways and gave him access
to the American cigarettes that had become the ''money'' of
defeated Germany.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of cigarette smuggling and music, the
22-year-old Massaquoi was finally able to leave Germany. He first
sailed to join his father's family in Liberia, where he wound up
doing menial jobs in the bush. Later, in 1950, he flew to the
United States to study aviation mechanics in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was an alien on a student visa, Massaquoi was
drafted into the U.S. Army in 1951 and decided not to challenge it.
Volunteering for the elite 82nd Airborne kept him from being sent
to Korea. Instead, he spent his Army years in the still-segregated
South.
</P>
<P>
   The Army led to U.S. citizenship, education and eventually to
Massaquoi's career as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even at its worst, the American version of racism seemed much
more endurable than the Nazism I had already experienced,'' he
said. ''In Germany, I was isolated -- I was the only one.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from Hans J. Massaquoi's memoir, ''Destined to Witness:
Growing Up Black in Nazi Germany'':
</P>
<P>
   ''Nazi racists, unlike their white American counterparts, did
not commit their atrocities anonymously, disguised in white sheets
and under the protection of night. Nor did they operate like some
contemporary American politicians who advance their racist agendas
by dividing black and white Americans with cleverly disguised code
words about 'unfair quotas,' 'reverse discrimination' and 'states'
rights.'''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   (On being barred from joining the Hitler Youth in 1936):
</P>
<P>
   '''But I am a German,' I sobbed, my eyes filling with tears. 'My
mother says I'm German just like anybody else.'
</P>
<P>
   '''You are a German boy,' Herr Schurmann conceded with unusual
compassion, 'but unfortunately not quite like anybody else.'''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   (On his survival)
</P>
<P>
   ''That I, a certified non-Aryan, was spared extermination,
sterilization or medical experimentation in one of Hitler's death
camps I attribute largely to two fortunate coincidences. Unlike
Jews, blacks were so few in numbers that they were relegated to
low-priority status in the Nazis' lineup for extermination. Also,
the unexpectedly rapid advance of the Allied military juggernaut
kept the Nazis preoccupied with their own survival and in many
cases crushed the Gestapo executioners before they could put the
finishing touches on their racial cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   (On learning of Hitler's death)
</P>
<P>
   ''I was totally unprepared for the way my countrymen actually
reacted to the announcement. When the news was flashed repeatedly
over the radio at our shelter, it was met with neither jubilation
nor sorrow, just monumental, yawning indifference. Except for an
occasional 'good riddance,' my roommates all but ignored the
historic event during their inevitable daily arguments.''

<HEADLINE> Janssen Mutates: 'X-Men' to Romantic  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Famke Janssen has been a lusty Bond
villainess who crushes a man to death with her thighs. She's played
a wallflowerish teacher transformed into a sultry vamp by an alien
parasite. Most recently, she was a mutant who could hurl objects
with her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Janssen doesn't think much of that whole
sci-fi-fantasy-action species of film.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even like that genre,'' said Janssen, who plays the
telekinetic mutant Jean Grey in ''X-men'' and stars in the bawdy
romance ''Love &AMP; Sex.'' ''It's a weird thing. For whatever reason,
that's what I get asked to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Janssen's carnal performance as Xenia Onatopp in the James Bond
movie ''GoldenEye'' undoubtedly explains some of the
action-adventure offers. The former model's striking dark looks
don't hurt, either. And her stately frame -- an inch under 6 feet --
may earn points with action filmmakers looking for imposing
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Her other sci-fi and fantasy credits include last year's ''House
on Haunted Hill,'' ''Deep Rising'' and ''Lord of Illusions,'' plus
an episode of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' opposite ''X-men''
co-star Patrick Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Janssen, 34, a Netherlands native who has lived in the United
States since the mid-1980s, doesn't bemoan the typecasting that has
landed her such roles. She figures the higher profile of those
movies, particularly ''GoldenEye,'' gives her clout to pick up
juicier parts in smaller films, including a spurned lover who
exacted cruel revenge in Woody Allen's ''Celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   She was already committed to ''GoldenEye'' by the time Janssen
saw the script and discovered what a lascivious, frenzied character
she had signed on to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I had no choice,'' she said in an interview over breakfast
at a Los Angeles cafe. ''I mean, my career was nowhere at that
point. It wasn't like, 'Oh, my God, I have so much to lose, I
really can't do this.' I figured I have nothing to lose. In the
worst case, I go down in history as another Bond girl who's never
gone anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Janssen worked hard to inject Xenia Onatopp with verve and
character. The effort paid off. Xenia got Janssen noticed, and more
film offers came in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had some choices for the first time in my life. Not a lot,
but some,'' Janssen said. ''But every single thing that came my way
I turned down because it was all things that would have taken me
into that B-movie genre, where they put you on a billboard with a
gun, and they make some money, and the movie probably would go
straight to video.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want that. I've always wanted longevity in this
business. I always wanted to be taken seriously. I wanted to get a
career that was varied.''
</P>
<P>
   Janssen mixed things up between smaller features and big-budget
films. After ''GoldenEye,'' she did the gritty drama ''City of
Industry.'' Along with more commercial features, she had roles in
''Rounders,'' ''Monument Ave.'' and Robert Altman's ''The
Gingerbread Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Janssen's roles in ''GoldenEye'' and ''Celebrity'' caught the
eye of ''Love &AMP; Sex'' writer-director Valerie Breiman.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was so good as this funny, nasty character in
'GoldenEye,''' Breiman said. ''I'd never seen her in anything else
until 'Celebrity.' That was it. I decided she was going to be Kate,
no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on Breiman's love life, the movie traces the messy amorous
entanglements of Kate Wells (Janssen), who tries to stay best
friends with ex-lover Adam (Jon Favreau).
</P>
<P>
   Janssen said she had a similar best-friend relationship for 11
years with her husband. The marriage broke up last year, but they
remain close friends, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kate is a gangly, klutzy beauty with a ribald romantic history
that includes losing her virginity to her high-school French
teacher and having loud sex in a restaurant men's room.
</P>
<P>
   ''I loved how unapologetic this woman was about her sex life,
love life, messy life in general,'' Janssen said. ''It was very
refreshing. She had a great sense of humor. She's a goofball. She's
a lot of things that I really am in life. But it's not the way
people have seen me before.''
</P>
<P>
   Breiman tailored the script to Janssen and Favreau's attributes,
with Kate mocking Adam for his ''abnormally large head'' and Adam
kidding Kate over her size-11 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Janssen delivers a fiery, flaky performance, handling the
movie's comic moments and dramatic turns with endearing relish.
</P>
<P>
   ''Famke has been unfairly typecast in other kinds of movies,''
Breiman said. ''But every scene in 'Love &AMP; Sex,' the proof is
there. ... It's just a matter of people being smart enough to put
her in these kinds of movies. I think she's Julia Roberts and
Sandra Bullock and more.''
</P>
<P>
   A hit with the audience at this year's Sundance Film Festival,
''Love &AMP; Sex'' was picked up by Lions Gate Films.
</P>
<P>
   Janssen and her co-star quickly teamed up again for ''Made,''
written and directed by Favreau, which is due out next year. She
plays a single mother who works as a stripper.
</P>
<P>
   Other than a likely ''X-men'' sequel, Janssen has not signed for
other movies, looking forward to some time off. She has been
promoting ''X-men'' and ''Love &AMP; Sex'' in the United States, Japan
and Europe, including a trip home to Amsterdam for an ''X-men''
premiere in September.
</P>
<P>
   Janssen, who studied writing at Columbia University, is also
trying to option rights to a book for which she hopes to write the
screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   While she would like to stick with smaller films, she knows she
has to mix in bigger ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't do that, first of all, you make no money and you
can't afford your own rent,'' Janssen said. ''Second of all, this
business is not that forgiving. Unless you appear in a movie once
in a while that is a box-office hit, you're out of the picture. And
you don't even get the parts you want anymore in the smaller
films.''

<HEADLINE> Photo Exhibit Celebrates Women  </HEADLINE>
By NEIL BIBLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- The images cover everything from the real and
mundane to the glamorous and bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   There's a weathered farmer in a field, an infant suckling a
famed mother's breast and a performance artist buried so that only
her head and shoulders protrude from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz has chosen
to celebrate women for a touring exhibition titled simply
''Women,'' a collection of dozens of photos presenting a varied
panoply of its subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, made up of about a third of the nearly 170
photos in Leibovitz's book by the same name, was first assembled
under the auspices of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington,
D.C., and displayed there through February. It opened a national
tour July 29 at the Phoenix Art Museum, where it will remain
through Sept. 24. It then goes to New York City for nearly three
months, with Miami, San Francisco and Seattle to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Leibovitz reached national prominence with a photo of John
Lennon and Yoko Ono on the cover of Rolling Stone shortly before
Lennon was shot to death in 1980. She spent a decade with the
magazine before moving on to Vanity Fair, Vogue and other
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Though much of her early work was journalistic, Leibovitz has
not merely recorded American culture but has been helping make it
from the outset. A Vanity Fair cover depicting actress Demi Moore
nude and pregnant is only one example.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over her career, which now spans 30 years, she has become a
real icon-maker,'' Phoenix Art Museum Director Jim Ballinger says.
''Part of that's due to the great quality of her work in itself,
but also because it's been her fortune to work with high-profile
magazines. That enables her printed work to reach such a broader
audience than would a museum show.''
</P>
<P>
   Novelist-critic Susan Sontag, whose essay accompanies the photos
in the book, came up with the concept, and Leibovitz undertook the
project with a typical combination of hesitancy and ardor.
</P>
<P>
   These photos, Leibovitz says, show ''how we look and what we
do'' -- a collective portrait of women and their roles today in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very moved by the sense of dignity these women have,'' the
photographer says.
</P>
<P>
   ''The camera shows us many worlds, and the point is that all the
images are valid,'' says Sontag, who grew up in Tucson and Los
Angeles. ''A woman may be a cop or a beauty queen or an architect
or a housewife or a physicist.'' They all appear in the book.
</P>
<P>
   The images include a portrait of Supreme Court Justices Sandra
Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg that resembles an Old Masters
painting, and the everyday simplicity of Osceola McCarty, a
Mississippi washerwoman who gave her savings to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton is there, as is former First Lady Betty
Ford. So are tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams with an
in-your-face stare. Three members of a Crips gang's female
auxiliary seem to be giving the viewer dismissive looks.
</P>
<P>
   A mature Yoko Ono graces one page.
</P>
<P>
   So do portraits of Las Vegas showgirls -- in their costumed
splendor next to their ordinary daily selves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any large scale picturing of women belongs to the ongoing
story of how women are presented, and how they are invited to think
of themselves,'' Sontag wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We assume a world with a boundless appetite for images in
which people, women and men, are eager to surrender themselves to
the camera. But it is worth recalling that there are parts of the
world where to be photographed is something off-limits to women.''
</P>
<P>
   In the show, the prints themselves are huge -- as large as 6 feet
by 8 feet -- and were produced by what is known as the Iris process
using computers, watercolor paper and special inks. Among the
results are a velvety surface appearance when viewed from a few
feet away and a visual depth of virtual dimension. Neither is
apparent in the glossy pages of the book.
</P>
<P>
   That the tour opened in Phoenix was partly a matter of luck and
partly of connections. When the decision was made to take the
exhibition on tour, the Phoenix museum happened to have a staff
member in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pleaded our case because if we didn't squeeze it in now, we
couldn't handle it at all because of our future bookings,''
Ballinger says. It helped that the museum had showcased a 1992
Leibovitz retrospective and had long-standing links with the
Corcoran.
</P>
<P>
   Ballinger says the exhibition and book ''show the total
transcendence of her work.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I see it as almost a millennial celebration of American
women,'' he adds. ''To be able to go from coal miners to show girls
to athletes to political leaders is outstanding.''

<HEADLINE> Poet-Park Ranger Inspired by Cave  </HEADLINE>
By TIFFANY MEREDITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH CAVE NATIONAL PARK, Ky. (AP) -- Even before it can be
seen, Mammoth Cave beckons.
</P>
<P>
   The land slopes sharply downward, warm summer air gives way to a
frigid blast, and out of the dense woodland a rugged rock staircase
appears, winding down into the blackness. The staircase is framed
by smooth beige stone that is the cave's gaping mouth. On the
clearest of mornings, dense fog still hovers about its entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, walls sparkle white with gypsum crystals, white
spiders scuttle along the floor in cave rooms as big as suburban
houses and eyeless fish swim in the dark depths of the River Styx.
</P>
<P>
   Still largely uncharted, the damp, surreal world that is the
planet's longest cave has stoked the imaginative fires of
generations of explorers. Now it is home to one of America's best
new poets -- a Harvard-educated park ranger.
</P>
<P>
   Henry David Thoreau had the woods of Walden for inspiration.
Davis McCombs has the cavernous depths of Mammoth Cave.
</P>
<P>
   ''People that share this love of Mammoth Cave, we share some
sort of a bond. It goes beyond everything,'' McCombs says. ''I know
I'll feel that way my whole life and that people who have worked
here in the past and have come back decades later really feel it.
You love Mammoth Cave -- you're changed.''
</P>
<P>
   McCombs, 31, won the prestigious Yale Younger Poets Prize last
year for ''Ultima Thule,'' his book of poetry about the 348-mile
cave and the picturesque wooded Kentucky farmland that surrounds
it. The book was published this April.
</P>
<P>
   Its title comes from the name of a large pile of rocks that
early explorers once thought to be the end of Mammoth Cave until
two explorers crawled under it in 1908 and discovered more. For the
ancients, ultima Thule referred to the northernmost part of the
habitable world. Figuratively, it means the highest goal of human
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Pulitzer Prize-winning poet W.S. Merwin, who judged the Yale
contest, called McCombs' work ''quiet, understated, delicate as a
hand exploring a tunnel in the dark.'' It is one of the few, if
any, books of cave poetry around, says Pulitzer and National Book
Award winner Charles Wright, who taught McCombs at the University
of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Mummies and artifacts found in the cave indicate that humans
first ventured into its cavernous depths as far back as 4,000
years. Stretching through the southwestern corner of the state,
Mammoth Cave is a series of chambers and passageways on five
different levels that connect to two other cave systems. A national
park, with forests and the winding Green River, was opened in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   With McCombs' credentials, which include a graduate degree from
Virginia, a fellowship at Stanford University and numerous other
distinguished poetry awards, it might seem more appropriate to
place him in the world of academia rather than a low-paying,
seasonable job as a park ranger, one who this season is relegated
to the duty of campground parking-lot attendant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's unusual what he does as a park ranger, but that's
where his subject lies,'' Wright says. ''I don't see anything
spiritual in being a park ranger. I think it's the cave that's
called him.''
</P>
<P>
   And the cave called him early. McCombs grew up in nearby
Munfordville and saw the cave for the first time on a school trip
when he was 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''The woman who gave the tour still works here,'' he says. ''She
doesn't remember, but I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip also sparked a childhood obsession with Floyd Collins,
a famous cave explorer who died in 1925, trapped inside a nearby
cave as newspapers chronicled for two weeks the unsuccessful
efforts to rescue him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would make my dad take me, drive me to Sand Cave where he
was trapped, all the time,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   One of his poems, ''Floyd's Lost Passage,'' is about Collins'
death:
</P>
<P>
   ''... Calloused hand
</P>
<P>
   to limestone scallop, he crawls into the hollow
</P>
<P>
   of a river's skeleton, and the muck wants him,
</P>
<P>
   comes sweating to his touch. A switchback
</P>
<P>
   and a siphon. The cave pinches down
</P>
<P>
   to a sloping, narrow chute, and feet first,
</P>
<P>
   the scuffed tip of his boot catches the rock that pins
</P>
<P>
   his leg in the mud -- a terminal breakdown
</P>
<P>
   though the cave slinks on through the hills'
</P>
<P>
   inhuman ribcage holding now
</P>
<P>
   his looked-for, soon-to-be-famous heart.''
</P>
<P>
   McCombs said that the poem about Collins is his favorite
because, ''I felt like I got to say all these things I'd been
needing to say for years.
</P>
<P>
   ''As much as I as poet and I as tour guide have kind of
denounced the media frenzy that surrounded Floyd Collins' death --
they wanted to package and sell him and make money from him -- I'm a
part of that,'' he says. ''I wanted to say that, and I wanted to
say that to him.''
</P>
<P>
   McCombs became a cave guide after his freshman year at Harvard,
when he would return for the summers to work. Through the years,
his numerous cave tours -- ''I bet I've done it thousands of
times,'' he says -- caused a connection to another explorer: slave
guide Stephen Bishop, who discovered and mapped out from 1839 to
1849 much of what is known about Mammoth Cave today. His voice
appears in many of McCombs' poems.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just everywhere down there,'' McCombs says. ''We don't do
anything where we don't follow in his footprints, or knee prints as
the case may be. I lead a tour called 'Wild Cave' which is
crawling, squeezing through little holes and climbing six hours,
and there are places on that tour where you crawl into these little
passageways and you're on your stomach, you're writhing around in
the dirt and the mud and you look up on the ceiling and there is
Stephen Bishop's signature.''
</P>
<P>
   McCombs started writing the poems when he returned to Harvard in
the fall following his first summer as a guide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sometimes think that made it easier,'' he says. ''I had a
portion of my life where I just lived it. I don't think I could
have come here thinking, 'OK, I'm going to write a poem about what
I do here. It wouldn't have worked. I had to go live it and let it
happen, and then I had to realize later on, 'Oh yeah, that's what
that meant.'''
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, McCombs studied with Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney,
who encouraged him in his exploration of Mammoth Cave.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a friend -- she was a really good writer. She wrote
beautifully; she had all the technical skills. Seamus told her,
'You write beautifully, but go out and live. Get something to write
about,''' McCombs says. ''And he never told that to me, because I
had this weird life, this other life where I would come to Mammoth
Cave in the summers and I grew up in Munfordville and had this
strange and crazy childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   McCombs' father, a farmer and shopkeeper who went to Duke
University and taught high school English, was born on land that
contains Mammoth Cave before it was claimed by the government as a
national park.
</P>
<P>
   One grandfather was a teacher and cave guide and another, a
lawyer and part-time farmer in Hart County who sold tobacco, baby
ducks, kept bees and studied law at Duke with Richard Nixon. His
mother, who was born in Munfordville, met his father while both
taught at a local high school.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm local, very local,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But McCombs' days near his beloved cave may be numbered. He and
his wife, also a poet who writes under the name Carolyn Koo, now
have an infant son, Warren, and McCombs says he has little chance
of getting on at Mammoth Cave full-time because of government
cutbacks and regulations. Full-time park jobs hard to get, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing like fatherhood to focus you on your career,''
he says. ''I can't have a rinky-dink job any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step, he says, probably will be teaching, although he
admits mixed feelings about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get into this deal where every poet teaches and I don't
think that's good,'' he says. ''Why can't there be poet park
rangers, poet lawyers and poet doctors?
</P>
<P>
   ''Ideally, I'd like never to have to work. I know that I would
be incredibly happy not working, forever. But I think that's
because my real work is not the work for which I get paid. So I'd
be working, I'd be killing myself with effort. But it wouldn't be
9-to-5. Poetry is the job I want, but it's a hard job to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright said McCombs' dilemma is common to writers, although his
love of the cave poses an unusual geographic problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''People do whatever it takes,'' Wright says. ''If they want to
write they have to figure out a way to pay the rent. But he wants
to be close to his inspiration, and I don't blame him.''
</P>
<P>
   And another place just would not be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love pretty places,'' McCombs says. ''I've been to other
places. Living in San Francisco was majestically beautiful. But I
didn't write poems about the San Francisco coastline. It's always
about here.''

<HEADLINE> Vincent D'Onofrio: Tall Guy Rising  </HEADLINE>
By MARK KENNEDY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The guy on the other end of Vincent D'Onofrio's
cell phone has no idea how much trouble he's in.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you think I'm joking, you haven't dealt with me before,''
the actor bellows into his receiver like a bear whose winter nap
has been interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be there soon, you know. And if I look you in the eye and
I know you're lying, there's gonna be hell to pay,'' D'Onofrio
says, straightening his 6-foot-3 frame.
</P>
<P>
   The offending party, a publicist from Los Angeles, has
apparently not stunned D'Onofrio with his skill promoting one of
the actor's latest offerings, ''Steal This Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Onofrio, who stars and is executive producer of the biopic on
'60s radical Abbie Hoffman, wants more actors corralled, more
posters, more hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   A choice selection of expletives later, D'Onofrio hands the
phone to a worried-looking publicist. Then he levels his gaze at a
newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't write about this,'' he says. ''I'll kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulp.
</P>
<P>
   D'Onofrio -- a character actor who's chiseled a career playing
off-the-wall losers, alien-possessed farmers and random misfits --
then bursts into a deep laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ''Honest to God, it's not like I'm banking on 'Steal This Movie'
to make my career,'' he says. ''I've got a career, thank you very
much. But if you're going to get involved in a project with me,
then do your job right. Right? That's it. That's all I'm asking.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgive D'Onofrio his snit fit. This is, after all, a guy who
puts his own body on the line for his films ever since he debuted
in ''Full Metal Jacket'' by gaining 70 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's an artist, in the best sense of the word,'' says ''Steal
This Movie'' director Robert Greenwald. ''He commits to the
creative process, wherever it takes him, whatever the toll it will
take. He just won't let go of the muse.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Onofrio's muse is an odd lady. He's gone from playing a
lovesick fisherman in ''Mystic Pizza,'' to a bumbling Mob
accountant in ''Feeling Minnesota,'' to a young Orson Welles in
''Ed Wood.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, his most notorious role is the intergalactic cockroach
who slips on -- very awkwardly -- the skin of an unlucky farmer to
battle Will Smith in ''Men in Black.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have to worry about box office receipts,'' D'Onofrio
says happily. ''It's not like the studio guys sit around and say,
'We've got to put out a D'Onofrio movie this year!' I'm allowed to
jump around and be eclectic.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he's taking oddness to a new high. In addition to
portraying a counterculture peacenik, D'Onofrio goes medieval in
''The Cell'' as a serial killer who drowns and bleaches his
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least it shows my diversity as an actor,'' he laughs. ''At
least it does that. I'm not sure it's a great plan of the studios,
but that's not my business.''
</P>
<P>
   His business, he says, is looking ''for stories that I can dive
in, places that I haven't been before. The only thing you can be
sure of is that I will continue to act. That's the thread that
connects my work.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York and reared in Hawaii, Colorado and Miami, the
41-year-old D'Onofrio cut his teeth at New York's American
Stanislavski Theatre, dabbling in stage work and student films.
</P>
<P>
   During down times, he was a bouncer at clubs and a bodyguard for
such notables as Yul Brynner and Robert Plant.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Stanley Kubrick picked him to play a chubby,
whacked-out recruit in 1987's ''Full Metal Jacket,'' D'Onofrio
realized that the key to success was to transform his towering
presence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can change my size so much. I can look like a whole
different guy,'' he says, still chunky from having gained 40 pounds
for an upcoming movie with Val Kilmer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it really comes down to not being a really good actor
and needing to be confident that my persona suits the part. When I
walk down the street in real life, the vibe that I give off has got
to suit the characters that I'm playing.''
</P>
<P>
   And what characters they've been. Look for him in ''The
Player,'' ''Mr. Wonderful,'' ''The Whole Wide World,'' ''Dying
Young,'' ''The Newton Boys,'' ''Strange Days,'' ''The Thirteenth
Floor'' and even ''Stuart Saves His Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask him how he views these smaller, supporting roles and
D'Onofrio chuckles. ''The first thing you have to know is that you
have to look at a story like it's a canvas, like a painting. It's
like Character Acting 101.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesson One: ''You have to realize where your character is within
the structure of the story. Maybe it's like a splash of yellow
paint in one corner of the composition of the painting,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't want to shine too bright and you don't want to shine
too little. You want to be the perfect splash of yellow paint to
let the whole composition work correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesson Two: ''You can never become something that you're not.
You can never become a person that you're playing,'' he says. ''All
you can do is put yourself, your soul, who you are, into that
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The minute you start to try and become something that you're
not, it goes in the direction of faking, of pretending. That's good
for sketches, but not good for drama.''
</P>
<P>
   His impromptu lesson over, D'Onofrio picks up his cell phone,
says good-bye and prepares to get back to work: It's time to knock
heads with Los Angeles again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once you're an actor and you have just a tiny bit of success,
you enter this area where anybody in any other form of the business
will always treat you like an actor,'' he says ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   ''You realize that one day and then you say, 'Oh, OK. Is that
the game we're playing? All right, fine. I'm gonna play it, too.
I'm going to be the biggest pain-in-the-butt actor that you've ever
had to deal with.'''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Clears Way for Colombia Aid  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Wednesday he released
$1.3 billion in aid money for Colombia despite concerns about human
rights abuses because Colombia's program for combatting drugs and
achieving other goals needs ''to have a chance to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed a waiver Tuesday night authorizing the release of
the aid even though Colombia fell short of meeting the human rights
conditions imposed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters before a trip to New Jersey, Clinton said
another reason waiving the conditions was the commitment of
President Andres Pastrana to protect human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has submitted legislation to the Colombian parliament, for
example, for civil trials for allegations of military abuses of
human rights. And we also have a system in place for specific
case-by-case investigation of serious allegations,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   For long-term stability and democracy and for protection of
human rights, Clinton said ''it is very, very important'' that the
centerpiece of the Pastrana government's program succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The program is designed to curb narcotrafficking, end the
guerrilla war, protect human rights, achieve economic growth and
move ahead on other fronts.
</P>
<P>
   By signing the waiver, Clinton said, the administration has not
given up its ability to look into allegations of rights abuses by
specific military units. He noted that such units can be barred
from U.S. assistance if they have engaged in abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers imposed the rights conditions out of concern that the
U.S. tax dollars would aid a military with an embarrassing human
rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sens. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Edward M. Kennedy
of Massachusetts had urged Clinton not to grant the waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy said last week that waiving the conditions would
contradict the intent of the law. He said a waiver would ''make a
mockery'' of the arguments and expectations of the many
congressional supporters of Colombia's counterdrug campaign who
insisted that the conditions are necessary to ensure that human
rights are protected.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley noted that the
legislation was signed only six weeks ago and said it was
''understandable the Colombian government has not had sufficient
time to meet all the conditions and establish a record of
compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The aid is meant to help Colombia fight drug traffickers and
includes money to train and equip the army and police, 18 Black
Hawk helicopters and 42 Huey 2 helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to visit Colombia Aug. 30, demonstrating support for
Pastrana's efforts to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of cocaine consumed in the United States is grown
or passes through Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia was to have met seven criteria before getting the
anti-drug money.
</P>
<P>
   One was met last week when Pastrana ordered that military
personnel accused of human rights violations be tried in civilian
courts, so that military courts could not be used as a shield.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used his waiver authority for the remaining six. Two
additional criteria are expected to be satisfied in the coming
weeks, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   One would give legal authority to military leaders to suspend
personnel suspected of abuses. The second would establish a judge
advocate general corps.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do think there is a good-faith effort under way in
Colombia,'' State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
''There is progress on all fronts. We believe the certification
process helps improve the human rights situation.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Electric Rate Relief  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton announced steps Wednesday to
help consumers in Southern California deal with ''skyrocketing''
electric bills and called on Congress to pass legislation to
''build a better energy future over the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Californians, especially those in the San Diego
area where the price crunch has been most severe: ''We'll do what
we can to help you get through this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the steps overlooking the Rose Garden moments before
leaving for a political fund-raising trip to New Jersey, Clinton
said he has ordered these steps:
</P>
<P>
   --The Federal Regulatory Commission has been asked to quicken the
pace of its investigation into wholesale power markets ''so we can
better understand what's happening in California and provide
policy-makers with the information they need to protect consumers
in a timely fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   --The Department of Health and Human Services will release $2.6
million to Southern California families from the Low-Income Home
Energy Assistance Program. Clinton said that doubles the amount of
aid available in the San Diego area and will help low-income
families and the elderly ''to pay their bills and stay cool.''
</P>
<P>
   --The Small Business Administration has been told to put out the
word about SBA loans ''to help cope with unusually high electrical
bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Residential and business customers who receive power from the
San Diego Gas and Electric Co., have seen their bills double or
even quadruple since rates were deregulated in June.
</P>
<P>
   The phased-in, south-to-north deregulation of California's $20
billion electrical power industry was supposed to lower prices by
creating greater competition.
</P>
<P>
   But demand for electricity has outstripped supply because of a
growing population and a booming high-tech economy and less power
available from neighboring states that haven't deregulated. A
sweltering summer in California has contributed to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the problem has a broader base than just the
current price crunch in southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ''I also renew my call to Congress to work with us to build a
better energy future over the long run, to take up my energy budget
initiatives and the tax incentives to promote energy efficiency and
conservation,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they will also pass a national comprehensive bill to
foster a new era of the right kind of competition in the electric
industry, to establish a more competitive, efficient and reliable
electric power system for our nation and to beef up efforts to
prevent utilities from abusing their market power to raise rates
above competitive levels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said those steps would save American consumers about $20
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked directly if he believes power companies are
profiteering in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what the folks are going to investigate,'' he said.
''We just want the folks to look into it and see what the facts
are.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an unusual impact there, different from virtually any
other place in America and it needs to be examined,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions, Clinton was asked about high gasoline
prices and what the United States is doing to convince
oil-producing nations to increase production at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will discuss the issue on his trip to Nigeria, a big
oil producer, later in the week and that renewed economic growth
elsewhere in the world is ''putting more pressure on the oil
supplies that are available.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
will suffer if high oil prices trigger regional recessions, causing
oil purchases to drop dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   He said OPEC will be much better off at a lower, sustainable oil
price.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't want to go down to $13 to $15 a barrel again, but
it needs to be, I think, in the low $20s somewhere,'' Clinton said,
calling that ''the more sustainable rate.''
</P>
<P>
   One benchmark crude oil was priced today at $32.68 a barrel.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 35; Nasdaq Adds 13  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors
contemplated a new economic outlook that apparently includes stable
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 11.35 at 11,127.80, after falling by more than 50
points earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 5.17 at 1,503.30, and the
Nasdaq composite index rose 13.07 to 3,971.28.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw some very normal profit-taking early in the session. It
was simply investors responding to the Fed's decision not to raise
interest rates,'' said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis
at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman noted also that the Dow index had risen 640 points in
the past two and a half weeks in anticipation of the Fed's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Banking stocks were up across the board following Tuesday's Fed
meeting. Chase Manhattan rose 1.188 to $53.938, and Bank of New
York was up 68.70 cents at $51.875.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had predicted for weeks that the Fed would leave
interest rates alone Tuesday, and traders responded to that
forecast with optimism, buying stocks in the sessions leading up to
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Economic indicators have signaled for several months that the
Fed's 14-month policy of raising interest rates to cool the economy
and ease inflationary pressures has been successful.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 391.85 million
shares, up from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.79 at 516.67.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Agents Seize Lobster Traps  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURNT CHURCH, New Brunswick (AP) -- Canadian agents seized or
destroyed hundreds of lobster traps and one officer was hit in the
face by a rock as Indian fishermen protested the raid in an ongoing
dispute over fishing rights off eastern Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The fisheries official was hospitalized with broken cheek and
nose bones and was awaiting reconstructive surgery, said Andre Marc
Lanteigne, a spokesman for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
</P>
<P>
   Lanteigne said the Tuesday raid began before dawn, with officers
from the fisheries department and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
boarding boats to remove more than 500 of the 1,300 traps set in
Miramichi Bay, on the eastern coast of New Brunswick, by Micmac
Indians from the Burnt Church reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody has to respect the law,'' Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said in defense of the Fisheries Department. ''It's the
way that a country functions.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnt Church was one of five reservations on Canada's Atlantic
coast that rejected an agreement last week with the government that
set fishing limits in exchange for financial aid. Twenty-nine other
reservations accepted the agreement, which allowed Indians to set
400 traps in part of Miramichi Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians began moving outside the designated area for their
traps and setting more than agreed to, Lanteigne said, prompting
the government to respond. Two Micmac Indians were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   More than 700 traps were seized or destroyed last week and four
Indians were arrested in a similar raid.
</P>
<P>
   During the raid Tuesday, Indian fishing boats tried to prevent
the government boats from getting to the traps. No collisions were
reported as the boats swerved around each other for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the weekend, the number of traps had tripled so we had to
intervene,'' Lanteigne said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that the Micmac and
Maliseek Indians have a right to earn a moderate living from
fishing and hunting, but clarified later that that right is subject
to federal regulation. The government says it must regulate the
fishing industry to protect a limited resource.
</P>
<P>
   The Burnt Church Indians reject federal authority to regulate
lobster fishing, which they call a traditional practice crucial to
their livelihood.

<HEADLINE> Report: China Arrests Christians  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Police in central China arrested 130 members of
an underground Christian evangelical group on Wednesday, including
three American citizens, a human rights group reported.
</P>
<P>
   The church members were seized in an afternoon raid in Henan
province's Xihua county and have been detained at the county jail,
the Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy reported.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested were Henry Chu, Patricia Lan and Sandee
Lin, American missionaries who are residents of California, the
Hong Kong-based center reported. The report did not give their
hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   The report could not be confirmed late Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested were members of the Fangcheng church, whose
founder, Zhang Rongliang, was sentenced to two years in a labor
camp in December on charges of leading a cult. Fangcheng church
leaders also were reported arrested last year, prompting members to
appeal to President Clinton to pressure China for their release.
</P>
<P>
   The group is one of scores of clandestine Christian communities,
known as house churches because they are unable to worship in
public. The officially atheistic communist government forbids
worship outside state-sanctioned churches.
</P>
<P>
   However, foreign missionaries estimate the number of Protestants
to be as high as ten times the official figure of 11 million. The
unofficial churches tend to be more evangelistic and charismatic
than the government-approved non-denominational Protestant church.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Press OPEC on Production  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Wednesday he will press
Nigeria and other members of the Organization for Petroleum
Exporting Countries to consider production increases so oil prices
can decline.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton leaves Friday for a two-day visit to Nigeria and talks
with President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   He said OPEC countries would be ''much better off with a price
that's below where it is now, but one that can be sustained.''
</P>
<P>
   The price for light sweet crude was $32.68 a barrel Wednesday on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the price should be in the low- to mid-20s ''and I
will clearly discuss it with President Obasanjo and with others in
the weeks ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   He said renewed economic growth in other parts of the world was
putting more pressure on available oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would argue to Nigeria and other OPEC nations
''that if the price gets too high, they will cause recession in
other countries and then the supply, the purchases will drop
dramatically and for a far longer time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said prices did not need to return to the $13 to $15 a
barrel level that prevailed for much of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   United Arab Emirates Oil Minister Obaid bin Saif al-Nasseri said
earlier this week $25 a barrel was a reasonable price for oil and
it is important for both consuming and producing countries to agree
on that.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union said on Tuesday that it has asked OPEC to
increase oil production to bring down prices. EU officials said the
15-nation bloc would like to see the price of crude oil around $25
a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   World oil prices have soared above $30 this month, leading to an
outcry from consuming countries.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC, of which the Emirates is a member, has been divided over
the need for more oil. Some members fear increased production could
lead to a price slump that would hurt producing countries'
economies.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC is expected to consider an output boost at its next meeting
Sept. 10 in Vienna. The cartel provides about one-third of the
world's oil.

<HEADLINE> Crocodile Heart Valve May Aid Divers  </HEADLINE>
By RICK CALLAHAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   An unusual heart valve in crocodiles that has puzzled scientists
for nearly 200 years has finally been explained, and the finding
may reveal how crocs can stay underwater for hours.
</P>
<P>
   The valve recirculates oxygen-poor blood back into the
bloodstream, apparently to sustain the animal's most vital organs,
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish and Australian team studied a common saltwater
crocodile, focusing on a valve in its right ventricle called a
cogged-teeth valve. It resembles interlocked human knuckles.
</P>
<P>
   By injecting the reptile with a heart-slowing drug, they
prompted the notched valve to close off an entry to the artery
leading to the lungs. It acted like a shunt, diverting oxygen-poor
blood away from the lungs and back into the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment was done in the laboratory. The researchers
suspect that wild crocodiles regulate blood flow in a much more
complex manner by opening and closing the valve when they submerge
for long durations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe they're using this valve to ration their oxygen
when they're underwater,'' said Michael Axelsson, an associate
professor of zoophysiology at the University of Goteborg in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The research appears in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The cog-teeth valve is composed of nodules of connective tissue
unlike the thin, leaf-like valves typically found in vertebrate
hearts. It was first described by scientists in the early 19th
century, but its function remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   All crocodiles are believed to have the heart valve, though
Axelsson and an Australian colleague looked only at the Crocodylus
porosus, a man-eater found along the coasts of Australia and Papua
New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Vliet, an alligator biologist at the University of Florida
in Gainesville, Fla., said the laboratory work clearly reveals the
blood-flow pattern within the croc's complex heart.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now what we really need to know is whether or not these
structures are actually used by the animals in nature. Do freely
diving crocodiles really shunt blood away from their lungs and into
the bloodstream?'' Vliet said.
</P>
<P>
   Axelsson said his team is working with an American engineer to
develop an implantable heart monitor that can be inserted in wild
crocodiles.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 3; Nasdaq Rises 27  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as investors
contemplated a new economic outlook that apparently includes stable
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 2.93 at 11,136.22, after falling by more than 50
points earlier in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 4.53 at 1,502.66, and the
Nasdaq composite index rose 26.68 to 3,984.89.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw some very normal profit-taking early in the session. It
was simply investors responding to the Fed's decision not to raise
interest rates,'' said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis
at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman noted also that the Dow index had risen 640 points in
the past two and a half weeks in anticipation of the Fed's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold grocery stocks after Albertson's warned that its
second quarter profit will fall short of expectations on slow
same-store sales and higher operating costs. The news prompted an
analyst at UBS Warburg to downgrade other grocery store stocks and
helped drag down the Dow index.
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's shares fell $4.437 to $22.563, and Kroger Co. was
down $1.125 at $21.875.
</P>
<P>
   Banking stocks, meanwhile, were up across the board following
Tuesday's Fed meeting. Chase Manhattan rose 68.80 cents to $53.438,
and Bank of New York was up $1 at $52.188.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had predicted for weeks that the Fed would leave
interest rates alone Tuesday, and traders responded to that
forecast with optimism, buying stocks in the sessions leading up to
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Economic indicators have signaled for several months that the
Fed's 14-month policy of raising interest rates to cool the economy
and ease inflationary pressures has been successful.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 572.68 million
shares, up from Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.78 at 516.78.

<HEADLINE> Typhoon Bilis Leaves 11 Dead  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Typhoon Bilis churned into coastal China
Wednesday, bringing heavy rain and gale-force winds but little of
the destruction it left across Taiwan, where it wrecked homes and
killed 11 people.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of injuries or serious damage in China's
Fujian province, where Bilis made landfall Wednesday afternoon
before dying out further inland, said a government spokesman in the
port city of Xiamen, who gave only his surname, Xie.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal workers were keeping watch through the night for
flooding and other damage from the torrential rains expected to
follow the typhoon, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Xiamen had prepared for a major storm, giving city workers the
day off as Bilis moved in. The Xiamen ferry service and a local
airline shut down operations, television stations and the state-run
Chinese news agency Xinhua reported.
</P>
<P>
   Boats were ordered into port along the Fujian coast, and
airports in Xiamen and the provincial capital, Fuzhou, closed for
part of the day, television reports said. TV footage showed
signboards blown down and city residents negotiating streets in the
wind and rain.
</P>
<P>
   A government statement, read on Chinese television, expressed
''deepest condolences'' to victims of the typhoon in Taiwan, where
11 people were killed, 80 injured and thousands stranded in
makeshift shelters. The statement, issued by the government's
Central Office for Taiwan Affairs, was markedly different in tone
from the usual blustery Chinese pronouncements on Taiwan, which
Beijing considers a breakaway province.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dead in Taiwan were seven farmers and a 6-year-old
girl buried in a mudslide in the remote Taiwanese mountain village
of Jenai. A woman was killed by downed electrical wires and a
construction worker died when a retaining wall collapsed in a
suburb of the capital, Taipei. Another man died after he was hit by
a door knocked down by strong winds.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers searched late into Wednesday night for a missing man
last seen floating down a raging river in Taiwan's central Nantou
county clinging to a piece wood for support. Officials were also
searching for a doctor reported missing during a hike Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some 250 houses collapsed in Taiwan's eastern Hualien county and
more than 600,000 homes lost power during the height of the storm.
Tens of thousands of people across the island were moved into
typhoon shelters set up by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The typhoon flooded rice paddies and fruit farms in Taiwan,
causing $48 million in agricultural damage, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Local and international airlines canceled 76 flights to southern
Taiwan and abroad. In southern Taiwan, Kaohsiung harbor -- one of
the world's busiest ports -- remained closed as waves battered the
sea walls.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of
5.7 struck Hualien, but no damage was reported.
</P>
<P>
   Bilis hit southern Taiwan late Tuesday night with winds of up to
118 mph, according to Taiwanese authorities. However, the Joint
Typhoon Warning Center at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, said Bilis had
sustained winds as high as 161 mph, making it equivalent to a
Category Five hurricane capable of causing catastrophic damage.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said the discrepancy in wind speed was partially the
result of Taiwan measuring the storm's intensity over a longer
period.
</P>
<P>
   Bilis was the second strong typhoon to hit Taiwan this year.
Last month, Typhoon Kai Tak swept through southern Taiwan with
winds of up to 93 mph, leaving one dead and five injured.

<HEADLINE> Russia Defense Head Offers To Quit  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- As Russians mourned in churches, on Web sites and
at home, a humble President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday he felt
responsible and guilty for a submarine disaster that killed 118
sailors and outraged the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's defense minister and navy chief submitted their
resignations over the loss of the Kursk, one of Russia's most
advanced submarines before an explosion crumpled it Aug. 12, but
Putin said he would not accept them. Seeking scapegoats, he said,
would be ''the most mistaken response.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I take a full sense of responsibility and sense of blame for
this tragedy,'' he said in an interview with Russia's RTR
television.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where authoritarianism runs deep, Putin's comments
displayed a remarkable humility and sensitivity to public opinion,
and an eagerness to regain the nation's confidence unprecedented
for a Russian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Russians have assailed Putin and his government for their slow,
contradictory reaction to the disaster and the botched rescue
operation, and many observers expected Putin to respond by firing
top brass.
</P>
<P>
   His interview came as Russia held a day of mourning for the
victims, and after he sat through a harrowing three-hour meeting
with the sailors' families late Tuesday night at the submarine's
home base of Vidyayevo.
</P>
<P>
   The anger runs deep.
</P>
<P>
   Many heartbroken relatives of the dead sailors refused to join
in the grieving Wednesday, demanding that their sons and husbands
be retrieved from the sea floor first.
</P>
<P>
   But pulling out the bodies will likely require lifting the
flooded ship from the bottom of the Barents Sea, and Russian navy
officials said such a risky, expensive project wouldn't likely
begin until after next spring's thaw.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until the bodies of our husbands are retrieved, until we see
them with our own eyes, we will not mourn,'' said Oksana Dudko,
whose husband Sergei was the ship's deputy commander.
</P>
<P>
   ''The conversation was very heartfelt. He admitted his guilt and
inactivity, and he said the main thing is a lack of funds,'' Dudko
said of the meeting with Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin promised Wednesday to restore the honor of the beleaguered
military and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It grieves me, the theory lately that together with the Kursk
the honor of the navy also drowned, the honor of Russia,'' he said.
''Our country has survived a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Navy chief Adm. Vladimir
Kuroyedov, and the commander of the Northern Fleet, Adm. Vyacheslav
Popov, had handed him their letters of resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't accept these requests. They won't be accepted until we
have full understanding of what happened,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rest of the nation held a day of mourning,
lowering flags to half-staff and praying in Orthodox churches.
Television interrupted some programming, and Russia's most popular
Web site, www.anekdot.ru, displayed an empty black screen
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Putin returned to Moscow on Wednesday, canceling plans to visit
the site where the Kursk sank and throw a wreath into the sea after
the families urged him not to.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin promised compensation to the families, who had
relied on the sailors' meager salaries for subsistence. The federal
government promised a one-time payment equal of an average of
$7,000 per family -- equal to 10 years of pay for a submarine
officer, said Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko.
</P>
<P>
   But what the relatives were most eager for is a recovery of the
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials were negotiating with a Norwegian diving
company for help on such an operation.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Kuznetsov, commander of the Vidyayev submarine garrison,
said the work couldn't begin until next year. Preparations would
take at least a month or two, and by then the Arctic weather would
be too harsh to risk such a project, he was quoted by ITAR-Tass as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian divers who reached the wrecked ship said Wednesday
their work at the site was technically simple but emotionally
demanding. They took over from Russian teams that had struggled for
a week without success, and immediately determined that the ship
was flooded and all aboard were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Concern has been growing about the ship's two nuclear reactors
and other weaponry. The Norwegian Nuclear Protection Authority said
Wednesday it had found no sign of a radiation leak.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the explosion that mangled the ship was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian high command says the most likely reason was a
collision with a Western submarine, though no concrete evidence has
been provided. A likely scenario was an internal malfunction and
explosion in the Kursk's torpedo compartment.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of Russia's main intelligence agency, Nikolai
Patrushev, and the country's top prosecutor, Vladimir Ustinov,
traveled to the northern naval base Wednesday to begin
investigations.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The 12 young men and women grip their paddles,
holding them at a slight angle above the water and awaiting the
start. They have sweated and strained nine weeks for this moment -
their first dragon boat race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Meep,'' the start signal blares, and they are storming across
Meadow Lake in their 2,000-pound boat decorated with a red dragon's
head and tail, racing in the Hong Kong dragon boat festival.
</P>
<P>
   Cries of ''Paddle! Paddle! Go! Go! Go!'' mix with drum beats,
resounding over the lake.
</P>
<P>
   It's over in less than four minutes, and Carol Chang, the team's
pacesetting drummer, leads the Xtreme NY club in a cheer for its
third place finish. ''Extreme!'' the dripping wet crew shouts.
</P>
<P>
   The paddlers at the mid-August meet in New York's borough of
Queens were vying in the ancient Chinese sport of dragon boating -
more than 2,000 years old - and now one of America's fastest
growing sports.
</P>
<P>
   From San Francisco to New York, and along the Mississippi River
in places as unlikely as Dubuque, Iowa, more than 400 teams across
the country are dragon boating, said Iowan Gary Carstens of the
United States Dragon Boat Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Most dragon boating hotspots are in the Midwest, which has 275
teams. Nearly 70 teams train in New York City, and some 80 teams
practice in and around Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love it. I want to win as much as anybody else, but I love
the team community. And even though I come out four days a week, it
is with people I like,'' said Ginny O'Hare, 33, co-captain of New
York's Wall Street Lions crew.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had never heard of it before,'' said Ellen Tacelosky, 32, a
banker from Arlington, Va., whose D.C. Dragons team paddles on
Washington's Anacostia River. ''It is very, very hard, and it
hasn't gotten better. But it's a great workout on the river.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to the sport - which traditionally has a crew of 18
paddlers, a steerer and a drummer setting the pace - is
synchronization.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the paddles combine as one big paddle, and that's what
moves the boat forward,'' said Xtreme NY co-captain Kang Ko, 30, of
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it's a matter of speed. Paddlers use a combination
of strokes to propel the 38-foot-long canoes. Sharp slices through
the water make for a quick start or a run for the finish; deeper
pulls maintain a steady pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Xtreme NY team had 12 paddlers in its 500-meter race.
Usually, a team has two rows of nine paddlers each competing for
250, 500 or 1,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
   The sport has attracted great interest outside the Asian
community, and Carstens noted that mostly non-Asians compete in the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the sport is the promotion of Asian culture,'' said
Tim Woo, 37, of Flushing, Queens. But, he added, ''even in New
York, where I would say you have the highest Asian-American
participation, it's only 30 to 40 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Dragon boating began in China with the legend of Qu Yuan, a
poet-statesman who drowned himself in the Milo River in Central
Hunan province more than 2,000 years ago to protest government
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Qu's bereaved countrymen rowed boats in the river, beating their
paddles against the water to frighten fish and dragons away from
his body.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is part of our lives,'' said May Wong, a Hong Kong native
now living in New York. ''I like it because it brings out Chinese
traditions and Americans can join in. They can learn something
about the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to trace the roots of the sport in the United
States. A Philadelphia rowing team was given a dragon boat in 1983
by a Hong Kong group, said Bill Toole of the Philadelphia dragon
boat team. An early dragon boat festival in New York in 1991 -
sponsored by a Hong Kong group - sparked further interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''It went from an event to promote Hong Kong to becoming a
community thing,'' said Henry Wan, chairman of the Hong Kong Dragon
Boat Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Paddlers say one reason for the sport's popularity is that it
does not require too much skill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only so many people can play soccer, rugby or baseball, but
everyone can paddle,'' said Carstens, 48. ''You don't have to go
out and kill yourself. It's good for you mentally, good for you
physically.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a team in Cedar Rapids where the youngest person is
62,'' said Carstens. ''Their motto is: 'We can do everything for a
minute and a half.'''

contemplated a new economic outlook that apparently includes stable

</P>

   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones

<HEADLINE> In effort to spruce up its image, China starts $7 million U.S. roadshow </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Concerned that China is misunderstood by
ordinary Americans, who officials say know little about China
beyond bound feet and human rights worries, the People's Republic
of China is taking a $7 million step toward sprucing up its image
here.
</P>
<P>
   ''A Close Look at China,'' a public relations extravaganza of
performances, exhibits and lectures, will tour nine cities across
the United States, beginning Thursday through Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The culture blitz coincides with the visits by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, and head of the national legislature Li Peng. It comes
at a time when U.S.-China relations are rocked by differences over
proposed U.S. missile defense programs, trade and U.S. arms sales
to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   And in the coming weeks, the U.S. Senate is expected to vote on
whether to give China permanent trading status, the final step
toward China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our hope that the American people will know the culture
of China ... the healthy and positive aspects,'' Zhao Quizheng,
director of the Chinese Cabinet's Information Office, told
reporters Wednesday. ''I believe that cultural understanding will
be a basis of political understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are some surprises to those new to Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary Chinese fashions include the slinkiest and
sparkliest of ensembles paired with stiletto sandals, and
traditional fashions are spectacular, sometimes even including
colorful face painting.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts are a study in diversity and some of the landscape
photos from various parts of China are breathtakingly beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   The tour features folk song and dance performances, and
exhibitions of Chinese art, fashion, and photography.
</P>
<P>
   New York events and displays will be at the Jacob K. Javits
Convention Center Sept. 6-15, and are free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   The tour also will travel to Washington, D.C., Des Moines, Iowa,
Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis, San Jose, Calif., Los Angeles and
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Zhao and others, including Sun Jiazheng, China's
minister of culture, will deliver a series of lectures in New York,
Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The events are organized by China's State Council Information
Office and its Ministry of Culture, and is funded with help from
American companies with large investments in China.
</P>
<P>
   President Jiang will attend the United Nations Millennium Summit
in New York Sept. 6-8, an event billed as the largest gathering of
heads of state and government in history.
</P>
<P>
   Li is scheduled to attend a meeting of leaders of national
legislatures at the United Nations on the sidelines of the summit.

<HEADLINE> Suharto Ordered To Stand Trial  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's former ruler Suharto was
ordered Wednesday to stand trial on corruption charges next week
despite his lawyer's claim that he is brain-damaged.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, embattled President Abdurrahman Wahid
reshuffled his Cabinet in response to criticism that he has failed
to solve the nation's economic problems and end the religious and
ethnic violence wracking at least two Indonesian provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers said Suharto, 79, is seriously ill, but
officials insisted he must attend his trial opening Aug. 31. He has
been accused of siphoning off at least $570 million in state funds
through a network of charities under his control.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Suharto could be imprisoned for life, but Wahid
has offered a pardon in exchange for the return of any ill-gotten
gains. The former leader, who like many Indonesians uses one name,
has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have ordered the prosecutor to bring the defendant to
court,'' said Judge Lalu Mariyun, who will head a five-judge trial
panel. ''God willing, we hope he will show up. If not, we will see
what is the reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's legal team said he is unable to comprehend questions
and remember details.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is suffering from permanent brain damage. We will have to
wait and see if he is fit enough or not,'' said defense lawyer
Syamsul Hadi.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say recent brain scans show Suharto, who ruled for
32 years, is fit enough to face trial.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's prosecution is regarded as a crucial test of the
resolve of the 10-month-old reform-minded government to clean up
endemic corruption in the world's fourth-most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of the former despot on trial is expected to
attract crowds of protesters who helped oust him from power in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet reshuffle represents a second chance for Wahid who
last October became Indonesia's first democratically chosen head of
state in four decades, but whose star soon faded with criticism
directed at his management style.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of Wahid climaxed this month when Indonesia's supreme
legislature, the People's Consultative Assembly, threatened to
impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid trimmed his Cabinet from 35 members to 26, and to appease
lawmakers, he stressed his new ministers were ''experts in their
fields.'' But 18 members are holdovers from the previous lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets reacted badly to the reshuffle. Indonesia's
troubled currency, the rupiah, dropped by 5 percent in European
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Of greatest concern was the appointment to the finance ministry
of Priyadi Prapto Suharso, a Wahid associate who this year was
blocked from heading a state-owned bank after he was judged
unsuitable by regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Another worry was the nonappearance of Vice President Megawati
Sukarnoputri at Wednesday's announcement ceremony even though she
is to assume day-to-day control of the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Her absence has fueled speculation that she might not support
Wahid's choices and is upset that few of her supporters were
selected.

   PUERTO PLATA, Dominican Republic (AP) - Emergency workers
evacuated dozens of people from riverside shacks in Dominican
Republic and gusty rain tore roofs off homes in Haiti as Tropical
Storm Debby skirted the island of Hispaniola.
</P>
<P>
   Debby was downgraded from a hurricane when it lost some force
Wednesday morning and was further disrupted by the mountains of
Hispaniola.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good news for the people of southeast Florida and the
Bahamas,'' said forecaster Michelle Huber of the National Hurricane
Center. She said there was less chance now of Debby becoming a
dangerous hurricane with over 100 mph winds than was earlier
feared.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials in the Florida Keys on Wednesday ordered
visitors to evacuate and also shut down all schools.
</P>
<P>
   Outer rainbands dumped heavy rain on northern Haiti overnight,
tearing away tin roofs from shanties and flooding some homes in the
northwest town of Port-de-Paix, police reported.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks with megaphones patrolled the streets of Cap Haitien,
Haiti's second-largest city, broadcasting warnings of the coming
storm.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers in the Bahamas deployed on several southern islands
Tuesday and more were being sent to other islands Wednesday ahead
of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Debby was centered off Monte Cristi, in
the Dominican Republic, and about 45 miles from Cap Haitien. It was
moving west near 18 mph and was expected to keep that track through
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Winds were down to 60 mph and the U.S. National Hurricane Center
said it was expected to get even weaker. Tropical storm-force winds
extended 175 miles from the center.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn Wednesday, emergency workers from the Dominican
Civil Defense woke up people living alongside rivers in the resort
town of Puerto Plata - fearing the rivers would overflow their
banks - and sent them to relatives or some of the 50 shelters.
Deputy director Ojilbiz Mercado said 250 people were evacuated in
Puerto Plata.
</P>
<P>
   But Debby's strongest winds faced out to sea and it was hard to
tell it was so close with the sun peeking occasionally through sun
and drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   In Cabarete resort village, 27-year-old Sandrine Kowalik of
Paris said the hurricane was making her vacation ''more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something that we're not used to in France,'' she said as
she walked along a calm beach. ''It's a very small one, right?''
</P>
<P>
   A 15-minute drive away, street vendor Placido Padilla, 53,
watched high waves breaking over garbage strewn on the beach less
than 100 feet from his home.
</P>
<P>
   ''They should have brought the army in here because people don't
want to leave unless everbody leaves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rain had caused open sewers to overflow into muddy roads
where children played.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, emergency officials urged southern residents to pay
close attention to weather reports. ''We're like everybody else,''
said Elizabeth Hirst, spokeswoman for Gov. Jeb Bush. ''In the
wait-and-see mode.''
</P>
<P>
   South Floridians stuffed shopping carts with bottled water,
canned food, milk, batteries and other emergency supplies - just in
case.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good to be prepared because even if the hurricane doesn't
hit, we may still get blackouts,'' said Clara Milanes, 64.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said they may post a hurricane watch in south
Florida on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane warnings were posted for the Turks and Caicos, the
southeastern Bahamas and the northern Dominican Republic. Cuba
posted a hurricane watch for its north coast and added parts of the
south coast on Wednesday. A hurricane watch was in effect for the
rest of the Bahamas and northern Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   As a relatively minor hurricane on Tuesday, Debby brought some
rain and little apparent damage to the U.S. territories of Puerto
Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and a number of small islands such
as Antigua and Anguilla.
</P>
<P>
   ''This storm was quite confusing in terms of all the various
changes it made,'' said Gene Walker, head of the Virgin Islands'
emergency response agency. ''We were supposed to have had heavy
rainfall some 10 to 12 inches of rain, and today that was changed
to 5 inches.''
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory of 4 million people, torrents
of rain pelted down seven hours after the passage of the storm,
flooding and closing some major roads in San Juan, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a 78-year-old man died in a San Juan suburb when he
slipped from his roof while trying to dismantle an antenna before
the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The HOVENSA oil refinery on the U.S. Virgin Island of St. Croix,
which cut back production Monday and Tuesday, planned to resume
normal operations Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Dutch St. Maarten, battered in recent years by a series of
hurricanes, officials reported no damage and reopened the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the northern Atlantic, Hurricane Alberto, the
longest-lived August tropical storm on record, became an extra
tropical cyclone. Alberto formed Aug. 4.

<HEADLINE> Cop sentenced to one to three years for taking bribes from drug dealers </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A former police officer who had been assigned to
the Harlem police precinct once known as the ''Dirty 30'' was
sentenced Wednesday to one to three years in prison for taking
bribes from drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Titus Mitchell, who pleaded guilty last month to third-degree
grand larceny and official misconduct, admitted that he accepted a
bag containing $10,000 cash that he thought was a bribe from a
narcotics trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   Just before sentencing, Mitchell, 30, told State Supreme Court
Justice Carol Berkman he knew that what he did was wrong. He said
he wanted to apologize to the community he was supposed to serve
and to his family.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence means that Mitchell, a police officer for six years
when he was arrested, must serve at least a year before he is
eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was arrested on Oct. 21, 1999, in a ''sting''
transaction at Amsterdam Avenue and West 146th Street in the 30th
Precinct. He was in uniform and on duty at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Mitchell approached a car in which two men sat.
He thought they were drug dealers but they were in fact undercover
officers. He told one of the men to put a bag of money in a garbage
can in front of a nearby restaurant. When Mitchell tapped on the
restaurant's window, Stanley Bailey, a correction officer, left the
restaurant and retrieved the money.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey pleaded guilty on June 14 to third-degree grand larceny.
Berkman sentenced him to 100 hours of community service and a
conditional discharge - the condition being that he complete the
community service and is not rearrested for anything within the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the 30th Precinct, which covers Upper West
Harlem along the Hudson River from 133rd Street to 155th Street,
was the scene of a corruption probe that led to the arrests of more
than 30 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   In one attention-getting incident, then-Police Commissioner
William Bratton marched into the stationhouse on West 151st Street
and confiscated the shields of several officers who had been
charged with crimes.

<HEADLINE> Albright Highlights Rights in Africa  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With American soldiers arriving in Nigeria and
President Clinton due to begin a state visit Saturday, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright says no U.S. assistance will go to
elements of the military accused of abusing civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said human rights in Africa's most populous country,
once shunned by the United States, is very much on Clinton's mind
as he gets ready for his visit and she also praised President
Obasanjo as a leader working to reform Nigeria's military forces.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. troops will help train some Nigerian soldiers for
peacekeeping duty in Sierra Leone but will avoid dealing with units
accused by the United Nations and human rights groups of executing
rebels and their civilian supporters, she said at a news conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip to Africa in 1998, Clinton avoided Nigeria to register
his disapproval of the military dictatorship then in charge of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Wednesday he would press the oil-rich country and
other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
the cartel that plays a dominant role in setting prices, to lower
their prices.
</P>
<P>
   Soaring oil prices, highest in 10 years, helped raise the U.S.
trade deficit to a record $30.6 billion in June. Imports of crude
oil rose $1.6 billion to a record $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said OPEC countries would be ''much better off with a
price that's below where it is now, but one that can be
sustained.''
</P>
<P>
   The price for light sweet crude was $32.68 a barrel Wednesday on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the price should be in the low- to-mid-20s ''and I
will clearly discuss it with President Obasanjo and with others in
the weeks ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the president's two-day visit was designed mostly
to ''emphasize and underline the positive aspects'' of Obasanjo's
15-month-old rule.
</P>
<P>
   She said reports that Nigeria officials were adopting Islamic
Shariah law to segregate schools, cane drinkers and amputate the
hands of thieves were exaggerated. Albright said the strict system
was being installed only in parts of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 36 Nigerian states have embraced the laws of the
Koran in predominantly Muslim areas of northern Nigeria. According
to reports, Muslims have been moving into the areas and Christians
moving out.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said 20 U.S. soldiers were due to arrive soon in
Nigeria to begin training a Nigerian battalion to serve under a
U.N. command in Sierra Leone. She described the situation there as
''a horror'' and said it was important to regional forces there to
stabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
   On the oil front, United Arab Emirates Oil Minister Obaid bin
Saif al-Nasseri said earlier this week that $25 a barrel was a
reasonable price for oil and it is important for both consuming and
producing countries to agree on that.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union said on Tuesday that it has asked OPEC to
increase oil production to bring down prices. EU officials said the
15-nation bloc would like to see the price of crude oil around $25
a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   World oil prices have soared above $30 this month, leading to an
outcry from consuming countries.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC, of which the Emirates is a member, has been divided over
the need for more oil. Some members fear increased production could
lead to a price slump that would hurt producing countries'
economies.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC is expected to consider an output boost at its next meeting
Sept. 10 in Vienna. The cartel provides about one-third of the
world's oil.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Has Mixed Record in Africa  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- By paying Africa more attention than any other
occupant of the White House, President Clinton has earned himself a
place in history -- and a lion's share of grief.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will make a second journey to Africa this weekend to pay
a visit to Nigeria, the oil-rich nation that the White House has
sought to groom into a great African stabilizer, and Tanzania,
where Nelson Mandela has been negotiating peace in Burundi, scene
of seven years of civil war that has left 200,000 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides proudly note that the way Nigeria eased out of a
dictator's grip into an elected government in just two years proves
that his African policies are yielding fruit and serve as a
harbinger for what those policies will generate in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been able to go from a very minimalist, very difficult
and fraught bilateral relationship (with Nigeria) to a very strong
one,'' said Susan Rice, assistant secretary of state for African
affairs. ''We view Nigeria as an indispensable partner to pursue
our shared goals of democracy and stability and conflict
resolution, not only in West Africa and on the African continent,
but globally.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, say this relationship with Nigeria underscores
a flaw in Clinton's overall approach to Africa: eight years' worth
of mixed signals.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1998, President Clinton both visited and bombed Africa,''
said Salih Booker, director of The Africa Policy Information
Center. ''American policy was muddled. The increasing
militarization of U.S.-Nigerian relations, Washington's official
silence on the brutal repression of environmental protesters in the
Niger Delta, and its refusal to provide debt relief ... belies a
genuine U.S. commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton toured Africa in 1998, the first sitting U.S.
president to take an extensive tour, his goals were more symbolic
than substantive. He wanted to shine a spotlight on Africa's beauty
as well as its problems and launch ''a new African renaissance'' of
democracy and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, on Capitol Hill, GOP lawmakers criticized Clinton's
tour as the actions of an aging hippie. On the African continent,
the president's lofty goals proved difficult to achieve, creating
an ongoing foreign policy headache.
</P>
<P>
   During his trip, Clinton vowed that ''never again'' will the
United States move as slowly on an African crisis as it did on the
1994 Rwandan genocide that killed half a million people. Within
months, however, conflict broke out all around: in Liberia and
Sierra Leone, between Eritrea and Ethiopia, between Rwanda, Uganda
and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism reared its head, in the form of deadly twin bombings
of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, leading Clinton to order
air strikes on Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS infections in Africa reached pandemic proportions and the
United States found itself monitoring a feud over AIDS drug prices
between South Africa and pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation and a major supplier of
U.S. oil, began shouldering a peacekeeping responsibility so huge
that the cost posed a crippling burden for a poor country.
</P>
<P>
   The United States tried to nudge Nigeria toward democratic rule;
Clinton even told reporters that a military ruler was acceptable to
him if that ruler took off his uniform and ran as a civilian. In
the end, it was the timing of the death of dictator Gen. Sani
Abacha -- and that of Moshood Abiola, who was imprisoned shortly
after being elected president in 1993 -- that provided the
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't want to appear to be domineering, neo-colonial in
their approach, dictating to Africans how they must change,''
Booker said. ''But in terms of economic policy, the United States
and the West had no reluctance at all in dictating. There is a very
significant hypocrisy here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed the African Growth and Opportunity Act and a
separate pact with Nigeria, designed to pave a two-way street of
trade and investment with African nations. He convened White House
conferences on Africa's future, and dispatched his Cabinet
secretaries to Africa on a regular basis, setting up partnerships
to build roads, create better housing, even make the continent more
Internet friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appointed veteran civil rights activist Jesse Jackson as
his envoy for democracy in Africa, invited several African
presidents to the White House for meetings and asked industrialized
nations to ease the debt burden carried by the poorest African
nations.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip, Clinton carries with him a meaty list of issues:
debt relief, the fight against AIDS, the resolution of conflicts in
the Great Lakes region, which includes Burundi, Uganda, Rwanda and
Congo and the spread of Islamic law in Muslim-dominated areas of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Mobolaji E. Aluko, a Howard University engineering professor who
serves as U.S. coordinator for the United Democratic Front of
Nigeria, said Clinton's comments and actions carry great weight in
shaping U.S. policy under his successor.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he says what he should say, and does what he should do,
then he would have done the very best a lame-duck president can be
expected to. He can then leave the rest to Al Gore or George W.
Bush,'' Aluko said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said even if Clinton's trip does not result in major
changes within Africa, it does not detract from the new status
Africa has gained within the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has set a new pattern, a new pace for American
presidents,'' Jackson said. ''I think that no future president will
be able to isolate Africa or African Americans anymore as they have
in the past.''

<HEADLINE> Neo-Nazis Voice Regret For Killing  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLE, Germany (AP) -- The widow of a Mozambican man slain by
neo-Nazis said she was kept awake by harassing phone calls clearly
meant to intimidate her from taking the stand Wednesday, but she
did not yield.
</P>
<P>
   Angelika Adriano smoked nervously outside the courtroom after
testifying about life with her husband Alberto, and bitterly
rejected one defendant's expression of regret and his offer of
money for her three fatherless children.
</P>
<P>
   Three German skinheads are on trial for kicking Adriano so
brutally on June 11 in the eastern city of Dessau that he died
three days later. But his widow's torment reflected the unbroken
threat of resurgent neo-Nazi attacks that has left at least three
dead in formerly communist eastern Germany this year.
</P>
<P>
   Visibly distressed, Mrs. Adriano said she feared retaliation for
testifying at the murder trial. She said she had received repeated
phone calls overnight and believed the callers, who always hung up
without talking, were from the ''extreme-right scene.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am so afraid,'' she said in an interview. ''If I had been
there that night with my husband, you can be sure I wouldn't be
alive anymore either.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Adriano was ultimately persuaded to testify by her lawyer.
Sitting across from the defendants for about half an hour, she
talked about life with her husband and the last time she saw him,
her lawyer, Ronald Reimann, said. The trial is closed to the public
because two defendants are juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Adriano said she was shocked by the coldness of the
defendants, Christian Richer and Frank Miethbauer, both 16, and
Enrico Hilprecht, 24, and would skip the rest of the trial until
the verdict, expected next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to look into their eyes and there was nothing there,''
she said. ''There was no flicker of emotion, no sympathy, nothing
at all. It was horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilprecht finally spoke up in court after Adriano's widow
finished testifying. ''He made a two-sentence statement saying he
was sorry and hoped to work in prison so he could send money to
Mrs. Adriano,'' Reimann said.
</P>
<P>
   Angelika Adriano reacted with disgust. ''I won't accept any
money from my husband's murderers,'' she declared after leaving the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers later testified that neo-Nazi propaganda,
videocassettes and music from neo-Nazi rock bands were found at the
defendants' homes, the court said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   One defendant laughed when a document referring to ''hatred of
Jews'' was read in court Wednesday, prompting a rebuke from the
presiding judge, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is frightening,'' said Reimann, who declined to identify
which defendant laughed. ''All three defendants don't seem to
understand what they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   High unemployment and lack of exposure to democratic values
during 50 years of communist rule are often cited as reasons for
the high rate of attacks on foreigners and other minorities in
eastern Germany since unification a decade ago. However, there have
also been attacks in the west, including one on an African man
beaten by far-rightists Saturday night in northern
Schleswig-Holstein state.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the three drunken attackers stopped Adriano as
he was walking home through a city park, shouted racist abuse, then
beat and kicked him in the head repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors who took over the high-profile case say the
attackers were motivated by hatred of foreigners and ''were aware
that Adriano could die'' but didn't care, justifying murder
charges.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the two teen-agers face up to 10 years in prison.
Hilprecht would risk a life sentence, with parole possible after 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   German commentators Wednesday urged the Saxony-Anhalt state
court to hand down tough sentences. Some politicians said German
judges too often treat neo-Nazi crime as routine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many judges have not yet realized the extent and the
structures of right-wing extremism,'' said Cem Ozdemir, a member of
parliament for the Greens party whose parents came to Germany from
Turkey in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would argue for sending judges to special workshops on
rightist extremists,'' Ozdemir told the Badisches Tagblatt
newspaper.

   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Only weeks after conservatives were swept
into power, the militant core of their party has reopened a
potentially divisive debate about abortion, just as party leaders
are struggling to project a new image of tolerance and consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion is, with few exceptions, illegal in Mexico, and a move
to make the laws in one state even tighter has turned the issue
into a an unwelcome challenge for the National Action Party, or
PAN, which on July 2 wrested the presidency from the ruling party
for the first time in 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   The abortion question will serve as a measure of whether the
party -- which has long relied on militant Roman Catholic supporters
-- can become a party for the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
   And for President-elect Vicente Fox, who is visiting the United
States this week, it presents a test of his efforts to project a
modern, forward-looking image.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans are eager to delve into many issues suppressed during
seven decades of basically one-party, paternalistic rule --
government crimes, ethnic and social divisions. But when it comes
to abortion, most people wish the debate would just go away.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it started to resurface in April, when PAN officials in
the state of Baja California pressured a 14-year-old rape victim to
forgo an abortion, forcing her to bear a baby boy. In this case, an
abortion would have been legal, but doctors refused to perform it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, early this month, came a bigger political embarrassment
for Fox. Lawmakers of his own party in the central state of
Guanajuato -- a state where Fox was once governor -- pushed through
legislation to outlaw abortions even for rape victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''How do you stop this thing?'' PAN secretary general Jorge
Oceja pleaded as the controversy spread across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Mexicans are having to re-examine the decades-old
system whereby middle-class women can turn to private clinics,
while the poor have to risk their health with back-alley
abortionists.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion has long been a ''don't ask, don't tell'' issue that
socially liberal governments didn't dare touch.
</P>
<P>
   After centuries of church domination dating back to Spanish
colonialism, civil wars in the early 1900s enshrined a secular
Mexico. Decades later, many Mexicans, though deeply religious,
retain a visceral fear of the church trying to gain political power
once again.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic church didn't help matters by issuing a stern
warning that those who abet abortions can be excommunicated.
</P>
<P>
   But the two latest abortion cases have stung women's groups into
protest, and Fox quickly distanced himself from the vote in
Guanajuato.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is a churchgoing Catholic and his party has an
anti-abortion platform, Fox said: ''I want to make it clear this
was not a decision by my party.'' He pledged not to push for any
such legislation at the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Guanajuato measure went through by a vote of 17-16
over the objections of almost every other party, and despite
pressure from PAN's national leadership to drop the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is unfortunate. We want to get on with issues that can
create a consensus in Mexico,'' said Felipe Calderon, the PAN
federal congress leader.
</P>
<P>
   The PAN in Guanajuato, one of Mexico's most conservative states,
continues to defend the measure, but has said it might compromise
by allowing shorter jail terms for rape victims who have abortions
if there are ''extenuating circumstances'' -- if the rapist was a
relative or diseased, or if the victim was particularly young or
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Each state makes its own laws, but all 31 ban abortion except in
cases of rape, danger to the mother, and in some cases, severe
birth defects. Doctors caught performing abortions face three to
eight years in prison, while their patients can be jailed for up to
three years.
</P>
<P>
   The laws are seldom enforced. But simply by being on the books,
they keep abortion expensive and clandestine.
</P>
<P>
   How many abortions are performed? The official line, from Health
Secretariat spokesman Jose Luis Lopez, is, ''this is a practice
that is illegal, and thus we don't have statistics on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that ''you just ask your friends; everybody knows
where to get one, or knows somebody who knows,'' says Sandra, a
31-year-old Mexico City actress who paid about $600 for an abortion
several years ago at a private clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on condition her surname was withheld, Sandra said the
clinic was in a plush Mexico City high-rise. It provided a full
operating room, nurses, an anesthesiologist and blood-pressure
monitor, and the whole procedure took a half-hour. And it was all
technically illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The poor would more likely turn to backstreet practitioners who
use injections or heavy doses of Zorrilla herb tea to provoke a
hemorrhage or kill the fetus, at which point a public clinic must
operate to save the woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   Non-governmental groups estimate that up to 800,000 abortions a
year are performed here.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Consuelo Mejia of Catholics For The Right to Choose, who
led one of the protests triggered by the Guanajuato case, said that
for 20 years she has been told that ''this just isn't the right
time to get into that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now it can't be ignored anymore, and maybe that is a good
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fox says the existing law should stay. Instead, he favors
adoption, and himself has adopted four children.
</P>
<P>
   ''An adopted child can win the hearts of other parents,'' he
says, ''and I'm proof of that.''

<HEADLINE> Big drop in heart disease is attributed mostly to healthier living  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   Healthier habits rather than better medicine may account for
most of the dramatic drop in heart disease among U.S. women over
the past two decades, a long-running study of nurses suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The findings emerged from the Nurses Health Study, which
concluded the incidence of heart disease among the more than 80,000
participants dropped by nearly a third from 1980 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Harvard's medical and public health schools also
examined some of the factors that contributed to the drop and
concluded that two-thirds of that decline was explained by the
nurses eating healthier diets and not smoking - the two biggest
factors - plus some benefit from the big increase in the use of
estrogen after menopause.
</P>
<P>
   A big jump in the proportion of nurses who were overweight, a
major risk factor for heart disease, offset some of the gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first study to quantify the contribution of
changing diet and lifestyle and their relation to heart disease
risk,'' said Dr. Frank B. Hu, a nutrition professor who led the
study.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the remaining one-third of the decline could
include the use of blood pressure- and cholesterol-lowering
medications to prevent onset of heart disease, better overall
medical care and other factors less understood, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
   Heart disease is the nation's No. 1 killer, causing about
960,000 deaths annually.
</P>
<P>
   The study was published in Thursday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norman L. Lasser, director of preventive cardiology at
University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark, said
the study gives strong evidence of what changes in lifestyle can
do.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that the study did not look at other factors, such
as exercise, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. And he said the
nurses may not be representative of all American women.
</P>
<P>
   Based on questionnaires filled out every two years, the nurses'
consumption of red meat, high-fat dairy products and saturated fats
declined by about a third or more over 14 years, while intake of
foods containing healthy fish oils, fiber and folic acid increased
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking declined 41 percent and use of estrogen supplements
after menopause jumped 175 percent. However, 38 percent more of the
nurses became overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Women tend to gain weight going through menopause, noted Dr.
Nieca Goldberg, an American Heart Association spokeswoman. Even
nurses, who know the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, can find it
difficult to maintain one, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a report in the journal involving the same nurses
concluded that the risk of heart disease was 83 percent lower among
those without any risk factors: smoking, poor diet, lack of
exercise and being overweight. But only 3 percent of the nurses had
such a healthy lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies have called into question whether estrogen
supplements really do lower the risk of heart disease, as doctors
have long believed.
</P>
<P>
   A second study in this week's journal found that giving hormones
to postmenopausal women who already have heart disease does not
prevent it from worsening.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and
other sites followed 309 postmenopausal women and found that their
heart arteries narrowed about the same amount over three years,
whether they were taking estrogen, a combination of estrogen and
progesterone, or a dummy pill.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Elizabeth G. Nabel of the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute wrote in an editorial that those women did not
start hormone replacement therapy until 23 years, on average, after
they stopped menstruating - possibly too late to help.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that it may take more than three years of hormone
use to gain some protection against heart attacks and further
narrowing of arteries.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki introduced the first
high-speed Amtrak turbotrain Wednesday that will begin operating
statewide in October.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to travel up to 125 mph, the non-electric train
engineered and tested by Super Steel is the first of its kind and
the fastest in the United States. It will offer on-board phones and
power outlets for laptop computers, and is being displayed for
several days at the New York State Fair in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the seven trains that will operate at no extra cost to
passengers have been tested by Super Steel and readied for
transport. The final trains are scheduled for 2002, according to
Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki congratulated the workers of Super Steel, saying other
states and possibly other nations will look to the
Schenectady-based company for help with the non-electrified
turbotrains.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to upgrade train signals and tracks, creating
more of them to eliminate clogging he described as a ''bottleneck''
in areas between Albany and New York. The governor also wants to
create more stops in small and large towns statewide.
</P>
<P>
   The trip from Schenectady to New York City that now takes two
hours and 20 minutes, should only take about an hour and 50
minutes. The time to travel from Buffalo to New York City will be
reduced by about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to increase from four daily trips from Buffalo to
New York City to 10 and to increase trips from Albany to Manhattan
from 13 to 18.
</P>
<P>
   The $20 million project used $10 million of state funding which
was matched by a Federal Railroad Administration grant.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak and the state are investing $185 million to implement the
high-speed rail statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said Wednesday that he hopes the train will provide an
alternative to air travel where airfares are among the highest in
the nation.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's another girl for Woody Allen and Soon-Yi
Previn.
</P>
<P>
   The 64-year-old filmmaker and his 29-year-old wife have adopted
a second daughter, a spokeswoman for Allen confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News, quoting unidentified friends of Allen's, said
the baby was born in Texas about six months ago and arrived at
Allen's Upper East Side town house shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's first daughter, Bechet, was adopted last year and
is named after Allen's idol, jazz clarinetist Sidney Bechet. The
new baby is named Manzie Tio Allen after Manzie Johnson, a drummer
with Bechet's band, and Lorenzo Tio, the musical pioneer who taught
Bechet how to play.

<HEADLINE> Report: ''Inert'' pesticide ingredients may be harmful  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The federal government should require
pesticide manufacturers to fully disclose their ''inert''
ingredients since they may pose serious health risks, state
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A report released by Spitzer's office found that nearly
three-fourths of consumer pesticide products in New York list more
than 95 percent of their content as inert ingredients, which don't
have to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, only active ingredients are required to be
individually listed by name and percentage. Labels can have just
one lumped percentage figure for all inert ingredients combined.
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 percent of 113 pesticide products surveyed by the
attorney general's office in 1999 listed any inert ingredients on
their labels, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report found that more than 200 chemicals used
as inert ingredients, though not active when used in a particular
pesticide product, are classified as hazardous environmental
pollutants under federal environmental statues.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 of the ''inerts'' are on the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's list of priority pollutants found at Superfund
sites and 14 are considered ''extremely hazardous substances,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   While active ingredients target specific pests, sometimes it is
the inert ingredients that can be more harmful to humans and to the
environment said Michael Surgan, Spitzer's chief scientist and the
report's co-author. For instance, Toluene, used as a dispersant in
some pesticides, is considered an inert ingredient but can cause
skin and eye irritation or abdominal pain in people.
</P>
<P>
   But consumers are often unaware of the possible risks when they
see the wording ''inert ingredients,'' Surgan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a classic pig in poke,'' he said. ''When you choose
pesticides, you have to make a decision based on a large amount of
ingredients that you don't know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Unspecified inert ingredients may also lead to deceptive
advertising, Surgan added.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Monsanto Co. agreed to pay $75,000 in penalties and
cease advertising claims of its products based on its ingredients
alone in a settlement with New York state. In ads for its Roundup
products, Monsanto had implied, based on the active ingredients,
that the herbicides were not environmentally toxic. In reality,
Surgan said, an inert ingredient in Roundup proved to be deadly to
fish.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that in some cases, a chemical that's an
inert ingredient - and therefore not listed in one pesticide
product - could show up in another product as an active ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the report underscores the need for inert
ingredients to be identified on pesticide labels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public is kept in the dark about what is really being used
and is not able to adequately assess possible health risks,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, New York and other states filed a petition with the
EPA, asking that the federal government require full disclosure of
inert ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has since established the Inerts Disclosure Stakeholder
Workgroup to address the issue. Surgan is one of the participants
in the 20-member panel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not made any decision on the petition pending the
outcome of this public stakeholders process,'' EPA spokeswoman
Lauren Mical said.
</P>
<P>
   Mical said the group is expected to make a recommendation later
this year.

<HEADLINE> Study: Diabetes Up Sharply in 1990s  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Diabetes increased at an alarming rate in the
United States during the past decade -- rising 70 percent among
people in their 30s -- and health experts are blaming the wired-up,
couch-potato culture of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes is closely tied to obesity, and doctors say the higher
incidence of the disease is due in large part to America's weight
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity is ''not just a cosmetic issue anymore,'' said Dr. Frank
Vinicor, director of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's diabetes division.
</P>
<P>
   The share of the population diagnosed with diabetes jumped 33
percent nationally, to 6.5 percent, between 1990 and 1998, the
government said Wednesday. The rise crossed races and age groups
but was sharpest among people ages 30 to 39.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the September issue of the journal
Diabetes Care, was based on annual telephone surveys in which
people were asked whether they have diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   A one-third jump in the incidence of any disease in just eight
years is almost unheard of, Vinicor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that would happen in a disease like tuberculosis, syphilis
or AIDS, I think there would be a public outcry, and
understandably,'' Vinicor said. ''These trends are very
disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's weight problem is well-documented. The number of
Americans considered obese soared from about one in eight in 1991
to nearly one in five in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Experts blame several factors -- hundreds of TV channels,
stressful jobs that lead us to gulp down fatty fast food, the rise
of computers at home and at work, even a construction boom that has
gobbled up space for outdoor exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's numbers show there are grave consequences to
obesity, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   About 3.7 percent of people 30 to 39 had diabetes in 1998,
compared with 2.1 percent in 1990, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   Among 40- to 49-year-olds, the incidence of diabetes rose almost
40 percent, with roughly 5.1 percent of that age group reporting
they have the disease. The increase among 50- to 59-year-olds was
31 percent, to almost 10 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   About 13 percent of the population 60 and over has the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics' bodies cannot regulate blood sugar, or glucose.
</P>
<P>
   Some 16 million Americans have the disease, and the number is
expected to rise to 22 million by 2025. Diabetes is a leading cause
of blindness, kidney failure and limb amputations and dramatically
raises the risk of heart attacks. It kills 180,000 Americans each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts cautioned that the diabetes figures reported Wednesday
could severely underestimate the problem because about one-third of
American diabetics do not realize they have the disease.
</P>
<P>
   But the sharp rise during the 1990s also could be credited
partly to better reporting methods, said Dr. Judith Fradkin, an
endocrinologist with the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Type 2 diabetes, which gradually robs the body of its ability to
use insulin, is increasingly common among children. Type 2 diabetes
is generally found among older patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids are spending incredible amounts of time in front of the
computer,'' Fradkin said. ''And when you think about the workplace,
it's increasingly people sitting at desks. Even at home, we have so
many labor-saving devices.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC is pushing for more national attention to obesity as a
health crisis, urging communities, churches, governments and
schools to get Americans to exercise more and eat better.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 6; Nasdaq Gains 48  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed modestly higher Wednesday as
investors surveyed a new economic outlook that apparently includes
stable interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   A late buying spree pushed the Dow Jones industrial average into
positive territory. The blue chip index closed up 5.50 to
11,144.65, according to preliminary calculations, after falling
more than 50 points early in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 7.75 at 1,505.88, and the Nasdaq composite index
rose 48.41 to 4,006.62.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw some very normal profit-taking early in the session. It
was simply investors responding to the Fed's decision not to raise
interest rates,'' said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis
at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman noted that the Dow index had risen 640 points in the
past two and a half weeks in anticipation of the Fed's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now investors can focus on the economy and they're going to
like what they see. It looks like the Fed will be out of our face
for the foreseeable future,'' Goldman added.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the Fed will leave interest rates along at
least until November, if for no other reason than to avoid making
interest rates an issue in the upcoming Presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's market was sector-driven, meaning no broad themes
sent stock prices in one direction or another.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks rose on news the price of crude oil rose 5 percent in
July, and that U.S. inventories are at their lowest in nearly 25
years. Dow component Exxon Mobil rose $1.375 to $84.50, and Chevron
jumped $1.563 to $88.188.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold grocery stocks after Albertson's warned that its
second-quarter profit will fall short of expectations on slow
same-store sales and higher operating costs. The news prompted an
analyst at UBS Warburg to downgrade other grocery store stocks and
helped drag down the Dow index.
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's shares fell $4.375 to $22.625, and Kroger Co. was
down 81.20 cents at $22.188.
</P>
<P>
   Banking stocks, meanwhile, were up across the board following
Tuesday's Fed meeting. Chase Manhattan rose 87.50 cents to $53.625,
and Bank of New York was up 81.20 cents at $52.
</P>
<P>
   Widely-held technology stocks fed the Nasdaq's rise. Intel
gained $2.50 to $74.625, and Cisco Systems rose $2.375 to $67.188.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had predicted for weeks that the Fed would leave
interest rates alone Tuesday, and traders responded to that
forecast with optimism, buying stocks in the sessions leading up to
the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Teen accused of murdering female friend to plead not guilty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. (AP) - A 16-year-old boy charged with killing
a 15-year-old school mate will plead innocent Thursday when he is
arraigned in Schuyler County Court, according to his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua J. Horein was charged in the Aug. 5 death of Amber J.
Brockway and has been held in the county jail without bail since
his arrest. Police said the girl died as a result of being struck
in the head with an object.
</P>
<P>
   Horein's attorney, Raymond Urbanski, said Wednesday that his
client will plead innocent to the second-degree murder charge,
which alleges Horein intentionally caused Brockway's death.
</P>
<P>
   Brockway was last seen about 7 p.m. Aug. 5 near the public pier
on Seneca Lake during the village's annual Italian-American
Festival at a park.
</P>
<P>
   Brockway's body was found two days later about halfway between
the pier and a park, on the second floor of an abandoned building
in an overgrown area.
</P>
<P>
   Brockway, a 6-foot-tall member of the volleyball team and honors
student, was scheduled to enter the 11th grade at Watkins Glen High
School. Horein, who had just finished his freshman year, is about 5
feet 9 inches tall and played junior varsity football last fall.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of second-degree murder, Horein could face a
minimum sentence of 15 years in prison or a maximum sentence of 25
years to life.

<HEADLINE> Disposable Hearing Aid Marketed  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Thanks to too much cranked up Led Zeppelin,
Rolling Stones and Lynyrd Skynyrd, thousands of aging baby boomers
are suffering hearing loss, although they don't want to admit it by
wearing a traditional hearing aid.
</P>
<P>
   The old-fashioned, conspicuous hearing aids are not an option
for many boomers worried about looking old, and the smaller,
in-the-ear canal devices may be too expensive for those who are
experiencing only mild hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   So one company thinks it has an answer: a relatively
inexpensive, disposable hearing aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I saw this type of hearing aid, I thought it would give
me the chance to try them out in both ears and have an in-the-ear
hearing aid to see if I liked it,'' said Dave Trent, 42.
</P>
<P>
   In-the-ear digital hearing aids can cost nearly $5,000 for both
ears.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was more of a financial thing for me,'' Trent said. ''The
3-month supply was $250 and I thought it would give me the
opportunity to test it out and see if I liked it. It's an
interesting concept to throw away a hearing aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Songbird, manufactured by Songbird Hearing Inc. of Cranbury,
N.J., is disposable because the batteries don't need to be
replaced. When the hearing aid wears out in 30 to 40 days, it can
be thrown away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Songbird is targeted to the vast population of baby boomers
whose lifelong exposure to decibel-blasting music, high-pitched
manufacturing noises and other forms of noise pollution has taken
its toll on their hearing,'' said Helena Solodar, an audiologist
and co-owner of Audiological Consultants of Atlanta, which sells
the hearing aid, which first became available earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome the perception that hearing aids are only for the
elderly, Songbird Chief Executive Officer Fred Fritz said the
product will be marketed to address noise-induced -- as opposed to
age-related -- hearing loss, the most common reason for baby boomer
hearing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 government study said the number of men aged 45 to 65
suffering hearing problems was 36 percent higher than indicated in
a similar study in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz says Songbird includes a microphone seven times larger
than those found in traditional hearing aids and a hearing tip that
is softer, fitting deeper into the ear canal, cutting out
extraneous noise.
</P>
<P>
   To some in the industry, Songbird's innovation is more marketing
than science.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an interesting concept, but the circuitry is not that
revolutionary,'' said Doug Hudson, Chief Executive Officer of
HearingPlanet.Com, a Nashville, Tenn.-based Internet seller of
hearing aid products. ''It's cheap to produce and it's disposable.
It's a neat idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Powers, director of Audiology for Siemens Hearing
Instruments, a New Jersey-based manufacturer and seller of hearing
aid devices, said one concern is that users of disposable hearing
aids might not get checkups as often because they don't require
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's really no mechanism or guarantee that a person would
get future hearing tests to see if their hearing has changed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Ryan, an audiologist at Johns Hopkins University, said
one of the disposable hearing aid's strongest appeals is that it
frees hearing-loss sufferers from having to change batteries as
often as once a week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the contact-lens concept,'' she said. ''It makes it a
little easier for people who don't have to hassle with the
battery.''
</P>
<P>
   Soladar said Songbirds cannot be dispensed without a hearing
test or consultation with an audiologist.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have created quite a rift in the industry,'' Hudson said.
''There are lots of professionals that are not real excited about
this product. They feel it could be a product that the consumer
could literally get refills on the Internet without first
consulting a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Users of the disposable hearing aid may also need a disposable
income to afford them. At a cost of about $80 a month for both
ears, the Songbird is cheaper initially than currently marketed
hearing aids, but in the long run might be more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The newest digital hearing aids cost around $4,600 for both
ears, but they'll last five or six years. The cost of Songbirds,
replaced monthly, would be about $5,760 for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson predicts Songbird will sell well because it is marketed
to the estimated 28 million Americans who suffer hearing loss but
have not sought treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good idea for the consumer who is not sure they want to
commit to full-fledged program of amplification and hearing
rehabilitation,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Rejected Clinton Offer  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Palestinians turned down a suggestion
President Clinton made at a summit last month that the status of
Jerusalem be negotiated after they set up an independent state,
Israel's foreign minister said Wednesday, adding that Israel agreed
to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, Israel's chief
negotiator with the Palestinians, said at a news conference that
Israel favors tackling Jerusalem on the basis of ''negotiations
between two sovereign, independent states that need not be in
conflict in order to resolve the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt has taken the lead in trying to resolve the tricky debate
over control of the holy city, and gave proposals to Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat this week, said Ben-Ami, who will travel to
Cairo Thursday. Arafat plans to return to Cairo Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of contacts since last month's failed meeting at Camp
David is to achieve agreements before another summit in late
September, Ben-Ami said, but ''we are not at that stage at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami met Wednesday with Palestinian negotiators Saeb Erekat
and Mohammed Dahlan. U.S. mediator Dennis Ross has been meeting
with Palestinian and Israeli leaders, but no progress has been
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians want a state with the traditionally Arab
section of Jerusalem as its capital, but the two sides have
conflicting claims over the city.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of the two-week Camp David summit outside
Washington, Ben-Ami said, Clinton suggested delaying talks on
Jerusalem, but Arafat turned him down. Ben-Ami told the news
conference that Israel accepted Clinton's idea.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton made three proposals: deferring negotiations
over all of Jerusalem, over the Old City or just over the hill
known to Jews as the Temple Mount and the Muslims as Haram
as-Sharif, or the Holy Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat ''categorically rejected'' all three proposals and did
not come up with a counterproposal, as Clinton requested, Ben-Ami
said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials were not available for comment on
Ben-Ami's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has said he retains the right to make a unilateral
declaration of independence after Sept. 13, the target date the two
sides set for completing a peace treaty. Israel has warned that a
unilateral declaration would bring Israeli countermeasures and
might lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey offered ideas about solving the Jerusalem issue
Wednesday, Arafat said after meeting Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem in Gaza. Cem said the Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem
are the property of ''all the Muslim world,'' not only the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem is the touchiest issue facing the negotiators. Israel
captured eastern Jerusalem, including the Old City with its Muslim,
Jewish and Christian shrines, in the 1967 Mideast war. The
Palestinians demand sovereignty over all of eastern Jerusalem,
though they might agree to Israel's keeping the Jewish Quarter and
the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, both in the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami also said the conflict must end with the signing of an
agreement that includes a mechanism to solve the Palestinian
refugee problem. He said it would be ''total nonsense'' to postpone
the formal end of the conflict ''until the last Palestinian refugee
is satisfied with the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred thousand Palestinians fled during a two-year war
that followed Israel's creation in 1948. The Palestinians demand
that the refugees and their descendants be allowed to return to
their homes. Israel counters that most should be resettled
permanently where they now live and have free access to the
Palestinian state, though only several thousand would be allowed
into Israel.

<HEADLINE> Features of Airbus' A320 Plane  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A look at the main features of Airbus' A320 jet. A
Gulf Air A320
crashed Wednesday in the Persian Gulf:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --SPECIFICATIONS: The A320 is a single-aisle aircraft that can
carry up to 150 passengers. It has a range of about 3,000 miles and
specializes in short routes. The plane in Wednesday's crash was
powered by a CFM56-5A3 engine, made by CFM International (Snecma
and GE), the Airbus press office said. It had been delivered to
Gulf Air in September 1994 and had accumulated about 17,170 flight
hours in 13,848 flights, Airbus said.
</P>
<P>
   --HISTORY: The A320 began service in 1988 and is currently in
widespread use in six continents, flying routes that range from
short European commuter flights to coast-to-coast U.S. flights. The
plane's successor, the A321, came into service in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   --ACCIDENTS: Since 1988, the A320 has suffered seven accidents in
which the aircraft was damaged beyond repair, according to the
Aviation Safety Network. People died in five of the accidents.
Prior to Wednesday, Airbus crashes had claimed 185 lives, according
to the aviation network.

<HEADLINE> Students entering seventh grade this fall need vaccinations  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Youngsters entering the seventh grade this
fall throughout New York must have received at least one
vaccination against hepatitis B to begin classes.
</P>
<P>
   The new requirement is aimed at protecting children against the
liver disease which, once contracted, can increase a person's
chances of eventually developing liver cancer, cirrhosis and other
serious conditions.
</P>
<P>
   If contracted in adolescence, there is a 6 percent to 10 percent
chance of developing a chronic case of the disease, said Dr. John
Talarico, medical director for the immunization program for the
state Health Department. It is estimated that people with chronic
hepatitis B die prematurely about 25 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jan. 1, 1995, newborns in New York have been required to
get hepatitis B vaccinations. The new requirement for
seventh-graders is designed to get immunizations to older children
born before that requirement went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Talarico said seventh-grade was selected because it is at about
the age of those students - 12 - that youngsters begin to engage in
the kinds of behaviors that allow hepatitis B to spread.
</P>
<P>
   Those activities include having unprotected sex, sharing
hypodermic needles, using the toothbrush or razor of an infected
person and being tattooed with unsterilized needles.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that about 70 percent of all hepatitis B
infections occur in late adolescence or early adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Since the means of transmission of hepatitis B are so similar to
those in which sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are spread,
health professionals will typically recommend that people found to
have STDs also be tested for hepatitis B, Talarico said.
</P>
<P>
   In acute cases of hepatitis B infection, nausea, vomiting and
high fever will occur. In less-severe cases, people will notice
pain in joints and perhaps the yellowing of the skin known as
jaundice.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, no symptoms occur.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, it takes three shots to complete the vaccination
regimen. Youngsters must have proof they have taken at least the
first shot in order to be admitted to classrooms in New York this
fall, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While precise numbers for New York were not available, Talarico
said when California instituted a similar immunization requirement
for hepatitis B, it found that about 15 percent of seventh-graders
had had the full series of vaccinations and 40 percent had had at
least one shot.
</P>
<P>
   The requirement that seventh-graders be immunized will continue
in future years until the arrival of children who received
state-mandated vaccinations starting at birth, said Health
Department spokeswoman Kristine Smith. That should occur in or
about 2007.
</P>
<P>
   ''Logistically, you can't catch everyone up at the same time,''
she said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis B is not to be confused with hepatitis A, which is
typically transmitted through food and originates with an infected
person not washing his or her hands properly after defecating. A
different vaccination is used to combat hepatitis A.

<HEADLINE> International companies rent space at upstate business park  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW WINDSOR, N.Y. (AP) - The developer of a 260-acre business
park at the newly privatized Stewart International Airport has
secured its first tenants.
</P>
<P>
   The technical software companies cManagement of Germany and Asi
Centro America S.A. of South America signed with First Columbia,
the Albany-based developer of the park, a spokesman said. Thirty
software development technicians and their families are expected to
be transferred to the Hudson Valley next year, said John Gunderson,
a partner with First Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Sales and support staff will be hired or transferred to join the
software team, but the number of jobs aren't certain, he said. He
said more jobs are expected to be created as the enterprise grows,
but there are no work force projections.
</P>
<P>
   ''These companies originally looked at Manhattan and only wanted
to be in Manhattan,'' Gunderson said. They changed their mind after
seeing that resources available to them in New York City would be
available in Newburgh, but for a fraction of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne McCray, president of cManagement, said the company's
permanent American headquarters would be based in the Newburgh
business park called the New York International Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   McCray said cManagement, which markets software assisting
construction, was sold on the services provided including access to
an international airport and major highways, as well as
quality-of-life issues for workers, and the proximity to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson Valley trade zone gives benefits on duties and local
tax advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Gunderson said because the facility was already existing and the
runway is one of the east coast's largest, the infrastructure was
in place for the plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The Poughkeepsie Journal, however, reported Wednesday that
existing water and sewer systems will not be able to accommodate
the level of transportation and business expected to be created.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way we can create these jobs and have this impact
on the community if there's no infrastructure,'' said New Windsor
Supervisor George Meyers. ''Right now, there's some question about
water and sewer.''
</P>
<P>
   With the additional strain on service, other project could be
delayed, Meyers said.

<HEADLINE> Albania PM: End Kosovo Violence  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid lavish praise from Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, the young prime minister of Albania called
Wednesday for an end to violence in Kosovo by both Serbs and ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   With the province preparing for October elections, Prime
Minister Ilir Meta blamed Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for
inspiring acts of violence by Serbs. But he said ''Albanian
elements'' not interested in stability and democracy also were at
fault.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Albanian government condemns these actions of violence,''
Meta said at a joint news conference with Albright at the State
Department. ''The best that Albanians can do for themselves in
Kosovo is to stay away from repeating the same acts that Serbs did
against them in the past and they are continuing to commit in the
present.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of the province is unresolved. Serbs want to remain
part of Yugoslavia while ethnic Albanians seek independence.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia has protested to the U.N. Security Council against an
Albanian liaison office in Kosovo, saying it would fuel Albania's
hopes of splitting the province from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians are in the majority in Kosovo, their hopes
bolstered by a U.S.-led air war against Yugoslavia last year to
force the withdrawal of Serb troops and police believed responsible
for widespread massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Albright on Wednesday again condemned Milosevic and said the
Clinton administration supported political opponents trying to
unseat him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see Prime Minister Meta leading his country into the future
while Slobodan Milosevic drags his further into the past,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   She heaped praise on the 31-year-old Meta, saying he represented
an energetic new generation of Albanians. In 10 months in office,
Albright said, Meta's government has restored public order, fought
crime, worked with the country's neighbors and modernized the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Pledging to maintain U.S. aid to Albania at $30 million a year,
Albright said the United States looked forward to a productive
partnership in the months and years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Meta, meanwhile, said the former communist country's conversion
to private enterprise has been very successful and the judiciary,
tax system and central administration also had been overhauled and
reformed.

<HEADLINE> Fossett tries again for record-breaking trans-Atlantic sail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Yachtsman Steve Fossett and his 11-man crew set
sail Wednesday on his third attempt to break the record for
crossing the Atlantic in a catamaran.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really like the wind conditions for this trans-Atlantic,''
Fossett said just before a tugboat began towing his 105-foot
catamaran PlayStation from a pier on Manhattan's West Side. ''We've
waited for six weeks and we think we have one of the best weather
patterns for the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The current record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean by catamaran
is six days, 13 hours and three minutes. The record was set by
Serge Madec of France in 1990, on board the Jet Services V.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett's two previous attempts to break the record, in December
1999 and again last May, were cut short.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a lot of problems early in our sailing program,'' he
told reporters Wednesday. ''And since last December when we almost
flipped the boat we've put in water ballast to keep the bows from
digging in. And we've made some other changes so the boat's really
in top condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip from Ambrose Light outside New York Harbor to Cornwall
in England is a distance of 2,888 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett already holds other sailing records and failed in
attempts to circle the world in a hot-air balloon.

<HEADLINE> Police file nuisance complaint against nightclub owners  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PENNSAUKEN, N.J. (AP) - Police on Wednesday filed a nuisance
complaint against the owners of the Woodbine Inn, where one man was
killed and 11 were injured in a fight last week.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief John Coffey said Friday's incident was the most
recent in a string of troubles at the nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had numerous incidents - shootings, stabbings,
aggravated assaults, theft, burglary,'' Coffey said.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint was filed against Penn 73 Restaurant Inc. and
co-owners Michael Kouvatas and Francis A. Cerchiaro, said township
Prosecutor Michael Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   Under a rarely used state nuisance law, anyone who maintains a
condition that ''endangers the safety or health of a considerable
number of persons'' can be found guilty of ''maintaining a
nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   If they are found guilty, a judge can order that the business be
closed for up to a year, Coffey said. The owners also could be
fined.
</P>
<P>
   Kouvatas, a Haddonfield lawyer, did not return a telephone
message Wednesday. Cerchiaro, of Delran, has no published phone
number.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Reinert, spokesman for Camden County Prosecutor Lee A.
Solomon, said the prosecutor's office is cooperating with
Pennsauken police.
</P>
<P>
   The fight started about 1:30 a.m. in the club and escalated. The
nearly 1,000 patrons panicked and ran to the back of the club and
to the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Frazier, 23, of Camden, was shot to death. Six people were
stabbed and three others were shot. A Pennsauken police lieutenant
and a paramedic also were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Police Capt. Robert Brandt said the club has been fined twice in
the past two years for violating public nuisance laws. More than 30
people were arrested there from February 1998 to March 1999, he
said. Problems abated until this March, when at least two people
were shot, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary court hearing was scheduled for Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Estate Tax Repeal Bill Prepared  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Setting up another veto confrontation with
President Clinton, congressional Republicans Thursday will send the
White House a bill that would gradually repeal estate taxes.
Assuming Clinton follows through on his threats, GOP leaders hope
to stage an election-year veto override attempt soon after Congress
reconvenes in September.
</P>
<P>
   ''A veto is a win for big government, high taxes and more
stalemate,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, outlining the difficult spot in which
Democrats could find themselves. ''A signature is a win for
families, small business owners and farmers who are haunted by this
unfair tax.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which would gradually phase out the ''death''
tax over 10 years at a cost of $105 billion, passed the House and
Senate earlier this summer with sizable Democratic support. But
Republican leaders kept the bill tucked away on Capitol Hill,
waiting for an opportune time to send it to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is just one part of the plan. The bill will be delivered
to the White House by a Montana farmer driving a tractor, said an
aide to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert also planned an event Thursday at a farmer's market in
Columbia, S.C., to highlight the effect estate taxes have on
farmers, small businesses and high-tech entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, Clinton will have until just after Labor
Day to sign or veto the bill, meaning GOP leaders could hold the
override vote the first week or two after Congress returns from its
summer recess. White House officials said Clinton would certainly
veto it, saying it primarily benefits the wealthy and would consume
$750 billion of projected surpluses during the 10 years after the
tax is fully repealed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more people learn about the dangerous exploding nature of
this tax plan, the less they like it,'' said White House spokesman
Jake Siewert. ''We think you could do more targeted estate tax
relief that takes care of the small businesses and family farms.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Clinton vetoed another big Republican tax
cut: the 10-year, $292 billion bill that would have eliminated the
income tax penalty paid by millions of married couples. Republicans
are likely to also attempt a veto override on that bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five Democrats joined all Republicans in the House vote to
pass the estate tax repeal bill in June, exceeding the two-thirds
threshold necessary to override a veto. But House Democrats say a
combination of absentees and a handful of switched votes will give
them the margin to sustain the veto.
</P>
<P>
   Heirs of only about 2 percent of all Americans who die each year
are forced to pay estate taxes, mainly because of a $675,000
exemption that a married couple can double with simple planning
steps. The exemptions are even higher for farmers and small
businesses, but many are still forced to buy costly insurance
policies and pay lawyers and accountants to protect hard-earned
assets from a tax that reaches 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''In essence, we've been planning for our deaths for about 20
years,'' said Dan McGregor, president of a 325-employee auto parts
manufacturing company in Springfield, Ohio. ''The older we get, the
more onerous the planning is.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have long sought to get rid of the ''death'' tax,
but it has only begun to resonate in these recent prosperous times,
notably among blacks and Hispanics who are increasingly building
successful businesses. Republican presidential nominee George W.
Bush advocates repeal of the tax, while Democratic nominee Al Gore
favors simplifying exemptions and raising them for farmers and
small businesses.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Phone negotiations moving toward a conclusion  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Negotiators for striking telephone workers in
six mid-Atlantic states and Verizon Communications came closer
Wednesday to reaching a new contract as picket lines reappeared in
New York despite an earlier tentative accord with phone workers
there.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said they have largely addressed the substantive
issues needed to replace contracts that expired Aug. 6 for more
than 35,000 Communications Workers of America employees in
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West
Virginia and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are down to the final couple of points,'' said CWA
spokeswoman Candice Johnson. ''We're very close to working things
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The company says the major sticking points have been resolved. A
local matter involving what work can be performed by cable-splicing
technicians in Pennsylvania has lead to some delay in reaching an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must say we are a little perplexed as to why the strike is
still going on,'' said Verizon spokesman Eric Rabe.
</P>
<P>
   Picket lines reappeared in New York state three days after
unions representing telephone workers there reached a tentative
contract agreement with Verizon. Striking CWA workers from the
Mid-Atlantic states demonstrated at about 15 company facilities in
New York state Wednesday, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   CWA President Morton Bahr had urged the New York workers to
honor picket lines as a sign of solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that about 85 percent of workers scheduled to
work Wednesday were on the job, but on any given day, 5 percent to
10 percent of that absence could be a result of sick leaves or
last-minute vacation requests. Another 5 percent may reflect in
part workers who chose not to cross picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   The company predicted that the net effect on the company's
operations was negligible
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that there are employees in New York that want to
be helping customers ... and not be kept on the sidelines by
out-of-town picketers,'' Rabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Those employees who refuse to cross picket lines won't be paid
for the day, but the company declined to specify if a disciplinary
action would be taken. Company executives noted that union
officials did sign a return to work agreement when they reached a
tentative contract Sunday. That agreement covered 50,000 workers in
New York and New England represented by the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and CWA.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of overtime, company executives have proposed a
plan that would move toward an eight-hour-per-week cap on mandatory
overtime over the life of the three-year contract. Workers can now
be ordered to put in 10 to 15 hours of overtime a week.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon was formed by the summer merger of Bell Atlantic and
GTE.

<HEADLINE> Farben To Create Slave Labor Fund  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER SCHMALE
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- IG Farben, the German chemical company
that made poison gas for Nazi death camps, will set up a
compensation fund for Nazi-era slave laborers within weeks, an
official in charge of liquidating the once-great firm said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Once the world's largest chemical company, IG Farben was broken
up in 1952 by the Allies, who ordered the company into liquidation.
It remains largely as a trust to settle claims and lawsuits from
the Nazi era. Dozens are still pending in German courts.
</P>
<P>
   Volker Pollehn, the official in charge of dissolving IG Farben,
said the fund would be started with an initial $228,000 in the
coming weeks. The government has criticized IG Farben's decision
not to participate in the $4.5 billion government-business fund to
compensate those forced to work for Nazi firms and in slave labor
camps.
</P>
<P>
   IG Farben had an estimated 83,000 slave workers by 1944 at the
Auschwitz complex in what is now Poland. Its subsidiary Degesch
produced Zyklon B for Adolf Hitler's gas chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Pollehn reiterated at the company's annual meeting in Frankfurt
that the holding company would not join in the government-business
fund because of legalities due to the liquidation. A spokesman for
the government-business fund said it would cost IG Farben money and
time to set up duplicate administrative structures to pay two
funds.
</P>
<P>
   A leading lawmaker from Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social
Democrats, Dieter Wiefelspuetz, called IG Farben's decision
''almost an affront'' and said not enough money was being put
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''The entire proceedings is really embarrassing,'' he told
Handelsblatt newspaper. ''It's really regrettable if a company
thinks it can get away in this manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollehn said the IG Farben of today accepts responsibility for
its past.
</P>
<P>
   The company once provided great services in the chemical and
pharmaceutical branches, he said, but ''was in a horrible manner
jointly guilty in the enslavement, degradation and extermination of
innocent people during the time of the Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, IG Farben paid $16.4 million in compensation to
Holocaust survivors,
</P>
<P>
   The company set the compensation fund a year ago at an estimated
$1.36 million -- an amount then criticized by survivors and human
rights groups who demanded much more. At the time trustees of the
former conglomerate said the fund would be established by the end
of 1999. Pollehn has blamed lawsuits and technicalities for slowing
the process.

<HEADLINE> NTSB: Fuel Tank Blast Downed Jet  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Investigators seeking the cause of the fuel
tank explosion that downed TWA Flight 800 on Wednesday focused on
aging aircraft and the problems that can accumulate in those
complex machines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer an airplane is around, the more changes and
modifications it needs,'' said Jim Hall, chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board. He said it is not clear the industry
is paying enough attention to these problems.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came as the board was concluding a two-day hearing
into the July 17, 1996, crash off the coast of New York's Long
Island that killed all 230 aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Board investigators said Tuesday they had reached the
''inescapable conclusion'' that the wing center fuel tank of the
plane exploded, probably because of an electrical short circuit.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the five-member board unanimously agreed with that
conclusion, voting to list it as the probable cause of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But they added criticism of the design philosophy that assumes
aircraft fuel tanks will always contain at least some potentially
explosive material and seeks to prevent ignition.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not possible to eliminate all possible ignition
sources,'' said Bernard Loeb, the agency's aviation safety
director. Instead, the board urged that steps be taken to prevent
explosive fuel mixtures from forming, such as pumping inert gas
into the empty portion of tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The board also approved a series of recommendations for
government regulators and airplane manufacturers to examine and
improve fuel tank wiring, to assure adequate wiring separation,
eliminate chemical deposits on wires and reduce the chance of short
circuits.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since the crash, speculation on the cause has
ranged from maintenance problems to a bomb and even reports of
lights in the sky that some witnesses thought could have been a
missile.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the aviation industry
have launched aging aircraft programs to study the needs of older
planes and how to deal with them. TWA Flight 800, bound from New
York's John F. Kennedy Airport for Paris, was a 25-year-old Boeing
747.
</P>
<P>
   Board member John J. Goglia, a former aviation mechanic,
stressed that the mere age of an aircraft does not mean it's not
safe. ''A properly maintained airplane can last forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Swaim of the board's aviation engineering division said,
however, that inspections of a number of commercial aircraft showed
increasing problems as the planes got older.
</P>
<P>
   Swaim said that although a solid body of circumstantial evidence
points to an electrical short as the cause of the explosion,
insufficient wire was recovered to know for sure. He added that the
investigation led to discovery of damaged wiring in other older
planes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We looked at other planes from other carriers and other
countries,'' Swaim said. Inspectors found worn insulation, improper
wiring repairs, opened splices that should have been sealed and
lint on circuit breakers.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, he added, wiring had been damaged by chemicals
such as anticorrosion spray and overflow from lavatories.
</P>
<P>
   Wiring checks in 25 airlines -- some old, some new -- found that
''all had some kind of foreign material except for one new 737,''
Swaim said.
</P>
<P>
   Loeb cautioned that investigators were not saying the problem
had reached the level of planes being unsafe. ''We found problems
and they need to be addressed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lychner of Houston, Texas who lost his wife, Pam, a
former TWA flight attendant, and his two young daughters, Shannon
and Katie, found little comfort at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The presentation by the NTSB has been excellent but there have
been no surprises. The center fuel tank blew up and killed my
family, and the loved ones of the other family members. That is not
supposed to happen, is it?'' Lychner said.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Breistroff from Paris, whose son Michel, 24, had been
about to join the French Olympic hockey team, is not convinced the
plane was brought down by a mechanical problem. He said he had
lingering doubts about a missile or some other non-mechanical
means.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have been explaining to me but inside my head I don't
fully believe what they are saying. I wish I could be convinced so
I could be free,'' Breistroff said.

<HEADLINE> Testimony in White House E-mail Case  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Clinton administration official said it
is not true that he threatened White House computer technicians
with jail time and the loss of their jobs over lost administration
e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   At a court hearing Wednesday, attorney Mark Lindsay, the
assistant to the president for management and administration,
reprised testimony he gave to Congress last spring, saying claims
that he threatened employees were ''absolutely not true.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he doesn't recall meeting for more than a few
seconds with Betty Lambuth, the White House contract employee who
made the allegations, and said he never told her to keep quiet
about some e-mails that might not have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to the House Government Reform Committee last
March, Lindsay acknowledged asking that employees keep quiet about
the issue, but said he never threatened anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay, 37, has been accused by Lambuth of threatening her with
jail if she talked about the e-mail. Lindsay said he asked workers
to keep quiet because he did not want a lot of office gossip on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials earlier this year said thousands of
e-mails, including some from Vice President Al Gore's office, were
not properly archived. As a result, the messages were never
reviewed by White House lawyers to determine if they should be
turned over to investigators under subpoena in cases ranging from
the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Whitewater to campaign fund
raising.
</P>
<P>
   The computer problems -- which White House officials learned of
in June 1998 -- did not become public until February, and then in a
lawsuit over the Clinton White House's gathering of FBI background
files of Republican appointees from past administrations.
</P>
<P>
   The $90 million class action suit was filed by Judicial Watch, a
conservative legal organization that has filed several lawsuits
against the administration.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth has been holding hearings for
several weeks to determine how to retrieve the messages and get
them to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In a declaration unsealed in March, Lambuth said that after she
informed the White House of the problem, Lindsay told her ''that if
I or any of my team who knew about the e-mail problem told anyone
else about it we would lose our jobs, be arrested and put in
jail,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth said Lindsay specified that she was not to tell even her
private-sector boss, Steve Hawkins, who she said eventually removed
her from her White House assignment when she refused to tell him
about the e-mail problem.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth said she and her co-workers dubbed the e-mail problem
''Project X,'' and because of the threats, she and her staff took
to meeting in a park close to the New Executive Office Building and
in a nearby coffee shop when discussing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth, who left the White House in July 1998, said she still
works for CEXEC, a subcontractor for Northrop-Grumman that helps
run and maintain the White House computer system.
</P>
<P>
   Former White House employee Sheryl Hall, who first unearthed the
e-mail problem, alleged in a declaration that ''when the
contractors told the White House about the problem, they were
threatened, warned not to discuss it. They were told the documents
were classified.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Suspends W. Timor Operations  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
Wednesday it was suspending operations in West Timor after three of
its workers were severely injured in an attack by pro-Indonesian
militias.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-independence militia gangs have also set up roadblocks
in West Timor to stop refugees from returning home to East Timor,
said UNHCR spokesman Jake Morland, adding that Indonesia's military
was doing nothing to stop the rising tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is regrettable that the militias are allowed to operate
with impunity and make a mockery of statements by responsible
officials in Jakarta guaranteeing security for aid workers and
refugees,'' said Soren Jessen-Petersen, assistant high commissioner
for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   He said the attack with sticks and machetes came as the workers
were distributing plastic sheeting to East Timorese refugees at a
camp 80 miles from the provincial capital, Kupang, on Tuesday. Two
of the three aid workers escaped, but the third was captured and
taken to a nearby rice paddy and had his head held under water. He
escaped later with the help of some refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The aid workers received hospital treatment for severe head and
body injuries, UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Indonesian army officials in the area were called for help but
failed to respond immediately to the incident -- the worst of more
than 100 recorded cases of harassment and intimidation against aid
workers and refugees,'' a UNHCR statement said.
</P>
<P>
   At best, the operation could be shut down for a few days or a
week, threatening water, sanitation and health care and possibly
even food distribution for thousands of refugees, said UNHCR
spokesman Ron Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have been worsening in West Timor since last month,
when a 24-year-old soldier from New Zealand was killed in a clash
with gunmen believed to be independence foes, said another UNHCR
spokesman, Fernando del Mundo. Some believe sections of Indonesia's
military have been arming and training the gangs.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor voted for independence last August in a
U.N.-sponsored ballot. Afterward, tens of thousands of people fled
their homes when pro-Indonesia militiamen reacted by going on a
violent rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The violence ended when international forces landed in the
territory in September. Most refugees have since returned home, but
about 80,000 -- mainly militiamen and their families -- remain in
camps in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   An Indonesian military officer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the armed forces were trying hard to disarm the
gangs. He said their efforts were being hampered because the
militias keep crossing into East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.N. peacekeepers have been killed and four others wounded
in fighting so far. Several militiamen have also been killed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a team of Indonesian officials arrived in East
Timor's capital Dili to discuss the repatriation of the refugees
with U.N. administrators. Indonesia has promised to close the
refugee camps within six months.

<HEADLINE> Germ Exposure May Prevent Asthma  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early exposure to other youngsters and their germs appears to
protect children from developing asthma later on, according to a
study that could reassure parents feeling guilty about putting
their infants in day care.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that children who attended day care in their
first six months or had two or more older siblings were about half
as likely to have asthma at age 13 as youngsters who had one or no
older siblings and did not attend day care until they were older.
</P>
<P>
   This echoes the hot new ''hygiene theory'' that says children
who do not get outside and get dirty every now and then are not
being exposed to enough germs to stimulate proper development of
their immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''This paper reflects the growing belief that the more sterile
the early environment, the more problems later in life,'' said Dr.
Leonard Bielory, director of the Asthma and Allergy Research Center
at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in
Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The findings come amid an unexplained explosion of asthma among
children and worries that smaller families and households scrubbed
with antibacterial cleansers may be weakening our immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma cases jumped 158 percent from 1980 through 1998, with
many of the new cases among children, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute, was published in Thursday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Arizona College of Medicine
have been following about 1,000 children for 15 years, studying
their respiratory health and allergens in their environment. After
previously showing that children in day care get more respiratory
infections than others, the researchers examined more closely the
role of day care and family size.
</P>
<P>
   They found that protection against asthma came from frequent
exposure to other youngsters, but only if the contact took place in
the first six months, a key period for a new immune system.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that if the immune system isn't stimulated early
in life by germs, it overreacts later to allergy-inducing
substances, said Anne L. Wright, a pediatrics research professor
who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   The children most exposed to other youngsters were about 40
percent more likely than the group with less contact to suffer from
frequent wheezing in their first few years. But doctors believe
that in toddlers, wheezing usually is due to their small airways or
respiratory infections. And wheezing almost always disappears by
age 6 unless the child has asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma, the most common chronic childhood disease, is an
incurable condition in which allergic reactions to such things as
pollen or dust mites trigger a narrowing of the airways, wheezing
and trouble breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma afflicts some 17 million Americans, including at least 5
million under 18, and kills about 5,400 people annually. While it
is partly inherited, less-understood factors also are at work.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent German studies similarly found asthma less common in
children who started day care early, and other research indictates
that growing up in the country, on a farm with animals or in a home
with a dog protects against asthma, noted Dr. Sandra C.
Christiansen of Scripps Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marshall Plaut, chief of allergic mechanisms at the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the Arizona
group's study is the strongest evidence of this idea to date.
</P>
<P>
   But he said more research is needed on how children's immune
systems mature, how that affects whether they develop asthma and
whether the apparent benefits of early infections outweigh the
dangers.

<HEADLINE> Study Looks at Drop in Heart Disease  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>

   Healthier habits rather than better medicine may account for
most of the dramatic drop in heart disease among U.S. women over
the past two decades, a long-running study of nurses suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The findings emerged from the Nurses Health Study, which found
that the incidence of heart disease among the more than 80,000
participants dropped by nearly a third from 1980 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Harvard's medical and public health schools also
examined some of the factors that contributed to the drop and
concluded that two-thirds of that decline was explained by the
nurses eating healthier diets and not smoking -- the two biggest
factors -- plus some benefit from the big increase in the use of
estrogen after menopause.
</P>
<P>
   A big jump in the proportion of nurses who were overweight, a
major risk factor for heart disease, offset some of the gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first study to quantify the contribution of
changing diet and lifestyle and their relation to heart disease
risk,'' said Dr. Frank B. Hu, a nutrition professor who led the
study.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the remaining one-third of the decline could
include the use of blood pressure- and cholesterol-lowering
medications to prevent onset of heart disease, better overall
medical care and other factors less understood, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
   Heart disease is the nation's No. 1 killer, causing about
960,000 deaths annually.
</P>
<P>
   The study was published in Thursday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Based on questionnaires filled out every two years, the nurses'
consumption of red meat, high-fat dairy products and saturated fats
declined by about a third or more over 14 years, while intake of
foods containing healthy fish oils, fiber and folic acid increased
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking declined 41 percent and use of estrogen supplements
after menopause jumped 175 percent. However, 38 percent more of the
nurses became overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Women tend to gain weight going through menopause, noted Dr.
Nieca Goldberg, an American Heart Association spokeswoman. Even
nurses, who know the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, can find it
difficult to maintain one, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norman L. Lasser, director of preventive cardiology at
University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark, said
the study gives strong evidence of what changes in lifestyle can
do.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that the study did not look at other factors, such
as exercise, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. And he said the
nurses may not be representative of all American women.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a report in the journal involving the same nurses
concluded that the risk of heart disease was 83 percent lower among
those without any risk factors: smoking, poor diet, lack of
exercise and being overweight. But only 3 percent of the nurses had
such a healthy lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies have called into question whether estrogen
supplements really do lower the risk of heart disease, as doctors
have long believed.
</P>
<P>
   A second study in this week's journal found that giving hormones
to postmenopausal women who already have heart disease does not
prevent it from worsening.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and
other sites followed 309 postmenopausal women and found that their
heart arteries narrowed about the same amount over three years,
whether they were taking estrogen, a combination of estrogen and
progesterone, or a dummy pill.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Elizabeth G. Nabel of the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute wrote in an editorial that those women did not
start hormone replacement therapy until 23 years, on average, after
they stopped menstruating -- possibly too late to help.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that it may take more than three years of hormone
use to gain some protection against heart attacks and further
narrowing of arteries.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants To Hear Fox's Plan  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, looking ahead to a meeting
with Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox, said Wednesday he wants
to give Fox a fair hearing on his controversial proposal for freer
flows of Mexican workers into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's proposal for an eventual opening of borders with United
States has been greeted with skepticism by U.S. business and labor
groups but Clinton said he wants to hear more before making a
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The devil is always in the details here, so I want to talk to
him about it and see what he has in mind,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke to reporters shortly before departing on a trip to New
Jersey. Fox, who will be sworn in on Dec. 1, will meet with Clinton
on Thursday, and he also has separate meetings with Vice President
Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reservations about his border proposals, Fox has won
admiring comments from many Americans for having defeated the party
that has run Mexico for more than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   They include some of Mexico's fiercest critics, such as Senate
Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and
Thomas Constantine, a former director of the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine said Wednesday he is impressed with Fox's
willingness to do battle against corruption and organized crime in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tend to be optimistic that an individual can change the
dynamics of a situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the doubts about Fox relate to his outspoken opposition
to the U.S. policy of spending billions of dollars each year to
keep undocumented Mexicans off U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   Fox wants eventually to do away with border controls. He
envisions the transformation of the three countries of North
America into a kind of European Union, where the citizens of one
can work in any other member nation.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that open borders among EU countries have brought
Portugal and Greece much closer to economy parity with other EU
members.
</P>
<P>
   But critics argue the two situations are not comparable, noting
that Portugal and Greece have populations much smaller than Mexico
and that their migrant workers were dispersed throughout EU
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the number of poor Mexicans is large, an estimated
40 million, and the great majority who are inclined to migrate look
to the United States -- and no other country -- for their economic
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is not looking to the United States to solve Mexico's
population surplus. Rather, he would offer incentives for Mexicans
to stay at home, including an economic program that would create
jobs on a scale far greater than what is being done today.
</P>
<P>
   He is adamant about doing away with the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ''By building up walls, by putting up armies, by dedicating
billions of dollars like every border state is doing to avoid
migration, is not the way to go,'' Fox says.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans obviously disagree and believe existing barriers
are inadequate. Six weeks before Fox's election, the House approved
a bill sponsored by Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, to allow
deployment of U.S. troops along the border to protect a variety of
U.S. interests, including the curbing of drug trafficking and of
weapons smuggling. The vote was 243-183. The sentiment reflected in
the vote was diametrically opposed to Fox's vision.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill has been approved by the House on two previous
occasions but died in negotiations with the Senate both times.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith, director of public policy for the AFL-CIO, says
open borders are impractical with two countries at such different
stages of development.
</P>
<P>
   A guest worker program favored by Fox would pit arriving Mexican
workers against American workers, resulting in a ''race to the
bottom'' between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   George Grayson, a Mexico expert at the College of William and
Mary, agrees. ''The chances of an American floor sweeper in a
Houston high-rise to get a raise are greatly diminished when there
is a squadron of immigrant job seekers waiting outside,'' he says.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - At a recent air show in Oshkosh, Wis.,
several people sidled up to the ''World Flight 2000'' booth to ask
the young aviators the same, carefully phrased question: Do you
remember Jessica Dubroff?
</P>
<P>
   ''Each one was kind of looking at the ground when they asked,''
said Daniel Dominguez, a bit irked to hear repeated mention of the
7-year-old girl who was killed in 1996 while trying to become the
youngest person to fly across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez, fellow pilot Chris Wall and photographer Jesse Weisz
are embarking from Rochester in a silver-bodied, twin-engine plane
Sept. 1 in a bid to become the youngest flight crew on record to
circle the globe.
</P>
<P>
   They all turned 22 this year. To some onlookers, notably a few
sponsors who held back on donations, that still doesn't seem nearly
old enough to be hopping across oceans, over icebergs and war
zones, through horizon-blotting clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The crew is downplaying the ''youngest'' aspect of the flight.
''It'd be a nice thing to set a record but it's not the reason the
flight's taking place,'' said Dominguez, who graduated in May with
an economics degree from the University of Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   More important is just the sheer adventure of steering
26,500-plus miles eastward in ''Dreamcatcher.'' Their 1957 Aero
Commander 560E is the same aircraft model once used to ferry
President Eisenhower to his Pennsylvania farm.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez and Wall, who have logged thousands of flying hours
since getting their pilot's licenses at 17, bought the disused
plane with a $15,000 loan in 1998. They've refitted it themselves
with everything from new propellors to sophisticated avionics and
buffed it up like a mirror to reflect its surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   As teachers got wind of the project, schoolchildren frequently
showed up at the airport by the busload. They were encouraged to
climb into the cockpit, play with the controls, ask questions to
their heart's content. The lesson the crew wishes to impart: Work
hard enough at it, and big dreams can often be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always an excuse not to go after your dream,'' said
Wall, an engineering senior at Rice University in Houston. ''We've
got to do this now. We don't know if we'll have another opportunity
- we'll have too many ties, too many responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisz, a film studies graduate from South Orange, N.J., will
provide daily photo-and-video updates of the 3&AMP;frac12;-month trip on the
Internet (www.worldflight2000.org). Youngsters will be able to
follow the trio on excursions to volcanoes, reefs, temples,
marketplaces and historic homes from Turkey to Fiji and
Newfoundland to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   The longest leg will be a 14-hour, 2,042-mile hop from Hawaii to
San Jose, Calif. Flying has ''inherent risks,'' Wall said, but he
worries more about foul-ups on the ground: landing-permit troubles,
getting stranded without an available spare part, or running into
''a guy with a machine gun asking questions in some weird
language.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is largely self-financed. Dominguez has been busy
flying freight, reporting rush-hour traffic jams for radio stations
and giving flying lessons. Wall has worked every spare minute as an
aircraft mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Circumnavigating Earth isn't so much of a stretch for the pair
from El Paso, Texas, who have been aviation fanatics for as long as
they can remember. At age 17, they managed to persuade their
parents to let them fly alone from Texas to Alaska. ''Both our
parents have been very supportive, letting us go out and live our
lives,'' Wall said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, 11-year-old Tony Aliengena became the youngest pilot to
fly around the world. Jessica Dubroff died while trying to break
the U.S. cross-country record the California boy had set at age 9.
Both children were accompanied by their fathers and other adults.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation history buffs deem it highly unlikely that the oldest
crew member aboard any of the estimated 160 or so noncommercial
flights around the world since 1924 was as young as 22. Such
flights usually make no mention of the crew members' ages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most round-the-world flights have been taken either by daring
fliers, people in military service or wealthy folks, and you don't
get into that realm without having some age under your belt,'' said
Joe Conger of Airchive, a history-of-flight repository in
Springfield, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   As for this project's cash crunch - it has drawn an abundance of
aircraft equipment and other supplies but less than $30,000 in
donations - Conger isn't surprised that sponsors turned out, to
Dominguez's amazement, to be ''so stingy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only natural for grown-ups to disparage young people,''
he said. ''Most anyone over 30 who thinks 'Would I have the nerve
to do what these kids want to do?' decides 'Heck, no - they must be
crazy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Around-the-world flights were a big deal between the 1920s and
1940s ''when it was important just to prove it could be done - and
done faster and safer and to pioneer new aircraft and new
technologies,'' said Bob Van Der Linden, curator of aeronautics at
the National Air and Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, he said, the world-weary attitude has become, ''If you
want to fly all the way around the world, then why leave?''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan forces file petitions for New York presidential ballot  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Board of Elections received
petitions containing more than 30,000 signatures Wednesday designed
to get Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan on the November
presidential ballot in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The petitions had to be postmarked no later than Tuesday to make
them eligible for consideration for this year's ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ''They looked to be OK, though I don't know whether our lawyer
has had a chance to go over them,'' Board of Elections spokesman
Lee Daghlian said. ''They'll probably be taken on as valid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan ticket, with vice presidential candidate Ezola
Foster, will probably appear under the name ''Buchanan-Reform''
party on the New York ballot, Daghlian said.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan forces had to collect the signatures of at least
15,000 registered voters in New York, including at least 100 each
from 16 of the state's 31 congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Buchanan, the co-chair of the Buchanan-Foster campaign, said
it has been the campaign's custom to collect more than twice the
required number of signatures in each state in case the petitions
are challenged by Buchanan foes.
</P>
<P>
   New York state's one-time affiliate of the national Reform
Party, the Independence Party, has moved away from the national
organization in recent months as it experienced turmoil between
Buchanan, his presidential rival in the party John Hagelin,
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura and other personalities.
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Party itself has also been beset by infighting.
</P>
<P>
   Frank MacKay, the state chairman of the Independence Party, said
party officials will meet Sept. 23 in Albany to designate a
presidential candidate who will appear on the Independence line on
the November ballot. All leading presidential candidates have been
invited to appear to plead for the nomination, including Republican
nominee George W. Bush and Democratic nominee Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan-Foster ticket will also be on the ballot in New
York this fall on the Right-to-Life line. The state committee of
the Right to Life Party made that designation during a meeting last
weekend in Armonk, Westchester County.

<HEADLINE> NTSB: Jet downed by explosion in fuel tank  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Investigators seeking the cause of the fuel
tank explosion that downed TWA Flight 800 on Wednesday focused on
aging aircraft and the problems that can accumulate in those
complex machines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer an airplane is around, the more changes and
modifications it needs,'' said Jim Hall, chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board. He said it is not clear the industry
is paying enough attention to these problems.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came as the board was concluding a two-day hearing
into the July 17, 1996, crash off the coast of New York's Long
Island that killed all 230 aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Board investigators said Tuesday they had reached the
''inescapable conclusion'' that the wing center fuel tank of the
plane exploded, probably because of an electrical short circuit.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the five-member board unanimously agreed with that
conclusion, voting to list it as the probable cause of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   But they added criticism of the design philosophy that assumes
aircraft fuel tanks will always contain at least some potentially
explosive material and seeks to prevent ignition.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not possible to eliminate all possible ignition
sources,'' said Bernard Loeb, the agency's aviation safety
director. Instead, the board urged that steps be taken to prevent
explosive fuel mixtures from forming, such as pumping inert gas
into the empty portion of tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The board also approved a series of recommendations for
government regulators and airplane manufacturers to examine and
improve fuel tank wiring, to assure adequate wiring separation,
eliminate chemical deposits on wires and reduce the chance of short
circuits.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since the crash, speculation on the cause has
ranged from maintenance problems to a bomb and even reports of
lights in the sky that some witnesses thought could have been a
missile.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the aviation industry
have launched aging aircraft programs to study the needs of older
planes and how to deal with them. TWA Flight 800, bound from New
York's John F. Kennedy Airport for Paris, was a 25-year-old Boeing
747.
</P>
<P>
   Board member John J. Goglia, a former aviation mechanic,
stressed that the mere age of an aircraft does not mean it's not
safe. ''A properly maintained airplane can last forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Swaim of the board's aviation engineering division said,
however, that inspections of a number of commercial aircraft showed
increasing problems as the planes got older.
</P>
<P>
   Swaim said that although a solid body of circumstantial evidence
points to an electrical short as the cause of the explosion,
insufficient wire was recovered to know for sure. He added that the
investigation led to discovery of damaged wiring in other older
planes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We looked at other planes from other carriers and other
countries,'' Swaim said. Inspectors found worn insulation, improper
wiring repairs, opened splices that should have been sealed and
lint on circuit breakers.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, he added, wiring had been damaged by chemicals
such as anticorrosion spray and overflow from lavatories.
</P>
<P>
   Wiring checks in 25 airlines - some old, some new - found that
''all had some kind of foreign material except for one new 737,''
Swaim said.
</P>
<P>
   Loeb cautioned that investigators were not saying the problem
had reached the level of planes being unsafe. ''We found problems
and they need to be addressed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lychner of Houston, Texas who lost his wife, Pam, a
former TWA flight attendant, and his two young daughters, Shannon
and Katie, found little comfort at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The presentation by the NTSB has been excellent but there have
been no surprises. The center fuel tank blew up and killed my
family, and the loved ones of the other family members. That is not
supposed to happen, is it?'' Lychner said.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Breistroff from Paris, whose son Michel, 24, had been
about to join the French Olympic hockey team, is not convinced the
plane was brought down by a mechanical problem. He said he had
lingering doubts about a missile or some other non-mechanical
means.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have been explaining to me but inside my head I don't
fully believe what they are saying. I wish I could be convinced so
I could be free,'' Breistroff said.

<HEADLINE> Verizon unions, with concessions in hand, focus on organizing  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Unions at phone giant Verizon Communications
fought hard for an agreement reducing barriers to organizing
wireless workers. But their toughest campaign lies ahead: selling
the benefits of collective bargaining to workers with little or no
exposure to organized labor and who enjoy an economy where they are
in high demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''The union is going to have to adjust to this new reality and
make itself attractive to the workers,'' said Michael Leeds, an
economics professor at Temple University. ''It's not a 9-to-5
punch-the-clock setting anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The company knows, too, that labor leaders face an uphill battle
in attempting to organize workers in an industry that has little
union presence. Of 260,000 employees at Verizon, 32,000 work on
wireless - cellular phone - business, and only 50 of those are
union members.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not automatic unionization,'' Lawrence T. Babbio,
Verizon's vice chairman and president, said of the accord reached
over the weekend with the Communications Workers of America and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on organizing wireless employees covers even the
mid-Atlantic region where Verizon employees remained on strike this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, labor leaders can begin in six months to
collect signed cards from wireless workers indicating their desire
to unionize. To become their bargaining agent, the unions must get
signatures from at least 55 percent of employees in a specific
group.
</P>
<P>
   The process is less cumbersome and faster than holding
secret-ballot elections. And the unions believe the interest is
already there.
</P>
<P>
   In Woburn, Mass., some Verizon wireless employees approached CWA
about unionizing earlier this year, citing concerns about wage
disparities and a lack of guarantees for long-term benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a red flag to people that they needed to do
something,'' said Erin Bowie, a CWA organizer in the area, where
several informal meetings have been held.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers and Verizon wireless management agreed on neutrality
clauses that allow each to present their positions to employees.
</P>
<P>
   But as the unions seek to attract new members, they also face
the challenge of integrating the interests of a new type of work
force, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional union focus on long-term security and pensions
may not resonate with highly mobile workers in new economy sectors
like the wireless industry, said Neil Bernstein, a labor arbitrator
and law professor at Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   The unions ''are going to have to spend some time worrying about
a package that has some appeal,'' he said. ''New people may put
pressure on them to radically shift their demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers in these high-growth areas look for opportunities to
quickly move up and get paid with options, said Mel Marten, a
telecommunications analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are areas where the union is at odds with the actual
employees,'' he said, pointing to labor's preference for
seniority-based promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say unions that evolved during a period of
industrialization and standardization now need to become more
flexible as they add members from a work force with a different
demographic makeup.
</P>
<P>
   In the wireless industry, customer service representatives tend
to be a few years out of college, as are engineers who enter the
company as technicians and monitor operations at cell sites. At
Verizon, the average wireless employee is between age 30 and 35. By
and large, he or she has no experience with organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Internet industry, the computer industry and the wireless
industry have grown up without unions,'' said Burke Stinson of
AT&AMP;T's wireless business, which agreed to allow unions to conduct
an expedited election about a year ago. Of the company's 23,300
wireless employees, 300 are union members.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of the unions in the communications industry today were
rooted in the Depression,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Baby Bell regional phone companies - offspring of the old
AT&AMP;T Bell system that provided local and long-distance voice
service - still have fairly strong union representation. Businesses
that have grown up in the past few decades, like Sprint and
WorldCom, have much smaller union memberships.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders in the traditional telephone trade have used their
contract negotiations to get leverage for organizing the new growth
sectors of the market: wireless and high-speed Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   They've had some success. At SBC Communications, the nation's
second largest provider of local phone service, the CWA in 1996 won
the right to use a card check process in the wireless division and
now represents 5,000 of about 14,000 wireless employees.
</P>
<P>
   If Verizon unions are widely successful in organizing the
company's wireless workers, unions at other telecommunications
companies will feel emboldened to try the same, analysts predict.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would certainly put more pressure on the wireless divisions
of the other Baby Bells, but I don't see a big impact on other
stand-alone wireless companies,'' Marten said.

<HEADLINE> Reno Delays Carnivore Study Pick  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno has postponed
until Sept. 15 her selection of a university to analyze the FBI's
''Carnivore'' e-mail surveillance system to give the many schools
that have volunteered an equal shot at the work.
</P>
<P>
   Reno told her weekly news conference Wednesday that the
department would post on its website at 5 p.m. Thursday ''a
statement of work and specific expectations for the review.''
</P>
<P>
   She launched the review after members of Congress and civil
liberties groups objected to the computerized system.
</P>
<P>
   The Carnivore system has software that scans and captures
''packets,'' the standard unit of Internet traffic, as they travel
through an internet service provider's network. The FBI installs a
Carnivore unit at a provider's network station and configures it to
capture only e-mail to or from someone under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials say court orders limit which e-mails they can see.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates say only the FBI knows what Carnivore can
do, and Internet providers are not allowed access to the system.
They ask why the FBI retains remote control of Carnivore equipment
and doesn't just give it to Internet providers so they can comply
with court orders.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the review standards will be posted for 10 business
days, followed by a two-day selection period in which the
department's internal Carnivore review team will decide which
university to recommend to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will ensure that all the universities what want to be
considered will be able to apply based on the same standards, and
everyone, including privacy and industry experts, will understand
exactly what we are expecting from the review process,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups had argued that Reno should just make
Carnivore's computer source code public for the widest possible
analysis of its capabilities. Justice officials said many schools
expressed interest, and some offered to conduct the review for
free.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she would pick a school by Sept. 15. ''We are
committed to having an independent technical review complete by
Dec. 1,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   The university's technical review will be analyzed by the
internal Justice review team which will forward its recommendations
to Reno after obtaining public comment on the university's
technical review. Earlier, Assistant Attorney General Steve
Colgate, head of the internal team, had spoken of having that
process finished with recommendations to Reno by Dec. 1.

<HEADLINE> Ray: Probe Has Serious Allegations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to criticism of the $55.5 million
spent investigating the Clintons, Independent Counsel Robert Ray
said Wednesday that his probe involves ''serious allegations'' of
misconduct by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Ray defended his probe after Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said
''it is time for the independent counsel to file his report, pack
it up and go home.'' Leahy said ''these millions and millions of
dollars would have been better spent on serious criminal
investigations that could make a real difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said that ''our expenditures are necessary and appropriate''
and involve ''serious allegations of perjury and obstruction of
justice by the President of the United States -- matters which
appropriately constitute a 'serious criminal investigation.'''
</P>
<P>
   The first six months of Ray's investigation cost $3.5 million,
said Keith Ausbrook, senior counsel to Ray, while his predecessor
Kenneth Starr spent $52 million investigating Clinton in five
years, the most expensive independent counsel inquiry ever.
</P>
<P>
   Ray took the investigation over last October.

<HEADLINE> Schools May Face Meat Shortage  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hamburgers and meatballs may be missing from
some school menus this fall because the government can't find
affordable ground beef after imposing new testing requirements on
meat processors this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department has purchased less than 40 percent of
the school-bound beef that it bought at this time last year and is
paying as much as 50 cents a pound more to get it.
</P>
<P>
   The new testing requirements for disease-causing microbes were
issued in June just before USDA started taking bids on its meat
purchases for the 2000-2001 school year.
</P>
<P>
   Patterned after standards set by fast-food chains, the
requirements are significantly tougher than those for meat sold in
grocery stores. Processors say the rules are unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools ''are doing menu changes; some are going to the
commercial market to buy product,'' said Barry Sackin, director of
government affairs for the American School Food Service
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not object to the food safety efforts that the
department is making,'' he said. ''... The precipitous nature of
this is where the problem lies, not the intent.''
</P>
<P>
   Illinois and Wisconsin have canceled their orders for USDA beef
for the entire year because of the shortage.
</P>
<P>
   USDA buys about 125 million pounds of beef each year and
supplies it free to schools. They pay only for shipping.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot discontinue serving hamburgers; it's a very popular
food. So we'll go out to our local suppliers and purchase ground
beef,'' said Marilyn Hurt, supervisor of nutrition programs for the
LaCrosse, Wis., school district.
</P>
<P>
   Meat that schools buy from commercial sources doesn't have to
meet USDA's new standards. Hurt said the LaCrosse school system has
enough ground beef in storage to accommodate its needs through the
first two to three months of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the new requirements for USDA-purchases say
the meat can contain no salmonella bacteria. But salmonella in
varying amounts is commonly found in meat.
</P>
<P>
   Meatpackers asked the department Aug. 1 to reconsider the
testing rules, saying in a letter that the program was ''unworkable
and detrimental to the agency's commodity procurement program, your
agency and the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   USDA spokesman Andy Solomon defended the testing program and
said the department expected to obtain enough beef to supply school
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're committed to procuring high-quality, safe product for
use in the school lunch program and other federal feeding
programs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department and meatpackers have been in a
dispute since December over salmonella testing for all beef sold in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last May a federal judge prohibited the Food Safety and
Inspection Service from closing Supreme Beef Processors of Dallas,
which supplies about 15 percent of the ground beef for school
lunches, after its plant failed a series of salmonella tests.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, the department's Agricultural Marketing
Service slapped even more stringent testing requirements on meat it
purchases for school lunches.
</P>
<P>
   At this point a year ago, USDA had bought 35.5 million pounds of
beef. So far this summer, the department has purchased only 14
million pounds and has rejected several offers because the bids
were too high.
</P>
<P>
   Processors have been asking as much as $2.25 a pound for fine
ground beef, nearly twice what the department paid during the
1999-2000 school year.

<HEADLINE> Friars, parks officials reach deal on Appalachian Trail  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - And so it was made good, and peace reigned once
again in the mountains of the East.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 years of fruitless negotiations, officials of a
Franciscan friary and the National Park Service reached agreement
Wednesday over a disputed stretch of the Appalachian National
Scenic Trail that runs through the holy land of Putnam County.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government had threatened to seize 18 acres of the
friary's land under eminent domain - taking the land without
permission while paying market price. The friars feared losing a
large portion of the ''Holy Mountain'' that is their home.
</P>
<P>
   Under a compromise deal, both sides will give a little and
everybody leaves happy. The two sides walked the trail and drew
proposed new boundaries that appeased concerns both secular and
spiritual.
</P>
<P>
   The deal allows the friars to preserve their ''legacy of
reconciliation and healing'' while creating an improved buffer for
hikers, said the Rev. Arthur Johnson, minister general of the
Franciscan Friars of the Atonement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spoke about spiritual tradition and why this land is part
of the friars' heritage and identity,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1898, the group located about 90 minutes north of
Manhattan has served thousands of homeless men and recovering
alcoholics. The friary currently holds 130 priests, brothers and
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,500-mile trail, which runs from Georgia to Maine, cuts
through Graymoor along a 58-acre easement purchased by the Park
Service in 1984. In some places, though, the easement is only 50
feet wide, and authorities wanted to buffer it with an additional
18 acres from the Friar's 400-acre home.
</P>
<P>
   The new boundaries will reduce the areas of conflict between the
existing easement and the Graymoor facilities, allow for the
upgrade of existing facilities within the easement, and provide for
protection of the trail through the property.
</P>
<P>
   Specifics of the new agreement were not released. A formal deal
was expected to be signed by the end of the year, ending the feud
between the friars and the feds.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Underhill, National Park Service manager of the
Appalachian Scenic Trail, said her group was ''looking forward to
continuing the harmonious relations ... into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The friars are among the trail's most hospitable hosts, offering
meals, showers and shelter to hikers. But federal officials became
concerned when the friary violated the easement with a pump house
and sewer pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities feared encroachment by the outside world along the
forested trail. The friary felt it was being squeezed out of its
land and any possible future expansion.

<HEADLINE> Ice Cream truck driver charged after taking girls for a ride  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y. (AP) - An ice cream truck driver was arraigned
on child endangerment charges Wednesday after picking up three
9-year-old girls and driving them around in his truck for two
hours, police said.
</P>
<P>
   John Pailes, 32, who police say has a history of improper
conduct with children, befriended the girls during a stop in their
suburban Buffalo neighborhood about 1:30 p.m. Tuesday and obliged
when they asked him for a ride, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took them through several parts of Cheektowaga, sold some
ice cream while he had them,'' Police Officer Jonathon Ober said.
</P>
<P>
   Pailes also bought the girls lunch at a fast-food restaurant,
where he allegedly told them to say one was his niece and the
others were her friends, police said. The girls said Pailes invited
them to his house later in the week to go swimming and gave one
girl his phone number. They were not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The girls arrived home as the mother of one of them was calling
police to report her missing, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Pailes was arrested in the 1990s on child endangerment charges,
according to investigators, who would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   He was arraigned in Cheektowaga Town Court on three counts each
of endangering the welfare of a child and unlawful imprisonment.
Bail was set at $15,000.

<HEADLINE> EU Growth Supersedes Neutrality  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union is moving closer to
developing its own military force apart from NATO, which is forcing
some of its members to either abandon a cherished tradition of
neutrality or be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The term ''neutral'' is going out of fashion in Europe anyway in
favor of the fuzzier ''militarily nonaligned.'' Officials in EU
neutrals Sweden, Finland, Austria and Ireland say this has made it
easier for them to join fully in the EU's common security and
defense policy while maintaining at least a fig leaf of neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   Even Switzerland, a non-EU member that history has sandwiched
between belligerents for centuries, has begun to shed its image as
the epitome of European neutrality -- at least on a political level
-- in favor of a more cooperative, multilateral view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The new EU assertiveness is part of a growing European
confidence spawned by the economic success of the 15-nation bloc
and a desire to play a larger role on the world stage. For the four
EU neutrals, it's a matter of joining in the new defense policy
plans or being left without a voice at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't call ourselves a neutral country,'' said Sweden's
Foreign Minister Anna Lindh. ''We say we are a militarily
nonaligned country with the possibility of being neutral when we
want to be neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like having it both ways, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Neutrality made sense when Europe was divided into two blocs,
but multilateralism has changed the face of the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the Cold War, neutrality was well-defined,'' said
Staele Ulriksen of the Norwegian Institute of Foreign Policy. ''It
was clear what they were neutral against. These days, it's much
more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Warsaw Pact is a historical footnote. Institutions
such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe are
playing a more active role. NATO has turned its attention from
defense against an armored onslaught across the plains of Central
Europe to dealing with regional or ethnic conflict, terrorism,
humanitarian crises, weapons of mass destruction and peacekeeping.
The thinking is changing and armies are adjusting to new realities.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this new context, however, the United States still
dominates NATO. The Europeans, pushed by France, Britain and
Germany, want to move out from under the American shadow and give
themselves the capacity to take military action no matter what
Washington thinks.
</P>
<P>
   All five of the ''neutral'' countries -- the EU four plus
Switzerland -- are members of NATO's Partnership for Peace, an
alliance program to diminish threats by strengthening military
cooperation at any level a participant choses. None of the five
find any contradiction between this association and their
nonaligned status.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is there a commitment to mutual defense in the EU's
common European security and defense policy, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   That, the EU says, is not its purpose. Collective defense is
NATO's job. The new EU policy is aimed at intervening in
humanitarian, peacekeeping or peace-enforcing in situations in
which the 19-nation NATO declines to get involved, areas the EU
defines as ''crisis management.''
</P>
<P>
   That falls short of going to war.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are gray zones,'' the Swedish foreign minister
acknowledges. ''But even if we can see dangers, the positive side
is bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of one of the two competing blocs makes it
easier for the neutral countries to get more deeply involved in
international military activities.

<HEADLINE> State Police tried but ranks are still overwhelmingly white  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey's State Police spent $300,000 on
advertising, doubled the size of its recruiting staff and sent
officers as far away as Texas in an attempt to draw more minorities
and women into the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest recruiting effort ever. It failed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a new pool of troopers that is still virtually all male
and mostly all white, critics are saying the State Police deserve
more time.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the beginning,'' said the Rev. Reginald Jackson,
executive director of the Black Ministers Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the numbers do not improve with each successive class, then
we'll have to look at the system,'' Jackson said Wednesday. ''Now
we have to give it a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's group was one of several to publicly chastise the
State Police for its lack of minorities and women at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism came after minority motorists claimed they were
targeted by troopers. The attorney general's office later admitted
troopers did practice racial profiling. One recommended cure was to
increase the numbers of blacks, Latinos, women and other minorities
on the force.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to do that began in November, State Police spokesman
John Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was without a doubt the most extensive recruiting effort
ever by the State Police,'' Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   The $300,000 paid for advertising in college newspapers as well
as radio and magazines with largely minority audiences, Hagerty
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Police recruiters - now numbering 24 instead of 12 - went
to every community college in New Jersey, Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sent recruiters as far away as Texas, Illinois and
Florida,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially the work paid a dividend. Roughly 2,800 people applied
for a position in the last recruit class. This round attracted
5,023 applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Just under half of those were white males. Women figured for
almost 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the process, only one woman remained in a pool of
105 where approximately 14 percent were minorities. In the current
roster of 2,500 troopers, about 13 percent are minorities and 3
percent are women.
</P>
<P>
   New rules allow those cut for most reasons to reapply.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson says that should help minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is disappointing, but not surprising,'' Jackson said.
''We need to let this process work.''
</P>
<P>
   Another critic said if the process does not attract minorities
and women, then the State Police need outside help. And the state
should pay for that, Assemblyman Leroy Jones, D-Essex said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The efforts that have been made are clearly laudable,'' said
Jones, a member of the Legislature's Black and Latino Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Many private firms have hired consultants to help them
diversify, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they are willing to go that route, then I think it's
clearly not out of the question for a public sector program,''
Jones said.

<HEADLINE> DCF workers protest alleged racism at the agency on eve of hearing  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE COLLINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A legislator and black employees of the
Department of Children and Families renewed allegations of racial
discrimination at the agency on Wednesday, in an effort to raise
public awareness on the eve of a state hearing on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The employees have been claiming for several years that DCF
discriminates against minority workers and families it serves.
</P>
<P>
   They claim the agency has failed to hire and promote employees
because of their race. They also claim DCF disciplines a
disproportionate number of minority workers, and removes a greater
percentage of black and Hispanic children from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on the accusations before the state Commission on
Human Rights and Opportunities is scheduled for Thursday at the
Legislative Office Building in Hartford from 2 to 5 p.m. and from 6
to 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine D. Ragaglia, the DCF commissioner, defended the agency
as the most diverse in the state. Nearly 42 percent of DCF workers
are minority, the highest percentage of any state agency, she said.
She also said the same percentage of minority workers are promoted
as white workers.
</P>
<P>
   But state Rep. Kenneth Green, D-Hartford, who called Wednesday's
news conference, said a survey of employees indicates racial
problems within the department.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 percent of all black and Hispanic workers believe
racial stereotyping occurs at the agency, while only 23 percent of
whites believe it happens, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-two percent of all formal disciplinary matters at DCF
within the past year involved blacks and Hispanics, while 61
percent of all terminations at the agency in the same period
involved minorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently something is happening at DCF,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wiggins, a DCF worker since 1984, said he believes he
has been denied promotions because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're dealing with an agency that has a systematic problem and
they're not willing to come forward and admit it,'' Wiggins said.
''There's no credibility in this agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins, who has racial discrimination lawsuits pending against
the agency, claimed that in one instance DCF officials lowered the
evaluation score of a minority employee and raised the score of a
white worker so the white worker could get promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Ragaglia said she was concerned about the discipline rate of
black and Hispanic workers. She also she was looking into
allegations that the agency's Manchester office has a racial
discrimination problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not tolerate discrimination within my agency,''
Ragaglia said. ''I will not tolerate racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy DCF Commissioner Thomas Gilman said while the department
has removed a disproportionate percentage of minority children from
their homes and terminated more minority adults' parental rights,
the situation is much more complex than the numbers show.
</P>
<P>
   He said national studies show that minorities are more likely to
be poor, get pregnant as teen-agers and abuse drugs, all of which
are factors in family problems.
</P>
<P>
   Of the complaints of child neglect and abuse the department
receives, 36 percent involve white families, 21 percent involve
black families and 16 percent involve Hispanic families.
</P>
<P>
   Of the children removed from their homes, 33 percent are white,
30 percent are black and 21 percent are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   And of the adults whose parental rights are terminated, 38
percent are white, 39 percent are black and 20 percent are
Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman also pointed out that judges decide whether to remove
children from their homes or terminate parental rights after
hearings in which children and parents are represented by lawyers.
He said that provides a safeguard for the system.
</P>
<P>
   The CHRO has agreed to hold a fact-finding hearing on Thursday
to determine if an investigation of DCF is warranted.

<HEADLINE> Exposure to other kids' germs can be a good thing  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early exposure to other youngsters and their germs appears to
protect children from developing asthma later on, according to a
study that could reassure parents feeling guilty about putting
their infants in day care.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that children who attended day care in their
first six months or had two or more older siblings were about half
as likely to have asthma at age 13 as youngsters who had one or no
older siblings and did not attend day care until they were older.
</P>
<P>
   This echoes the hot new ''hygiene theory'' that says children
who do not get outside and get dirty every now and then are not
being exposed to enough germs to stimulate proper development of
their immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''This paper reflects the growing belief that the more sterile
the early environment, the more problems later in life,'' said Dr.
Leonard Bielory, director of the Asthma and Allergy Research Center
at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in
Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The findings come amid an unexplained explosion of asthma among
children and worries that smaller families and households scrubbed
with antibacterial cleansers may be weakening our immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma cases jumped 158 percent from 1980 through 1998, with
many of the new cases among children, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute, was published in Thursday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Arizona College of Medicine
have been following about 1,000 children for 15 years, studying
their respiratory health and allergens in their environment. After
previously showing that children in day care get more respiratory
infections than others, the researchers examined more closely the
role of day care and family size.
</P>
<P>
   They found that protection against asthma came from frequent
exposure to other youngsters, but only if the contact took place in
the first six months, a key period for a new immune system.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that if the immune system isn't stimulated early
in life by germs, it overreacts later to allergy-inducing
substances, said Anne L. Wright, a pediatrics research professor
who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   The children most exposed to other youngsters were about 40
percent more likely than the group with less contact to suffer from
frequent wheezing in their first few years. But doctors believe
that in toddlers, wheezing usually is due to their small airways or
respiratory infections. And wheezing almost always disappears by
age 6 unless the child has asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma, the most common chronic childhood disease, is an
incurable condition in which allergic reactions to such things as
pollen or dust mites trigger a narrowing of the airways, wheezing
and trouble breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma afflicts some 17 million Americans, including at least 5
million under 18, and kills about 5,400 people annually. While it
is partly inherited, less-understood factors also are at work.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent German studies similarly found asthma less common in
children who started day care early, and other research indictates
that growing up in the country, on a farm with animals or in a home
with a dog protects against asthma, noted Dr. Sandra C.
Christiansen of Scripps Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marshall Plaut, chief of allergic mechanisms at the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the Arizona
group's study is the strongest evidence of this idea to date.
</P>
<P>
   But he said more research is needed on how children's immune
systems mature, how that affects whether they develop asthma and
whether the apparent benefits of early infections outweigh the
dangers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Gives Drug Aid to Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Human rights groups and two Senate Democrats
on Wednesday assailed President Clinton's decision to release $1.3
billion to Colombia to fight its drug trade, and drop several
conditions that the nation improve its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking to reporters before a trip to New Jersey,
explained that withholding the aid package would not give the drug
program and other goals of Colombian President Andres Pastrana a
chance to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said Pastrana is committed to protecting human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has submitted legislation to the Colombian parliament, for
example, for civil trials for allegations of military abuses of
human rights. And we also have a system in place for specific
case-by-case investigation of serious allegations,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official, asking not to be identified, noted
that if Clinton had not signed the waiver, Colombia would have been
denied $50 million in human rights assistance, which is part of the
overall package.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision also came as no surprise since it would have
been awkward for him to go empty handed on a day trip to Colombia
set for next week.
</P>
<P>
   But some Senate Democrats sharply criticized the waiver. Sen.
Patrick Leahy of Vermont said the human rights conditions imposed
by the Congress do not require perfection, but at least ''we need
to see consistent compliance with the conditions, and they are not
even close to that. There is no need or justification for waiving
the conditions,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn, said, ''Waiving the human rights
conditions is a profound mistake. It sends a dangerous message to
the Colombian army and Colombia's civilian leadership that U.S.
commitment to human rights does not go beyond mere rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton chose the last of these three options: releasing the
money after certifying compliance; withholding the money after
concluding the rights conditions had not been met; or releasing the
money on national security grounds though the conditions remain
unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Council spokesman P.J. Crowley noted that the
legislation was signed only six weeks ago and said it was
''understandable the Colombian government has not had sufficient
time to meet all the conditions and establish a record of
compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups in Colombia expressed disapproval of
Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a grave error,'' Jorge Rojas, director of the Agency for
Human Rights and the Displaced, said in an interview in Bogota. He
said Clinton was sending a message that fighting drugs was more
important than stopping the murders, torture and disappearances of
noncombatants by the military and their right-wing paramilitary
allies.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can Washington say that the problem of human rights is
still grave and then send more money that will worsen the
situation,'' Rojas asked.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Office on Latin America had argued against the
waiver in a statement issued before Clinton made his decision
Tuesday night. It said a waiver would ''make a mockery'' of the
congressional conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Jose Miguel Vivanco, a top official of Human Rights
Watch, said release of the aid would be ''downright
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the six human rights conditions written into the law, Clinton
certified compliance with only one -- a provision that requires
military personnel accused of human rights violations be tried in
civilian courts.
</P>
<P>
   Two additional criteria are expected to be satisfied in the
coming weeks, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   One would give legal authority to military leaders to suspend
personnel suspected of abuses. The second would establish a judge
advocate general corps.
</P>
<P>
   The assistance is aimed mostly at helping the Colombian military
take control of cocaine-producing regions held by leftist
guerrillas and, to a lesser extent, right-wing paramilitaries. Both
forces protect the drug trade and are keys to Colombia's position
as the world's leading cocaine producer and a growing supplier of
heroin.
</P>
<P>
   The most notorious incident cited by rights groups occurred
February in the northern Colombian community of El Salado. A
paramilitary group seized control of the town and killed 36 people,
whom they accused of sympathizing with leftist guerrillas.
Witnesses said military and police units just a few miles away made
no effort to stop the slaughter.

<HEADLINE> Senators Against Palestinian State  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With prospects dim that Israel and the
Palestinians can meet a deadline for a settlement, two U.S.
senators Wednesday announced plans for legislation designed to
discourage U.S. recognition of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who was joined in the move by
Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., said if a Palestinian state is
established it should be the result of negotiations between Israel
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said repeatedly that if the
Palestinians do not gain a state in negotiations with Israel he
simply would declare statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Those negotiations are lagging, and a summit hosted by President
Clinton last month with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland collapsed
without a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides last year set Sept. 13 as their deadline for an
overall accord, including a decision on whether the Palestinians
are to have a state and part of Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to meet in New York separately before the
deadline with Arafat and Barak while the three leaders attend a
millennium summit at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has begun to ease away, meanwhile, from the
deadline, intending to push for a settlement past mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Arafat's warning, Feinstein said in a statement
that ''a unilateral step of this sort by the Palestinians would, in
my view, undermine the peace process and may, in fact, derail it.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein and Lugar plan to introduce legislation after the
Senate returns to session Sept. 5 that would urge Clinton not to
recognize a unilaterally state and ''to use all diplomatic means''
to discourage U.S. allies not to recognize it, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also would prohibit any direct U.S. assistance
to a unilaterally declared Palestinian state except for
humanitarian assistance or cooperation against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions would require the United States to try to block
financial assistance from international lending groups and
downgrade the Palestinian office in Washington to an information
office.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said Barak showed ''tremendous political courage'' in
his negotiations with Arafat at Camp David,
</P>
<P>
   ''If Mr. Arafat is willing to continue to work within the
context of the peace process then he will find he has a partner in
the United States,'' the senator said in a statement. ''If he is
not, however, then I believe that the United States should neither
condone nor accept a unilateral declaration...''

<HEADLINE> Dog prompts FBI to examine bartender's car for clues on disappearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A search dog found the scent of a New
York-based travel writer in the car trunk of a resort bartender in
Jamaica, and the FBI is testing its lining and his boots for clues,
the agency said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the forensic tests should be available in about six
weeks, the dog handler, Harry Oakes Jr., who operates a private
search group, told the Daily Record of Parsippany in Wednesday's
editions.
</P>
<P>
   Miami FBI spokesman Terry Nelson told the newspaper that no
suspects have ''been zeroed down.''
</P>
<P>
   Messages left Wednesday for Oakes and the Miami FBI, which is
assisting Jamaican police, were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Oakes and his search dog, Valorie, were in Jamaica Aug. 13-20,
nearly three months since the disappearance of Claudia Kirschhoch,
a Morristown native.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, reached Wednesday, dismissed suggestions that the
dog found evidence relating to Claudia.
</P>
<P>
   ''To jump to that conclusion is totally ridiculous and very
upsetting to us,'' Fred Kirschhoch said. He declined to comment
further.
</P>
<P>
   Oakes, who operates International K-9 Search and Rescue
Services, of Portland, Ore., volunteered to search for free, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The bartender has admitted having a date with the 29-year-old
resident of Queens, N.Y., a day before she was last seen, a Sandals
Resorts International official said last month.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Grant, a bartender at Sandals-owned Beaches Negril,
originally told investigators that he did not know the Morristown
native, according to the Sandals official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschhoch, an editor for Frommer's Travel Guides in New York,
arrived in Jamaica on May 24, as part of a Sandals-sponsored tour
for travel writers which was to continue to Cuba. But when the Cuba
leg was canceled because of visa problems and all flights back to
New York were booked, she opted to stay at Beaches as a guest of
Sandals.
</P>
<P>
   Grant eventually told FBI agents that he took Kirschhoch to a
local bar the night of May 26 and then accompanied her to the
hotel, the Sandals official has said.
</P>
<P>
   She was last seen the following day in the lobby at Beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, who still live in Morristown, reported her missing
on June 2 when she failed to check out of Beaches or call.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her belongings were still in her hotel room, except for
her notebook, which she took wherever she went, a blue bathing
suit, and a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   The Sandals official said Grant has been fired for violating a
policy prohibiting staff members from dating guests.
</P>
<P>
   A $50,000 reward is being offered for information leading to
Kirschhoch.
</P>
<P>
   Her family has a toll-free number, 1-888-967-9300, for tips on
the case.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 6; Nasdaq Gains 53  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed modestly higher Wednesday as
investors surveyed a new economic outlook that apparently includes
stable interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   A late buying spree pushed the Dow Jones industrial average into
positive territory. The blue chip index closed up 5.50 at
11,144.65, after falling more than 50 points early in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 7.84 at 1,505.97, and the Nasdaq composite index
rose 52.80 to 4,011.01. It was the first time since July 25 that
the technology-dominated index closed above 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw some very normal profit-taking early in the session. It
was simply investors responding to the Fed's decision not to raise
interest rates,'' said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis
at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman noted that the Dow index had risen 640 points in the
past two and a half weeks in anticipation of the Fed's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now investors can focus on the economy and they're going to
like what they see. It looks like the Fed will be out of our face
for the foreseeable future,'' Goldman added.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, economic indicators had signaled that the Fed's
14-month strategy of raising interest rates to cool the economy and
keep inflation at bay was working.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts now believe the Fed will leave rates along at least
until November, if for no other reason than to avoid making
interest rates an issue in the upcoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's market was sector-driven, meaning no broad themes
sent stock prices in one direction or another.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks rose on news that the price of crude oil rose 5
percent in July, and that U.S. inventories are at their lowest in
nearly 25 years. Dow component Exxon Mobil rose $1.375 to $84.50,
and Chevron jumped $1.563 to $88.188.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sold grocery stocks after Albertson's warned that its
second-quarter profit will fall short of expectations on slow sales
and higher operating costs. The news prompted an analyst at UBS
Warburg to downgrade other grocery store stocks and helped drag
down the Dow index.
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's shares fell $4.312 to $22.688, and Kroger Co. was
down 81.20 cents at $22.188.
</P>
<P>
   Banking stocks, meanwhile, were up across the board following
Tuesday's Fed meeting. The prospect of stable interest rates made
investors optimistic that banks' profits would remain healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan rose 87.50 cents to $53.625, and Bank of New
York was up 81.20 cents at $52.
</P>
<P>
   Widely-held technology stocks fed the Nasdaq's rise. Intel
gained $2.50 to $74.625, and Cisco Systems rose $2.375 to $67.188.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.06 billion shares,
up from Tuesday's pace of 1.01 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 0.42 to 517.88.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.11 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 0.23 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.28 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.18 percent.

<HEADLINE> White House Computer System Blamed  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An ''antiquated and unstable'' computer system
that crashed repeatedly is responsible for thousands of e-mails
lost in 1998, a top White House official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problems were so numerous that I couldn't even name
(them),'' said attorney Mark Lindsay. ''Our whole information
technology architecture was a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   At a court hearing on the missing e-mails, Lindsay, assistant to
the president for management and administration, said the problem
was fixed, for the most part, by a 1999 upgrade performed to head
off expected Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials earlier this year said thousands of
e-mails, including some from Vice President Al Gore's office, were
not properly archived. As a result, the messages were never
reviewed by White House lawyers to determine if they should be
turned over under subpoena to investigators probing cases ranging
from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Whitewater to campaign fund
raising.
</P>
<P>
   In court on Wednesday, the 37-year-old Lindsay, who was formerly
general counsel for the White House's Office of Administration,
rebuffed accusations in the case that he threatened White House
computer technicians with jail time and the loss of their jobs over
the lost e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony was virtually a reprise of what he told Congress
last spring: Claims that he threatened employees were ''absolutely
not true.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he doesn't recall meeting for more than a few
seconds with Betty Lambuth, the White House contract employee who
made the allegations, and said he never told her to keep quiet
about the e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to the House Government Reform Committee last
March, Lindsay acknowledged asking that employees not to gossip
about the matter, but said he never threatened anyone. Lindsay has
been accused by Lambuth of threatening her with jail if she talked
about the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The computer problems -- which White House officials learned of
in June 1998 -- did not become public until February, and then in a
lawsuit over the Clinton White House's gathering of FBI background
files of Republican appointees from past administrations.
</P>
<P>
   The $90 million class action suit was filed by Judicial Watch, a
conservative legal organization that has filed several lawsuits
against the administration.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth has been holding hearings for
several weeks to determine how to retrieve the messages.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Lindsay said he told then-Deputy Chief of Staff
John Podesta and White House counsel Charles Ruff about the e-mail
glitch in June 1998, but never spoke to Clinton himself about the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth said she and her co-workers dubbed the e-mail problem
''Project X,'' and because of the threats, she and her staff took
to meeting in a park close to the New Executive Office Building and
in a nearby coffee shop when discussing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth, who left the White House in July 1998, said she still
works for CEXEC, a subcontractor for Northrop-Grumman that helps
run and maintain the White House computer system.
</P>
<P>
   Former White House employee Sheryl Hall, who first unearthed the
e-mail problem, alleged in a declaration that ''when the
contractors told the White House about the problem, they were
threatened, warned not to discuss it. They were told the documents
were classified.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay on Wednesday said he never called the documents
classified, saying he wasn't cleared to discuss classified issues.

<HEADLINE> NPR in Flap Linked to 'Survivor'  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Like many other media outlets in the country,
National Public Radio ran a story Wednesday about a widely
anticipated broadcast coming up later that day: the final episode
of ''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the piece, NPR did an on-air interview with Fortune
magazine columnist and author Stanley Bing about what the show
tells us about office politics and human behavior. What NPR didn't
know at the time is that Stanley Bing's real name is Gil Schwartz,
the top spokesman for CBS, which airs ''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   NPR, having discovered Bing's other identity after being asked
about it by The Associated Press, plans to air a clarification
about the matter Thursday on ''Morning Edition,'' the same show
that ran the original story.
</P>
<P>
   NPR spokeswoman Jess Sarmiento said reporter Madeline Brand did
not know about the link between Bing and CBS and would never have
used the comments had she known. She said it was ''outrageous''
that Schwartz, knowing the interview was about ''Survivor,'' did
not make his affiliation known.
</P>
<P>
   Brand had contacted Schwartz through Fortune after seeing a copy
of his book ''What Would Machiavelli Do,'' which deals with office
politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the radio interview, Schwartz said the show ''has most, most
definitely proven that it is, in fact, the mean that inherit the
earth. The world is run by people who are beady-eyed and out for
No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz acknowledged in an interview that he should have made
his role at CBS known to the NPR reporter. ''It would have been
smart to clear the issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been longing to speak about what I, like the rest of
America, am watching. I've seen a lot of news stories where experts
that have thoughts on organizational politics have given their
views -- and Stanley Bing wanted to talk about it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Olsen Set to Challenge Marcus for Democratic chairmanship  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A week after one of their own ascended to
the national ticket for the first time, Connecticut Democrats are
bracing for a fight over who will lead them.
</P>
<P>
   State AFL-CIO President John W. Olsen sent out a letter this
week telling party leaders that he is considering running for
Democratic state chairman against longtime Chairman Ed Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen's letter, which was sent to members of the state central
committee, town chairs and other influential Democrats, comes as
party members returned from the Democratic National Convention,
where Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman was nominated for vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Olsen's letter, as much as the substance, raised
eyebrows among some Democrats, who questioned whether the party
would lose focus on the November elections because of the latest
challenge to Marcus' rocky rule.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus admitted it could be a distraction, but said he was
confident he had support from ''the vast majority'' of the
72-member state central committee. Election of the state chairman
is scheduled for Dec. 13 - five weeks after the Nov. 7 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   ''My reaction to all this is that everybody has the right to run
for anything he chooses,'' Marcus said Wednesday. ''I intend to
spend my time between now and Nov. 7 campaigning for the
Gore-Lieberman ticket and everyone else on the Democratic ticket,
and I would suggest (Olsen) do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen, who has clashed frequently with Marcus over the years,
agreed that the race for chairman was secondary to the Nov. 7
elections, but said deciding who leads the party is crucial to its
future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people would call any democratic election a
distraction,'' he said. ''I think the old (Soviet) Politburo used
to say that elections were distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, which was obtained by the Associated Press, Olsen
said that in order to win the governor's mansion in 2002, Democrats
''must re-examine, rebuild and reinvigorate our state Democratic
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the party needs to improve its fundraising, take
better advantage of the media - including cable TV, radio and the
Internet - and broaden its base to reach independent voters and
those turned off by the political process, Olsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen said he will decide soon - within a few weeks - whether to
run against Marcus. If he does, it would be the latest in a series
of challenges Marcus has faced since becoming party boss in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, U.S. Sen. Christopher Dodd and a group of
disaffected Democrats, including Olsen, tried to topple Marcus,
saying Barbara Kennelly's dismal performance in the 1998 governor's
race was evidence of the need for fresh leadership.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 party leaders signed a petition urging Marcus to
step down. Marcus refused, and in the end, garnered enough support
from the state central committee to win another two-year term
without a formal opponent.
</P>
<P>
   This latest challenge will end in a similar result, Marcus
predicted,
</P>
<P>
   But Leo Canty, a spokesman for the Connecticut Federation of
Educational and Professional Employees and a member of the AFL-CIO,
said Olsen's candidacy should not be discounted.
</P>
<P>
   ''John is a proven organizer, motivator and activator,'' Canty
said. ''He does for the labor movement what the Democratic party is
in dire need of at the statewide level.''

<HEADLINE> Camden patrolman charged with tipping off drug dealer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A Camden police officer was arrested
Wednesday after identifying an undercover officer to a drug dealer,
the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrolman David T. Dupree, 26, identified the undercover officer
to a known drug dealer at an open-air drug market during an
operation by a narcotics task force Tuesday night, said Prosecutor
Lee A. Solomon. Dupree lives near the drug market.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon called the allegations ''most disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If proven true, Officer Dupree not only compromised an ongoing
investigation but also risked the lives of his fellow officers,''
Solomon said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Dupree was arrested and charged with official misconduct. He was
suspended without pay. If he's found guilty, he will be fired, said
Police Chief Robert Allenbach.
</P>
<P>
   Dupree was released on $50,000 bail Wednesday morning. If
convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Senator Wants Crash Revisited  </HEADLINE>
By LIB QUAID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senator wants the Air Force to look into why
no disciplinary action was taken after investigators found safety,
training and morale problems contributed to a helicopter accident
that killed 12 airmen two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I respect the judgment of our military professionals, but this
case needs another look,'' said Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., who
on Wednesday asked the Air Force to review the accountability of
senior officers involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand that our military professionals have been ordered
to do more with less, but was this squadron pushed too far?''
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force spokesman at the Pentagon, Lou Timmons, said the
letter was received and officials are working on a response, which
Bond requested by Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Two HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters collided in midair the night of
Sept. 3, 1998, during a training mission over Nevada. The victims,
six aboard each aircraft, were members of the 66th Rescue Squadron
stationed at Nellis Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   While pilot error was the cause, the accident investigation
board said the 57th Operations Group commander, Col. Larry New, was
aware of safety, training and morale problems that also contributed
to the crash, yet failed to fix them or warn the commander of the
57th Wing, Brig. Gen. Theodore Lay.
</P>
<P>
   The other problems had been identified in a ''health-risk
assessment'' ordered by New a year before the crash. His only
response was to fire the squadron commander, Lt. Col. Charles
McCausland.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from Bond, who serves on the defense spending panel
of the Senate Appropriations Committee, was prompted by the brother
of Capt. Karl Youngblood, a pilot killed in the collision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very obvious to anybody who reads the report that there
was a total breakdown in the chain of command,'' said John
Youngblood of Fenton, Mo. ''Nobody has been held accountable for
this. There are 12 families that still remember what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Dreifus, a former Air Force lawyer who served on the
10-member accident investigation board, said the panel believed New
should be disciplined, though it made no such recommendation in its
report.
</P>
<P>
   The military looked again at the crash earlier this year when
New was named to take over the 33rd Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force
Base. After an inquiry by the Air Force Times newspaper, Air Combat
Command commander Gen. John Jumper withdrew the offer to New.
</P>
<P>
   ''While Colonel New's career-long record of performance
demonstrates he is a highly capable officer, his association with
this accident, and the continuing news media scrutiny it draws,
will detract from his ability to effectively lead the wing,''
Jumper said in announcing his decision July 10.

<HEADLINE> FTC Completes Travel Industry Sweep  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission charged three
more travel companies Wednesday in its latest sweep for fraudulent
deals the agency says cost consumers hundreds of thousands of
dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
   The sweep, called ''Operation Travel Unravel,'' is the third in
the last four years. The FTC said the companies misrepresented
package costs, among other questionable marketing activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're working diligently to ensure that consumers' plans for
enjoyable travel do not unravel and we appreciate the help we have
gotten nationwide in focusing attention on the continuing problem
of travel-related fraud and misrepresentation,'' said Jodie
Bernstein, director of the commission's consumer protection
division.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said Leisure Time Marketing Inc. allegedly
misrepresented the total cost of the package offered and failed to
disclose that vacationers were required to attend a timeshare sales
presentation. The Cocoa Beach, Fla., company was also accused of
sending unsolicited faxes to advertise their packages, violating
telemarketing rules by failing to disclose costs and restrictions
on those advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Clearwater, Fla.-based Med Resorts International Inc. is accused
of not telling customers about restrictions to vacation travel
memberships, as well as not disclosing the total cost of the
membership.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said Epic Resorts Inc. of King of Prussia, Pa., also
allegedly didn't tell consumers the total cost of their travel
packages, as well as ''cold-calling'' consumers -- based on leads
obtained at public events where consumers registered to win a
vacation -- making untrue statements in their sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the FTC announced a settlement of another travel
fraud case in a previous sweep, ''Operation Trip Trap.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, American International Travel Services,
Inc., of Deerfield Beach, Fla., will pay $1 million back to
consumers, in addition to the $1.4 million already refunded, and
will be required to post a $200,000 bond before engaging in
telemarketing travel-related products in the future. The settlement
will still need to be approved by a judge before taking effect.
</P>
<P>
   The latest announcements cap investigations by the FTC and 19
state law enforcement agencies, resulting in 85 complaints for
alleged consumer fraud violations by travel companies.

By JOSH MARGOLIN
The Star-Ledger of Newark
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - By its nature, Grove Street Cemetery is a
holy place. It also is a historic place, its dead a testament to
what was once a thriving Jewish community in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   But the 99-year-old cemetery is also a forgotten place. There
aren't many burials there anymore, and the grounds are littered
with broken beer bottles, White Castle boxes and even the receiver
from a pay phone. Fences are broken, and many of the tombstones
have been knocked off their pedestals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the all-Jewish cemetery remains an important link to the
past, and recently a dozen volunteers returned to the site to
record the history of the unknown number of Jews who are buried
there.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are thousands more to be done,'' Alice Gould, organizer
of the cataloging project, said of the markers. ''We're helping to
preserve the history of the Jews in Newark by making sure the
people who are buried here have their histories preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould, a Newark native who now lives in West Caldwell, began
cataloging gravestones at Jewish cemeteries throughout Newark five
years ago with her husband, Robert. She has continued on her own
since his death in 1998 and plans to write a book on the Jewish
cemeteries of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Gould, who is working with the Jewish Federation of MetroWest,
makes pilgrimages to the Grove Street Cemetery on the rare occasion
of a burial or when she leads a group of volunteers. The group will
return Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The cataloging involves recording the names, dates and any other
information on the tombstones. The information is being included in
a Worldwide Burial Registry, an online database of Jewish grave
histories being compiled by JewishGen Inc. and the International
Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the history in Europe that was lost during the
Holocaust and aided by the advent of computerized databases,
cataloging projects like the one at Grove Street have popped up
around the world as a means of keeping track of histories that
would otherwise be gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   Since beginning the project, Gould and her volunteers have
recorded the histories of 13,000 members of Newark's once-thriving
Jewish community. People like Esther Form, who died on Sept. 2,
1941, at age 26. And Mollie Bierholtz, who was 103 when she died
March 24, 1950. And Harold Berkowitz, who was 18 when he died on
Nov. 19, 1936, and whose headstone had been knocked over.
</P>
<P>
   During their lives, the dead of Grove Street were laborers or
teachers or rabbis. Some were simply fathers, mothers and children.
But in death, they have become cloaked in the obscurity left behind
when most of Newark's Jewish population fled to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The city that once boasted 58,000 Jews and was the
seventh-largest urban Jewish community in America in 1948 now has
only a few hundred. Many who were part of that once-vibrant
community are now buried at Grove Street Cemetery, in the shadows
of the Pabst brewery on South Orange Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are very few burials now. Very few visitors,'' Gould
said. ''Most people don't want to be buried here anymore because
people are afraid to visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Gould and her volunteers copied down as much
information as they could from the English and Hebrew etchings on
the stones. In some cases, there were just a few facts - name, age,
date of death - but some of the stones featured detailed
information, including the names of parents and other family
members.
</P>
<P>
   Those details help the genealogical documenters push even
further back as they try to connect families that have been
separated by decades and thousands of miles.
</P>
<P>
   Besides cataloging, the volunteers cleaned up the graveyard,
trimming some of the brush and gathering up trash.
</P>
<P>
   Seymour Zandell of Morris Plains even brought a homemade pulley
contraption he designed to lift fallen tombstones back into place.
After a couple of false starts, he managed to restore Harold
Berkowitz's stone to its upright position.
</P>
<P>
   Through smiles and the silence of a sunny Sunday morning, the
volunteers moved from row to row.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important,'' said Alan Zelazo of Parsippany, who
volunteered with his 12-year-old son, Jonathan. ''It's something we
both like to do and it's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Zelazo, who decided to volunteer for the Newark project
in preparation for his bar mitzvah, said it's even more than the
kind of history you could get from a school book.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's actually kind of cool because you are able to help.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Defense Fund Raises Money  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the help of some of the Democratic
Party's biggest donors, President Clinton's legal defense fund
raised more than $1 million this year. But he and Hillary Rodham
Clinton still owe about $4 million in legal fees, fund officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   More bills are expected from Clinton's fight to keep his law
license in Arkansas. And he faces the lingering possibility of
indictment after he leaves office for his conduct in the Monica
Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our view, we've come a very long way, but we still have a
ways to go,'' said Anthony Essaye, the fund's executive director.
It has raised about $8 million over 2&AMP;frac12; years.
</P>
<P>
   Donors giving the $10,000 maximum to the legal fund this year
include Peter Angelos, a trial lawyer and owner of the Baltimore
Orioles; Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax Films; Eli Broad,
chairman of SunAmerica, the insurance giant; Fred Eychaner,
president of Newsweb Corp.; and Lew Wasserman, chairman emeritus of
Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Three of them -- Broad, Eychaner, and Wasserman -- also gave
$10,000 apiece for legal fees in both 1998 and 1999. Angelos and
Weinstein gave $10,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The five men, their wives and their companies have given $1.8
million in unregulated soft money contributions to Democratic Party
committees since Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Their donations helped the Clinton fund take in $1.1 million
since Jan. 1, including $950,000 during the first six months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, during the last six months of 1999, the fund
received $800,000 in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Essaye said the Clintons still owe $4 million in legal fees for
the multifaceted independent counsel's investigation and the Paula
Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   None of the money has gone to pay Clinton's $850,000
out-of-court settlement with Jones nor the $90,000 in penalties
that a federal court judge imposed on the president for giving
false testimony in the Jones case about his relationship with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The fund will pay Clinton's legal expenses as he fights an
Arkansas state disciplinary panel's request that he lose his law
license because of his false testimony.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts to conceal the relationship with Lewinsky led to
Clinton's impeachment by the House on perjury and obstruction of
justice charges and acquittal in the Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Independent Counsel Robert Ray confirmed that a new
grand jury is looking at the president's conduct in the Lewinsky
scandal as prosecutors decide whether to bring criminal charges
after he leaves office in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's going to happen is totally out of our control,'' Essaye
said.
</P>
<P>
   Essaye said the fund will keep raising money through the end of
the Clinton presidency, and then the trustees will decide what to
do after that.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money for the fund has been raised through direct
mail appeals; 96 percent of the 104,000 contributions received have
been $100 or less.
</P>
<P>
   But the fund also has sought five-figure contributions,
including new donations from previous givers. Contributions are
capped at $10,000 a year.

<HEADLINE> Bolivians Question Archaeologists  </HEADLINE>
By PETER McFARREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Italian archaeologists say they have
found a 600-foot wall under the waters of Lake Titicaca that could
be part of an ancient temple, but Bolivian experts said Wednesday
the structure was part of a terraced agricultural field.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Tuesday by the Akakaor Geographical Exploring
Society has set off a slew of refutations from Bolivian experts and
government officials, who disputed the Italian group's claim that
its 15-day trip was the first underground expedition in Titicaca,
considered the largest and holiest lake in the Andes.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bolivian archaeologist Carlos Ponce Sanjines, there
have been at least 12 expeditions in Titicaca, including those by
French explorer Jacques Cousteau in 1968 in a submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo Epis, the head of the Akakaor expedition, said Tuesday
the group found an underwater temple and several Inca-period
objects in an area around the Islands of the Sun and Moon, 90 miles
north of La Paz. The trip was funded by ENTEL, a Bolivian
telecommunication company owned by the Italian company STET.
</P>
<P>
   Epis' group had left La Paz Wednesday and could not immediately
be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian expedition said they found a structure 600 feet long
and 150 feet wide near the Island of the Moon. Initial findings
indicate it is 1,000 to 1,500 years old, Epis said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bolivian Vice Minister of Culture Antonio Eguino said the
structure was not a temple.
</P>
<P>
   ''The information we have indicates they found a wall that we
believe was part of a terraced agricultural field,'' Eguino said.
''There is no evidence indicating the wall was part of a temple.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Reinhard, an American archaeologist who discovered an Inca
mummy in southern Peru, says there have been several underground
expeditions in Lake Titicaca, including the area the Italians were
exploring this month.
</P>
<P>
   Eguino also criticized the way the Italian group handled the
Bolivian archaeologist who guided them to the site, noting that he
wasn't even mentioned at their news conference. Bolivia requires
that a local archaeologist be on any such trip. If the underwater
structure does turn out to be something, he said, the Italians
should have given proper credit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was convenient for the Italians to take credit for a
discovery as if they had done it on their own without considering
Bolivian cooperation and previous expeditions,'' Eguino said.
</P>
<P>
   Near Lake Titicaca arose the population and ceremonial center of
the Tiwanaku civilization, one of the most important in South
America. The Tiwanaku began its rise over 1,000 years ago,
extending far into Peru, northern Chile and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The Incas believed they originated from Lake Titicaca and the
deity Viracocha began his acts of creation there. Several legends
described underwater cities and treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous ceremonial sites were built along the lake's shores,
indicating it was considered sacred at least 2,000 years ago,
Reinhard says.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Spanish conquest in the 1500s, one of the
most important religious sites of the Inca empire was located on
the Island of the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Due to the variations in the lake's level -- it rises and falls
as much as 18 feet -- causeways, piers and other structures have
appeared from under the water, giving rise to many of the stories
about underwater ruins, including cities, Reinhard says.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Italians did find, Eguino said Bolivia would
require foreign assistance in order to explore and confirm it.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Forces Seize Cocaine  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA OLSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Security forces seized 2.5 tons of
cocaine in a remote jungle corner of northeastern Venezuela during
a continuing international drug crackdown that is the largest in
the nation's history, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   National Guard officials discovered the haul Tuesday night after
a fresh series of raids on businesses in the jungle region along
the eastern delta of the Orinoco River.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Venezuelan and foreign agents recovered a record 5
tons of cocaine in the Orinoco jungle and arrested 14 people in
three countries in an international effort to disband the Los
Mellizos drug band. The raids are a result of an eight-month
investigation, financed in part by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration. Security forces used telephone bugging equipment,
three planes, three helicopters and eight boats.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel told The Associated Press
Tuesday night that 1.5 tons of cocaine were found. But National
Guard spokesman Eduardo Sanchez confirmed Wednesday that the amount
was actually 2.5 tons.
</P>
<P>
   National Guard officials said on Wednesday that the raids
continue and more cocaine could be recovered in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela is a key trafficking route for Colombian cocaine en
route to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel praised the bust as an indication that Venezuela is
cooperating with global anti-drug efforts despite repeated refusals
by President Hugo Chavez to allow U.S. anti-narcotic planes to fly
over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing is that even without the overflights, drug
packets are being discovered. This is the most important thing. The
overflights are unnecessary,'' Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the 14 people initially arrested were released after it
was determined that they were not involved in the crime, according
to the National Guard. Two people in Italy and one person in France
were among those detained in the international operation.
</P>
<P>
   Two Colombians captured in Venezuela were deported to the United
States where they were wanted on related drug trafficking charges,
according to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Michael

<HEADLINE> Girl dies during sailing program at Old Greenwich Yacht Club  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) - A 9-year-old Greenwich girl died Tuesday
while participating in a sailing program at the Old Greenwich Yacht
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they are not sure if Michelle Yee drowned, or if
something else led to her death. An autopsy performed Wednesday was
inconclusive, and officials said they were awaiting further test
results.
</P>
<P>
   Yee was in the water just before noon, practicing a capsizing
drill on her 14-foot sailboat, when a member of the yacht club
staff noticed she had stopped swimming and was floating in the
water, police said. Yee was wearing a life preserver, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The staff immediately began CPR, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Yee was taken to a nearby dock at the south end of Greenwich
Point where paramedics tried to revive her. She was transported to
Stamford Hospital and pronounced dead just after 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were treating the death as a boating accident,
pending the outcome of an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Yee was one of 13 students between the ages of 9 and 11 who were
in the second week of a two-week beginners sailing class with the
junior sailing program operated by the Longshore Sailing School at
the yacht club. She had already completed a two-week swimming and
introductory sailing class, said Greenwich Community Sailing
Commodore John Ehlers.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the students stayed on the water and completed
the lesson, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents arriving to pick up their children after the class
around 12:30 p.m. were not told what happened, but speculation
mounted as they waited for their children to come in.
</P>
<P>
   ''I passed the ambulance,'' said Sally Ritter as she waited for
her daughter. ''The first question was 'Is it my kid?' ''

<HEADLINE> Teachers in 87 school districts still don't have contracts  </HEADLINE>
By NINA RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - With the start of the school year less than
two weeks away, teachers in 117 school districts still do not have
new contracts, according to the New Jersey School Boards
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 120 school districts began the school year without a
new contract. In the public sector, expired contracts remain in
effect until a new one has been ratified.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a strike after Labor Day is looming in only one of
those districts, Hamilton Township in Mercer County.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any one of these is a potential crisis but that one is the
most troublesome,'' said Karen Joseph, a spokeswoman for the New
Jersey Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   Other districts that have not yet agreed on a new contract
include Bradley Beach, Englishtown, Mahwah, Marlboro, Manalapan,
Neptune, North Brunswick, Pennsauken, Willingboro and Woodbridge.
</P>
<P>
   ''Between now and Labor Day there will be a number of
settlements,'' Joseph said, adding that local unions and school
boards have been meeting throughout the summer to hash out
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Not all negotiations are progressing smoothly, however.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Schwartz, president of the Hamilton Township Education
Association, said his 1,500 members are prepared to strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no desire to go back without a contract,'' he said.
His union represents 900 teachers as well as teacher's aides,
custodians, bus drivers, and clerical and cafeteria workers who
work in the K-12 district.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said salaries remain a point of contention. The union
said it is asking for the ''typical range'' of raises given to
teachers in other districts in the county, which is between 4
percent and 5 percent. ''They (school board officials) claim the
county average is 4 percent but they aren't even offering that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton school officials did not return a phone call from The
Associated Press seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Galassetti, superintendent of the Bradley Beach
schools, said health benefits remain a sticking point in her
district.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cost of benefits has skyrocketed. We're trying to do what
we can to save money,'' she said. Her school board has asked its 45
elementary school teachers to pay a higher deductible or join a
preferred provider organization, but union officials would not
budge on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Wooten, a spokesman for the Willingboro school district,
said both sides have agreed not to discuss negotiations. But he
said he believes the contract for its 515 teachers will be settled
by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The average teacher salary increase for the 2000-2001 school
year was 4 percent, which is two-tenths of a percent higher than
the previous school year, said Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the
school boards association.
</P>
<P>
   The average teacher salary in New Jersey was $51,692 for the
1998-99 school year, the latest figure available.
</P>
<P>
   Belluscio said the trend for contracts negotiated for the
upcoming school year include longer school days.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five percent of the new contracts include an increase in
instructional time. Belluscio said an extended day is needed to
help districts meet new curriculum standards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 45 percent of contracts have a mechanism to control
health care costs, such as higher prescription drug copays and
employee deductibles.

<HEADLINE> Authorities sue adult Web sites in billing for 'free' visits  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Owners of scores of adult Web sites have been
charged with billing thousands of Web users for supposedly free
services, and billing other consumers who have never visited the
Web sites at all, the Federal Trade Commission announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both the FTC and the New York attorney general's office filed
suit in U.S. District Court seeking to halt the billing practices
and have asked the court to freeze the defendants' assets in order
to reimburse consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Crescent Publishing Group, Inc., based in New York City, and its
owner, Bruce Chew, as well as David Bernstein are named as
defendants in the complaint, along with 64 affiliated corporations
that operate the adult Web sites, which include Playboy.com and
Highsociety.com.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, the ''Free Tours'' generated income
of $188 million between 1997 and 1999 - $141 million of which was
generated in the first 10 months of 1999 alone.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said the defendants operate the Web sites and promote
them as free, saying that consumers' credit card numbers are
required solely to prove that the visitors are of legal age to view
the material - a common practice on adult Web sites. The sites say
that the credit cards will not be billed, but thousands of
customers were charged monthly membership fees from $20 to $90, the
FTC said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never saw any terms or conditions regarding how to become a
paying member of the site,'' one consumer stated to the commission
in the complaint brief. ''During my time on the Web site, I never
thought that the free tour had ended or that my credit card would
be billed for visiting the site.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint says that while consumers enter their credit card
information, they view adult pictures in the margins of the page.
Once the consumer presses a ''Continue'' button at the bottom of
the page, the card is billed, although no Web page says the tour
has ended or that their cards will be billed.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who tried to dispute the charges were thwarted,
according to the complaint. The defendants used billing names
different than the names of the Web sites, so consumers often had
no idea who was billing them.
</P>
<P>
   In the complaint, the FTC cited one consumer who visited
Highsociety.com and had no idea why he received five subsequent
$49.95 withdrawals from his checking account by companies named
Split Back, Romulust, and Arachne. The corporations, 65 in all,
were all owned by Chew and have the same business address, the FTC
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the consumers had difficulty contacting the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   A message left at the Crescent Publishing office in New York,
listed as Multimedia Forum, Inc., on Web site registrations, was
not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Neil Smith, once the scourge of Chargers
quarterbacks, might
become a teammate in San Diego.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The veteran defensive end, a fixture with Kansas City for nine
seasons who spent the last three with Denver, talked with Chargers
management Wednesday. The team desperately needs a proven
pass-rusher after losing Raylee Johnson to a season-ending knee
injury. Johnson had a career-high 10&AMP;frac12; sacks last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately one's got to go down before another one can step
in, and hopefully I'm in the process of stepping in,'' Smith said
after taking a physical.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think he still has gas left in the tank,'' said Billy
Devaney, San Diego's the director of player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had 6&AMP;frac12; sacks last year, pushing his career total to 104&AMP;frac12;.
He said he can step in and contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line, Neil knows what he's got left and what he can
do,'' Smith said. ''I love to compete. This is why I want to
continue. I guess there were some words out that I called it the
quits. That's not true. I never had it in mind that I was going to
retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Chargers coach Mike Riley also said Ryan Leaf will start the
exhibition finale Friday night against Arizona, but said he wasn't
ready to select a starter for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf remains the front-runner to regain the job he lost as a
rookie in 1998. This will be his second straight exhibition start.
He'll play the first half and Moses Moreno will start the second
half. Riley said incumbent starter Jim Harbaugh will get playing
time, too.
Packers:
</P>
<P>
   Brett Favre did some light throwing during practice Wednesday.
It was Favre's first extended practice time since he developed
elbow tendinitis two weeks ago. Favre threw approximately 20 passes
to his running backs and took snaps from center, but he was held
out of scrimmage drills involving long downfield throws.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers still aren't sure whether Favre will play in
Saturday's preseason finale against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our timetable is really set to 11 days, when we start the
regular season against the Jets,'' said offensive coordinator and
quarterbacks coach Tom Rossley. ''He felt great after (throwing).
He wanted to get into the team drills, but we didn't let him.''
Bears:
</P>
<P>
   Brad Culpepper, the eight-year veteran defensive tackle released
by Tampa Bay on Monday, signed a two-year contract with Chicago on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in my ninth year and I've got four to five more left,''
Culpepper said. ''I want to stick my roots in the ground and go to
a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper considered offers from Cincinnati and Philadelphia,
where he might have been given a starting job. But he decided on
Chicago, where he will back up Mike Wells and Jim Flanigan.
</P>
<P>
   To make room on the roster, the Bears placed rookie cornerback
Reggie Austin on injured reserve because of a sore heel.
Patriots:
</P>
<P>
   In an expected move, New England signed cornerback Otis Smith,
who played for the team during it's Super Bowl run in 1997 before
leaving for the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also claimed tackle Josh Rawlings off waivers from
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who now has had two turns each with the AFC East rivals,
played three seasons for the Jets before he was cut on Sunday. Now
he is reunited with Patriots coach Bill Belichick, who also left
the Patriots for the Jets after the '97 Super Bowl.
Bears:
</P>
<P>
   Brian Urlacher, the ninth overall pick in the draft whose skills
and intensity drew comparisons to great Bears linebackers of the
past, was replaced in the starting lineup by Rosevelt Colvin.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's because I didn't play very well and Rosie was playing
better,'' Urlacher said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears tabbed Urlacher as the starter on the strong side
almost immediately upon drafting him out of New Mexico, where he
was a roving safety and occasional linebacker.
Bengals:
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati waived offensive lineman Kris Farris, who flunked the
team's physical examination a day after he was obtained on waivers
after being cut by the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Farris was Pittsburgh's third-round draft pick last year. He
missed last season because of a broken foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals also released rookie offensive lineman Doug Dorley.

<HEADLINE> LA Signs No. 1 Pick; Elster on DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ben Diggins, the Los Angeles Dodgers'
first-round draft pick, signed with the club Wednesday and was sent
to Class-A San Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7 right-hander from Arizona was introduced at a news
conference, where he pulled on a Dodgers uniform for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just ready to get out and play,'' said Diggins, the 17th
pick chosen in the June draft. ''It feels like forever since I've
been on the field. I don't know if I've set a timetable for myself
to get to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd definitely like to get up here as soon as possible, but
I've got a long way to go and a lot of hard work ahead of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Diggins, a member of the 1999 USA national team, will begin a
throwing program at San Bernardino and work in the bullpen to
prepare for the fall instructional league.
</P>
<P>
   A catcher until three years ago, Diggins was 10-4 with a 3.83
ERA in 17 games as a sophomore. He struck out 127 in 113 innings.
</P>
<P>
   At the plate, he hit .336 with nine homers and 34 RBIs -- drawing
comparisons with Darren Dreifort, a 1993 Los Angeles draft pick,
who has three homers for the Dodgers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ben possesses a power arm combined with athleticism, a solid
slider and a great makeup on a premium pitcher's body,'' said Ed
Creech, an executive in the Dodgers' scouting department. ''All of
this projects into being a dominant pitcher at the major league
level.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also announced that shortstop Kevin Elster was
placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained left hamstring.
Right-hander Mike Judd was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque to
fill the roster spot.
</P>
<P>
   Elster, on the DL for the second time this season, is hitting
.225 with 29 RBIs and 12 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Judd was 7-4 with a 4.61 ERA at Albuquerque. He has a 4-1 career
record in the majors, including one start this season when he
pitched four innings in an 8-6 loss against Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> WWII Airmen Recovered in Iceland  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD MIDDLETON
<TEXT>
<P>
   REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) -- The bodies of four World War II airmen
from Britain's air force, trapped in an Icelandic glacier for
nearly 60 years, will at last be buried at a cemetery in Reykjavik.
</P>
<P>
   A Royal Air Force search team was working Wednesday to retrieve
the bodies for a funeral Sunday at the Fossvogur Commonwealth war
cemetery in the capital Reykajvik.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies, revealed last year by melting ice, are those of
Flying Officer Arthur Round, a New Zealander, Flight Sgt. Reginald
Hopkins of Southampton, England; Pilot Officer Henry Talbot of
Bedford, England, and Flight Sgt. Keith Garret of Worksop, England.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot Round, who was 26, and navigator Hopkins, 21, had flown
their Fairey Battle bomber to pick up Talbot, 24, and Garret, 22,
who had been receiving treatment on a hospital ship docked at the
town of Akureyri.
</P>
<P>
   The plane carrying the four men took off from the Akureyri
airfield in fog on the morning of May 26, 1941, and crashed into a
mountainside about 30 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Wreckage was found two days later, and a week after the crash a
small burial party, including the squadron chaplain, held a service
and placed a small cross on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The RAF pulled out of Iceland two months later, and the precise
location of the crash site was lost as it became entombed in ice.
</P>
<P>
   It was found last year by Hardur Geirsson, curator of Akureyri
Museum, after a 20-year search.
</P>
<P>
   ''The breakthrough came last summer when a friend of mine went
to the British Public Record Office and found the original accident
investigation report, which had a precise grid reference,'' said
Geirsson, 40.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer in Iceland was the warmest for many years and the
ice melted, revealing the crash site. Geirsson had walked over it
in previous attempts to find the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were shocked to find wreckage, small sad human remains and
personal possessions, all perfectly preserved by the ice,'' said
Geirsson. There was a toothbrush, a collar with the name of one of
the airmen inside, and a wallet, he said. ''Everything was
scattered around and although I had been looking for it for so
long, I didn't feel happy when I finally found the aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. John Sim, a member of the original search party, was quoted
by London's Sunday Times newspaper as saying he had always been
haunted by his superiors' decision to leave the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had no body bags, no way of bringing the bodies down,'' he
said. ''We returned with a padre and a makeshift wooden cross and
conducted a service on the glacier. I always had the gut feeling
that they should not have been left up there.''
</P>
<P>
   The RAF has invited relatives of the four men to the memorial
service.
</P>
<P>
   RAF and Icelandic coast guard planes will fly past, and the
British ambassador to Iceland will lay a wreath. Ambassadors of
other nations also are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The exact wreckage site has not been revealed to prevent trophy
hunters from looting the site.

<HEADLINE> Kindergarten teacher charged with pot sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NISKAYUNA, N.Y. (AP) - A kindergarten teacher at a Catholic
school has been arrested and charged with selling marijuana, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen McGough, 42, was charged criminal sale of marijuana and
two counts of unlawfully dealing with a child and criminal sale of
marijuana after neighbors videotaped a party at McGough's home in
the suburb of Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors had become frustrated by frequent noisy parties at
McGough's house. The video shows McGough handing a minor a bag of
marijuana, Niskayuna police spokesman Lt. Lewis Moskowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   McGough has been a teacher at St. Helen's School of Niskayuna
for the past eight years. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany is
conducting an internal investigation and declined to discuss what,
if any, disciplinary action could be taken.
</P>
<P>
   Niskayuna is about 10 miles west of Albany.

<HEADLINE> Cards' McGwire Not Close To Return  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The Cardinals are not optimistic that they'll
be activating Mark McGwire on Sept. 1 when active rosters expand
froim 25 players to 40.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't really improved much and he's been doing everything
for it,'' St. Louis manager Tony La Russa said before Wednesday's
game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. ''He's been on time and hasn't
missed one treatment, and hasn't gotten an attitude about it. But
when you're doing all that and it doesn't improve, you start to
worry.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire last played July 6, taking himself out of a game due to
a severe case of patella tendinitis in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Barry Weinberg is to the point where he's using gallows
humor, joking about needing the condemned convict from ''The Green
Mile'' to suck out the pain and speculating about the existence of
a voodoo doll with a pin stuck in the knee somewhere in America.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please take the pin out,'' Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who has 30 home runs, 69 RBIs and a .303 average, will
not accompany the team on a seven-game trip that begins Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as it goes and remains the same, the less optimistic
it becomes,'' Weinberg said. ''But you just can't give up. You just
keep thinking something good will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg said McGwire is slowly, very slowly, getting better,
''but it's not significant enough to call it progress.''
</P>
<P>
   La Russa said last week that he wanted to use McGwire as a pinch
hitter in September, although McGwire has said he wants to come
back as a regular player. The manager said there's no controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to play in the field and that's what he's going
through all this stuff to do,'' La Russa said. ''All I said is if
he hasn't been improving a great deal, and if it turns out he can't
play in the field, he's one of the most dangerous pinch hitters in
baseball. He understands, he just doesn't want to give into that
yet.''

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Audience Awaits Finale  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- When ''Survivor'' premiered three months ago,
critics called it ''Gilligan's Island'' meets ''Lord of the
Flies.'' On Wednesday, much of America called it a must-see.
</P>
<P>
   An audience that experts said might reach 40 million awaited the
final resolution: Would Rudy, Richard, Susan or Kelly be the island
castaway who returned home a millionaire?
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour into the show, Susan Hawk, the feisty trucker from
Palmyra, Wis., was sacked in a tribal vote.
</P>
<P>
   By then, ''Survivor'' buzz, predictions and, most of all, hype
had reached epic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   So had festivities by fans who planned to throw ''Survivor''
viewing parties, complete with tropical costumes and the
ever-present threat of getting voted out of the bash.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping on the reality-TV bandwagon, CBS launched the 13-week
''Survivor'' on May 31 to breathe life into a prime-time schedule
largely filled with reruns. The show had been taped during 39 days
last spring on the island of Pulau Tiga near Borneo.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night, the 16 volunteers were seen arriving on the
tiny tropical isle. By the end of the hour -- actually three days
later -- the first among them had been voted off the island during a
solemn tribal council.
</P>
<P>
   All summer, CBS beat the ''Survivor'' drum, from morning (on its
''Early Show,'' where weekly castoffs were showcased) to night (on
Wednesday, ''Late Show'' host David Letterman welcomed the 16
castaways to recite the Top 10 list).
</P>
<P>
   But no newspaper, TV show or magazine seemed able to resist. USA
Today on Wednesday featured a full-page color advertisement (''Got
Milk?'') with the ''Final Four'' Survivors wearing milk mustaches.
Under the headline ''END GAME,'' New York's Daily News splashed the
same photo on its front page.

   Entertainment Weekly pushed back its deadline by a day and
prepared four possible covers, so as to feature the winner as its
cover story on the issue out next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Today'' show even interviewed Dawn Wells, who nearly 40
years ago played Mary Ann on the castaways comedy ''Gilligan's
Island.''
</P>
<P>
   But the TV show more directly comparable was ''Dallas.'' Since
that drama's ''Who Shot J.R.?'' mystery in 1980, nothing television
dealt out had gripped the nation in quite the same way. Until
''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   The first ''Survivor'' episode drew a healthy 15.5 million
viewers, but by mid-August, that number had nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the audience hooked, CBS imposed an information
clampdown, even as the castaways resumed their normal lives -- and
one of them, already the big winner, quietly envisioned life with a
million-dollar jackpot. Everyone associated with the show signed a
nondisclosure agreement with stiff cash penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Schefus, the younger brother of finalist Susan Hawk, spent
Wednesday in the dark like nearly everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his sister, the Waukesha, Wis., native declared:
''She didn't tell anybody, I swear to God. I've got a big mouth;
I'd tell everybody.''

<HEADLINE> On heels of Los Angeles, another big concert  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Democratic National Committee will invade
Radio City Music Hall next month for the sequel to a
convention-ending fund-raising gala that raised $5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup for the Sept. 14 event rivals the concert schedule at
any summer venue. It includes Crosby, Stills and Nash; Jimmy
Buffett, Sheryl Crow; Bon Jovi; Lenny Kravitz; Bette Midler; Macy
Gray; Don Henley and Glenn Frey. Comedian John Leguizamo will serve
as master of ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential ticket of Al Gore and Joseph
Lieberman are scheduled to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Helping to pull it all together are Harvey Weinstein,
co-chairman of Miramax Films; Jann Wenner, publisher of Rolling
Stone magazine; and John Sykes, chief executive of the music
channel VH-1, which is owned by Viacom, the parent of the CBS
network and the Paramount movie studio.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices will range from $125 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is our effort to get as many people involved in the
campaign and to seize the energy of this campaign season,'' said
Peter Knight, the Democratic Party's chief fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   He said the party hopes to raise up to $2 million from the New
York City extravaganza, all of it under federal contribution
limits, meaning the money can be spent directly on candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller-scale concert/fund-raisers are being planned for Silicon
Valley in California, Boston, Miami and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   On the final night of the Democratic National Convention last
week in Los Angeles, Democrats raised $5.1 million at a sold-out
concert at the Shrine Auditorium, home of the Academy Awards
ceremony, that featured Barbra Streisand. The money was raised
under federal limits, the largest such haul in party history.
</P>
<P>
   The concert series is designed to help Democrats close the
fund-raising gap with Republicans. Through June 30, the Republican
National Committee had $21.1 million in federally limited
contributions to just $9.3 million for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties can spend $13.7 million this fall in coordinated
efforts with their presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   By setting such a low ticket price, Democrats also hope to
attract new donors and energize voters. Their model remains a May
24 fund-raiser in Washington that brought in a record $26.5 million
and attracted more than 12,000 people to hear Kravitz, Stevie
Wonder and Robin Williams. The event had a top ticket price of
$500,000, but also sold thousands of tickets at $50.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing like great music to get people fired up and
ready to go to knock on doors, make phone calls and hold up signs
at 6 a.m. on street corners,'' said DNC spokeswoman Jenny Backus.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Air Jet Crashes Off Bahrain  </HEADLINE>
By ADNAN MALIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- A Gulf Air Airbus A320 crashed into
shallow Persian Gulf waters Wednesday night after circling and
trying to land in Bahrain, killing at least 137 people. Rescuers
were searching early Thursday for the other six people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six of the 143 people on the flight, which was en route
to Manama from Cairo, were children, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no survivors yet,'' Ibrahim Al-Hamer, Bahrain's
undersecretary for civil aviation, said in announcing 137 bodies
had been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word on what caused the crash. Searchers
also recovered both flight data recorders, but their contents were
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Navy helicopters, destroyers and an oceangoing tug with a
10-ton crane joined the nighttime search and rescue effort, three
or four miles off the northern coast of Bahrain, which is
headquarters of the U.S. 5th Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet spokesman Cdr. Jeff Gradeck's office said the waters at
the crash site were less than 40 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   An air traffic controller at the Bahrain airport, reached by
telephone, described watching the plane attempt to land.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plane was near the runway, but didn't land,'' he said,
asking that his name not be used. ''It circled two times and the
third time it crashed into the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   The controller saw no flames or sign of trouble before the crash
and could not immediately explain why the plane circled before
landing. He said the plane's crew did not report anything out of
the ordinary. He gave the time of the crash as 7:20 p.m. (12:30
p.m. EDT).
</P>
<P>
   ''I could not believe my eyes,'' said Sobeih, 27, a resident of
the nearby neighborhood of Al-Fodha who saw the plane go down.
''When I saw it heading toward the sea nose down, I screamed 'Oh my
God, this thing is going down.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sobeih and Riyadh, 24, another Al-Fodha resident, said the plane
flew unusually low over their heads heading to the runway, but took
a sharp turn toward the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, who would not give their full names, said the plane
returned minutes later flying even lower but headed straight to the
sea where it crashed. They said unusual noises came from the
plane's engines, but they saw no flames.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in a state of shock,'' said Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Air said in a statement that 135 passengers and eight crew
members were on board GF072, an evening Cairo-Bahrain flight.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Air said in a statement that 135 passengers and eight
crewmembers were on board Flight GF072. Lists of passengers' names
showed that 36 were under the age of 18. Sixty-three passengers
were Egyptian, 34 Bahraini, 12 Saudi, nine Palestinian, six from
the United Arab Emirates, three Chinese, two British and one each
from Canada, Oman, Kuwait, Sudan and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   And one passenger was believed to be an American. A State
Department official in Washington said Bahraini officials had
informed them that a boarding pass indicated that a U.S. diplomatic
courier was aboard. The courier's name was not immediately
released.
</P>
<P>
   The crew included two Bahrainis and one each from Oman, the
Philippines, Poland, India, Morocco and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Weeping relatives of passengers pleaded with policemen who threw
a security ring around the airport outside the capital, Manama.
Many did reach the airport, and cries and screams echoed in its
halls. Dozens of men and women with reddened eyes and tears flowing
down their cheeks wept loudly. Some comforted one another while
others screamed out for their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Three U.S. helicopters, 10 small boats and the USS Katawba, a
tug, joined Bahraini helicopters and boats in the search. Bahraini
Crown Prince Sheik Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa personally directed
the effort, the U.S. military said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military pulled back three of the ships it had lent to
the effort, with Fleet spokesman Gradeck's office saying early
Thursday that the search was ''gearing down.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of passengers also gathered at the airport in Cairo,
where the flight originated. There were angry scenes when one
relative tried to attack news cameramen and complained about the
lack of information on the fate of the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Air is owned by Bahrain, the Gulf states of Oman and Qatar,
as well as Abu Dhabi, the largest of seven sheikdoms making up the
United Arab Emirates. Based in Bahrain, it flies to 53
international destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, the emir of Bahrain, declared
three days of mourning and said a committee of Bahraini and foreign
experts would investigate the crash. In France, Airbus Industrie
said it was dispatching a team of specialists to Bahrain to help in
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus plane, delivered to Gulf Air in September 1994, had
accumulated about 17,177 flight hours in some 13,848 flights, the
Airbus statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, an Airbus A310 owned by Kenya Airways crashed into
Atlantic Ocean shortly after takeoff from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, to
Lagos, Nigeria. Ten people survived, and 169 died. An Air Inter
Airbus A320 crashed in 1992 in Strasbourg, France, killing 87
people.

<HEADLINE> US Baseball Team No Dream Team  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- No baseball Dream Team in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has assembled a collection of up-and-coming
minor leaguers and journeymen to represent it next month in the
first Olympic baseball tournament open to professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Borders, a 37-year-old catcher who was a major league
journeyman and currently is in the Tampa Bay farm system, was one
of the few recognizable names on the U.S. Olympic team announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Borders also played with Toronto and was the MVP of the World
Series in 1992, the first year baseball was an official Olympic
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Players on major league rosters weren't available for the
Olympics and teams were reluctant to part with some of their top
minor leaguers, fearing they'd need them down the stretch. As a
result, the U.S. roster is dotted with players currently toiling in
such places as Pawtucket, Mobile and Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would have liked to have had players like Mark McGwire,
Greg Maddux and Darryl Kile, but this is what was available to
us,'' said Bob Watson, co-chairman of the selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team, managed by Dodgers executive Tommy Lasorda, will
be trying to upset two-time defending gold medalist Cuba. Japan,
which will feature some of its best pros on its team, and Korea,
which is suspending its pro season for two weeks during the
Olympics, also are among the favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Host Australia will feature All-Star catcher Dave Nilsson, who
played in Japan this year so he would be available for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, a former Dodgers' manager and Hall of Famer, still has
high hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We aren't going 6,000 miles to lose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve of the players on the roster have some major league
experience. Some of them were on the U.S. team that beat the Cubans
during the Pan Am Games last year but lost to them in the gold
medal game.
</P>
<P>
   By finishing second, that team qualified the United States for
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a few guys that I wish were there because I know
them and played with them last year,'' said Todd Williams, a
pitcher in the Seattle farm system who played in the Pan Am Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''But this committee has gone through so much to pick a team, I
don't think they were going to get anybody who wasn't capable of
doing the job. So I think the team we've got and the goal we have,
it should be easy to put a good team out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Shawn Gilbert, who has spent some time in the majors
with Los Angeles and now is with their team at Albuquerque, knows
expectations are high for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other countries are definitely underrated, as far as their
play. But it's our national pastime, so we're expected to win, in
the eyes of our country,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Olympics' stringent drug-test policies might have
deterred some players from committing to play for the United
States, Bill Bavasi, co-chair of the selection committee, said he
didn't believe so, and that all the players had been made aware of
the Olympic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Major league baseball has no drug testing except for players who
have had substance-abuse problems.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team, which opens the Olympic round-robin series
against Japan on Sept. 17, has a pitching staff that includes Ryan
Franklin, Chris George, Matt Ginter, Shane Heams, Rick Krivda, Roy
Oswalt, Jon Rauch, C.C. Sabathia, Bobby Seay, Ben Sheets, Williams,
Tim Young and Kurt Ainsworth.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Borders, the catchers will be Marcus Jensen and
Mike Kinkade.
</P>
<P>
   Infielders on the 28-man roster are Brent Abernathy, Sean
Burroughs, Brent Butler, Mike Coolbaugh, Gookie Dawkins, Adam
Everett and Doug Mientkiewicz.
</P>
<P>
   The outfielders are Gilbert, Anthony Sanders, Ernie Young, Brad
Wilkerson and Mike Neill.
</P>
<P>
   One more player will be added to the roster, which will then be
cut to the 24-man limit by Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Watson doubts that the United States will ever field an Olympic
team with its best major leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see anybody here giving up players to do that. Maybe
if they play the Olympics in the Southern Hemisphere in November,''
he said. ''But if we win the gold medal with these guys, maybe that
won't be an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States lost to Japan in the semifinals of the 1996
Olympics and also failed to win a medal in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Japan's July Trade Surplus Falls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world dropped 19.3
percent in July from the same month last year, the government said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandise trade surplus, the measure of all goods exported
minus those imported, shrank to $9.37 billion, the Ministry of
Finance said.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus with the United States fell 13.8 percent in July
from the same month last year to $5.80 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is fighting to emerge from its worst economic downturn in
50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been under heavy pressure from the United
States and other trading partners to rein in the surplus by
bolstering its weak economy to buoy demand for imports.
</P>
<P>
   The overall surplus for July was lower than expected. Economists
surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires predicted it would come in at $10.2
billion.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Election Opponent Is Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By JASON STRAIT
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROSSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A man prosecutors said was consumed by
a thirst for political power was found guilty Wednesday in the
shooting death of his election opponent, a popular state senator.
</P>
<P>
   A jury convicted Byron (Low Tax) Looper, in the murder of state
Sen. Tommy Burks, who was the clear favorite to win the 1998
election.
</P>
<P>
   Looper, 35, faces life without the possibility of parole. The
Burks family asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The jury was deliberating his sentence Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments Wednesday, prosecutor Tony Craighead said
Looper killed Burks because he wanted his power and position.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a motive, a method to win this election with a Smith &AMP;
Wesson,'' Craighead said. ''Of all the people in all the world, who
had a reason to kill Tommy Burks? Byron Looper.''
</P>
<P>
   Burks, 58, was shot once in the head at his hog and tobacco farm
on Oct. 19, 1998. He was sitting in pickup truck on a gravel road
near a pumpkin patch where he planned to take schoolchildren on a
hayride.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Bill Gibson said there was no doubt Looper was
the killer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't leave DNA at the scene. He left a bullet at the
scene. He left tire tracks at the scene. He left an impression of
who he was on a young man (farmhand Wesley Rex) at the scene,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys relied on the testimony of Looper's mother and
her neighbors to try to prove Looper's innocence. They said he was
at his mother's home the morning Burks was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Looper, who legally changed his middle name from Anthony to (Low
Tax), was the Putnam County property assessor when he was charged
with Burks' murder.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Pres. Elect Visits Canada  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Mexico's president-elect wrapped up a visit to
Canada on Wednesday by outlining some changes he plans when he
takes office: opening the petrochemical industry to more foreign
investment, talking peace with rebels, strengthening NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to encourage investors to think about the long term in
Mexico ... so we build a real future in our country,'' Vincent Fox
said at a news conference before he headed to the United States for
talks with President Clinton and the Democrat and Republican
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who formally takes office Dec. 1, met earlier with
representatives of non-governmental organizations and other social
groups to discuss his plans to improve human rights in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He had lunch was with major Canadian business figures such as
chief executive officers Robert Milton of Air Canada, Bobbie Gaunt
of Ford Motor of Canada and F. Anthony Comper of Bank of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting an integrated vision of the North American Free Trade
Agreement with the United States and Canada, Fox spoke of getting
help from Mexico's larger, more powerful neighbors to become a more
valuable trading partner and ally.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must work hard to bring Mexico to an agreeable and
comparable level as the United States and Canada,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who formally takes office Dec. 1, called for a new vision
of NAFTA -- '' a 15-20 or 30-year vision'' -- to expand and
strengthen the trade pact.
</P>
<P>
   He said Mexico would open itself to foreign investors and added
that he wanted a regulation requiring 51 percent Mexican ownership
in the petrochemical industry removed by December ''so that
investment flows'' into the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to let investors know that we are a business
government,'' Fox said. He said he wants the economy under his
watch to grow at 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He said plans to form a commission of ''members of high moral
values and high ethical behavior'' to halt endemic corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he was ready to begin peace talks with Zapatista rebels
in Chiapas state within weeks or even days. He said that his
victory in the July 2 national vote and the victory Sunday by Pablo
Salazar in the Chiapas governor election brought a new era of
democracy that made negotiations possible.
</P>
<P>
   A former Coca-Cola executive, Fox said last week he wanted the
United States and Canada to help Mexico become an equal partner in
a stronger, expanded version of NAFTA that could grow into a
hemispheric version of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien nixed the idea after
meeting with Fox on Tuesday, saying the structure of North America
-- two smaller countries on either side of the powerful United
States -- made the common currency and open borders of the EU
unworkable.

<HEADLINE> Protestant Shot in North Belfast  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A Protestant man was shot to
death at his north Belfast home Wednesday, police said, in what
appeared to be the latest blow in a vicious feud between
pro-British gangs.
</P>
<P>
   No group claimed immediate responsibility. The shooting happened
only a few hundred yards from the spot where the outlawed Ulster
Volunteer Force on Monday shot dead two Protestant militants, among
them a prominent member of the rival Ulster Defense Association.
</P>
<P>
   The UDA had vowed to retaliate by killing UVF supporters. And
Wednesday's victim, 21-year-old Sammy Rocket, came from a family
that had been expelled from UDA circles in the mid-1990s and had
switched allegiances to the UVF.
</P>
<P>
   Before the latest shooting, Britain's minister responsible for
Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, insisted that a joint UDA-UVF
cease-fire remained intact in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said he had no doubt that most commanders of the UDA
and UVF didn't want their feud to degenerate into a total breakdown
of their 1994 truce, a pillar of Northern Ireland's shaky peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is possible for an organization to be on cease-fire but for
individuals associated with it to be involved in unlawful
activity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson defended his decision Tuesday to order the arrest and
reimprisonment of the most notorious militant, Johnny ''Mad Dog''
Adair, who was seized at police gunpoint and delivered by
helicopter back to prison.
</P>
<P>
   The brawny UDA commander was paroled last year under terms of
the 1998 peace accord, but he had been accused of stoking a violent
turf war with UVF members, particularly in his Shankill Road power
base.
</P>
<P>
   Adair led a raucous UDA parade up Shankill Road last weekend.
After gun attacks on a UVF-linked pub and several leading UVF
members' homes, the UVF retaliated Monday by fatally shooting two
men, one of them an Adair subordinate, as they sat in a parked car
on nearby Crumlin Road.
</P>
<P>
   Britain deployed police and troops into the Shankill district to
deter an expected UDA counterstrike. Wednesday night's shooting on
a residential street just off the Crumlin Road happened not far
from a joint police-army checkpoint. No arrests were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Had Mandelson ruled that the joint UDA-UVF truce had broken
down, he could have ordered more than 150 convicted members of both
groups returned to prison to continue serving their suspended
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he focused criticism on Adair, calling him the leading
member of a small group of ''gangsters and thugs who operate on the
black side of Northern Ireland society.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Adair had been ''given a chance to go straight,'' but
had instead ''whipped up the feud.''
</P>
<P>
   The viability of the Good Friday peace accord depends in part on
maintaining cease-fires by the Irish Republican Army, which draws
support from the most militant Catholic areas, and Protestant-based
gangs such as the UDA and UVF.
</P>
<P>
   Before calling their joint cease-fire, those two Protestant
groups were responsible for slaying more than 800 Catholic
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But rivalry over control of criminal rackets has risen between
the two groups, particularly once Adair returned home to the
Shankill last September.
</P>
<P>
   Adair, 36, was convicted in 1994 of directing terrorism after
being taped by undercover police officers bragging about his role
in terrorizing Belfast Catholics. He served just five years of a
16-year sentence.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Robert J. ''Shad'' Northshield, the ''CBS News
Sunday Morning'' creator who persuaded Charles Kuralt to abandon
the road and host the new program, died Monday after a long
illness. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   During his 40-year career, Northshield earned the Peabody Award,
the Polk Award and an Emmy while working at CBS, NBC and ABC.
</P>
<P>
   His signature segment on ''Sunday Morning'' was the weekly
program's closing spot: a nature scene, framed for more than a
minute without any narration or accompaniment beyond natural sound.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, he joined CBS television in New York as an associate
producer, but soon moved up to the rank of producer.
</P>
<P>
   He jumped to ABC for a short stint before shifting to NBC, where
he spent 17 years producing a variety of events that included the
''Today'' show and ''The Huntley-Brinkley Report.''
</P>
<P>
   Northshield was rehired by CBS in 1977, eventually landing back
in the news division as executive producer of the ''CBS Morning
News.'' He reformatted the weekday show and launched a sixth day of
programming -- ''CBS News Sunday Morning.''
</P>
<P>
   He persuaded Kuralt to become the show's host. Kuralt, who died
three years ago, handled those duties for 15 years.
Roy F. Wells:
</P>
<P>
   LE MARS, Iowa (AP) -- Roy F. Wells, who began bottling milk for
his father's dairy when he was just 7 years old and later became
the dairy's owner, died Saturday of pneumonia. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, whose father, Fred H. Wells, founded Wells Dairy Inc. in
1913, was active in the family business for more than 63 years.
</P>
<P>
   At age 11, Roy Wells drove a delivery truck before and after
school. At 14, he and his brother, Harold, quit school to work in
ice cream production, which began in 1926.
</P>
<P>
   Several years later, the ice cream business expanded to Sioux
City as Blue Bunny Ice Cream.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Wells was in charge of the dairy during the 1930s and 1940s,
managing all aspects of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Wells served as president of the Iowa Ice Cream Manufacturers'
Association for three terms, and worked as a state and national
representative for the dairy industry.

<HEADLINE> Godwin Rejects Rangers' Offer  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Tyrell Godwin, a supplemental first-round draft pick
by the
Texas Rangers in June, rejected the team's contract offer Wednesday
and returned for his final semester at North Carolina.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Godwin, an outfielder for the Tar Heels the past three seasons,
was set to sign a $1.2 million bonus last week as the 35th overall
pick, but the Rangers reduced the offer when an examination
revealed a pre-existing knee injury, Baseball America reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin, considered by many as the best pure athlete and fastest
player in the draft, turned down the team's reduced offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have enrolled for classes this fall at the University of
North Carolina and I will not be signing a professional contract
with the Texas Rangers,'' Godwin, a Morehead Scholar, said
Wednesday. He has 12 credits remaining and plans to graduate in
December with a degree in history.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin's physical showed he is missing the anterior cruciate
ligament in his right knee, a condition that has existed since high
school. He also had additional surgery on the knee while in high
school to repair the meniscus.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin will have surgery within the next few weeks and will be
sidelined until at least June, making it unlikely he will play for
the Tar Heels next season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is in my best long-term interest to repair my knee now, so
as to prevent any problems over the course of my career,'' Godwin,
21, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had the information before the draft that we've gotten
now through MRIs and X-rays, we probably wouldn't have even drafted
him,'' Rangers general manager Doug Melvin told Baseball America.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin offered to defer his bonus until he proved himself fit,
but the Rangers rejected the offer. The team instead made another
offer of $100,000 up front, with additional payments contingent on
the outfielder proving he is healthy. But Godwin turned down that
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very frustrated to have to put my professional baseball
career on hold,'' Godwin said. ''After years of hard work, I really
thought that now was the time to begin my pro baseball career.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time Godwin rejected a deal after being a
first-round pick. He declined a $1.9 million offer from the New
York Yankees in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin, slowed by nagging leg injuries last season, is fourth on
North Carolina's career list with a .362 batting average. He will
be eligible for the 2001 draft, and could become the first player
taken in the first round three times.
</P>
<P>
   This marks the second time the Rangers have had a
first-rounder's status affected by a physical. In 1996, Texas
voided a contract to right-hander R.A. Dickey when an examination
revealed he was missing a ligament in his pitching elbow. Dickey
later signed for less money and is now pitching for the Rangers'
Triple-A affiliate in Oklahoma City.

<HEADLINE> Rights Groups Granted Special Status  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- A judge granted friend-of-the-court status
Wednesday to two civil rights groups seeking disclosure of any
evidence that a Taiwanese-born nuclear scientist was singled out
for a national security prosecution because of ethnic profiling.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James Parker, who is weighing several
defense motions in the case of Wen Ho Lee, agreed Wednesday to
allow the American Civil Liberties Union and the Asian Law Caucus
to file briefs in support of the defense petition for disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Parker is also considering defense motions to dismiss all but 10
counts against Lee, to soften the language of the indictment to
show that materials Lee is accused of downloading were not
classified secret, and to allow Lee's release on bail pending his
Nov. 6 trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is charged with 59 counts alleging he transferred restricted
data to unsecure computers and tape at Los Alamos National
Laboratory. He is not charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
   The defense contends Lee was selected for prosecution because he
is ethnic Chinese. Lee's attorneys have submitted statements by
former lab officials confirming such profiling occurred. The FBI
has said Chinese government scientists seek out Chinese Americans
when seeking scientific secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU and Asian Law Caucus argued in their
friend-of-the-court briefs that the defense had amassed sufficient
evidence of profiling to require disclosure by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the government has nothing to hide, then it can dispel the
specter of racism that has haunted this case from the outset by
producing the documents and the discovery that Dr. Lee is
seeking,'' Lucas Guttentag, one of the ACLU lawyers who filed the
brief, said by telephone from Berkeley, Calif. ''Full disclosure is
essential both to protect Dr. Lee's constitutional rights and to
restore public confidence that the laws are being applied fairly
and equally.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution denies profiling and has asked the court to
reject the disclosure petitions.

<HEADLINE> Putin To Visit Japan Next Month  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin will visit Japan
on Sept. 3-5 before heading for a United Nations summit in New
York, the foreign minister said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov did not give details of Putin's
official visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has sought to improve ties with Tokyo and Russia's other
Asian neighbors since his election in March. He was last in Japan
for a summit of the Group of Eight leading industrialized nations
in July.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow and Tokyo have not signed a peace treaty formally ending
World War II because of a dispute over the Kuril Islands, which the
Soviet Union seized from Japan in the waning days of the war and
which remain in Russian hands.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is also expected to address the U.N. Millennium Summit in
New York, Ivanov told reporters.

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Finale Is Under Way  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- When ''Survivor'' premiered three months ago,
critics called it ''Gilligan's Island'' meets ''Lord of the
Flies.'' On Wednesday, much of America called it a must-see.
</P>
<P>
   An audience that experts said might reach 40 million awaited the
final resolution: Would Rudy, Richard, Susan or Kelly be the island
castaway who returned home a millionaire?
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour into the show, Susan Hawk, the feisty trucker from
Palmyra, Wis., was sacked in a tribal vote.
</P>
<P>
   River guide Kelly Wiglesworth had won immunity from that vote
after correctly answering the most questions about former
castaways.
</P>
<P>
   She also won the second immunity challenge by standing the
longest with a hand on the immunity idol. Her only remaining rival
in that contest, Rudy Boesch, dropped out after 4 hours, 11
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the second tribal council, Kelly was placed in the odd
position of single-handedly deciding the fates of Richard and Rudy.
Rudy, the fiesty retired Navy SEAL from Virginia Beach, Va., was
picked off by Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought I'd come this far,'' said Rudy Boesch, many
oddsmakers' favorite to win.
</P>
<P>
   That left Kelly and ruthless strategist Richard Hatch, a
corporate trainer from Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   By then, ''Survivor'' buzz, predictions and, most of all, hype
had reached epic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   So had festivities by fans who planned to throw ''Survivor''
viewing parties, complete with tropical costumes and the
ever-present threat of getting voted out of the bash.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping on the reality-TV bandwagon, CBS launched the 13-week
''Survivor'' on May 31 to breathe life into a prime-time schedule
largely filled with reruns. The show had been taped during 39 days
last spring on the island of Pulau Tiga near Borneo.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night, the 16 volunteers were seen arriving on the
tiny tropical isle. By the end of the hour -- actually three days
later -- the first among them had been voted off the island during a
solemn tribal council.
</P>
<P>
   All summer, CBS beat the ''Survivor'' drum, from morning (on its
''Early Show,'' where weekly castoffs were showcased) to night (on
Wednesday, ''Late Show'' host David Letterman welcomed the 16
castaways to recite the Top 10 list).
</P>
<P>
   But no newspaper, TV show or magazine seemed able to resist. USA
Today on Wednesday featured a full-page color advertisement (''Got
Milk?'') with the ''Final Four'' Survivors wearing milk mustaches.
Under the headline ''END GAME,'' New York's Daily News splashed the
same photo on its front page.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment Weekly pushed back its deadline by a day and
prepared four possible covers, so as to feature the winner as its
cover story on the issue out next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Today'' show even interviewed Dawn Wells, who nearly 40
years ago played Mary Ann on the castaways comedy ''Gilligan's
Island.''
</P>
<P>
   But the TV show more directly comparable was ''Dallas.'' Since
that drama's ''Who Shot J.R.?'' mystery in 1980, nothing television
dealt out had gripped the nation in quite the same way. Until
''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   The first ''Survivor'' episode drew a healthy 15.5 million
viewers, but by mid-August, that number had nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the audience hooked, CBS imposed an information
clampdown, even as the castaways resumed their normal lives -- and
one of them, already the big winner, quietly envisioned life with a
million-dollar jackpot. Everyone associated with the show signed a
nondisclosure agreement with stiff cash penalties.

Mideast Jet Crash Kills 137
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- A Gulf Air Airbus A320 crashed into shallow Persian
Gulf waters Wednesday night after circling and trying to land in Bahrain,
killing at least 137 people, officials said. Rescuers were still searching early
Thursday for the other six people aboard. ''The search is still going on. We
have no survivors yet,'' Ibrahim Al-Hamer, Bahrain's undersecretary for civil
aviation, said in announcing 137 bodies had been recovered. Thirty-six of the
143 people aboard the flight, which originated in Cairo, were children,
officials said.

   MIAMI (AP) -- Visitors were ordered to leave the Florida Keys today as
officials prepared for the possibility that Tropical Storm Debby could hit
Florida as a hurricane. Monroe County, which encompasses the island chain,
declared a state of emergency with Debby still hundreds of miles away. ''It
could be powerfully close by Friday,'' said Michael Tichacek, a meteorologist at
the National Hurricane Center. Mary Ann Kirkland, dockmaster for Whale Harbor
Inn &AMP; Marina, said it was business as usual at the Keys fishing resort on
Islamorada, about 65 miles southwest of Miami.

Embryo Research Funding Approved

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New guidelines to allow federal funding of human embryo
cell research may prompt a revolution in medical science, leading to dramatic
new ways to treat virtually every human disorder. But anti-abortion groups are
vigorously opposed, saying the research means ''you have to kill a human
embryo.'' The guidelines, issued today, allow federal funding for research with
stem cells that have been removed from human embryos. The rules forbid research
on the embryo itself, which is prohibited by federal law.

Reno: No Probe of Gore

GOP Scuttles Attack Ad

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican Party abruptly dropped plans to air a TV ad

Lewinsky scandal. Officials with Texas Gov. George W. Bush's campaign and at the
Republican National Committee also objected on grounds that the ad used an
outdated Gore interview and conflicted with Bush's promise to soften the tenor

about-face.

Fires Close More Land in Montana

   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Montana Gov. Marc Racicot declared more of his state
off-limits to recreation because of extreme fire hazard. His new proclamation
means 19.6 million acres are closed -- about 31,250 square miles, an area
roughly the size of Maine. Twenty-seven large fires were burning nearly 630,000
acres in the state. Montana encompasses 93 million acres. The governor's new
order banned hiking, camping, hunting and fishing on public land in western
Montana and parts of central and southern Montana during the height of the

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Claims Compete in Kan.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Secretary of State Ron Thornburgh has
rejected certificates of nomination for Pat Buchanan and John
Hagelin, each of whom claims to be the Reform Party's nominee for
president and seeks a spot on Kansas' general election ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Thornburgh's decision is expected to force a meeting of the
State Objections Board, which would then decide who belongs on the
ballot under the Reform Party banner.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion resulted when Reform Party groups backing Buchanan and
Hagelin each submitted certificates of nomination to place their
candidate on the ballot. Each faction claims to represent the party
and consider their choice to be the party's legitimate nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for the competing camps said they will challenge
the Thornburgh's decision. Either side also could go to court to
overturn any decision by the board.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, election officials in Iowa and Montana were holding
drawings to decide which candidate to put on their state's general
election ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Thornburgh, Kansas' chief elections officer, said he does not
have the legal authority to choose a nominee and expressed
frustration Wednesday over the complication.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is the Reform Party needs to get itself in
order, and it needs to name one candidate in the state of Kansas,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> FSU's Polley Cleared To Play  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State senior linebacker Tommy
Polley was given medical clearance to play in the second-ranked
Seminoles' season-opener Saturday against Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
   Polley's return comes nearly eight months after he tore a knee
ligament in the second quarter of the Sugar Bowl victory over
Virginia Tech that gave the Seminoles the national championship. He
showed remarkable progress throughout fall practices and has
participated in full contact drills.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to see some spot duty,'' Polley said. ''I'm not
going to wear it out or try to take all the reps. I'm going to see
some time, but not all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Polley, who didn't compete in hitting drills until late last
week, had to prove to team doctors that he has fully recovered from
off-season knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bobby Bowden believes Polley will bolster a defense that
lost four starters from last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a pretty big boost,'' Bowden said. ''Because when he is
in there, and you watch him work, he's very active.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Brian Allen's status for Saturday's game is still
unknown, as the senior nurses a high right ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   Polley, who led the team in tackles last season with 109, said
he will not be favoring the injured leg.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm anxious to hit somebody,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hip-Hop Awards Show Ends Abruptly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- UPN will broadcast a rap music awards
show next week even though the glittery hip-hop celebration was cut
short by a bottle-throwing brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Only three performances and a handful of awards were announced
before The Source Hip-Hop Music Awards 2000 was shut down by
fights. Some witnesses said some involved members of various rap
groups, although police could not immediately confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a reflection of what hip-hop is really all
about,'' rapper Coolio said. ''Hip-hop is really about all the
people coming together.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, sponsored by The Source magazine, mingled rap stars
such as Grammy Award-winner Dr. Dre with mainstream celebrities.
About 2,500 people were inside Pasadena Civic Auditorium, including
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, basketball star Shaquille O'Neal and
boxing promoter Don King.
</P>
<P>
   There were no arrests and no injuries, police said.
</P>
<P>
   UPN said it will broadcast the show on Aug. 29 as scheduled. New
scenes will be taped to include awards that were not presented,
said Patti McTeague, a network spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an undertaking that we're willing to make,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   UPN broadcast the show for the first time last year, and it
produced the highest ratings the network had ever drawn for a
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Source does not condone violence of any kind and over the
years has worked hard to dispel negative images associated with
hip-hop,'' the magazine's founder and publisher, David Mays, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dre was the big winner at the awards show, garnering honors
for solo artist of the year, album of the year (''Dr. Dre 2001'')
and producer of the year (with Mel-Man). Dr. Dre and Ice Cube
received lifetime achievement awards.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court says no mayoral election needed in Utica  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) - A panel of judges from the state's second
highest court on Wednesday decided no special election is needed to
replace a mayor who resigned with more than three years left on his
term.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Julian, the city's former Common Council president,
automatically became mayor when Edward A. Hanna resigned July 3,
citing health problems.
</P>
<P>
   The five judges of the appellate division of the supreme court
in Rochester unanimously reversed the July 19 ruling by Supreme
Court Judge John R. Tenney that said Julian would have to face
Utica voters this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Tenney had ruled in favor of a lawsuit brought by Edward Revere,
a former county legislator who said he thought city residents
deserved a choice for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate division said Tenney was wrong to rule the city
code provided an exception to state law. The Utica code
specifically defers to state law when replacing a mayor, the panel
ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Julian said he was pleased by the ruling and eager to get to
work for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Since he resigned, the 78-year-old Hanna has been sued for $54
million by four male city workers who claimed he sexually harassed
them. The employees claim he made ''unwelcome sexual advances'' and
used his authority to pressure them to perform sex acts with him or
with others while he watched, conditioning their jobs or pay on
their response.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Sign C Boyd Devereaux  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Red Wings agreed to terms Wednesday
with unrestricted free agent Boyd Devereaux.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old center, who spent the past three seasons with
Edmonton, signed a three-year deal, Red Wings general manager Ken
Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   Devereaux, the sixth player taken in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft,
had 15 goals and 31 assists in 175 games with the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a young player who adds depth and speed to our hockey
club,'' Holland said. ''We also like his size and versatility as he
has played both center and left wing.
</P>
<P>
   ''As he matures as a hockey player, he should develop into a
solid two-way NHL player.''
</P>
<P>
   Devereaux had eight goals and 19 assists last season before an
April 1 hit from Phoenix's Dallas Drake left him with a severe
concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Devereaux was hurt with four minutes left in the second period,
of the Oilers' 4-3 win, when Drake caught him not looking and
leveled him with his shoulder. The hit sent Devereaux into
convulsions and he was removed from the ice on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   Holland said the Red Wings were satisfied with the results of a
battery of neurological tests Devereaux underwent in July.

<HEADLINE> Tenn. Politician Found Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By JASON STRAIT
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROSSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A man prosecutors said was consumed by
a thirst for political power was found guilty Wednesday in the
shooting death of his election opponent, a popular state senator.
</P>
<P>
   Byron (Low Tax) Looper, 35, was sentenced to life in prison
without parole by the same jury that convicted him in the death of
state Sen. Tommy Burks, the clear favorite to win the 1998
election.
</P>
<P>
   The Burks family had asked prosecutors not to seek the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments Wednesday, prosecutor Tony Craighead said
Looper killed Burks because he wanted his power and position.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a motive, a method to win this election with a Smith &AMP;
Wesson,'' Craighead said. ''Of all the people in all the world, who
had a reason to kill Tommy Burks? Byron Looper.''
</P>
<P>
   Burks, 58, was shot once in the head at his hog and tobacco farm
on Oct. 19, 1998. He was sitting in pickup truck on a gravel road
near a pumpkin patch where he planned to take schoolchildren on a
hayride.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Bill Gibson said there was no doubt Looper was
the killer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't leave DNA at the scene. He left a bullet at the
scene. He left tire tracks at the scene. He left an impression of
who he was on a young man (farmhand Wesley Rex) at the scene,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys relied on the testimony of Looper's mother and
her neighbors to try to prove Looper's innocence. They said he was
at his mother's home the morning Burks was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Looper, who legally changed his middle name from Anthony to (Low
Tax), was the Putnam County property assessor when he was charged
with Burks' murder.

<HEADLINE> Denvers' Smith Happy With NFL Fine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos wide receiver Rod Smith said
Wednesday he was satisfied with the NFL's conditional fine against
him in a verbal harassment case and is eager to continue his
court-ordered group therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel they made a fair decision,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, arrested on Jan. 24 for suspicion of domestic violence,
pleaded guilty last month to one misdemeanor count of verbal abuse.
He was sentenced to two years' probation and ordered to attend
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials then imposed a $25,000 conditional fine, which
Smith will not have to pay if he adheres to the terms of his
probation. He said he was ''very, very glad they made the decision
they did.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That way, I don't have to feel like I've let my teammates down
for thing I've done off the field, things that had nothing to do
with football,'' he said. ''Now, I just want to move on. I don't
want to have to worry about it, and I don't want to have to talk
about it any more.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith talked freely about the first of 36 group counseling
sessions he is required to attend. After the 90-minute session,
Smith said he has embraced the group concept.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was good; it was really good,'' Smith said. ''Anybody, any
person, needs this because you pretty much get your problems out of
the way. You have only an hour-and-a-half, but it was a huge relief
to hear just normal guys and how they got caught up in the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he felt so good after the session that he hopes to
persuade some teammates to join him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because our lives are so public, we try to keep our personal
stuff totally separate. So we hardly ever talk about it. And the
thing is, we actually need to talk about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith met with NFL officials to present his version of the
circumstances surrounding the altercation with Jami Mourglia, the
mother of his two children. He also submitted documents that showed
Mourglia had recanted her claims of physical assault and said the
couple merely had an argument.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he said Mourglia helped him restore his
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was a huge part of that, in helping me get my name and my
character back,'' he said.

137 Killed in Mideast Jet Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- A Gulf Air Airbus A320 crashed into shallow Persian
Gulf waters Wednesday night after circling and trying to land in Bahrain,
killing at least 137 people, officials said. Rescuers were still searching early
Thursday for the other six people aboard. ''The search is still going on. We
have no survivors yet,'' Ibrahim Al-Hamer, Bahrain's undersecretary for civil
aviation, said in announcing 137 bodies had been recovered. Thirty-six of the
143 people aboard the flight, which originated in Cairo, were children,
officials said.

embryo.'' The guidelines, issued today, allow federal funding for research with
stem cells that have been removed from human embryos. The rules forbid research

<HEADLINE> 22 Hurt in Panic of Turkey Quake  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- A strong quake shook western Turkey on
Wednesday, hitting an area devastated by a massive quake last year.
At least 22 people were injured when they jumped out of buildings
in panic, private NTV television reported.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.8, was centered
near the town of Hendek, 105 miles east of Istanbul, said Ahmet
Mete Isikara, head of Istanbul's Kandilli Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Hendek is 13 miles east of Adapazari, a town that was virtually
leveled in last year's earthquake, which killed 17,000 people and
destroyed hundreds of thousands of buildings.
</P>
<P>
   At least three people were brought to a hospital in Adapazari
suffering from shock, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Isikara said the governor of the Adapazari region told him there
were apparently no deaths or serious damage.
</P>
<P>
   At a state-owned train factory in Adapazari, which was heavily
damaged in last year's quake, workers left the building in panic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone rushed out,'' said Emin Yilmaz, a switchboard
operator at the TUVASAS train factory. But he said there was no
damage at the factory.
</P>
<P>
   The 8 to 10 second temblor hit at 4:41 p.m. It shook buildings
in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city with some 12 million
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Following last year's quake, some 26,000 people in the quake
zone still live in tents, while another 150,000 live in
prefabricated homes provided by the government.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 6, Mariners 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- On a night insects invaded Comerica Park, Juan
Encarnacion hit a two-run triple in a five-run seventh inning that
rallied the Detroit Tigers past Seattle 6-5 Wednesday, the
Mariners' ninth loss in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Swarms of flying insects caused fans to flee their seats early
in the game. Fans began running up the aisles as Seattle's Edgar
Martinez batted in the first inning, swatting at the insects as
they moved. Those who remained in their seats were constantly
swatting at the bugs on themselves or others.
</P>
<P>
   Pitches in the Tigers' bullpen started a small fire trying to
ward off the attack. The game was never delayed, and fans returned
to their seats as play progressed. There was no immediate word on
what caused the swarm.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez hit his career-high 30th home run and Mike Cameron also
homered for Seattle, who began the night 3&AMP;frac12; games ahead of Oakland
in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit trailed 4-1 before batting around in the seventh,
getting five straight hits.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Rhodes (3-7) gave up four consecutive hits after
relieving starter Paul Abbott. Jose Macias had an RBI single,
Wendell Magee a pinch single, Encarnacion tripled to the
right-field corner and Bobby Higginson hit a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez greeted Jose Mesa with an RBI single before Dean
Palmer's sacrifice fly gave Detroit a 6-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Cruz (5-1) pitched 1 1-3 innings, allowing Cameron's solo
homer in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Jones pitched the ninth for his AL-leading 36th save in 38
tries.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott gave up two runs and six hits in 6 1-3 innings. Tigers
starter Hideo Nomo left trailing 4-1 after allowing eight hits with
six strikeouts and two walks in 6 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back two-out doubles from Carlos Guillen and Wilson gave
the Mariners a 1-0 lead in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez hit an RBI double in the third but was out trying
to steal third. That cost the Mariners a run when Martinez followed
with a long solo homer.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit broke through in the sixth when Billy McMillon hit a
leadoff double and scored on Encarnacion's single.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson doubled, moved up on Henderson's single and scored on
John Olerud's ground out to make it 4-1 in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Martinez had 29 homers with the Mariners in both 1995 and
1998. ... Abbott was 0-2 with a 16.50 ERA in two previous career
appearances against Detroit. ... The Tigers haven't lost two
straight since Aug. 6-7 against Minnesota and Baltimore. ... Rhodes
hasn't retired a batter in either of the first two games in
Detroit. He walked Higginson, the only batter he faced, Tuesday.
... Wednesday's crowd of 32,356 pushed season attendance at
Comerica Park to 2,016,652.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Tony Meola made a Kansas
City-record nine saves for his MLS-record 14th shutout of the
season as the Wizards and New York-New Jersey MetroStars played to
a scoreless tie Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards, 1-4-4 in their last nine road games, have a
league-best 14-7-7 record and 49 points. The MetroStars, 5-0-3 in
their last eight home games, are second at 15-10-3 and 48 points.
</P>
<P>
   New York-New Jersey's Tim Howard made four saves for his fifth
shutout.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars dominated the first half, outshooting the Wizards
14-7. It was more of the same in the second half, but neither team
was able to score despite several good chances.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars had two good chances. Mike Petke's shot from 15
yards outside the box was tipped over the bar by Meola in the 62nd
minute, and Alex Comas' header off Petter Villegas' cross missed
just wide in the 72nd minute.
</P>
<P>
   A header by the MetroStars' Clint Mathis sailed just over the
bar in the third minute of overtime.

<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- Former major league pitcher Orel
Hershiser made his broadcasting debut Wednesday in the Little
League World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, who retired from baseball last month, teamed with
Brent Musburger and Harold Reynolds on ESPN2 to announce the game
between Davenport, Iowa, and Vancouver, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ''With retiring, (ESPN) knew I had some time available and they
kind of bounced it off me,'' Hershiser said. ''I thought it would
be a great opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Los Angeles Dodgers star said he was both excited and
nervous before his first broadcast, and he still doesn't know if he
will pursue it as a career.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good way to put my toe in the water and see what it's
like,'' Hershiser said. ''I have some other aspirations and some
other opportunities that may arise so I don't want to get stuck on
one thing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser also will announce Thursday's U.S. Pool final and
Saturday's championship game.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   DAY OFF: The players on the Bellaire, Texas, team slept in on
their first day off in the Series.
</P>
<P>
   Bellaire will face Davenport, Iowa, on Thursday in the U.S.
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ''The advantage is the kids have really had today to relax,''
Bellaire coach Cliff Atherton said.
</P>
<P>
   After all the players woke up, the team watched the TV
rebroadcast of Tuesday's seven-inning 6-4 win over Davenport. And
they joined parents for a visit to the Little League Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR LEAGUE CALL-UP: The Bellaire team also received a special
treat Tuesday when Houston Astros pitcher Scott Elarton and
infielder Bill Spiers called.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Atherton said the team was notified about the conference
call Tuesday morning and that it surprised the kids. The Little
Leaguers questioned Elarton about his biggest win and who has hit
the longest home run ever off him. Spiers shared some of his Little
League memories.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Astros organization really put it together,'' Atherton
said. ''And it was really wonderful for the kids.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   TRADE YOU: When a home run ball clears the hedge beyond the
fence at Howard J. Lamade Stadium, it is usually gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   The rabid fans, a good many being young kids, normally snatch up
the balls and hold on to them as keepsakes.
</P>
<P>
   Nine-year-old Steven Godine of New Jersey is obviously
different.
</P>
<P>
   Godine came up with the ball Leo Nakayama launched onto the hill
Tuesday in Japan's 9-0 win over Saudi Arabia. Instead of keeping
the home run ball, Godine decided to give it back to the Japanese
Little Leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   To repay Godine's kindness, Nakayama gave him an autographed
baseball.

<HEADLINE> Davenport Iowa 6, Vancouver, Wash 4  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- The team from Davenport, Iowa, became
the first from the Central Region to reach the U.S. Pool
championships at the Little League World Series on Wednesday night,
eliminating Vancouver, Wash., which used a 6-year-old boy as their
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Evans had two hits and scored twice, including the
go-ahead run in the fifth inning that clinched the dramatic 6-4
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, which earlier this week ended the Central Region's
three-year losing drought at the Series, will meet Bellaire, Texas,
in Thursday's final.
</P>
<P>
   While three teams finished with 2-1 records, Vancouver wound up
being the odd squad out under the tie-breaking format.
</P>
<P>
   Bellaire, which lost 5-0 to Vancouver on Monday, clinched a
berth because it wound up with the fewest runs allowed per inning.
Davenport became the second seed by virtue of beating Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, when the pool format was introduced, the Central was
the only region not to reach the U.S. final.
</P>
<P>
   As euphoric as it was for Davenport, it was a sudden and
unlikely end for the Little Leaguers from Hazel Dell-Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Their remarkable summer run had been dedicated to and inspired
by 6-year-old Tyler ''TJ'' Jacobs, who underwent surgery to remove
a benign brain tumor last June.
</P>
<P>
   A day after overcoming a 4-0 fifth-inning deficit to beat
Goffstown, N.H., 6-4, Vancouver -- only the third team from
Washington team to reach the Series -- had run out of dramatics.
</P>
<P>
   The International Pool finalists were decided Tuesday. Tokyo
(3-0) will face Maracaibo, Venezuela (2-1), in a rematch of regions
from last year's final won by Osaka, which went on to win the
Series title.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport starter Dan O'Donnell earned his second Series win,
scattering four hits and allowing only two baserunners over the
final three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Ponciano had two hits for Vancouver, while Josh Hash drove
in three runs.
</P>
<P>
   After the teams traded leads, Davenport struck for two runs in
the fifth to go ahead 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, with a leadoff single, eventually scored on catcher
Michael Schwartz's infield hit over the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport added an insurance run when reliever Jesse Boehm hit
Chris Kolar with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   It was both a sloppy and gutsy battle.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver opened the scoring with two runs in the first without
the benefit of a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport rallied for four runs in the third on two hits and two
Vancouver errors.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver responded in the bottom of the third, tying the game
4-4 on Hash's two-out, two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Philip Hecht had three hits and drove in the winning
run lifting Dahran, Saudi Arabia to a 3-1 win over Toronto in a
game between the International Pool's two winless teams.
</P>
<P>
   The loss capped a week of heartbreak for Toronto, which lost its
three games by a combined four runs.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto manager David Trimble was still reliving the previous
day's 5-4 dramatic loss to Maracaibo, a game in which Toronto lost
on a two-out, two-run single in the bottom of the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ''That one was in my mind all last night,'' Trimble said. ''It
was a big emotional letdown on the kids. It took a lot of time to
get them cheered up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of week for Toronto, which opened the Series
losing 9-8 to Tokyo, despite a six-run, sixth-inning rally.
</P>
<P>
   Dhahran manager Al Griffith was pleased that the long trip to
Williamsport ended with a win, especially after his team combined
for five hits and were outscored 12-0 in its two previous games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel real good. The kids are ecstatic about it,'' Griffith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tied 1-1, and runners at first and third, Hecht singled up the
middle driving home Doug Wood. Then Riley Arp scored on a wild
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht had three hits and finished the Series going 6-for-8,
including two doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Chong allowed three runs -- two earned -- and six hits,
striking out four, while Toronto squandered a 1-0 lead and stranded
eight baserunners.

   HOUSTON (AP) -- An American Airlines jet encountered severe
turbulence over the Gulf of Mexico, turned around and landed safely
in Houston, an airline official said. Thirteen people were treated
for minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 304 bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico, left Dallas on
Wednesday afternoon with 60 passengers and eight crew members.
</P>
<P>
   It encountered turbulence about 10 minutes off the Texas coast,
airline spokesman Dale Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our captain declared an emergency and made a safe landing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the injured were flight attendants. Paramedics said a cut
scalp was the worst injury among the cuts, bumps and bruises.

<HEADLINE> USA 70, Canada 31  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- With its shots going every which way but in, the
U.S. women's basketball team showcased another part of its game
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The United States smothered Canada with suffocating defense to
survive a shaky start offensively, then got its running game going
in the second half to rout the Canadians for the second straight
night, 70-31.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthie Bolton-Holifield led the way with 14 points and gave her
team a jump start when its was struggling on offense at the start.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, on the other hand, was never a problem for the
Americans, who are favored to repeat as the gold medalists in the
Sydney Olympics next month and are showing they have all the
ingredients to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   The United States pressured the ballhandlers on the perimeter,
closed off the passing lanes and kept the post players from getting
the ball, all while holding the Canadians to 26.7 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   So effective was the defense that Canada went the final 9:10 of
the first half and the opening 4:42 of the second half without a
basket. The only point Canada managed during that stretch was a
free throw by Stacey Dales.
</P>
<P>
   While that was going on, the United States was expanding a 19-10
lead to 39-11, mainly by beating the Canadians down the floor. The
lead would have been bigger except the U.S. inside players kept
missing layups and Katie Smith, the team's most reliable outside
shooter, couldn't get her shots to drop.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was 0-for-5 in the first half and was wide open on every
shot. She hit two quick ones at the start of the second half,
however, including a 3-pointer, to help the United States increase
its lead to 30 points.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Griffith added 11 points for the United States, while
Vicky Bullett had nine and Nikki McCray and Kara Wolters added
eight each.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Sutton-Brown led Canada with eight points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The United States beat Canada 81-40 in San Antonio on Tuesday
night and they meet again in Oakland, Calif., on Saturday. The U.S.
team then will start making its way to Sydney, playing six more
exhibition games before its Sept. 16 Olympics opener with South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 100th game with a U.S. team for coach Nell Fortner,
who starred in basketball and volleyball at Texas. Fortner is
86-14, with a world championship in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest victory had an inauspicious start. The U.S. team
missed six of its first seven shots, including three layups, but it
didn't matter because the Americans kept Canada in check at the
other end.
</P>
<P>
   After getting two baskets in the first 4:15, the Canadians made
only three more the rest of the half. Once its shooters warmed up,
the United States pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton-Holifield helped get the Americans going. She hit a jump
shot in transition and banked in another after a nifty pump fake to
key an 11-0 run that put the United States ahead to stay at 13-4.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bolton-Holifield nailed a jumper from the wing and a
3-pointer as the United States scored the final eight points of the
half for a 31-11 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The lead grew to 43-13 when Teresa Edwards, about to become a
five-time Olympian, fed McCray for a fastbreak layup and Bullett's
three-point play after a steal made it 52-17 midway through the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   The United States still does not have its complete team. Lisa
Leslie and DeLisha Milton will join the team in California. Sheryl
Swoopes will come on board after the WNBA finals.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Carlos Delgado had his fifth two-homer game of
the season, hitting a go-ahead drive in the eighth inning as the
Toronto Blue Jays won their third straight, 9-8 over the Kansas
City Royals on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado, who tied Chicago's Frank Thomas for the AL lead with 38
homers, hit a leadoff homer in a five-run seventh that tied the
score at 8, then hit a go-ahead shot in the eighth off Andy Larkin
(0-2).
</P>
<P>
   Delgado has 22 multihomer games, including five this season.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Gonzalez tied a career high with five RBIs, including a
game-tying two-run double in the seventh. Gonzalez went 3-for-5,
including a two-run homer in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Kelvim Escobar (9-13) won for the second straight night,
allowing one hit in one inning. Billy Koch pitched a perfect ninth
for his 30th save in 34 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto rallied in the seventh as Delgado homered and Jose Cruz
Jr. hit a two-run drive.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto starter Esteban Loaiza, acquired from Texas on July 19,
gave up seven runs and seven hits in just 3 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez hit a two-run homer in the first, but Kansas City tied
in the second on consecutive RBI doubles by Todd Dunwoody and Greg
Zaun. Johnny Damon homered in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City scored five runs in the fourth on Zaun's RBI double,
and consecutive run-scoring singles by Jeff Reboulet, Damon and Rey
Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
Notes: After Delgado hit his 37th homer, Tony Batista narrowly
missed his 37th one batter later when he doubled off the wall in
left-center. ... ... Damon is batting .438 (77-for-176) in 40 games
since the All-Star break. ... Damon scored twice, raising his
career-high runs total to 109. ... Kansas City starter Blake Stein
hasn't lost in five starts since Aug. 2. He gave up three runs and
six hits in six innings.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Congress on Schools  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- President Clinton had three
missions in New Jersey on Wednesday: Help the Democrats win back
the House, plug Al Gore's run for president and push his own
education initiatives through Congress before he leaves the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ''All over America, our faculties are better than our
facilities,'' Clinton said, standing outside one of eight classroom
trailers at Crossroads Middle School, a building that was designed
for 1,200 students, but will have 1,650 when classes start after
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got the problem of the trailers, and then you've got
the problem in our cities of so many old school buildings that
either can't be or haven't been modernized. You've got whole floors
in some of these schools that are shut down, even though the
schools are full to the gills.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that a record 53 million will enter public and private
schools this fall, Clinton criticized Congress for engaging in a
philosophical debate about the federal government's role in
education instead of approving money to modernize America's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has requested $25 billion in interest-free modernization
bonds for school districts to help build and renovate 6,000 schools
nationwide. He also wants Congress to approve $6.5 billion in
grants and interest-free loans to make emergency roof, heating,
cooling and electrical repairs at 5,000 schools.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress, who don't want the federal government
meddling in local school district affairs, fear Clinton's plan
would create unnecessary bureaucracy in Washington. The GOP prefers
a tax credit plan like one Clinton vetoed last year when Congress
aimed to lower a school district's cost of borrowing money for
building projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the past two years, Congress has sent school construction
packages to President Clinton and both times he vetoed them,'' said
House Ways and Mean chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. ''We will try
again but I hope this year our schoolchildren come before politics,
and that the president will drop his veto pen and pick up an
attitude of compromise so we can get this done.''
</P>
<P>
   With education a top concern among voters in this year's
presidential election, Clinton also took time to laud Vice
President Gore's work to improve the federal student loan program,
provide tax credits for college tuition and get 95 percent of
schools connected to the Internet -- up from 35 percent five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at the school before attending two receptions for
Democratic congressional candidates. One was to raise $200,000 for
Cherry Hill Mayor Susan Bass Levin and the other was to bring in
$250,000 for Rep. Rush Holt, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats need to win seven congressional seats to gain a
majority in the House; five in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At Garden State Park in Cherry Hill, the site of a
Clinton-for-president rally that Levin hosted on the eve of the
1992 presidential election, Clinton urged the donors to go out and
tell voters about the differences between Democratic and Republican
policies. Tell them: ''Here are the differences on economic policy,
education policy, health care policy, human rights policy, crime
policy. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton stumped for Holt, a former university professor
running against Dick Zimmer, who defeated former Rep. Mike Pappas
in the Republican primary earlier this year. Zimmer, a former
member of Congress himself, ran ads that labeled Pappas foolish for
singing ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Kenneth Starr'' on the House floor
during the Clinton impeachment ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 people, who drank champagne and snacked on chicken
with artichokes under a white tent in Princeton, N.J., listened as
Clinton said that even Republicans should think long and hard about
replacing a physicist who has a grip on complicated technological
and scientific issues facing America.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need someone who really understands this stuff,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Banging the podium, the president pleaded with the audience to
tell everyone they know between now and November to support Gore,
Holt and Jon Corzine, a multimillionaire venture capitalist running
for the Senate from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Then he remembered first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is
running for a Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''And Hillary -- if they live in New York,'' he quickly added.

<HEADLINE> Insects Swarm Tigers' Comerica Park  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREA CECIL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Things got kind of buggy at Comerica Park
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Swarms of small insects caused fans to flee their seats early in
the Detroit Tigers' game with the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Fans began running up the aisles as Seattle's Edgar Martinez
batted in the first inning, swatting at the insects as they moved.
Those who remained in their seats repeatedly swatted at bugs on
themselves or others.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers in Detroit bullpen started a small fire in an attempt
to ward off the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State University entomologist Howard Russell said if
it's the species of flying ant he suspects, the insect will be
around for another week to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   He said something must have caused the species to abandon its
ground nest. Russell said the reason could be weather conditions or
the length of the day compared to the length of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said he has received reports from Grand Blanc, Lansing,
Frankenmuth, as well as Detroit concerning the swarms of bugs. But,
he said not to worry -- the insects are harmless.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bugs came in like the plague,'' said Noel Selewski, a
season-ticket holder from Grosse Pointe. ''I couldn't sit in my
seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, we came to the ballpark and wasted an evening. ...
It was horrible. I couldn't sit there anymore. I was full of
bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura McGregor, of St. Clair Shores, brought in-laws from Las
Vegas to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father-in-law thought the fans were doing the wave. People
were rushing out all at once,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor, whose seats were in section 135 in the mid-lower
level, said people covered in bugs were rushing up the steps from
lower levels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, people in guest services were taking down people's
names and seat numbers, but it was not immediately clear whether
refunds would be offered.
</P>
<P>
   ''If millions, if not billions of bugs set their sights on your
city, there's not much you can do,'' Tigers spokesman Tyler Barnes
said. ''We're responsive to fans, but in this case, we're dealing
with circumstances beyond our control.''
</P>
<P>
   The bugs, which looked like black ants with long, clear wings,
were visible on cars parked in lots outside the park, on people's
clothing, on the sidewalk and in some unfortunate cases, the ants
flew into people's mouths.

<HEADLINE> Initial tests find no contamination at school  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) - The soil, air and water at a high school
where 40 former or current students have developed cancer pose no
apparent threat to health or the environment, according to
information released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Conservation now will
shift its focus to two sites near Southside High School for
potential contamination.
</P>
<P>
   A presentation scheduled for Wednesday was to discuss the study
and disclose the number of students who have had cancer since the
school opened in 1979, comparing that number with normal rates.
</P>
<P>
   State engineers collected 135 samples from more than 46 soil
borings between May and August. The samples were tested for a wide
range of contaminants including metals, volatile chemical compounds
and pesticides. More than 100 years worth of industrial waste is
buried a few feet below the surface, under the school.
</P>
<P>
   ''The results of (the state's) investigation show that there are
no consequential amounts of hazardous waste and there is no
significant threat to public health or the environment at Southside
High School,'' said Thomas Kump, director of environmental health
for Chemung County and president of the Elmira City School Board.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report also showed the air inside and outside the
school does not pose a health threat. Additionally, all water used
in the school meets state standards.
</P>
<P>
   The soil is contaminated with elevated levels of metals, an
easily evaporated chemical called trichloroethene, TCE; synthetic
chemical pesticides called polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs; and
some petroleum-related contaminants called polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, PAHs.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is no current health risk, the state health
department recommends the school district restrict the property
deed to prevent digging there in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The DEC said it will examine two adjacent sites where engineers
discovered contaminants including semi-volatile organic compounds,
metals and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   The school site was chosen in the 1970s before federal
legislation required polluted industrial sites to be cleaned up.
Today, the site would have been cleared of the contamination before
the school could have been built.
</P>
<P>
   Elmira is 74 miles southwest of Syracuse.

<HEADLINE> Nebraska DT Has Appendix Removed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Nebraska defensive tackle Loran Kaiser had
his appendix removed Wednesday and the doctor who performed the
surgery expressed optimism that he would be able to play in the
season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Norris said the surgery went well and Kaiser should
be released from the hospital Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Norris said Kaiser should be able to play Sept. 2 against San
Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, one of five defensive starters returning for the
top-ranked Cornhuskers, went to team trainers Wednesday morning
complaining of a pain in his side. By noon the pain had gotten
worse and Kaiser was taken to Bryan Memorial Hospital, where he had
an appendectomy late Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser will not participate in a team scrimmage Friday, coach
Frank Solich said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser is a two-year starter who had 36 tackles, including 3&AMP;frac12;
sacks, last season. His backup is junior Jeremy Slechta, who had 19
tackles in seven games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Slechta is coming off reconstructive surgery on his left knee
that kept him out of spring practice.

   CLEVELAND (AP) -- David Segui's go-ahead RBI double in the sixth
inning Wednesday night sent the Cleveland Indians to their fifth
straight win, a 7-5 victory over the Oakland Athletics that
included more bad blood between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome homered as Cleveland won for the 14th time in 19 games
to open a one-game lead over Boston in the AL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The A's, who have lost five of six and 12 of 17, are 1&AMP;frac12; back.
</P>
<P>
   For the second night in a row the teams exchanged brushback
pitches and trash talk.
</P>
<P>
   The starting pitchers for both teams were warned after head-high
pitches emptied the dugouts and bullpens for some heated
finger-pointing and animated conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Segui and Travis Fryman each hit RBI doubles in the sixth after
Cleveland starter Bartolo Colon was forced to leave the game with
tendinitis in his left knee. He is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Segui, sent sprawling earlier by an inside pitch from Tim Hudson
(13-6), got revenge against the right-hander in the sixth with his
double that put the Indians up 6-5 and chased Hudson, who allowed
seven runs and eight hits in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman followed with a run-scoring double off Doug Jones.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring twice off Paul Shuey (4-1) to tie it in the sixth,
the A's got a one-out double from Adam Piatt in the seventh before
Ricardo Rincon, activated from the DL earlier in the day, replaced
Shuey.
</P>
<P>
   Rincon hadn't pitched since May 16 after undergoing elbow
surgery, but retired pinch-hitter Eric Byrnes on one pitch. Steve
Karsay got the final out in the seventh and got out of a
bases-loaded mess in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wickman pitched the ninth for his sixth save.
</P>
<P>
   Colon gave up a one-out double in the sixth to Ramon Hernandez
and threw two balls to Frank Menechino before looking to the
Indians' dugout for help.
</P>
<P>
   Shuey replaced Colon, who has chronic knee problems, and walked
Menechino. One out later, Miguel Tejada's double tied it 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar's diving stop to end the top of the fifth sparked
the Indians, who scored four runs in the bottom half to open a 5-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging into shallow right, Alomar dived to grab Piatt's hard
grounder, popped to his feet and threw to first for the out, saving
a run and keeping the Indians within 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Vizquel and Kenny Lofton -- both swinging at Hudson's first
pitch -- each hit two-run singles in the Indians' four-run fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The wild-card race might be behind the Indians and A's recent
dislike for each other.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Indians reliever Steve Reed incensed the A's by
hitting rookie Eric Byrnes. Oakland's bench screamed at Reed, and
Jeff Tam sent a nasty message to Cleveland via two fastballs behind
catcher Sandy Alomar's back.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's festivities began when Hudson knocked down Segui in
the second. In the bottom half, Colon fired two pitches over Ben
Grieve's head.
</P>
<P>
   The A's jumped on Colon for three runs in the first on Grieve's
RBI double and Piatt's two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   Thome's 31st homer, a shot to straightaway center, brought the
Indians within 3-1 in the second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Thome's homer moved him past Earl Averill for second on the
team's career list. His 227th homer was also Thome's 999th career
hit. He picked up his 1,000th with a single in the sixth. ...
Cleveland is 6-1 vs. Oakland at home this season. ... The A's have
lost 10 of 11 on the road. ... Hudson is 0-2 with a 10.89 ERA in
four career starts vs. Cleveland.

the bodies and there were no survivors, Bahraini Civil Defense Commander
Brigadier Abdul-Rahman Bin Rashed Al Khalifa said on state-run television.
Thirty-six passengers on the flight, which was en route to Manama from Cairo,
were children, officials said. Searchers recovered both flight data recorders.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Negotiators for Verizon Communications and more than
35,000 telephone workers reached tentative agreement on a new contract tonight,
ending an 18-day strike in six mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia.
The company and the last of three bargaining units settled on a three-year
contract covering workers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Union representatives for
50,000 other workers in New York and New England already agreed to a package
Sunday night. All three contracts still need to be ratified by unions members.

Embryo Research Funding Approved

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New guidelines to allow federal funding of human embryo
cell research may prompt a revolution in medical science, leading to dramatic
new ways to treat virtually every human disorder. But anti-abortion groups are
vigorously opposed, saying the research means ''you have to kill a human
embryo.'' The guidelines, issued today, allow federal funding for research with
stem cells that have been removed from human embryos. The rules forbid research
on the embryo itself, which is prohibited by federal law.

Gore by the Justice Department's campaign finance task force, Reno concluded
that further investigation is not likely to result in a prosecutable case. ''The
transcript reflects neither false statements nor perjury,'' Reno told her weekly

Dan Marino, mostly played spectator, a role to which he's still adjusting.
''It's kind of overwhelming,'' he said. ''Thinking about all the terrific times

<HEADLINE> Buoniconti Selected as HOF Finalist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Nick Buoniconti, the middle linebacker who
helped the Miami Dolphins to the NFL's last unbeaten season in
1972, was selected Wednesday by the Pro Football Hall of Fame's
senior committee as a finalist for the Class of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Buoniconti will join a list that is to include 14 modern era
players yet to be selected.
</P>
<P>
   To be elected, Buoniconti must receive 80 percent of the votes
from the hall's 38-member Board of Selectors. The board will elect
between four and seven new members in January.
</P>
<P>
   After playing as an offensive guard and linebacker at Notre
Dame, Buoniconti wasn't selected in the 1962 NFL draft, but was
picked in the 13th round of the AFL draft by the Boston Patriots.
He was traded to the Dolphins in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   He became the leader of Miami's ''No Name Defense'' on teams
that went to the Super Bowl three times and won two championships.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 5, Pirates 2  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Rick Ankiel won for the second time in 11
starts and Jim Edmonds homered for the second time in three games,
leading the St. Louis Cardinals over the Pittsburgh Pirates 5-2
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel (8-7) had been 1-4 since June 20, mostly due to control
problems that forced him out of games early. However, the Cardinals
have won in his last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel, at 20 the youngest pitcher in the major leagues, allowed
six hits with six strikeouts and four walks in seven innings, which
matched his season high. He gave up home runs to Keith Osik and
Enrique Wilson in his final inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Veres got four outs for his 22nd save in 27 chances,
stranding Aramis Ramirez, who had tripled in the eighth, when Osik
popped out to shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds hit his 34th homer in the first off Todd Ritchie (6-7).
Edmonds' three-run shot Monday was his first in 57 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive doubles by Will Clark and Fernando Tatis followed by
a triple by Will Clark made it 3-0 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Osik hit his third homer leading off the seventh and Wilson hit
his fifth with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who had three hits, hit his fifth homer to the opposite
field off Scott Sauerbeck in the eighth. It was his first homer
since he connected in his first four starts for the Cardinals from
Aug. 2 to 6.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Renteria added an RBI single off Rich Loiselle later in
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie lasted six innings, allowing three runs and seven hits,
in his third start since coming off the disabled list from a
strained muscle under his armpit.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The NL Central-leading Cardinals have won six of eight. ...
Fernando Vina extended his hitting streak to a career-best 15 games
with a triple in the third. It was a routine fly ball but LF Brian
Giles and CF Adrian Brown collided. ... Edmonds has reached in 100
of his 115 starts. ... The Cardinals have outscored opponents
122-73 in the first inning. ... Giles, who had been 17-for-35
during a 10-game hitting streak with 12 extra-base hits, was
0-for-3 with two walks. ... Brown had two hits and is 13-for-30 his
last seven games. ... The Pirates completed a 3-6 trip and dropped
to 22-41 on the road. They've won only five of their last 16 games
overall.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 4, Reds 3  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Mike Lieberthal's eighth-inning homer started
a three-run rally that swept the Philadelphia Phillies over the
Cincinnati Reds 4-3 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies got consecutive wins for the first time since Aug.
8-9 by overcoming a 3-1 deficit against Scott Sullivan and All-Star
closer Danny Graves (10-4).
</P>
<P>
   Benito Santiago's pinch bases-loaded single in the seventh off
Robert Person put the Reds up 3-1, but Lieberthal's 15th homer, a
drive off Sullivan, started the Phillies' comeback.
</P>
<P>
   After Travis Lee singled and Rob Ducey walked, Marlon Anderson
grounded a single up the middle that barely eluded Graves and
diving shortstop Barry Larkin, tying the game at 3. Tomas Perez hit
into a forceout at second that allowed Ducey to score the go-ahead
run and gave Graves his fourth blown save in 25 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Brock (7-6) retired the only batter he faced to close out
the seventh and get in line for the win. Vicente Padilla got two
outs for his first career save.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati lost for the seventh time in nine games, extending a
month-long slump at home that has squashed its comeback in the NL
Central. e Reds are 4-11 at home since July 24.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Ken Griffey Jr. stopped Hall of Fame
broadcaster Marty Brennaman and took issue with his criticism.
Brennaman criticized Griffey on the air Sunday for jogging to first
base on a hit that could have been stretched to a double.
</P>
<P>
   During their heated conversation, Brennaman said he'll continue
to point out when Griffey fails to hustle. Griffey went 0-for-4,
ending his eight-game hitting streak and dropping his average to
.257.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds wasted a highly efficient start by Scott Williamson,
who threw 70 strikes out of 107 pitches in seven innings. He
matched his career high with eight strikeouts and gave up only four
hits on a night when it appeared he wouldn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson hurt himself when he lost his balance and stumbled
off the side of the mound as he threw a pitch to Doug Glanville in
the third inning. After the trainer talked to him, Williamson took
a few warmup throws and stayed in the game, though he moved slowly
between innings.
</P>
<P>
   Person gave up three runs -- two earned -- and five hits in 6 2-3
innings. He lost his control in the seventh, letting a 1-all tie
slip away. The Reds loaded the bases with two outs on Dmitri
Young's double and a pair of walks, and Person went to a 3-1 count
on Santiago before giving up a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: When Philadelphia's Omar Daal (3-14) faces Cincinnati's
Steve Parris (7-14) in the series finale Thursday, it will mark the
first time two starters with at least 14 losses faced each other
since Oct. 1, 1992, when Seattle's Erik Hanson (8-17) was matched
against Milwaukee's Bill Wegman (12-14). Milwaukee won that game
7-2 in 10 innings as Wegman pitched a complete game. ... Glanville
singled in the fifth, extending his hitting streak to 10 games. ...
The pine tar-covered bat that Cincinnati's Alex Ochoa used for his
first career grand slam is headed to the baseball Hall of Fame.
Ochoa's slam Tuesday night was the 142nd in the majors this season,
a record. ... Reliever Mark Wohlers had more tests Wednesday that
came back normal. Wohlers has been bothered by pain in his lower
right side that evidently is the result of a pulled muscle.

<HEADLINE> Notes from Monday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Rangers-Yankees:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEXAS: The Rangers went 12 straight games without scoring in the
first inning before getting four on Tuesday and two on Wednesday.
... Closer John Wetteland earned his first save in four weeks on
Tuesday night. His six appearances between saves were the most
since going seven straight at the start of the 1994 season. ''I am
so happy for that man,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ... Rafael
Palmeiro homered in the first two games of the series, giving him
393 for his career. ''He's starting to get into one of those
grooves,'' Oates said. ''He's an important part of our offense.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Jose Canseco let manager Joe Torre know he is able to
play outfield for the short-handed Yankees. ''I'm definitely
willing to do it. But it is a scary thought. I don't want to
embarrass myself or the organization out there so I'm working on
getting in the best condition I can.'' ... OFs Bernie Williams
(sore right rib cage) and David Justice (neck) did not start again.
Williams has missed five straight games and won't be back until at
least the weekend. Justice, who was available to pinch hit, missed
his third straight game. ... INF Mike Coolbaugh, who is playing at
Triple-A Columbus, was the only Yankee picked for the U.S. Olympic
team.
Angels-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: RHP Ramon Ortiz hasn't had it easy. Since being
recalled Aug. 8, he's faced only the top two teams in the AL East.
He was 0-1 in two starts against the New York Yankees since beating
Boston's Pedro Martinez 1-0 with a two-hit complete game on the day
of his recall. ... Even backups hit plenty of homers for the
Angels, who have set a club record for homers in a season. Four of
Ron Gant's seven hits for Anaheim before Wednesday were homers. ...
Mo Vaughn started the day with 95 RBIs and seems likely to become
the second Angels player to have consecutive 100 RBI seasons. Wally
Joyner did it in 1986 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Nomar Garciaparra is hurting -- at bat and in the body.
He wasn't in the starting lineup Wednesday as he nursed a minor
hamstring injury incurred Tuesday night. His hitting problems have
lasted longer. Garciaparra was mired in a 4-for-26 slump. His .369
batting average was his lowest since June 1 when he was hitting
.361. ... Entering Wednesday, Boston played 11 games since Carl
Everett hit his last homer, his 29th. The last time a Red Sox
outfielder hit 30 homers was 1984 when Tony Armas had 43 and Dwight
Evans had 32.
Mariners-Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: OF Rickey Henderson's two walks in Tuesday's 8-4
victory at Detroit left him 18 shy of Babe Ruth's record 2,062. ...
SS Alex Rodriguez had an AL-leading 21 road homers (out of 31
total) after his three-run blast Tuesday. Sammy Sosa led the majors
with 25. Rodriguez's .379 road average also topped the AL and
ranked second to Mike Piazza's .399. ... RHP Kazuhiro Sasaki's 29th
save Monday left him two shy of Billy Koch's AL rookie record set
last year. Todd Worrell set the major league record with 36 in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: RHP Brian Moehler (10-7, 4.16 ERA) will seek a
career-best and Tigers season-high fifth straight win Thursday
afternoon when he starts the finale of a three-game series with
Seattle. Moehler is 7-2 at Comerica Park, and his 3.36 home ERA is
the sixth-best in the AL. ... The Tigers topped 2 million in home
attendance Wednesday night. They're on pace to draw 2,592,409 to
Comerica Park, second-best in club history. Only the 1994 World
Series champion Tigers drew more (2,704,794).
Devil Rays-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: The Devil Rays clinched their first winning season
against the Twins with Tuesday's 3-2 win. ... Fred McGriff needs
three more home runs to become the second player to hit 200 home
runs in both leagues. McGriff has 214 National League homers and
197 in the American League. Frank Robinson is the only other player
to do it, although Mark McGwire needs 11 homers for the Cardinals
to accomplish the feat. It would be the fourth major milestone
reached this season for McGriff. He already had his 2,000th hit,
400th home run and played in his 2,000th game.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Although the Twins were impressed with J.C. Romero's
start on Tuesday -- he gave up four hits in 7 1-3 innings in a 3-2
loss to the Devil Rays -- the rookie won't take his next turn in the
rotation. Instead, another rookie, Matt Kinney, will start Sunday
against Detroit. Manager Tom Kelly said Romero isn't being demoted;
the Twins just want to see more of Kinney, as players audition for
roles in 2001. Romero is 2-3 with a 4.33 ERA in five starts. Kinney
is 0-1 with a 2.84 ERA in one start. ... Bill Robertson, the former
Twins vice president in charge of stadium operations and brother of
former owner Calvin Griffith, died Sunday. He was 79.
Royals-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: LHP Chris George was chosen for the United States
Olympics team. George is 2-2 with a 5.82 ERA at Double-A Wichita.
He went 8-5 with a 3.14 ERA at Triple-A Omaha. ... This series
marks the end of a stretch of 25 of 35 games on the road for Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Former Blue Jays catcher Pat Borders was selected to
the United States Olympic baseball team. ... The Blue Jays claimed
RHP Pat Daneker off waivers from the Chicago White Sox. Danekar,
8-11 with a 5.80 ERA at Triple-A Charlotte, will report to Triple-A
Syracuse ... OF Dave Martinez, filling in for the injured Raul
Mondesi, singled in the first, giving him at least one hit in each
of his 14 games with the Blue Jays. Martinez was acquired from
Texas on August 5.
Athletics-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: The A's were upset with Indians reliever Steve Reed,
who hit Oakland rookie Eric Byrnes -- making his big-league debut --
in the seventh inning of Monday night's game. ''You could tell by
his demeanor that he took it upon himself to hit the guy,'' Oakland
manager Art Howe said. ''You do that and we're going to stand up
for our players.'' The A's retaliated in the eighth as reliever
Jeff Tam twice threw behind Indians catcher Sandy Alomar. ''A
message had to be sent,'' said Howe, who noticed a different team
after Byrnes got hit. ''The guys got pumped,'' he said. Reed denied
throwing at Byrnes. The bad blood continued Wednesday night as the
benches emptied after a pair of brushback pitches. ... Jason Giambi
(strained shoulder) didn't start for the fifth straight game and
Howe didn't know if he would be available to pinch-hit. Randy
Velarde (strained neck) missed his sixth game in a row. ... Despite
being 13th in the AL with a .267 team batting average entering
Wednesday's game, the A's were second in walks with 561 walks.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: LHP C.C. Sabathia, the Indians' top pitching
prospect, was selected as a starting pitcher for the U.S. Olympic
team. ''It's a great honor for me and I'm excited about it,'' the
6-foot-7 left-hander said. ''It will be a great experience for me
to go over there and pitch in pressure situations.'' After starting
the year in Class-A, Sabathia is 3-7 with a 3.81 ERA at Double-A
Akron. Indians GM John Hart said the club spent six weeks wavering
on whether to send Sabathia to Australia. The Indians considered
bringing up the 20-year-old for the pennant race before deciding to
let him pitch for the United States. ... RHP Charles Nagy, out
since May after undergoing elbow surgery, pitched a simulated game
on Wednesday and could be back next month. ''I liked the way he
looked,'' manager Charlie Manuel said. ... With GM John Hart's
knack for adding a player by the Aug. 31 deadline, Manuel was asked
what he would like to add to the roster. ''I need McGwire,'' Manuel
joked. ''He's been hurt but I could make a DH out of him.''
Orioles-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Cal Ripken Jr., on the DL since June 28 with a sore
back, made the trip with the team to Chicago to work out. No date
has been set for his return. ... The Orioles moved RHP Jose
Mercedes up to start Thursday's game against the White Sox. Pat
Rapp, who's father died Monday, was pushed back and will start
Friday's game against Tampa Bay. ... In every month from April to
July, the Orioles' team ERA increased, reaching 6.21 last month.
... Before Wednesday night's game against his former team, the
White Sox, C Brook Fordyce had thrown out only 1 of 15 basestealers
for the Orioles. ... Former Sox OF Albert Belle was greeted with
the usual chorus of boos when he came to bat in the first.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: RHP Jon Garland went on the DL Wednesday but is happy
he'll be ready to rejoin the White Sox before the season ends.
Garland was hit with a Fred McGriff line drive just below his right
elbow last Friday. It was still swollen Wednesday but could have
been worse for the rookie. ''I was lucky. If It had gotten me
higher, I probably would be out the rest of the year,'' Garland
said. ... RHP Cal Eldred, on the DL with neuritis in his right
elbow, will throw batting practice Saturday in Seattle. ''It will
give us an opportunity to see where he is,'' manager Jerry Manuel
said. If he's ready, Eldred will probably make two rehab starts
before rejoining a starting rotation that sorely misses him. ...
Veteran Ken Hill will start Thursday's game against the Orioles. He
says his arthritic elbow was not been a major problem before he was
released earlier this month by the Angels, but something that
flares up from time to time. ... James Baldwin, forced to skip one
start because of a tired arm, will start Sunday's game in Seattle.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Phillies-Reds:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: The Phillies turned a double play in the first
inning Wednesday and have had at least one double play in 12 of
their last 13 games. They turned three in the series opener Monday
and a season-high four on Tuesday night in a 5-4 win. Until then,
they'd been tied with the Mets for fewest double plays in the NL.
... Reliever Jeff Brantley said it was special to save Tuesday
night's game against his former team. ''I feel comfortable pitching
in this park,'' he said. ''A lot of good things happened to me in
this park.'' ... Doug Glanville took a nine-game hitting streak
into the game. Bobby Abreu had hit in seven straight.
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: The bat that Alex Ochoa used for his first career
grand slam is headed to the baseball Hall of Fame. Ochoa's slam
Tuesday night was the 142nd in the majors this season, a record.
Ochoa autographed the pine-tar covered Louisville Slugger model
C271 bat before it was sent off. ... Reliever Mark Wohlers had more
tests Wednesday that came back normal, like the others. Wohlers has
been bothered by pain in his lower right side that evidently is the
result of a pulled muscle. He said it felt better Wednesday and he
was available to pitch. ... SS Barry Larkin got the day off. Larkin
has been bothered by a sore left knee, sprained on Aug. 4. He's
9-for-48 since Aug. 2.
Cubs-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The Cubs entered Wednesday's game having allowed 180
home runs. At their current pace they would give up 235. The Cubs
set the club record last year by allowing 221 homers. ... In five
games at Enron Field, former Astro Ricky Gutierrez is 9-for-18 with
three homers and 10 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Rookie SS Julio Lugo has played only 81 games, but he
leads the team with 15 errors, including missing a popup on the
infield during Tuesday night's game that he lost in the ceiling.
''Nobody is used to this stadium, but there have been balls thrown
off the Washington Monument and balls thrown out of airplanes that
people have caught,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ''That was
a catchable ball. I'm not going to cast a lot of blame, it was a
tough catch, but there's a lot of tough catches and major league
players are supposed to make those.''... C Tony Eusebio, who has
the majors' longest active hitting streak (20 games) was not in the
starting lineup Wednesday night. Rookie Mitch Meluskey started
instead of Eusebio.
Braves-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: RHP Greg Maddux was not expected to miss his next start
despite being bothered by a stiff neck Wednesday. He was unsure
what caused the problem, but said he didn't think it was the team's
hotel. ''I bring my own pillow anyway.'' ... Rookie SS Rafael
Furcal ended the six-game road trip 2-for-30. ... Maddux has
allowed seven earned runs in his last five starts for a 1.87 ERA.
He also improved to 4-0 in five career starts at Coors Field. ...
Maddux's 10 victories over the Rockies are the most by an opposing
pitcher against Colorado. ... OF Andruw Jones went 7-for-15 with
two homers and five RBIs in the series.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Manager Buddy Bell did not speak to reporters after
Wednesday's game. A team spokesman said Bell was not feeling well.
The manager had surgery on his right knee earlier in the day but
was in the Rockies dugout for the first pitch. ... Rookie OF Juan
Pierre extended his hitting streak to 16 games. ... OF Jeffrey
Hammonds was scratched from the starting lineup because of a stiff
neck. ... RHP Brian Rose dropped to 1-5 in his last 10 starts.
Pirates-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Tuesday's game was the last in a 19-game stretch in
which the Pirates played 16 times on the road. They entered the
game 6-12 in that span. ... Jason Kendall and Brian Giles scored 27
of the Pirates' last 55 runs. ... With 105 RBIs in 124 games, Giles
was on pace to break the team record of 131 by Paul Waner in 1927.
... 2B Warren Morris hadn't committed an error in 45 games after
committing 11 in his first 64 games. ... Alex Ramirez has two home
runs in his last three pinch-hit at-bats. The Pirates went 41 games
without an RBI from a pinch-hitter from June 30-July 16.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: The Cardinals want Andy Benes, on the disabled list
with a knee injury, to make perhaps three starts in preparation for
the postseason. Benes could pitch sooner, but has had his right
knee drained of fluid six times. They want to minimize his work
down the stretch unless the NL Central race gets close.
Marlins-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: OF Cliff Floyd has been participating in pregame
activities at full speed and is expected to come off the 15-day DL
on Friday when the Marlins return to play host to Cincinnati. He is
showing no signs of the limp he had before July 29 arthroscopic
left-knee surgery for torn cartilage, his second such surgery in 15
months. Floyd won't play every day once he's back, but he should
get the majority of playing time in left field. ''You would never
know,'' Florida manager John Boles said of Floyd. ''He didn't have
a limp. He was running smoothly. He was flying.'' When RHP Dan
Miceli gave up a two-run homer to Barry Bonds and RHP Antonio
Alfonseca allowed a homer to Ellis Burks on Tuesday, the Marlins'
bullpen has allowed 35 earned runs in 22 2-3 innings (13.90 ERA)
over the past 10 games. ... RHP Josh Beckett's chance to be named
to the Olympic team was probably hurt by the fact he's just coming
off the 15-day DL for the Marlins' Single-A affiliate in Kane
County.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: RHP John Johnstone will miss his second rehab
appearance Wednesday night with Single-A San Jose in Modesto
because of a flare up in his back. There's still no timetable for
Johnstone's eventual return to the Giants, though he might be added
to the roster before Aug. 31 -- ready or not -- to be eligible for
postseason play. Johnstone has been on the 15-day DL since July 20.
... The Giants extended their agreements with their minor league
affiliates in San Jose and Salem-Keizer through the 2002 season.
Because of a new ruling that prohibits a team from having two
affiliates in the same league, the Giants will not renew with
Bakersfield and will seek a replacement in either the Midwest
League or South Atlantic League. ... RHP Kurt Ainsworth, a possible
September callup for the Giants, will pitch for the U.S. Olympic
baseball team instead. Ainsworth, who turns 22 on Sept. 9, was
named to the squad on Wednesday. He's 8-9 in 26 starts with a 3.53
ERA at Double-A Shreveport this season. He has 113 strikeouts and
60 walks in 145 innings pitched.
Expos-Dodgers
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos decided Wednesday not to renew the option on
the piece of land where the proposed Labbatt's Stadium was due to
be built. ''It is our feeling that until the ownership situation
gets resolved, and the other stadium-related economic issues get
resolved, it wasn't prudent to re-up the option right now because
we could not present a certain date when we could start
construction,'' executive vice president David Samson said. ''By no
means does this mean that the stadium is not going to be built,''
he added. ... OF Brad Wilkerson, playing for Montreal's Triple-A
Ottawa team, was the only member of the Expos organization selected
Wednesday to play for the U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: LF Gary Sheffield, scheduled to meet with
commissioner Bud Selig next Monday in order to appeal the five-game
suspension he received for the Dodgers' brawl with Wrigley Field
fans on May 16, withdrew the appeal and began serving the
suspension Wednesday night. With a doubleheader at Chicago on
Friday, Sheffield will be eligible on Sunday. ... Former Dodgers
owner Peter O'Malley told the Associated Press on Wednesday that he
has no regrets about selling the team to Fox Corp in 1998, but
declined comment regarding the way the current management is
running a team with a $98 million payroll that's barely over .500.
''I think it would be unfair of me to say,'' O'Malley remarked.
''Unless you sit in the chair of the CEO's office at his desk and
know all the facts, no one can put a finger on it from a distance
and say, 'Well, they should do this,' or 'That's the problem.'
They're going through a tough time and they don't have it together
today, but they will soon.'' ... The Dodgers signed their first
pick in the June draft, 6-foot-7 Arizona RHP Ben Diggins, and
assigned him to Class-A San Bernardino.
Mets-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: LHP Mike Hampton, who missed Tuesday's start because
of a fractured rib, will throw on the side on Friday, and the Mets
will then decide when he'll return. ... C Mike Piazza was back
after sitting out Tuesday's game with a swollen shin, but SS
Edgardo Alfonzo sat out his second straight game, with a stiff
neck.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Padres farmhand Sean Burroughs was named to the
Olympic baseball team. The 19-year-old third baseman, the son of
Jeff Burroughs, the 1974 AL MVP, is the organization's top
prospect. ''I've always dreamed about making the Olympic team and
playing for my country,'' Burroughs said. Burroughs, who plays for
Double-A Mobile, was the MVP at last month's Futures Game, which
was played at Atlanta two days before the All-Star Game. Burroughs
led Long Beach to consecutive Little League World Series titles in
1992-93.
Brewers-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers optioned LHP Rafael Roque to Triple-A
Indianapolis and activated RHP David Weathers, who had been on the
15-day DL with a left strained oblique muscle since Aug. 1. ...
Milwaukee's No. 1 draft pick last year, Ben Sheets, was named to
the U.S. Olympic team. He was 8-8 with a 2.43 ERA this season with
Double-A Huntsville and Triple-A Indianapolis. ... Milwaukee had
won three in a row going into Tuesday night's series finale against
Arizona, matching its longest win streak of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: RHP Todd Stottlemyre, on the DL since June 26 with
tendinitis in his right elbow, made his first rehab appearance for
Arizona's Rookie League team in Tucson. He threw 60 pitches without
pain Wednesday. He has one more appearance scheduled next Monday
and plans to make his return to the Diamondbacks rotation on Sept.
2 or 3. ... Luis Gonzalez's season-high 14-game hitting streak
ended when he went 0-for-4 in the Diamondbacks' 4-3 loss Tuesday
night. ... After Wednesday's game, Arizona heads to New York. The
Diamondbacks are just 1-5 against the Mets this season, 0-3 at Shea
Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Verizon settles 18-day strike with mid-Atlantic phone workers  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Negotiators for Verizon Communications and
more than 35,000 telephone workers reached tentative agreement on a
new contract Wednesday night, ending an 18-day strike in six
mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The company and the last of three bargaining units settled
Wednesday on a three-year contract covering workers in
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West
Virginia and the District of Columbia. The employees will return to
work Thursday, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Union representatives for 50,000 other workers in New York and
New England had already agreed to a package Sunday night. All three
contracts still need to be ratified by unions members.
</P>
<P>
   Company and unions leaders, who negotiated into the night
Wednesday before announcing a resolution, said the agreement
strikes the right balance between protecting the interests of
employees while allowing the company to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ''This settlement secures the future for our members at this
company, and it also helps sharpen Verizon's competitive edge,''
said Communications Workers of America President Morton Bahr. ''In
many ways, it gives our members the ability to do their job even
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Verizon executives said the contract will make it possible to
exceed rather than just meet customer expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement ''gives us the flexibility we need to compete in
the Internet era, satisfying the company's need to manage the
workload while meeting customer demands for outstanding service and
access to the latest technology,'' said Lawrence T. Babbio Jr.,
Verizon vice chairman and president.
</P>
<P>
   With employees back at work, the company can now focus its
resources on serving customers, he said. That will mean tackling
about 63,000 repair requests and 200,000 orders by customers for
new service. The company says it will take about a month to clear
all the orders.
</P>
<P>
   The employees represented by the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers and the CWA went on strike Aug. 6, after their
contracts expired with Verizon, the new name for the combined Bell
Atlantic and GTE telephone companies. More than 25 million phone
users in the East were affected by the walkout.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the CWA unit from the mid-Atlantic region and
Verizon have been entangled the past few days over local issues and
concerns about mandatory overtime. Currently, workers can be
ordered to put in 10 to 15 hours of overtime a week.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tentative agreement, customer service representatives
could not be required to work more than 7.5 hours of overtime
weekly. Technicians and operators in the region would have an
eight-hour-per-week cap on mandatory overtime, beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon officials said the offer was substantively the same as
one that was on the table days ago, with the cost of the total
package for all union employees unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ''This agreement is affordable and prudent and will not affect
Verizon's financial targets,'' Babbio said.
</P>
<P>
   All three tentative agreements include a 12 percent increase in
wages over the life of the three-year contracts, options for all
employees for purchasing 100 shares of Verizon stock and a 0.7
percent limit on the number of jobs in any region that can be moved
to another area in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Unions had feared that Verizon would shift work to areas of
cheaper labor within its newly expanded territory.
</P>
<P>
   Through the negotiations, the unions also won an agreement to
let them try organizing workers in the company's largely
nonunionized wireless division using sign-up cards rather than
holding a representation election. The unions must get signed cards
from 55 percent of wireless workers in a specific group to
represent them. That agreement takes affect in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Workers who had settled over the weekend returned to work
Monday. Some in New York stayed off the job Wednesday, honoring
picket lines set up by striking workers from the mid-Atlantic
region.

<HEADLINE> Cheers Back Home as Hatch Wins  </HEADLINE>
By RACHEL ZOLL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, R.I. (AP) -- At the Sportsticket bar in Richard
Hatch's home town, his sister, Sue, leapt out of her chair when he
became a millionaire on ''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Good for him,'' she said, watching the show with about 30
people. ''He played the game well and he deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch had schemed and conspired his way to the final episode.
When his maneuvering paid off Wednesday, his friends back home were
cheering.
</P>
<P>
   At the Newport Athletic Club, where Hatch trained before going
on the show and still works out, a crowd of about 40 people
watching the show's final episode erupted in cheers.
</P>
<P>
   The club was decorated with balloon parrots and torches with the
names of the final four contestants on them. The bartender snuffed
out the torches one by one as the finalists were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Smyth, Hatch's personal trainer, said he never had an
inkling who the winner was. Then he thought back to a moment before
Hatch left for the island.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looked me dead in the eye and said, 'I'm going to win this
competition, and I said I know,''' Smyth said. ''It was strange,
but he said it with the most confidence I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Smyth said the Machiavellian Hatch seen by millions on TV is not
the man he knows.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a side of Rich I've never seen before,'' Smyth said.
''In real life Rich is a warm, fun guy to be around. He's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, 39, is the corporate trainer who became the contestant
everyone loved to hate. In his professional life, he specializes in
team building and conflict resolution; on the remote tropical
island off Borneo, he used lies and subversion to form an alliance
that helped him win.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Survivor'' contestant whom David Letterman dubbed ''the
naked fat guy'' was in Los Angeles with his fellow castaways when
the TV show's secret was bared.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Hatch had sat quietly through most of the show, agonizing
over her brother's fate. During the final minutes, she held her
face in her hands, giving a ''thumbs up'' sign when a vote for
Richard was read.
</P>
<P>
   She said the disparaging comments some of the other players made
about her brother didn't really bother her.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was just the persona he played, and it was all part of
the game,'' Hatch said. ''I just laughed, I didn't take it
personally, and I'm sure my brother didn't either.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Brett, a clinical psychologist who works with Hatch's mother
at Newport Hospital, defended the way Hatch played the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're playing a game without rules, ethics are a
difficult thing to define, therefore anything goes,'' Brett said.
''It's probably deemed unethical because Rich was so overt. If he
was less overt he would have won with more votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch began reaping the spoils of fame weeks before his win was
made public. He will spend next week as the host of a morning talk
show on a local radio station and he's currently featured with the
final four in a ''Got Milk?'' mustache ad. He's been hounded by
autograph seekers and, openly gay, has been inundated with marriage
proposals from men and women.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Islander experienced the flip side of celebrity when
the national media reported he was charged with second-degree child
abuse in April, days after he returned home from the island.
</P>
<P>
   His then 9-year-old son told police Hatch pulled him by the ear
and wrapped his hands around his neck when the youngster tired on a
run. The criminal case is pending. Hatch is suing police and state
child welfare officials for false imprisonment and defamation and
is seeking more than $1 million in damages.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Meets Congolese President  </HEADLINE>
By ARNAUD ZAJTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- A special U.N. envoy said Wednesday he
had reached agreements with Congo's President Laurent Kabila that
would soon allow U.N. peacekeepers to deploy in the war-battered
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, Nigeria's former military ruler who
gave way to democratic elections last year, refused to say exactly
what had been agreed on after a one-hour meeting with Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are much (more) ahead than where we were yesterday,''
Abubakar said. ''We made some agreement ... Very soon we will be
able to deploy.'' The two leaders had already met for two hours on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar was dispatched to Congo by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan after Annan announced a re-evaluation of plans to send a
5,537-member U.N. force to Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Annan cited the crumbling of a cease-fire deal reached last year
in the Central African nation, as well as a propaganda campaign
against U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration has grown at the United Nations over the continuing
fighting. More than two years of war has involved neighboring
countries and threatened to destabilize the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has laid the blame squarely on Kabila's
government. So has the secretary-general, though without naming him
directly.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Kabila, Abubakar left for Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia to discuss the situation with Organization of African
Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Wednesday to extend
the U.N. military observer mission in Congo by 45 days until Oct.
15 to allow time for diplomatic efforts to get the Congolese
government to honor the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting in Congo started in 1998 when rebel forces backed by
Rwanda and Uganda tried to oust Kabila, who had support from
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Under last year's peace agreement, observers were to be
stationed in Congo to supervise a cease-fire and the withdrawal of
foreign forces.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only 264 U.N. military observers and about 15
international staff have been deployed because the violence has
continued, and Congo has failed to ensure the safety of
peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE> Paraguay's President To Accept Vote  </HEADLINE>
By PEDRO SERVIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Paraguay's president said Wednesday he
would abide by election results that showed an opposition vice
presidential candidate was likely to deal the ruling Colorado Party
its first defeat in 53 years.
</P>
<P>
   President Luis Gonzalez Macchi appeared ready to face the
possibility he would govern alongside an opposition leader in an
unprecedented power-sharing arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to respect the decision by the Electoral Board,''
the president said, speaking to reporters at the government palace.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his comments meant that Liberal Party candidate Julio
Cesar Franco was likely to win, he said: ''Yes, and I hope to meet
with him very soon to get his position on how to get out of this
difficult economic situation.'' Paraguay is mired in a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguay's electoral board was to announce final results as
early as Thursday in the election to replace Luis Argana, who was
shot to death in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   With 90 percent of the vote counted, Franco led with 47.77
percent, ahead of Felix Argana, the son of the slain vice
president, with 46.93 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, electoral officials suspended the release of
official results. While the delay raised suspicions about possible
tampering, observers from the Organization of American States said
the election was one of the most open in recent memory in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Should Franco win, it would be the first major defeat for the
Colorado Party, which has governed Paraguay since 1947. An
opposition victory would install a popularly elected vice president
alongside a president not chosen by the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly Senate president, Gonzalez Macchi assumed office
following a political crisis brought on by Argana's assassination,
which forced former President Raul Cubas to resign from office.
</P>
<P>
   Cubas and former army chief Lino Oviedo were accused of
masterminding the Argana slaying. Both men sought political asylum
abroad after Gonzalez Macchi assumed the presidency.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Debby Heads to Fla.  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNAH E. NESMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUERTO PLATA, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Emergency workers
evacuated dozens of people from riverside shacks in the Dominican
Republic Wednesday and powerful winds tore roofs off shanties in
Haiti as Tropical Storm Debby skirted the island of Hispaniola.
</P>
<P>
   Debby was downgraded from a hurricane when it lost force
Wednesday and was further disrupted by the mountains of Hispaniola,
which is shared by the two countries. It continued to slowly lose
strength, with winds falling to 45 mph shortly before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   It was expected to cross eastern Cuba, where the government
began evacuating people.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good news for the people of southeast Florida and the
Bahamas,'' said forecaster Michelle Huber of the U.S. National
Hurricane Center.
</P>
<P>
   She said the chance had lessened of Debby reforming as a
dangerous hurricane with over 100 mph winds, as predicted Tuesday,
though it is expected to regain some strength as it approaches the
Florida Straits, probably Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Florida Keys on Wednesday ordered visitors to
evacuate and shut down all schools.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain and gusty winds battered northern Haiti, ripping
ripped tin roofs from shanties and flooding some homes in northwest
Port-de-Paix, police reported.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks with megaphones patrolled the streets of Cap Haitien,
Haiti's second-largest city, broadcasting storm warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're especially afraid of heavy rain washing down from the
mountains. The rivers might overflow their banks. We don't have any
canals, and flooding will cause a lot of damage,'' journalist Smith
Joseph said by telephone from Port-de-Paix.
</P>
<P>
   He said high winds sank a boat in the harbor at the nearby
coastal village of Carenage.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bahamas, soldiers deployed on several southern islands
Tuesday and more were sent to other islands Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Debby was centered off the northwest
tip of Haiti over the Windward Passage. It was moving west near 16
mph, headed for Cuba.

<P>
   Winds had fallen to 45 mph extending 115 miles from a poorly
defined center. But forecasters warned that even in its weakened
state the storm could produce dangerous battering waves and up to
15 inches of rain that could cause life-threatening flashfloods and
mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's government moved 3,000 people from Maisi, the island's
easternmost town, including Haitians at a refugee camp. Officials
said they planned to evacuate thousands more, including about 700
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. National Hurricane Center forecaster Krissy Williams said
Debby might spend as much as 48 hours crossing Cuba. Cuban
officials said they feared flooding and high waves could force
evacuations of 83,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't rule out the possibility that the center (of the
storm) could touch land in our country,'' said Jose Rubiera of the
country's Meteorological Institute, even as tourists in Havana
continued to enjoy sunny weather with light breezes.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn Wednesday, the Dominican Civil Defense woke up
people living alongside rivers in Puerto Plata resort town, fearing
they would overflow their banks, and sent them to relatives or
shelters. Deputy director Ojilbiz Mercado said 250 people were
evacuated from the town.
</P>
<P>
   But Debby's strongest winds faced out to sea and it was hard to
tell it was so close, with the sun peeking occasionally through
drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   In the resort village Cabarete, 27-year-old Sandrine Kowalik of
Paris said the hurricane was making her vacation ''more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something that we're not used to in France,'' she said as
she walked along a calm beach. ''It's a very small one, right?''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, emergency officials urged southern residents to pay
close attention to weather reports. South Floridians stuffed
shopping carts with bottled water, canned food, milk, batteries and
other emergency supplies -- just in case.	   As a relatively minor hurricane,
Debby brought some rain and
little apparent damage Tuesday to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands and a number of small islands such as Antigua and Anguilla.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a 78-year-old man died in a San Juan, Puerto Rico
suburb when he slipped from his roof while trying to dismantle an
antenna before the storm.

<HEADLINE> Rich Hatch Wins 'Survivor' Contest  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The tribe spoke one last time.
</P>
<P>
   It said: Rich.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hatch, the ruthless strategist on CBS' ''Survivor,''
proved his mettle Wednesday night by wangling the million-dollar
prize.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-hour finale, Hatch edged out three rival
castaways on the tropical island that served as the setting for the
game-show hit that became a pop-culture phenomenon. Outlasting
Susan Hawk, Rudy Boesch and Kelly Wiglesworth, Hatch became the
sole survivor from the 16 who marooned themselves on remote Pulau
Tiga at the series' launch in May.
</P>
<P>
   The final choice -- between Hatch and Wiglesworth -- was handed
down by a jury of seven former tribe-mates. Their vote was a
squeaker: 4 to 3.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't change anything that I did,'' Rich told the jury in
a final statement.
</P>
<P>
   Then, waiting for the ballots to be tallied, he admitted, ''I
can't breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' host Jeff Probst called out his name. There was a
sprinkling of applause from the group and Rich looked stunned.
</P>
<P>
   At the Newport Athletic Club in Hatch's hometown, Middletown,
R.I., where he trained before going to the island and still works
out, the crowd of about 40 who had gathered to watch the final show
erupted in cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Smyth, Hatch's personal trainer, thought back to a moment
before Hatch left for the island.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looked me dead in the eye and said, 'I'm going to win this
competition,' and I said 'I know,''' Smyth recalled. ''It was
strange, but he said it with the most confidence I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Smyth said the Machiavellian Hatch seen by millions on TV is not
the man he knows.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a side of Rich I've never seen before,'' he insisted.
''In real life Rich is a warm, fun guy to be around. He's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Hatch concocted an alliance that helped carry him to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   With the castaways originally divided into two tribes, one of
them, ''Pagong,'' faced a tactical buzzsaw from the other,
''Tagi.'' The final four contenders all were part of that ''Tagi''
alliance, which was left to consume itself.
</P>
<P>
   Rich emerged from the rubble with $1 million in cash and a new
car. (As runner-up, Kelly wins $100,000.)
</P>
<P>
   But when Hatch got back home he faced an unforeseen challenge.
Just days after returning from the island last April, he was
charged with second-degree child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   His then 9-year-old son told police Hatch pulled him by the ear
and wrapped his hands around his neck when the youngster tired on a
run. The criminal case is pending. Hatch is suing police and state
child welfare officials for false imprisonment and defamation and
is seeking more than $1 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   When ''Survivor'' premiered three months ago, critics called it
''Gilligan's Island'' meets ''Lord of the Flies.''
</P>
<P>
   But the TV show more directly comparable was ''Dallas.'' Since
that drama's ''Who Shot J.R.?'' stunt in 1980, nothing on
television had gripped the nation in quite the same way -- until
''Survivor.'' An audience that experts said might reach 40 million
viewers awaited the final resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Fans threw ''Survivor'' viewing parties, complete with tropical
costumes and the ever-present threat of getting voted out of the
bash.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour into the show, Susan, the trucker from Palmyra,
Wis., was sacked in a tribal vote.
</P>
<P>
   River guide Kelly had won immunity from that vote after
correctly answering the most questions about former castaways. She
also won a second immunity challenge by standing the longest with
one hand touching the immunity idol. Her rival in that contest,
Rudy, dropped out after 4 hours, 11 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the second tribal council, Kelly was placed in the odd
position of single-handedly deciding the fates of Richard and Rudy.
She voted against Rudy, the retired Navy SEAL from Virginia Beach,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought I'd come this far,'' said Rudy, many
oddsmakers' favorite to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' buzz, predictions and, most of all, hype reached
epic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping on the reality-TV bandwagon, CBS launched the 13-week
''Survivor'' on May 31 to breathe life into a prime-time schedule
largely filled with reruns. The show had been taped during 39 days
last spring.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night, the 16 volunteers were seen arriving on the
tiny tropical isle. By the end of the hour -- actually three days
later -- the first among them was voted off the island during a
solemn tribal council.
</P>
<P>
   All summer, CBS beat the ''Survivor'' drum, from morning (on its
''Early Show,'' where weekly castoffs were showcased) to night (on
Wednesday, ''Late Show'' host David Letterman welcomed the
castaways to recite the Top 10 list -- ''Things I Learned on the
'Survivor' Island'').
</P>
<P>
   Letterman had made fun of Hatch, who liked to roam the island in
the buff, as ''the naked fat guy.'' Hatch, who appeared trim and
clean-shaven on a live broadcast after the show Wednesday, said he
had lost 34 pounds on the island and 100 pounds before he got
there.
</P>
<P>
   Openly gay, Hatch has said he has received marriage proposals
from men and women.
</P>
<P>
   The first ''Survivor'' episode drew a healthy 15.5 million
viewers, but by mid-August, that number had nearly doubled.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the audience hooked, CBS imposed an information
clampdown, even as the castaways resumed their normal lives -- and
the winner quietly envisioned life with a million-dollar jackpot.
Everyone associated with the show signed a nondisclosure agreement
with stiff cash penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the best efforts of computer hackers, voice analysts and
other sleuths, the secret held.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Debby skirts Dominican Republic, menaces Bahamas, Florida </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNAH E. NESMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUERTO PLATA, Dominican Republic (AP) - Emergency workers
evacuated dozens of people from riverside shacks in the Dominican
Republic Wednesday and powerful winds tore roofs off shanties in
Haiti as Tropical Storm Debby skirted the island of Hispaniola.
</P>
<P>
   Debby was downgraded from a hurricane when it lost force
Wednesday and was further disrupted by the mountains of Hispaniola,
which is shared by the two countries. It continued to slowly lose
strength, with winds falling to 45 mph shortly before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   It was expected to cross eastern Cuba, where the government
began evacuating people.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's good news for the people of southeast Florida and the
Bahamas,'' said forecaster Michelle Huber of the U.S. National
Hurricane Center.
</P>
<P>
   She said the chance had lessened of Debby reforming as a
dangerous hurricane with over 100 mph winds, as predicted Tuesday,
though it is expected to regain some strength as it approaches the
Florida Straits, probably Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the Florida Keys on Wednesday ordered visitors to
evacuate and shut down all schools.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain and gusty winds battered northern Haiti, ripping
ripped tin roofs from shanties and flooding some homes in northwest
Port-de-Paix, police reported.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks with megaphones patrolled the streets of Cap Haitien,
Haiti's second-largest city, broadcasting storm warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're especially afraid of heavy rain washing down from the
mountains. The rivers might overflow their banks. We don't have any
canals, and flooding will cause a lot of damage,'' journalist Smith
Joseph said by telephone from Port-de-Paix.
</P>
<P>
   He said high winds sank a boat in the harbor at the nearby
coastal village of Carenage.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bahamas, soldiers deployed on several southern islands
Tuesday and more were sent to other islands Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Debby was centered off the northwest
tip of Haiti over the Windward Passage. It was moving west near 16
mph, headed for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Winds had fallen to 45 mph extending 115 miles from a poorly
defined center. But forecasters warned that even in its weakened
state the storm could produce dangerous battering waves and up to
15 inches of rain that could cause life-threatening flashfloods and
mudslides.

<HEADLINE> Mom Arrested After Leaving Children  </HEADLINE>
By SONJA BARISIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) -- A young mother charged with
abandoning her three children in a library said she was stressed
out and had tried desperately to get help caring for them.
</P>
<P>
   Roszina Mack was charged Wednesday with felony child neglect.
Police spokesman Mike Carey said Mack told police she wanted a
break from her children and thought the library was a safe place to
leave them.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview from jail, Mack said she isn't a bad
mother and had tried to place the children in foster care but
didn't get any help despite numerous calls to several agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know what to do,'' she told WVEC television. ''I was
confused. I was stressed out. I just turned 20 years old. I can
only take so much.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she wants eventually to be reunited with her children
and hopes for a reconciliation with their father. ''I learned my
lesson,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The children -- 2&AMP;frac12;-year-old twin girls, Breanna and Teanna
Trabal, and an 8-month-old boy, Yabriele Trabal -- were placed in
foster care.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kids appear to be well taken care of,'' said Dennis Brown,
the detective who is leading the investigation. ''There's no sign
of trauma or abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack's nephew, Andre Carter, said the family was shocked to
discover that the children had been found alone in the library.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know she was having a difficult time,'' Carter said. He
added that family members believed the abandonment was not
something she planned, but ''just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Police believe Mack, who moved to the area about two weeks ago,
is unmarried and was living with her brother and sister-in-law near
the Virginia Beach Central Library. The children were left at the
library on Monday afternoon, Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   A large, yellow sign designates the building as a ''safe place''
where children who think they are in danger can go for help, Carey
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how long the children were alone before a patron
found them in the adult nonfiction section and notified the staff,
librarian Pat Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   The girls had juice bottles and were running around, while the
boy was in a stroller and had a milk bottle and a pacifier, Cook
said. There were no notes or identification tags on their clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were very sweet, very friendly babies -- pretty
well-behaved, considering,'' Cook said. She added they were clean
except that ''the little guy needed his diaper changed in a big
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack was found in nearby Hampton on Tuesday night, after the
media aired reports asking for help in identifying the children or
their guardians.
</P>
<P>
   Mack appeared in Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court on
Wednesday, and Judge J. Davis Reed set a bond hearing for Thursday
morning. Mack was being held without bond in the city jail pending
the bond hearing on three counts of felony child neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Reed also set an Aug. 28 custody hearing for the children, who
were placed with a foster family and are in the custody of the
Virginia Department of Social Services.
</P>
<P>
   Mack's brother, Kenny Carter, told reporters the family wants
Mack or her relatives to retain custody of the children. ''The
children will be taken care of,'' he said outside the courtroom.
