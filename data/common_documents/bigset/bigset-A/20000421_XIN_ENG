<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Mini-Summit Opens in Accra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings
warned on Thursday that unless the West Africa get further
integrated, the region will "remain weak, fragmented,
incompetitive and marginalized''.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at the opening of a mini-summit of the six out
of the 16 nations of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) in the Ghanaian capital Accra, Ghana News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Advancement of sub-regional integration through establishment
of a second monetary zone is the main focus of the meeting
attended by six presidents from Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Liberia,
the Gambia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Mali president, who is the current ECOWS president, also
attended the summit as an observer.
</P>
<P>
According to a resolution of the ECOWAS summit at the end of
last year, the six countries had resolved to form the second
monetary zone by 2003 as a step toward merging with the CFA (West
African Franc) countries to forge a single monetary area covering
the whole West Africa with a population of some 250 million.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings said the establishment of a second monetary
zone would mean the sub-region would be dealing with only two
currencies as opposed to the nine currently being used. This
would speed up the establishment of an ECOWAS Monetary Union with
a single currency by the year 2004, he added.
</P>
<P>
And to achieve the target date, a two-stage approach towards
the attainment of the convergence criteria which constitute the
bedrock of establishing the single currency has been adopted. The
primary convergence targets that have been agreed upon include:
</P>
<P>
Single digit inflation by 2004, gross foreign reserves to cover
at least three months of imports by 2000, increasing to six months
of imports by 2003 and budget deficit to be limited to 10 percent
of previous year's tax revenue by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings, however, said these efforts would come to
naught if issues of security and crime, especially economic, white
collar, electronic crime and money laundering are not tackled
seriously.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he suggested the establishment of an ECOWAS Criminal
 Intelligence Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He said ECOWAS hopes that by its 25th anniversary in May, it
would have made some strides and these include the opening of an
ECOWAS Court of Justice, ECOWAS Parliament and an organ to prevent
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Lansana Kouyate, Executive Secretary of ECOWAS, said
establishing a single currency for the sub-region would be
difficult. "It cannot be accomplished without difficulties but we
have to get rid of them one after the other with determination.''

<HEADLINE> Iran Inaugurates Tank Carrier Production Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran inaugurated a production line
of the extra heavy tank carrier "Tiger 400" recently to mark the
Week of the Army.
</P>
<P>
The nominal capacity of the production line is 100 tank carriers
annually, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The tank carriers are among the strategically important
equipment needed by the army while countries which produce this
equipment are reluctant to sell these vehicles to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The high technology employed in manufacturing these carriers
remarkably increase the combatant force of the military units, said
commander of the maintaining units of the army, who was only named
as Brigadier Saberi.
</P>
<P>
Saberi said the tank carriers have been designed on the basis of
the experience gained during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
He further noted that the production of these carriers is a step
toward self-dependency and that 350,000 U.S. dollars can be saved
for every such carrier constructed and a total of 200 million
dollars will be saved in a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian army has set up the production lines of Zolfaqar 1
and Zolfaqar 2 tanks, and Kobra carrier.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects U.S. Concern over Warning to Iranian Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi on Friday turned down the concern of the United
States over a warning to the Iranian freedom-seeking press.
</P>
<P>
Asefi termed the remarks by the U.S. State Department Spokesman
James Rubin on Thursday as "a flagrant interference in Iran's
internal affairs," the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the Iranian press has played an important part in
political developments and the U.S. are worried whenever free press
is challenged anywhere in the world or any statements are made that
question the fundamental right of free expression.
</P>
<P>
Rubin made the remarks after Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei made a warning on the same day that the Iranian press
should respect the constitution and Islamic values instead of
becoming tools of the enemy.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said he is suffering from some phenomena that a number
of the papers have turned into bases of the enemies and are doing
the same as the British, the U.S. and the Israeli broadcasting
agencies are trying to do.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that based on the Islamic teachings and the Iranian
constitution, the country attaches great importance to the freedom
of speech as well as the press.
</P>
<P>
"Safeguarding and strengthening the rights of the noble Iranian
nation including the freedom of speech is one of the most
fundamental policies of the Iranian government and will not be
influenced by others' comments," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian pro-reform press came under mounting pressure of the
powerful conservatives, who dominate most of the sensitive organs
but suffered a series of serious setbacks in elections in past two
years.
</P>
<P>
The conservative judiciary has summoned a number of reformist
journalists and publishers to courts on charges of defamation or
propagating against Islamic values, even sending some of them to
prison.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing conservative parliament on Tuesday passed an
amendment to the press law imposing more restrictions on the press,
which was believed to have played an important role in the
overwhelming victory of the reformists, main supporters of
President Mohammad Khatami in the February parliamentary elections.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges Respect of Every Nation's Right in Handling Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin on Friday urged for consultations in handling world affairs
and called for respect of the basic right of every nation in
dealing with its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said this when criticizing the NATO war in Yugoslavia's
Kosovo province last year at a banquet hosted by Greek President
Costis Stephanopoulos.
</P>
<P>
"A warning sent by the war is: international affairs should be
handled through consultations among nations, and the basic right
of every nation in dealing with its own internal affairs should be
respected," he said.
</P>
<P>
The war, launched a year ago by the NATO under the pretext of "
humanitarian intervention" by bypassing the U.N. Security Council,
has brought great sufferings to all the ethnic groups in Kosovo,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he added, the war, instead of settling the Kosovo
issue, has resulted in new humanitarian catastrophes and worsened
tensions in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
"Regional conflicts should be resolved through peaceful
consultations between related parties of the region," Jiang
stressed. But, he noted, "hegemonism and power politics frequently
use force to imperil regional peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the new millennium, he said, "We are gratified
to see the easing of the international situation as a whole, but
are also deeply concerned over the serious challenges facing world
peace and development."
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are the two key issues of the present
world, he noted, adding that only when the five principles of
peaceful coexistence, the purpose of the U.N. Charter and the
basic norms of other universally recognized international law are
strictly abided by, will peace be safeguarded actually and the
common development be realized.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government and people are willing to work with the
peoples of other countries to bring a peaceful and just as well as
prosperous and stable world in the 21st century, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived here Friday from Turkey for a four-day
state visit, also hailed the quick development in China and Greece,
and wanted to promote bilateral cooperation in various sectors.
</P>
<P>
In the 28 years after the establishment of diplomatic
relations between China and Greece, Jiang said, "We have respected
each other, treated each other on an equal footing, cooperated for
mutual benefit and achieved common development, thus writing a
glorious chapter in Chinese-Greek friendship."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government attaches importance to developing long-
term stable and friendly relations with Greece, and is willing to
work together with the Greek side to further expand and deepen
cooperation in political, economic and cultural fields, he
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Amato Named as Italian Premier-designate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian Treasury Minister and former
premier Giuliano Amato was asked by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi
this evening to try and form a new center-left government, in the
wake of the resignation this week of Massimo D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi gave Amato, 61, a preliminary mandate to form a new
administration to take the center-left through to the end of its
legislature, in April 2001.
</P>
<P>
Amato accepted the mandate "with reserve", meaning that he will
now have to consult with the leaders in the center-left coalition
and verify whether he can secure the parliamentary majority needed
to govern.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Premier D'Alema quit his job on Wednesday after the
center-left suffered a humiliating defeat in Sunday's regional
elections, emerging with seven regions to the center- right's
eight and polling about 45 percent of the vote against the
opposition's 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
If Amato can muster up enough support in parliament, he will
become the head of Italy's 58th post-war government.
</P>
<P>
If Amato does pass a confidence vote in both houses (the
Senate is a sure thing) he has made it plain that he wants to lead
the alliance not only through next month's electoral reform
referendum but into the next elections.
</P>
<P>
The referendum, if won, would require parliament to remove the
present 25 present of the Lower House elected proportionally,
thereby strengthening the two- party system and helping to end the
chronic instability of governments here, which are exceptionally
vulnerable to blackmailing tactics by small parties.

<HEADLINE> Russian Security Council Passes New Military Doctrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) --The Russian Security Council, the
top national security agency, approved the final text of Russia's
new military doctrine and Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin
signed it on Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a council meeting in the Kremlin, Security Council secretary
Sergei Ivanov stressed that the draft doctrine had been agreed
with all the necessary agencies and officials.
</P>
<P>
"Fundamental changes to it were not required" after the draft
was debated in February, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that changes were made only to the document's wording
to make it complete from the legal point of view.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov quoted experts as saying that the doctrine is defensive
and its main purposes are deterrence and the preservation of peace.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it firmly advocates Russia's interests in the
military sphere, he said, "the text of the military doctrine meets
Russia's national interests."
</P>
<P>
Colonel General Leonid Ivashov, chief of the Russian Defense
Ministry's Main Board for International Military Cooperation, said
after the meeting that under the new doctrine threshold of nuclear
weapon use by Russia is extremely low.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia's new military doctrine clearly determines that
the country's internal political security is provided for by
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he admitted that "undoubtedly, some
provisions of the military doctrine are to a certain extent a
response to U.S. and NATO attempts to act from a position of
strength, to build a unipolar world and to expand the geography of
the North Atlantic Alliance."
</P>
<P>
However, "Russian nuclear weapons can be used only against an
aggressor using weapons of mass destruction against Russia or in a
critical situation in the event of a large-scale aggression
against Russia," the general said.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the military doctrine and the concept of
national security, as well as the ratification of START II and the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty by the parliament, implies
that Russia is more actively searching for ways of achieving
national security and global strategic stability, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Visit a Milestone: Greek President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos described Chinese President Jiang Zemin's current
Greece visit as an "important milestone" in the development of the
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The people of the two countries are full of confident in the
further development of the bilateral relations in the 21st century,
he said at a banquet he hosted in Jiang's honor.
</P>
<P>
Extending his warm welcome to Jiang, Stephanopoulos expressed
his appreciation for China's progress in the construction of China
and its important role in the international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the bilateral relations have enjoyed
stable progress since the diplomatic ties were forged in 1972,
there is still great potential to tap in the economic cooperation
and trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The sound political relations have laid solid foundation for
the economic cooperation between the two countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Greece's upcoming admission to European Economic and Monetary
Union will create more favorable conditions for the Greece-China
cooperation, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Greece hopes that the relations between the European Union and
China will keep on improving and advancing, he said, adding his
country hopes that China will enter into the World Trade
Organization at an earlier date.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of China's One China, Two Systems principle,
and reiterated that Greece will adhere to the one China policy and
hopes that the Taiwan problem will be resolved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here earlier the day for a state visit at the
invitation of Stephanopoulos. This is first visit to Greece by a
Chinese head of state, and also the fourth leg of Jiang's five-
nation tour of Asia, Europe and Africa, which has brought him to
Israel, Palestine and Turkey, and will take him to South Africa.
Furthermore, President Jiang also meet with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in Alexandria City of Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Russia Appoints New Commander of Federal Forces in North Caucasus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Kremlin on Friday appointed
General Gennady Troshev as the commander of the Russian Combined
Forces in the North Caucasus, Russian presidential aide Sergei
Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Shamanov, who was earlier the commander of the
Southern Federal Grouping in Chechnya, is now again the head of
the 58th army, according to Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin aide said "nothing new has happened concerning the
operational situation in Chechnya over the past twenty-four hours.
"
</P>
<P>
The federal forces have almost completed regrouping in the
southeastern part of the province, where "a special operation is
being conducted to mop up mountainous areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky stated that "because of the gradual opening of
mountainous passes, the chances are increasing that the guerrillas
' ranks might be replenished from neighboring countries and
republics." This may be one of the reasons for Shamanov's new
appointment.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Keeps Deadline for Voluntary Repatriation of Kosovo Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The federal government and
cantonal authorities of Switzerland have agreed to keep the May 31
deadline for the voluntary repatriation of refugees from Kosovo,
who arrived before June 1999.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland is due to start forcibly returning refugees after
the deadline passes, according to Swiss Radio International Friday.
Around 30,000 Kosovar refugees are affected by the deadline to
leave Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The decision follows an agreement sealed earlier this month by
Swiss Justice Minister Ruth Metzler with the United Nations in
Kosovo(UNMIK). The accord is aimed at easing technical
difficulties, such as the question of identity papers of refugees
who are forcibly repatriated.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 19,000 Kosovars accepted financial incentives to return
home by the end of last year. Of the more than 4,000 refugees who
signed up for a second phase of the voluntary program, around 1,
600 have so far gone back.
</P>
<P>
The federal government and the cantons expressed hoped that as
many refugees as possible would take up the offer of repatriation
aid before the June deadline.
</P>
<P>
However, the cantons unanimously backed measures allowing for
delays in special cases. Other issues linked to the repatriation
program will be tackled in a national asylum conference on May 4.

The CNM will appoint a three-councilmen commission to evaluate
the alleged anomalies attributed to Portillo, it was reported.
</P>
<P>
The condemnation was presented by the opposition American
People's Revolutionary Alliance (APRA), which demanded the
dismissal of the ONPE official.
</P>
<P>
The CNM must declare the denunciation justified because
Portillo "showed incompetence" to fulfill his duties in the recent
elections, which was proved by the difference between the number
of ballots cast and the number of electors, said APRA
representative Angel Romero Diaz.
</P>
<P>
Romero added that "there is an additional number of 1.3 million
votes against the number of ballots emitted."
</P>
<P>
The results of the first round of voting held two weeks ago put
candidate-president Alberto Fujimori ahead with 49.84 percent of
the suffrages, while Alejandro Toledo had 40.31 percent of the
votes cast.
</P>
<P>
The CNM has 60 days to resolve about the denunciation, although
it has the power to dismiss Portillo "for serious misdemeanors
that affect the dignity of the office."

A second round of voting will be held by the end of May or at
the beginning of June to choose a new president between Fujimori

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Flood Emergency Assistance to Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has approved a
credit of 30 million U.S. dollars in response to the Mozambican
government's request for emergency assistance following floods in
the African country, the bank announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The flood emergency recovery project will help Mozambique
maintain macroeconomic stability through the financing of imports
necessary to rebuild social and economic infrastructure, and by
reestablishing production levels, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed project will be quick-disbursing and performance
will be measured by how well Mozambique maintains macroeconomic
stability in the year 2000 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be provided by the International Development
Association (IDA), the World Bank's lending arm for the poorest
countries, and on standard IDA terms of 40 years maturity,
including 10 years grace.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rains, which started in early February, continue to
disrupt several southern provinces of Mozambique, and have killed
640 persons, according to the World Bank. About 2 million people
are experiencing severe economic difficulties, including 491,000
people who are either displaced or trapped in flood-isolated areas.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Researchers Discover New Treatment for Sleeping Sickness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Swiss researchers have discovered
that a cheaper and shorter drug treatment for sleeping sickness is
just as effective as the standard longer regimen, according to
Swiss Radio International Friday.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the team from the Swiss Tropical Institute in
Basel have been published in the prestigious British medical
journal, The Lancet. The researchers, headed by Dr Christian Burri,
gave 125 patients in Angola 10 daily injections of the drug,
Melarsopol, instead of a 26-day course.
</P>
<P>
They found that the shorter course of treatment was just as
effective, had a similar number of side effects and a lower
patient drop-out rate. Burri's team said the new regimen had the
potential to become widely used.
</P>
<P>
"The significantly reduced duration of treatment and
hospitalization, and the 30 percent saving offer considerable
economic and practical advantages, especially for regions with
limited resources and high prevalence of the disease," they
reported in The Lancet.
</P>
<P>
Sleeping Sickness, or African Trypanosomiasis, is transmitted
to humans from the bite of the tsetse fly. It is fatal if
untreated. It causes influenza-like symptoms, inflammation of the
brain, behavioral changes and coma.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 300,000 people have the disease and about 60
million are at risk.

Gidada Friday called on Saudi Arabia to back up his country's
effort to effectively utilize water resources for agriculture
development.

PARIS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- France's Renault automobile
corporation confirmed on Friday that it has reached an agreement
with South Korea's Samsung Motors on resuming and financing the
latter's auto production.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Renault said that his company and its creditors
will sign an agreement on financing the project next Monday in

<HEADLINE> Italian New Premier Giuliano Amato </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian Treasury Minister Giuliano
Amato on Friday evening was named Italy's premier-designate, to
replace outgoing leader Massimo D'Alema, who resigned on Wednesday
after eighteen months at the helm of the center-left.
</P>
<P>
Amato, 61, served as Socialist party premier from June 1992 to
April 1993, when he led Italy through a dire financial crisis, as
it rebounded from the embarrassment of the lira being forced out
of the European Monetary System.
</P>
<P>
During his premiership, he enacted the first and deepest of a
string of austerity budgets that ultimately led to Italy
confounding its critics and qualifying for European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
An academic nicknamed "Doctor Subtle" for his ability to see
the
fine points of an argument, Amato was Number Two in the Socialist
party to Bettino Craxi, who died in self-imposed exile in Tunisia
in January, a fugitive from Italian justice.
</P>
<P>
Amato's reputation was virtually unscathed by the corruption
scandals that toppled his political master and destroyed his party.
</P>
<P>
He came out of political retirement in October 1998, to head
the institutional reform ministry in the government put together
by Massimo D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
In April 1999, Amato became D'Alema's Treasury Minister,
filling the gap left by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who was elected
President.
</P>
<P>
Amato was born in Turin on May 13, 1938.
</P>
<P>
A graduate, like Ciampi and D'Alema, of the prestigious Normale
University in Pisa, where he took law, Amato also obtained a
master's degree in comparative law from Columbia University's
School of Law in 1962.
</P>
<P>
He joined the Socialist party in 1958 and became a member of
its central committee in 1978.
</P>
<P>
From 1964 to 1969, he taught law at the university of Rome,
before moving on to Perugia and then Florence, and returning to
Rome in 1975 to take up a post in comparative and constitutional
law, which he taught until 1994.
</P>
<P>
He was first elected to parliament in 1983 and served as
cabinet chief to Craxi from 1983 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
In 1987 he was re-elected to parliament and served as deputy
premier; from 1987 to 1989 he was Treasury minister.
</P>
<P>
From 1989 to 1992 he was deputy head of the Socialist party,
just as it began to be enmeshed in the corruption scandals that
brought down Italy's old guard.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 he was re-elected to parliament and later that year
appointed premier.
</P>
<P>
After his spell at the head of government, he returned to
academic studies as the head of Aspen Institute Italia, before
serving as Italy's first anti-trust chief from November 1994 to
November 1997, during which time he handed down a string of tough
competition rulings.
</P>
<P>
He then went back to the academic life at the European
University Institute outside Florence, before returning to the
fray as reform chief under D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
Amato has published a large number of books and articles
covering the economy and public institutions, personal liberties,
federalism, and comparative government.
</P>
<P>
He is married with two children.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The top decision making
body of the East African Cooperation (EAC) composed of Kenya,
Uganda and Tanzania has directed the task force on establishment
of customs union to expedite its work.
</P>
<P>
The task force is charged with exploring all options on
convergence of the common external tariffs and elimination of
internal tariffs among the member states.
</P>
<P>
In a one-day EAC tripartite commission meeting held in northern
 Tanzanian town of Arusha on Thursday, it was also agreed to hold
an extraordinary meeting on June 29-30 to receive the task force's
report and give further guidance to its work.
</P>
<P>
According to an EAC press release issued on Friday, the
commission has also directed a study be undertaken to design a
mechanism for monitoring of non-tariff barriers for cross-border
trade.
</P>
<P>
Under the EAC treaty signed last November, the three partner
states have resolved to establish a customs union within four
years.
</P>
<P>
The member states also agreed to remove all the existing
non-tariff barriers on the importation of goods originating from
other partner states and refrain from imposing any further
non-tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Thursday's meeting, the new chairman of the EAC
tripartite commission Nicolas Biwott urged member states to make
rapid implementation of the decisions already taken by the
re-launched regional organization.
</P>
<P>
"Rapid implementation of the decisions taken within the
regional framework should become the hallmark of the new regional
organization as we move into the future," stressed Biwott, who is
also Kenya's Minister for Tourism, Trade and Industry.

cooperation, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his appreciation for the Sino-Greek cultural
cooperation, saying that the two countries should cement such
cooperation by bringing into full play the cultural resources of
the two ancient countries.
</P>
<P>
"China adopts positive attitude towards such cooperation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Stephanopoulos extended his warm welcome to Jiang. He said that
Jiang's visit is of great significance to the development of the
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries do not only have long history, but share same
views on many world affairs, he said, adding that there are great
potential to tap in the Greece-China cooperation in many sectors.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the great achievement China has made and
expressed his hope that the economic development of China will
create more opportunities for the bilateral cooperation.

the one China policy and appreciate China's One Country, Two
Systems principle adopted in its reunification cause.
</P>
<P>

Taiwan issue. He also asked his Greek counterpart to visit China
at his convenient time.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two heads of states also exchanged views
on situations in the Balkan region and Kosovo issue. They agreed
that the two countries take similar stance on the matter because
both of them hold that the problem should be resolved by
implementing the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Stephanopoulos also reached the consensus that the
two countries should strengthen exchanges of views and
consultation on the international affairs.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President on Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here Friday that China is always committed to the peaceful
resolving of the Taiwan issue, but the One China principle is the
prerequisite of the peaceful reunification of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to exchange views on the relations across the
Taiwan Straits and peaceful reunification with all parties,
organizations and personnel in Taiwan which support the One China
Principle," Jiang said. "However, we will never tolerate any form
of the Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during his meeting with Greek Prime
Minister Constantinos Simitis the afternoon of the day.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the Chinese government is listening to what
the new leaders in Taiwan say and observing what they do.
</P>
<P>
"Our fundamental principle is that only after the One China
Principle is recognized, are the relations across the Taiwan
Straits able to advance healthily," he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his conviction that as the One China, Two Systems
policy has been successfully adopted in Hong Kong and Macao, the
Taiwan issue can be settled at an early date through the
implementation of the policy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is here for a state visit to Greece at the invitation of
Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos. This is first visit to
Greece by a Chinese head of state, and also the fourth leg of
Jiang's five-nation tour of Asia, Europe and Africa, which has
brought him to Israel, Palestine and Turkey, and will take him to
South Africa. Furthermore, President Jiang also meet with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Alexandria City of Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Two Studies Doubt Fiber-Cancer Tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The studies found that neither eating a low-fat diet with
abundant fiber, much of it from fruits and vegetables, nor eating
extra fiber in the form of wheat bran made any difference in colon
cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
And while some researchers say there is still a chance that
fiber helps prevent colon cancer, others say it is time to stop
telling people that it can.
</P>
<P>
In both studies, financed by the cancer institute, the subjects
were men and women who had had at least one polyp, a tiny
noncancerous growth, removed from the colon.
</P>
<P>
Such people face a heightened risk of developing new polyps.
And since many colon cancers start out as polyps, people who have
had polyps also face an increased risk of developing colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
The question was, Can a special diet protect these people from
developing new polyps? If so, cancer-experts reasoned, the diet
might protect them from colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
One study, lasting four years, involved 2,079 people randomly
assigned to eat low-fat, high-fiber diets with lots of fruits and
vegetables or to follow their usual diets.
</P>
<P>
In the other study, lasting three years, 1,429 participants
were randomly assigned to eat high-fiber wheat bran cereals or
wheat bran fiber bars, or to eat cereals or bars that looked and
tasted the same but were low in fiber.
</P>
<P>
Experts on colon cancer said the research, led by scientists at
the National Cancer Institute and the University of Arizona, left
them stunned. Colon and rectal cancer is the second-leading cause
of cancer-related death in the United States, after lung cancer,
and is diagnosed in 130,000 Americans a year. Many people hope
that a high-fiber diet will protect them.
</P>
<P>
The results, published Thursday in The New England Journal of
Medicine, showed that those who ate the high-fiber diets were no
less likely to develop new polyps over the next few years than
those who did not.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Barnett Kramer, deputy director of the division of cancer
prevention at the National Cancer Institute, said it remained
possible that a high-fiber diet could alter colon cancer risk:
effect might occur either before polyps develop or very late,
outside the period covered by the studies. But that is only a
hypothesis, he said.
</P>
<P>
The hypothesis linking fiber to a reduced risk of colon cancer
dates from 1971, with a paper by Dr. Denis P. Burkitt, a British
missionary surgeon who noticed that poor rural Africans had much
less colon cancer than affluent Westerners. The reason, Dr.
Burkitt proposed, was diet: the Africans ate much more fiber. Over
the years, evidence supporting the hypothesis steadily mounted.
</P>
<P>
Animal studies bolstered the notion. Rodents, fed high
concentrations of carcinogens in laboratory studies, were
protected against colon cancer if they also ate high-fiber diets.
</P>
<P>
Studies of humans, however, were inconsistent. Some showed that
people who developed colon cancer or polyps ate more fat and less
fiber than those who did not.
</P>
<P>
But several recent studies, one involving 88,000 nurses, failed
to detect any effect of diet on colorectal cancers or polyps.
</P>
<P>
In planning the latest studies, said Dr. Arthur Schatzkin,
chief of the nutritional epidemiology branch at the cancer
institute, "we had high expectations and good rationale." But, he
said, "we got absolutely null results."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Schatzkin, who directed the study in which subjects ate
either diets high in fiber, including fruits and vegetables, or
their ordinary diets, said the fiber hypothesis might still turn
out to be true. "You could say diet works earlier - before they
develop the first polyp," he said. "Or maybe diet works later in
the process."
</P>
<P>
But the leader of the second study, Dr. David Alberts, director
of cancer prevention at the University of Arizona's Cancer Center,
said, "I think we've definitely disproved the fiber hypothesis for
colon cancer."

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Speaker Blasts Albright for Abusing "U.S. Democracy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian State Duma (lower house of
parliament) speaker Gennady Seleznyov on Friday in the Kazakhstan
capital of Astana strongly criticized U.S. State Secretary
Madeleine Albright for her attempt to impose U.S.-style democracy
on Russia and other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
"This (U.S. democracy) is her favorite subject. Wherever she
comes, she speaks mainly about democracy," Seleznyov told a press
conference at the end of a visit by a State Duma delegation to
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
"We are being raised to accept the American type of democracy,"
Seleznyov said, urging Albright "to calm down" and "enjoy U.S.
democracy
</P>
<P>
Albright "has been a pain in the neck on Chechnya by actually
setting us against the whole Europe," said the speaker, cited by
the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
He believes Washington will not forsake its main "divide and
conquer" principles even in the new century despite now the world
trends are dialogue, cooperation and multipolarity.
</P>
<P>
This is precisely why U.S. representatives want to assume a
high profile in the regions where they can gain more foothold,
said Seleznyov, citing Albright's recent visit to Kazakhstan as an
example.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans in this respect always try to look far beyond
the horizon, and once they see they can be the first somewhere and
can consolidate their interests, they are simply there," the
chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Once the integrated ties among CIS countries begin to weaken,"
Americans appear there right away," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The speaker also said the U.S. now are totally uninterested in
a strong Russia and in the re-creation of any allied structures on
post-Soviet territory.
</P>
<P>
"Look how many obstacles they raised to the Russia-Belarus
Union,"Washington's intention is very clear, he added.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Albright has kept being criticized by some U.S. and
overseas media for offending not few foreign leaders.

PARIS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Spaniards failed to repeat their
triumph in the Champions League when Alex Corretja and Juan Carlos
Ferrero bounced out of the quarter-final of the Monte Carlo Open
men's tennis tournament in Monte Carlo, Monaco.
</P>
<P>
Three Spanish soccer teams advanced into the semi-final of the
Champions League this week, making the history that three of the
final four of the tournament coming from one country.
</P>
<P>
Inspiring by the historical glory, the Spaniards seemed having
better chance of advancing, but neither gave any impressive
performance in Friday's games.
</P>
<P>
Ninth-seeded Corretja enjoyed a mild celebration before
collapsed to Dominik Hrbaty of Slovenia 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Hrbaty, last year's French Open semi-finalist Slovak, had
beaten top seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia in the second round.
</P>
<P>
Ferrero had nothing to answer in a one-sided game, suffering a
6-4, 6-2 defeat to Gaston Gaudio of Argentina.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Thai Main Opposition Party Heads for Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The New Aspiration Party (NAP),
the biggest Thai opposition Party, is now heading towards a major
reshuffle as both the party leader and its secretary general
announced they will submit their resignations to the party's
executive committee on April 30, analyst here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, leader of the NAP and a former Prime
Minister, who announced his resignation on Thursday, told
reporters Friday that political movements within and outside the
NAP have been anticipated, and the move will lead to "better
politics."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a separate interview, the NAP secretary general
Chaturon Chaisaeng said that he is also resigning from the current
post.
</P>
<P>
"When the party leader resigns, the other party executives
should resign as well, in order to give a free choice to the out-
going leader to nominate members for the party's top positions,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The NAP used to hold 124 posts in the 385-member Lower House of
the Thai Parliament and is still the biggest opposition party.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the NAP lost nearly 30 parliamentary posts
to the Thai Rak Thai Party, which is under the leadership of
telecommunications tycoon Thaksin Shinawatr.
</P>
<P>
More recently, another three NAP lawmakers were reported "
likely to defect" to the Thai Rak Thai Party.
</P>
<P>
There is also a reported conflict between NAP Secretary
Chaturon and Deputy Leader Chalerm Yubamrung over the nomination
of Chalerm's sons, Art-harn and Wanchalerm, to contest in the
forthcoming general election.
</P>
<P>
NAP Executive Committee members were divided over the issue.
The majority of the executive committee were in support of Chalerm
' sons, while a few objected to the nomination.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the resignation announcement by Chavalit is
likely a political strategy to cool down the "concealed" conflicts
within the party, as well as get rid of "undesirable elements" of
the party.

<HEADLINE> Politics in Court to Erode People's Confidence in Judiciary: Chief Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Chief Justice Latifur Rahman
Friday urged lawyers to help keep the court out of the purview of
politics, saying the entrance of politics in the arena of
judiciary would erode people's confidence in judiciary.
</P>
<P>
"If politics enters the arena of the court, justice will be
disrupted, dignity of court will be affected, and people will lose
their trust in the judiciary," he said while speaking at the
Bangladesh Bar Council conference, which was also joined by Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina said at the conference that people expect the
trial of the killers of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the first Prime
Minister of Bangladesh, to be completed in normal course of law
for the sake of justice and rule of law in the country.,
</P>
<P>
She said for more than two decades, the killers of Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman were provided state protection and awarded with
overseas postings to represent the country abroad despite their "
proud self-confessions."
</P>
<P>
Top leaders of the ruling Awami League recently blasted the
higher judiciary for what they said delaying the process of
execution of death sentences of the killers of Sheikh Mujibur
Rahman.
</P>
<P>
While the four-party opposition alliance led by Bangladesh
Nationalist Party alleged that the criticism of judges by ruling
party leaders was designed to "destroy the judiciary." They staged
a country-wide demonstration to protest it and to further
consolidate their unity to unseat the government and establish
what they termed a "nationalist and democratic one."

<HEADLINE> Belgian Trains Stop for Memory of Crash Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Railway personnel in Belgium
observed a work stoppage Friday to commemorate the victims of a
train disaster that occurred Tuesday near Charleroi, a southern
Belgian city.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions in Belgium called for the 30-minute memorial this
morning. An engine operator was killed after his train derailed
and collided head-on with an oncoming train. Dozens of passengers
were injured.
</P>
<P>
The accident was reportedly caused by three children who put a
concrete block on the rail. The children have been taken into
custodial care.
</P>
<P>
The damages could run up to over 100 million Belgian francs (
some 2.5 million U.S. dollars), according to a rough estimate. The
concerned parties are discussing who should pay the damages.
</P>
<P>
Consumer rights organization Test Aankoop/Test Achats urged
insurance companies to be obliged by law to cover the entire
amount of a damage caused by a minor no matter how serious, and
even if inflicted on purpose.
</P>
<P>
At present, the limit for a family policy is 35 million Belgian
francs (833,000 U.S. dollars) for material damage.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Duma Ratifies Nuclear Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma, lower
house of parliament, Friday overwhelmingly ratified the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) by a vote of 298-74
with three abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The voting was held behind closed doors, and by law at least
226 votes in the 450-seat Duma were needed for the approval of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
After the voting, presidential spokesman in the State Duma
Alexander Kotenkov told reporters that the Communist faction's
amendment to the treaty was not even voted on, as it did not
correspond with the law on international treaties.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Communist faction, deputy Alexander Shabanov
demanded that a passage be included in the text to the effect
that Russia will not hand the ratification charter over to the
United Nations before the treaty is ratified by other nuclear
states.
</P>
<P>
The treaty will come into force only after the last of its
participants, including the U.S., Russia, France, Britain, China,
India, Pakistan and other nuke-potential states, hands its
ratification charter to the UN, said Kotenkov.
</P>
<P>
The United States, who has the world's largest and most
advanced nuclear arsenal, has not approved the CTBT. The U.S.
Senate rejected it in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ratification of the CTBT came one week after the
Duma approved the START II nuclear arms reduction pact with the
United States. Under START II, Russia and the United States will
significantly reduce the number of their nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the two important treaties are seen as
victories for Russian president-elect Vladimir Putin.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- An electrical fire in a Washington D.C. downtown Metro
tunnel stranded frightened passengers in a smoke-filled train,
forced the evacuation of two stations and virtually shut down the
evening rush hour above and below ground on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
-- Attorney General Janet Reno has decided to remove Elian
Gonzalez from the home of his Miami great-uncle and has instructed
federal law enforcement officials to determine the optimum moment
to do so based on variables ranging from Miami traffic to the
weather forecast, officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Paleontologists said on Thursday that they had discovered
the heart of a dinosaur in the chest cavity of the ancient
animal's fossil skeleton uncovered in South Dakota. Encased in a
natural sarcophagus of stone, the heart was the size of a
grapefruit and had fossilized into reddish-brown stone 66 million
years ago.
</P>
<P>
-- Several thousand people gathered in a public park in
Littleton, Colorado, for an ecumenical remembrance on the first
anniversary of the shooting rampage at Columbine High School that
left 15 people dead and nearly two dozen others wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft's earnings grew 24 percent, slightly beating
estimates, but company executives said slowing demand for PCs
crimped revenue and could slow growth. The software giant is also
overhauling its advertising approach, shifting most of its ad
budget to the selling of Microsoft itself.

<HEADLINE> Greece React Swifly to Criticism from Samaranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece reacted swiftly on Friday
to criticism from Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the
International Olympic Committee(IOC), over delays in  the
preparations for the 2004 Athens Games, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch warned on Thursday in Lausanne that the Games could
be endangered if the Greeks failed to improve their organisation
drastically by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
One organiser said Samaranch's statement could be just what
was needed.
</P>
<P>
"This will be good for us. A lot of people will finally
realise what needs to be done," the organiser was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sources on the Athens 2004 organising committee said the IOC
has long been concerned about the slow progress of several
projects, including the construction of an Olympic village,hotel
accommodation and transport to venues.
</P>
<P>
Greece's notorious bureaucracy, in-fighting among the many
officials in charge of the Games and legal complications in taking
even minor decisions have caused delays that prompted some Greek
officials to describe the past two years as wasted, reports said.

<HEADLINE> CCB Announces Breakthrough in Personal Housing Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank (CCB)
announced today that outstanding amount of personal housing loans
has exceeded 100 billion yuan (about 13 billion U.S. dollars) by
April, helping more than 2.6 million families buy their own houses
with an aggregate floor space of over 230 million sq m.
</P>
<P>
CCB Vice-President Zhang Enzhao said that personal housing
loans are one of the bank's fastest growing business sectors. By
the end of 1998, the outstanding amount of personal loans reached
44.5 billion yuan, but the end of 1999 the figure rose rapidly to
86.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said these figures not only indicate CCB's achievement in
promoting reform in China's housing system, but the success of its
loan system.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, by early April, CCB has granted a
total of 150 billion yuan in personal housing loans, accounting
for 39 percent of the bank's total real estate loans and 97
percent of its personal consumption loans.
</P>
<P>
Presently, the CCB holds a 50 percent share in China's housing
loan market, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bank has set a minimum target of 40 billion
yuan in new personal housing loans. The Bank has also revised its
business procedures, extended loan periods and lowered the ratio
of down payments.
</P>
<P>
He said that personal housing loans are one of the Bank's best
business sectors in respect to credit quality. To date, non-
performing loans are rare.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Major Landslide Rare in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 21 (Xinhua)-- The landslide that took place in
Nyingchi Prefecture in Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region
on April 9 is the biggest China has seen and also a rare
phenomenon in the world, said experts.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters went to the site of the landslide in Bomi County on
April 18 and concluded that the landslide, which lasted about ten
minutes, occurred because the mountain slope had been heavily
soaked with melting snow due to warmer climate in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that the landslide, that piled up 60 meters
high in average over an area of about five square kilometers,
consisted mainly sand and heavily eroded stone blocks.
</P>
<P>
The landslide covered highways linking two villages and a tea
plantation, trapping 4,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The region has historically been beset with numerous landslides.
The last one occurred at the beginning of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
They ruled out any major landslides in the region in the near
future.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Plays Down Austrian Minister's Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Belgium Friday played down
Austrian Defense Minister Herbert Scheibner's threat to ban
flights over Austria by Belgian military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian Foreign Ministry said Scheibner's remarks were not
a decision of the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
Scheibner, a member of Jorg Haider's far-right Freedom Party,
made the comments in an interview with the Austrian weekly Format
published on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"If the Belgians say they don't want military contacts with
Austria, then we also do not want the Belgians to transport
military equipment through our airspace," Scheibner was quoted as
saying by the magazine.
</P>
<P>
Scheibner was referring to a meeting of Europe's defense
ministers in Portugal in February, where Belgian Defense Minister
Andre Flahaut announced the freezing of military cooperation with
Austria.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of Haider's Freedom Party in government in
February has prompted Austria's EU partners to impose political
sanctions against Vienna.

Foreign Ministry announced Friday.

<P>
During the visit, Shareh will meet President Jacques Chirac and

</P>
<P>
"The coordination with different parties, especially Syria,
which is an important player in the Middle East, is more necessary
than ever."
</P>
<P>
He said that although the peace process between Israel and
Syria was deadlocked, both countries have for several times
expressed their commitment to peace.
</P>
<P>
The assistant spokesman also said France considers Israel's
decision to pull out of southern Lebanon a "positive" move, but it
will not solve all the problems.

<P>
Israel has called on France to lead a United Nations
peacekeeping operation in southern Lebanon once it pulls its
troops out of there by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
France has half agreed to the Israeli demand, but is pushing
Israel to resume peace talks with Syria as an exchange.
</P>
<P>
Syria has 35,000 troops permanently deployed in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Passes Code For Citizens Who Risk Their Lives For A Just Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The legislative body in Beijing
today passed a code that awards citizens who risk their lives for
others or engaged in brave deeds for the good of the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
The law highlights a question which has been debated in the
last couple of years: Should deeds be rewarded by handing out
money? The mass media reports again and again of crimes committed
in public while bystanders do nothing. Those who do confront
criminals are often ridiculed. "We hope the law will help to
maintain a just society through legal means," said Huang Zhimin,
the spokesman of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
According to him, since a draft form of the law first appeared
in local newspapers to solicit advice from the public, more than 6,
000 pieces of suggestions and advices have been collected.
</P>
<P>
The new law will go into effect from August 1.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hostility Toward Iran Never Changes: Iranian Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Seyyed Ali
Khamenei has warned that the United States has never abandoned its
hostile policy on Iran although it has softened its tone toward
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency on Friday, the leader
said that Washington's soft tone does not mean that it has given up
its intentions of political and cultural hegemony in Iran, but it
is solely a change of strategy for achieving the same oppressive
goals.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Washington had been theorizing and
defending the so-called policy and idea of "globalization," by
which the Americans meant the global rule of the U.S. government
and a forced submission to America by other countries in Africa,
Asia, and Latin America, he said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a large gathering of young people on Thursday,
Khamenei pointed out that none of the problems of Iran would ever
be solved as a result of establishing any type of relations with
Washington, Iran's archenemy.
</P>
<P>
The Americans are more concerned about their own interests than
the interests of the governments and nations with which they dealt,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Washington and any foreign enemies of Iran would
never be able to pressure the Islamic government into any form of
submission to or reconciliation with the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
If the Americans or other enemies of the Islamic republic should
eventually be tempted to try the most extreme form of that pressure
on Iran, the result would be a crucial (armed) confrontation, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also criticized the freedom of the Iranian press to
question the religious sanctity of many principles. He warned "some
elements" in the press against writing things against Islamic
values and becoming tools of Iran's enemies.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic and economic relations between Iran and the U.S. were
shattered when Islamic fundamentalist revolutionaries overthrew the
U.S.-backed Shah in 1979, seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and
held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
Since moderate President Mohammad Khatami came to power in 1997,
however, the two countries have softened their hostile tones toward
each other, even opening their doors for unofficial contacts.
</P>
<P>
Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced
that Iran would be allowed to export its three major non-oil
products - carpets, pistachios and caviar - to the U.S., which was
considered the most substantial good-will step Washington has taken
toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
But there is still a long way to go before the two countries can
fully resume relations because the conservative hardliners in Iran,
who are controlling the regime, are strongly opposed to such a
move.
</P>
<P>
Washington, too, lacks trust in Iran, insisting that it supports
international terrorism, tries to obtain weapons of mass
destruction and hinders the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Iran's conservatives intensified their struggle against
reformers after they were defeated completely in February's
sensitive parliamentary elections by reformers.
</P>
<P>
One important strategy of the conservatives is to stir up
people's anti-U.S. feelings and accuse reformers of collaborating
with Iran's enemies in plotting to subvert the Islamic system.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Announces Policy Framework for Stockbroking Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Securities
Commission (SC) Friday announced the Policy Framework for
Stockbroking Industry and the Reduction of Transaction Costs,
which provide a set of strategies aimed at promoting consolidation
among local stockbroking companies by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The current freeze on the issuance of new licenses for
stockbroking will continue until the objective of industry
consolidation has been achieved, the SC said in a statement to
announce the policy framework.
</P>
<P>
Under the framework, there would not be more than 15 universal
brokers in Malaysia, each of which should comprise a group of at
least four existing stockbroking companies, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that there is obviously a need to consolidate the
stockbroking industry and the objective of consolidation is to
strengthen the industry and form a group of well-capitalised
domestic stockbroking companies which can provide efficient and
cost-effective intermediation for investors.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy framework, stockbroking companies will be
allowed to find their own merger partners and their firm merger
agreements should be executed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The SC said that a stockbroking company which could not enter
into such merger agreements by December 31, 2000 should not expect
its license to be renewed.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of the consolidation exercise, every
stockbroking company is required to have a minimum paid-up capital
of 250 million ringgit (65.789 million U.S. dollars), core capital
of at least 250 million ringgit (65.789 million U.S. dollars) and
a capital adequacy ratio of at least 1.50 times, it said.
</P>
<P>
Stockbroking companies are also required to satisfy
quantitative and qualitative criteria, which would include good
governance standards and management capabilities and also to
satisfy the necessary criteria of the SC.
</P>
<P>
All stockbroking companies which have been given firm
agreements for the merger by December 31, 2000, will be granted
tax credits for accumulated losses carried forward, and stamp duty
and real property gains tax exemptions as announced in the Year
2000 Budget on October 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
A universal broker will be allowed to offer the full range of
capital market services, it said, adding immediately upon meeting
the above criteria, a stockbroking company that has requisite
personnel will be allowed to take on corporate finance work, and
trade derivative products, and it will be allowed to undertake
additional business activities in the future, which include
managing private debt securities, trading in fixed income products
and other financial instruments as and when introduced.
</P>
<P>
A universal broker would be given latitude to open branches
throughout the country from January 1, 2002, subject to the SC's
approval.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that to enable a stockbroking company to
operate under a single license for both the equity and derivatives
markets, amendments would be made to the Securities Industry Act
1983 and the Futures Industry Act 1993.
</P>
<P>
It said a task force to be chaired by the Ministry of Finance
and comprising representatives from the SC and the KLSE will be
set up to review the status and extent of broker consolidation.

<HEADLINE> Verbal Agreement on Temporary Cease-fire Issued in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Following meetings with the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), a verbal agreement on a
temporary cease-fire for the 1-3 May round of polio immunization
has been issued by the Taliban Militia and its opposition, the
Northern Alliance ,according to a press release from the office of
the UN Coordinator for Afghanistan here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a positive step, now we hope that these commitments
will be met," said the Afghanistan UNICEF Representative, Louis-
Georges Arsenault.
</P>
<P>
Close to 4.5 million Afghan children less than 5 years old may
be vaccinated against polio in this year's first anti-polio
campaign if they can be reached with the vaccine. "If every single
child under five can be vaccinated now and in future immunization
campaigns, we can rid Afghanistan of polio," said the WHO
Representative M.A. Jama.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan and Pakistan are two of the world's thirty
countries where polio continues to cripple people, mostly young
children. In Afghanistan in 1999, 156 new polio cases were
identified, which may be only a fraction of the total number
because reports did not come from all the districts.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is now awaiting the written confirmation
from both sides.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Mini-Summit Adopts Communique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Six West African states outside
the franc zone of the African Financial Community Thursday night
adopted a communique with a strong commitment to creating a second
monetary union in the sub- region by January 2003, Ghana News
Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, which was available Friday morning,
presidents or their representatives from Ghana, Gambia, Guinea,
Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone said the union would be launched
after all the convergence criteria laid by the 22nd ECOWAS summit
last year are met.
</P>
<P>
The 22nd ECOWAS summit held last December in Togo's capital
Lome decided on a fast-track approach to ensure an accelerated
implementation of integration programs in member countries where
conditions are mature.
</P>
<P>
The criteria include an inflation rate of not more than nine
percent by the year 2000 and five percent by 2003, a gross
external reserves to cover at least three months of imports by the
end of this year, and six months by the end of 2003.
</P>
<P>
They also include a central bank financing of budget deficit
not more than 10 percent of previous year's tax revenue, with the
percentage of budget deficit (excluding grants) to gross domestic
product not more than five percent by 2000 and four percent by
2002.
</P>
<P>
To accommodate the monetary and fiscal pressures on individual
national economies, the six countries agreed to establish an
appropriate regional compensation and stabilization arrangement
dubbed "Accra Declaration on Second Monetary Zone", the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
Modalities for implementation would involve the adoption of
"the recommendations of the Convergence Council, including the
attached Action Plan, which outlines the program of activities to
be undertaken in four stages ending in December 2002, to be
followed by the commencement of the second monetary zone in
January 2003."
</P>
<P>
"Institutional arrangements to be made include the
establishment of a Summit of Heads of State and Government;
Convergence Council of Ministers and Governors of Central Banks;
Technical Committee assisted by the Task Force; and a Common
Central Bank," according to the document.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Fully Control Territorial Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda is to fully control its
territorial airspace by ensuring general alert and surveillance
through the use of a long range capacity radar installed at Rebero
hill near Kigali, Rwanda News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda has been solely dependent on monitoring done by the
Tanzanian Civil Aviation Authority in Dar es Salaam for any
aircraft flying beyond 25, 000 feet above sea level above Rwandan
territory," the report quoted Rwandan newly President-elect Paul
Kagame as saying in his project launching ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that there is critical need for the
country to have its own air traffic control and air space
surveillance system to ensure safe and efficient traffic flow.
</P>
<P>
This project would serve to bolster up the confidence of air
companies and boost the flow of air transport in the land-locked
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador of the United States to Rwanda George Staples hailed
the project, noting that "given Rwanda's strategic position on the
African continent and her potential for development, there is
great need for such modern means of technology in air traffic
control."
</P>
<P>
To increase efficiency and systems utilization, the radar will
have a remote control tower with full communication data links
between Kanombe Airport and Rebero radar site on the outskirts of
Kigali.
</P>
<P>
The first plane landed in Rwanda in 1936. Rwanda joined the
International Civil Aviation in 1964.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Li Huangxi, Self-Taught Senior Technician in China's Largest Automaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- When China's First Auto Work (
FAW) began introducing production line technology from foreign
countries in 1989, Li Huangxi was one of the many FAW maintenance
workers puzzled by the new systems and could not read manuals in
foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
Now, Li is one of the most highly-skilled technicians and a
leading experts of foreign machines in FAW, after spending days
and nights at his "home lab."
</P>
<P>
Li, now 50, is a senior technician at FAW and has been named
this year's winner of the "May Day Labor Award", a national honor
for people who have made notable contributions to the country.
</P>
<P>
Without higher education, the man lacked the confidence to
learn on his own everything necessary, which might be traced back
to the years he spent in the countryside as a "re-educated youth"
since 1968.
</P>
<P>
All his painstaking efforts began with the FAW's imported
production lines in 1989 when he turned his home into a "lab" just
for studying the imported equipment.
</P>
<P>
He spent all his savings, 2,100 yuan (about 250 U.S. dollars),
to purchase a cheap computer for setting up his "Family Computer
System" which includes a tape-recorder and a black-white TV set.
</P>
<P>
With the help of his family, his wife and their only boy, Li
got familiar with all the programs of the imported computer-
control machines.
</P>
<P>
The maintenance worker is now seen as a "magic doctor" of
foreign equipment by his colleagues at the FAW which is located in
Changchun, the capital of northeastern Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Li's intelligence has helped his company save a great deal of
money, through successfully repairing foreign machines and
replacing worn-out foreign parts with home-made ones.
</P>
<P>
Besides working in his home lab, Li has attended numerous part-
time schools and high-level training courses on electrical
equipment. "I could only become an illiterate man in front of
foreign equipment, if I don't keep learning," he says.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Member Killed in Israeli Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel continued its attacks Friday
morning in south Lebanon and one Hezbollah guerrilla was killed in
the air raids, People's Sound radio station reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio reported that Israel warplanes launched four missiles
at the region near Nabatiye, bombing several villages. One bomb
fell on a market of Nabatiye but did not go off.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah admitted that one of its member was killed in Israel's
attacks on south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Fire tradings between Israel and resistance guerrillas
intensified after Israel formally notified the United Nations that
it would pull out its troops from south Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak stressed Wednesday that his
country will retaliate if the resistance forces continue firing
Katyushas on north Israel or causes any casualties after its
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978. It set up
the present "security zone" in 1985, saying it needed to protect
its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since been leading
a war of attrition to try to end the Israeli occupation of south
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> China to Take Leaps in Scientific Developments: Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China will try to catch up with
developed countries in economic strength by taking leaps in its
scientific developments in the 21st century, according to the
latest issue of Outlook, the country's most authoritative news
weekly.
</P>
<P>
The magazine will carry an article in its April 24 edition,
discussing weather China has the ability to take such giant
strides and what the country should do to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
Some experts in scientific and technological strategies pointed
out that developing countries may have the chance to join
developed countries in some high-tech fields which produce new
inventions every three to five years.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, it is hoped that China will develop its
science and technology in an open, practical and market-oriented
way, according to the magazine.
</P>
<P>
However, the scientific progress should be made on the basis of
scientific and technological innovation, said Hu Angang, an
economist with the National Situation Research Center under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences and Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
He said that the market should play an active role in promoting
the scientific development, and enterprises should take a leading
role while the task for the government is to create a better
environment for such development.
</P>
<P>
The process for the country's technological leaps should
involve the entire industry and focus on key projects, especially
those in the frontier fields in the 21st century such as computer
software, information and pharmaceutical industries.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is serious in its
efforts to develop its capital market and measures are being taken
to ensure that it advances in a structured and prudent manner,
Finance Ministry Adviser Mustapa Mohamad said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa said Malaysia has all the components needed for its
capital markets to flourish and all that is required to move
forward is the experience, maturity of market players,
sophisticated products, high discipline and professionalism.
</P>
<P>
After years of promoting, introducing and improving, Malaysia
can be proud that it now has a whole range of exchanges to cater
for all types of trading along with the peripheral support
activities, he told an international seminar here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia now boasts four exchanges -- the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange, Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange,
Commodities and Monetary Exchange and Malaysian Exchange of
Securities Dealing and Automated Quotation Stock, Mustapa said.
</P>
<P>
He said that as shareholders as a whole are getting smarter,
companies may now be forced to source financing directly from the
capital markets.
</P>
<P>
As for the local unit trust industry, efforts to
institutionalize the market would ultimately lead to stability in
the market when the volatility of share price movements decreased,
he said.
</P>
<P>
As the fund management and unit trust industry grows, the
market exposure of institutional investors will increase, thus
ensuring the Malaysian market would continue to develop and mature
in a stable environment, he said.

BANGKOK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- About 120 Thai children have been

The Center for the Protection of the Children's Rights said Friday.
</P>

children since 1981 and all of them were victims of such neglect.

intend to neglect their children but they did not know how to take
care of them.
</P>
<P>
"Children's fates lie in their family's hands," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Publishes Positive Economic Program for Next 15 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government Thursday
published a positive economic program for the coming 15 years,
giving optimistic prospects for national economy.
</P>
<P>
The program worked out by the Russian Economy Ministry sets a 4.
5-percent growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) for next year.
</P>
<P>
During the period from 2001 to 2003, the government will seek
to deepen structural reform and bring the transitional period to
an end, said the Russian government's Information Department.
</P>
<P>
The program targets an average annual GDP growth of over 4.5
percent for this period and a real personal income up by 25
percent compared with 1999.
</P>
<P>
In 2001, Russia's GDP will grow 4-4.5 percent, industrial
production will rise 5 percent and agricultural output 3 percent,
while capital investment will rise 6 percent and real disposable
personal incomes 5 percent, according to the program.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth will reach 6 percent in 2003 and industrial
production is expected to rise by 7-8 percent annually, it says.
</P>
<P>
The program expects the Central Bank's key refinancing rate to
drop to 20 percent by the end of 2000 and to 10-13 percent by 2003,
forecasting inflation at 10 percent next year, 8 percent in 2002
and 7 percent in 2003.
</P>
<P>
In 2001-2003, the exchange rate of the Russian ruble against
the U.S. dollar will be controlled 15-20 percent lower than
inflation, and the average exchange rate of the ruble will be 35
rubles for one dollar in 2001, predicted Russian Economy Minister
Andrei Shapovalyants.
</P>
<P>
Such a difference between the ruble exchange rate and dynamics
of the consumer price index would be favorable for economic
development in the next few years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The price of Russian oil on the world market will be maintained
at about 18 U.S. dollars per barrel in 2001-2003, Shapovalyants
believes.
</P>
<P>
The increase of Russia's annual oil output to 300-308 million
tons is "positive" and an annual gas production of 600-610 billion
cubic meters will be good for preventing a deficiency of that fuel,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be good for the Russian economy to increase oil
production to 350 million tons next year," he noted, adding that
Russia will not cut exports of raw materials in the next two or
three years and the domestic need for raw materials will also go
up.
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to stimulate investment, including
creating an insurance agency to attract investment and forming a
pool of banks to investment in the real sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the priority of the second phase of
the development strategy -- from 2004 to 2007 -- will be to attain
maximum economic growth rates of at least 6 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the third stage -- from 2008 to 2015 -- will be long-
term economic stability, with steady growth and constant renewal
of the technological and production structures of the economy.
</P>
<P>
However, government officials said that that is an optimistic
prediction.
</P>
<P>
A report placed by Shapovalyants on the government's website
said: "According to the second version of the prognosis, when the
influence of unfavorable factors and the accomplishment of
existing threats are possible, higher inflation figures and lower
GDP growth may happen."
</P>
<P>
But Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin told a government
session Thursday that "we have better figures now than ones
forecast for 2001," because "GDP rose by 8 percent in the first
quarter of this year, which is not just steady growth, but also a
rapid growth."
</P>
<P>
Russia's industry has been undoubtedly developing according to
the encouraging scenario since the beginning of the year.
Nevertheless, observers say that the country's economy has not
recovered by far.

<HEADLINE> Tibet to Build Over 100 Towns to Accelerate Urbanization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous
Region plans to build 100 small towns along its major highways to
accelerate the region's urbanization.
</P>
<P>
The decision comes at a time when sociologists and reformers
are calling for expanded urbanization which they believe will push
forward the region's economy.
</P>
<P>
In the past 50 years, Tibet has set up 112 towns, according to
Xu Mingyang, the region's deputy chairman. But urbanization at
present remains only at 9.8 percent and infrastructure conditions
in many towns still lag far behind other regions.
</P>
<P>
Urbanization, or building cities, is a global trend, and the
regional government views it an effective way to develop its
economy and to narrow its gap with the prosperous coastal areas,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
So Tibet wants to take advantage of the opportunity created by
the ongoing national drive to develop western China and to build
100 new towns along the Qinghai-Tibetan Highway, Sichuan-Tibetan
Highway and China-Nepal Highway in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
By 2006, the region will be able to supply 60 percent of its
county town residents with liquefied natural gas, he said.
</P>
<P>
By 2008, it will solve the heating problems for most of its
urban residents; and by 2010, Tibet will renovate 80 percent of
the housing of its county towns and border trading ports and
increase its urbanization to 22 percent, with the total urban
population reaching 780,000, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Central Bank Protects Pound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Central Bank of Lebanon has stepped
in to support the Lebanese pound this week after U.S. dollars
almost disappeared from the market and security fears increased,
Daily Star newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted dealers as saying that the bank has provided
almost all of the 63 million dollars demanded this week. Last week
it supplied around 70 percent of the 40-million-dollar market.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing capital shifting toward the dollar", said Habib
Haddad, head of treasury at the Beirut Riyad Bank. "The regional
situation and to a smaller degree public finances are causing a
little pressure."
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank intervened last week for the first time in
almost a year to support the pound, which weakened on fading hopes
of a peace agreement to accompany a planned Israeli troop
withdrawal from south Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
The interbank exchange rate remained at 1,514 Lebanese pounds to
one dollar this week, the top of the Central Bank's intervention
band.

<HEADLINE> Italian Ruling Coalition Names Amato as Candidate for Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian ruling center-left coalition
on Friday morning named current Treasury Minister Gulio Amato as
candidate for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The nomination was announced by the ruling Left Democratic
Party's parliamentary leader Fabio Mussi, after his meeting with
Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi met with leaders of parties to open the second round of
consultations aimed at naming a premier-designate to replace the
outgoing government leader, Massimo D'Alema, who resigned on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Freedom Front leaders, who are pushing for an
immediate general election, have come out strongly against Amato.
</P>
<P>
They have also hinted that Amato does not have the
parliamentary backing as the left thinks he does.
</P>
<P>
Amato returned at dawn from the spring session of the
International Monetary Fund in New York Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
After 18 months at the helm of his center-left coalition,
D'Alema handed the president his resignation in the wake of heavy
center-left losses in regional elections held last Sunday.

<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Wannian, Vice-Chairman of
China's Central Military Commission, reiterated here today that
China never allows any form of "Taiwan independence," foreign
interference in the Taiwan issue, nor letting the Taiwan issue
remain unsettled without time limit.

<P>
The principle of "one China" is the basis and precondition for

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The International Coalition for Missing Israeli Soldiers has
set up a three-man committee to investigate a report indicating
that the three MIAs from the Sultan Yakoub battle are buried in a
neighboring Arab country.
</P>
<P>
Yona Baumel, whose son Zachary went missing in the June 1982
battle along with comrades Zvi Feldman and Yehuda Katz, said the
families demand that the report, which appears Friday on the
Nazaretzh-based A-Sinara newspaper, be checked thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a "well informed" high-ranking Palestinian
official who knows a source claiming to have information on the
burial site, which he is willing to divulge for money.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would be taking a tough line
in his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington, Arab
sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was scheduled for late Thursday night, Israel time.
Arafat met U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at her
Georgetown home and was to go to the White House later.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of State for Non-government Organization
Hassan Asfour said on Tuesday that he saw little hope for any
breakthrough during the summit.
</P>
<P>
A second week of Israeli-Palestinian talks ended at Bolling Air
Force Base in Washington last weekend with an exchange of position
papers, but no evidence of significant progress. Clinton met
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak last week and has been taking a
more active mediating role in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Three Israel Defense Forces soldiers of the Golani Brigade
were lightly wounded by shrapnel Thursday when a bomb planted by
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas next to the security fence on the
Lebanese border exploded.
</P>
<P>
In other incidents, a soldier of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army and two Hezbollah guerrillas were killed.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, an Israeli commando unit killed two
Hezbollah guerrillas who were on their way out of the security zone
in an encounter in the zone's central sector. The soldiers waylaid
a Hezbollah squad in an ambush, and no one was hurt on the Israeli
side.

-- Panathinaikos Athens of Greece beat Maccabi Tel Aviv of
Israel by 73-61 in front of a crowd of adoring Greek fans in
Salonika, thus winning the European Basketball Championship League
final.
</P>
<P>
The loss ends a fantastic Maccabi season that put Israeli
basketball back on the map in Europe and rekindled interest at
home, causing fans to camp out overnight and pay six times face
value for tickets.
</P>
<P>
In Tel Aviv's Rabin Square, the shouts of thousands of fans that
gathered to watch the game on an enormous screen turned from
excitement and anticipation to disappointment. By the end of the
game the outcome was clear from the downcast face and quiet
grumbling of fans streaming out of the square.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani anti-narcotics

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Ruling Party Attacks Western Favor of Zanzibar Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's ruling party
Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) has accused the western countries of
interfering in the country's internal affairs by siding with the
trouble-making opposition party Civic United Front (CUF) in
Zanzibar, local media reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the CCM Central Committee, read by its
Secretary-General Phillip Mangula on Thursday, warned the western
countries to prepare to share the blame if the on-going unrest in
the spice islands ends in bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
The party also expressed its "shock and disappointment" at the
western countries' complaints that CCM and the Zanzibar
Revolutionary Government had failed to implement the
Commonwealth-brokered agreement with the CUF.
</P>
<P>
The statement was released during a CCM Central Committee
meeting held on Wednesday in Zanzibar and presided over by CCM
national chairman Benjamin Mkapa, who is also the president of the
east African country.
</P>
<P>
"The constant threats of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
and a nose for nose by the CUF will not be tolerated," Mangula
said at the CCM office in Dar es Salaam, accusing the West of
keeping silent even when the CUF provoked violence in a bid to
destroy bilateral understanding.
</P>
<P>
Mangula also played a video tape showing CUF leaders uttering
what he described as "dangerous words".
</P>
<P>
In the 10-minute tape, CUF Secretary-General Seif Shariff Hamad
was shown calling for a policy of "an aye for an eye" at a public
rally, and CUF Vice Chairman Shaaban Mloo urging his supporters
"not wait to be given machetes (a kind of farm chopper)".
</P>
<P>
Other CUF leaders also warned that a "bloody civil uprising"
could soon come into being in Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
According to Mangula, the CCM and the Zanzibar government last
week attempted to implement the agreement through a bill for
constitutional amendment through the House of Representatives, but
the move was blocked by CUF legislators.
</P>
<P>
Since January when the Zanzibar treason trial came for hearing,
Zanzibar has been frequently hit by riots as CUF supporters and
policemen were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the then Secretary-General of the Commonwealth
Secretariat, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, expressed his disappointment at
the failure of the CCM and the Zanzibar government to implement
the agreed memorandum.
</P>
<P>
On April 6, the European Union mission in Dar es Salaam issued
a statement pressuring the Tanzanian government to intervene in
the Zanzibar treason case before the October general elections.
</P>
<P>
"If the current situation in Zanzibar continues, this will have
a negative impact on the international community's perception of
human rights, good governance and democracy in the United Republic
of Tanzania," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On April 12, police in Zanzibar arrested more than 60 people in
 connection with the recent disturbance which involved
law-enforcers and the CUF members.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar Revolutionary Government has flatly rejected pleas
of amnesty for the 18 CUF activists facing treason charges.
</P>
<P>
The first arrests in the treason case were made at the end of
November 1997 on the eve of an important by-election in Mkunazini,
Zanzibar, which the CUF nevertheless won.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen CUF members and supporters were charged with sedition,
but the next month the charge was changed to conspiracy to commit
treason, which is a non-bailable offence and carries a mandatory
life or death sentence under Zanzibar laws.
</P>
<P>
Over the following months, four more CUF members were charged
with the same offence on allegations of conspiring to topple
Zanzibar President and the revolutionary government.
</P>
<P>
All the 18 treason suspects, who have been languishing in the
Kiinua Miguu prison for more than two years, had pleaded not
guilty to the treason charges.
</P>
<P>
The first hearing of the case was held on January 19 which saw
fierce clashes between police and rioters, with at least 29 people
including 14 policemen injured and hospitalized and some 40 others
arrested.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Cleans Up Illegal Firearms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
embarked on an operation to clean up illegal arms in townships all
over the country, the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa has directed police to
start a clean-up exercise in houses suspected to harbor illegal
firearms, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on Thursday, Machungwa said that his ministry
would use any method possible to recover firearms.
</P>
<P>
"If we suspect that some houses have illegal weapons, we will
conduct a search," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would not allow criminals to threaten
the resuscitation of the economy and the growth of democratic
principles and good governance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a pass-out parade for police recruits in
Lusaka, Machungwa said it was his ministry's intention to acquire
helicopters for the police to improve the ability and agility to
fight crime.
</P>
<P>
There could not be any meaningful economic investment in the
country if the safety of the investors and their investment were
not secured, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said policing in the country has become extremely dangerous
because criminals used military firearms against people.
</P>
<P>
He called on police officers to use all the necessary force to
deal with dangerous criminals while upholding the human rights of
citizens.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Kills 121 People in Southwest Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The dreaded highland malaria has
claimed 121 lives in southwest Kenya's Kissi District this year,
the East African Standard reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 12,128 people were diagnosed to be affected by the
epidemic in the area, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, Nyanza provincial officials denied that the situation
was deteriorating, saying that the efforts were under way to
prevent a large- scale disease outbreak.
</P>
<P>
About three weeks ago, the Kenyan government sounded out a
malaria alert for parts of Nyanza and Rift Valley provinces.
</P>
<P>
Malaria, one of the top killers in Africa, is a mosquito-borne
tropical endemic. So far there is no vaccine for the disease, but
international scientists believe that a small amount of money can
prevent the deaths from the disease.

<HEADLINE> Nikkei Index Plunges to 15-Week Closing Low in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The benchmark Nikkei index plunged
to a 15-week closing low in Tokyo Friday, hit by a selling spree
relating to next Monday's reshuffle of the index's components.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined 706.64 points, or 3.
73 percent, from Thursday's close to end at 18,252.68, the lowest
closing since January 7.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) which covers
all First Section issues, however, rose 5.12 points, or 0.31
percent, to 1,634.12.
</P>
<P>
The key index opened higher, helped by an upturn in high-priced
information and technology issues, but plunged rapidly in the
afternoon, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Issues to be removed from and to be included in the Nikkei
index drew both bargain-hunting and profit-taking following their
recent rapid movements, making the key index fluctuate violently
in the afternoon, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section expanded to 1,119.24 million
shares from Thursday's 692.06 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Several issues to be removed from the key index plunged to
record lows, while those to be added in the index hit record highs.
</P>
<P>
Information and high-tech issues were generally higher,
reflecting firmness on Wall Street and the U.S. dollar's advance
to the upper 105 yen range, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Retailers, chemical firms and brokerage houses remained firm,
while real estate firms, paper makers and rubber makers posted
large declines.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers far
outnumbered gainers 968 to 306, with 106 issues closing unchanged.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Technological Development Centers in Major Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China will build technological
development centers in all its key enterprises before the end of
the year, a Chinese official has pledged.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wanbin, deputy minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, made the promise during a recent national meeting on
techno-innovations in enterprises held in Nanning, capital of
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Wang explained the move is meant to promote technical progress
in Chinese enterprises and to upgrade industrial technology in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Only 221 Chinese enterprises now have state-certified
technological development centers, accounting for 74 percent of
the country's key enterprises, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the meeting agreed that creation of a
technological innovation information network will be the first
step in extending the new system to medium-sized and small
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The network will include a vast store of information on
scientific achievements as well as difficult technical problems in
enterprises, namelists of qualified personnel, and brand-name
commodities for sale.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2001, websites on techno-innovation information
will be opened in all the municipalities, provincial capitals, and
major cities in China, Wang added.

<HEADLINE> China's Life Insurance Sector Preparing for WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China will encourage its
insurers to offer more dividend-paying insurance options as part
of the effort to prepare the life insurance sector for the country
's anticipated entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Wu Xiaoping, Vice-Chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory
Commission, said that China's life insurance sector is expecting
fierce competition from overseas insurance companies after the
country enters the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The most pressing task facing the domestic life insurance
sector now is to sharpen its international competitiveness by
improving management and providing better service, Wu said at the
ongoing International Forum on the Management and Development of
China's Life Insurance here in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance sector has maintained an annual average
growth rate of nearly 40 percent since the country resumed
insurance business in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Last year the sector reported a premium income of 139.3 billion
yuan (about 17 billion U.S. dollars), 62.6 percent of which came
from life insurance.
</P>
<P>
However, Wu said, the Chinese insurance market has witnessed a
slow-down in growth since last year.
</P>
<P>
"The insurance sector is at the critical stage of a shift from
those traditional insurance products which are somewhat similar to
saving deposits, " Wu said, stressing that the shift requires a
change in business concept and an overall improvement in
management.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, insurance products that enable policy-holders
to share insurers' profits by offering dividends are now
dominating the insurance market in some developed countries like
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Australia Forgives Poor Countries Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said here Friday that Australia would forgive all
10.71 million U.S. dollars of debts owed by Nicaragua and Ethiopia,
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
It was an answer to a World Bank/International Monetary Fund
initiative, Downer said.
</P>
<P>
of the 40 third world countries identified for relief, only the
two owed debts to Australia, separately 3.39 million and 7.497
million dollars, related mainly to machinery supplied by private
sector firms.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why the bilateral debt Australia is owed is
considerably less than the major industrial economies, Downer and
Treasurer Peter Costello said Australia had only a small
proportion of debt owed by poorer countries, because the
government mainly supplied funds to the Third World in the form of
grants.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
ranked last December Australia at the low end of the organization'
s list of aid donor nations.
</P>
<P>
According to the OECD, the percentage of Australian GNP devoted
to aid dropped to 0.27 percent and this is well below the United
Nation's target of 0.7 percent and also below the OECD average of
0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> African Leaders to Meet Over Zimbabwe's Land Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
will meet Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, Namibian
President Sam Nujoma and South African President Thabo Mbeki over
the situation prevailing in the country regarding the land issue.
</P>
<P>
The four leaders are expected to meet in Zimbabwe on Friday
after a summit of the belligerents in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) in the resort town of Victoria Falls.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Presidential Spokesman George Charamba Thursday said
Mbeki and Chissano had been approached by the British government
to help restore communication between Harare and London following
differences over land, which have seen Zimbabwean war veterans
occupy nearly 1,000 white-owned farms countrywide.
</P>
<P>
"What the president has decided to do is to brief his
colleagues," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Violence has broken out at some of the farms, resulting in the
death of two white farmers, while several war veterans have been
injured or are missing.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the war veterans and the white commercial
farmers met on Wednesday in an effort to quell the violence,
resolve their differences and find an amicable solution to the
problem. They are expected to meet again next week.
</P>
<P>
The differences between Britain and Zimbabwe over the land
issue worsened after the Parliament of Zimbabwe recently passed
the Constitutional Amendment Bill, which empowers the government
to compulsorily acquire land and compel the British government to
pay compensation.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has offered to help narrow
the differences between Zimbabwe and its former colonial master
Britain over the land issue.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo brokered a meeting between Mugabe and British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook on the sidelines of the European Union
(EU)-Africa summit in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader, through his Foreign Minister Sule Lamido,
sent a special message for Mugabe concerning the land issue on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe is also expected to host an informal meeting on the DRC,
which is to be attended by Nujoma, Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan President
Paul Kagame in Victoria Falls, Charamba said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the leaders are expected to work
out a plan for the pull-out of foreign forces in the DRC after the
arrival of 5,000 U. N. peacekeeping forces that are expected to be
deployed around mid-year.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have troops fighting alongside the
DRC army against those from Rwanda and Uganda who are supporting
rebels trying to topple the government of DRC President Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
During the recent EU-Africa summit in Cairo, Museveni asked
Mugabe to invite all the belligerents in the DRC to meet to work
out and agree on a timetable for the pull-out, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"It is an informal meeting and whatever deliberations from the
meeting will then be formally presented to Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba as Chairman of the DRC peace process," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Coffee Prices Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's coffee prices were firm
at this week's auction in the capital Nairobi although poorer
qualities were sold at lower prices, the East African Standard
newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The market was a little quiet with reduced activity at the
Tuesday auction because of Easter, traders said.
</P>
<P>
At the auction, AA grade fetched 95 to 199 U.S. dollars per
50-kilogram bag from 97 to 177 U.S. dollars last week and PB
grade sold at 81 to 130 U. S. dollars per bag compared with 89 to
121 U.S. dollars last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, AB grade was sold at 65 to 151 U.S. dollars per bag
from 69 to 140 U.S. dollars last week and T grade eased to 38 to
79 U.S. dollars per bag from 54 to 80 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi Coffee Exchange said it sold 40,273 bags of coffee
out of the 40,855 bags offered for sale, adding that it will
offer over 40,000 bags at the auction to be held next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that coffee production in Nyeri District in
central Kenya, one of the country's major coffee producers, has
increased to 62 million kilograms as against the previous season's
35.1 million kilograms, a record increase of 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
Favorable weather conditions and availability of farm inputs
were the major forces behind the improved coffee production, local
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Government Fails to Spur Cotton Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Despite efforts taken by
the Tanzanian government to simulate cotton development, the
production of this major cash crop in the east African country has
been declining, the Business Times reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cotton output in this season has dropped to 200,000 bales,
while that in 1997/98 and 1998/99 seasons were 379,087 bales and
201,400 bales respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania Cotton Lint and Seeds Board had estimated to
export about 250,000 bales this season. However, due to the low
production this season, that target cannot be attained, leaving a
shortfall of about 50,000 bales, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives said the decline
in cotton production is associated with many factors including the
poor agricultural inputs due to the low purchasing power of
farmers.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to arrest the decline, the government directed the
cotton board to introduce a development fund to help farmers solve
money problems.
</P>
<P>
Money for the fund is to be drawn from cotton buyers within and
outside the country. Exporters are supposed to contribute to the
fund before exporting the commodity, while internal buyers make
monthly contributions.
</P>
<P>
However, the money being paid by the fund to farmers cannot
offset their production costs, the newspaper said.

HARARE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- There has been a vast improvement
in the supply of petrol and diesel in Zimbabwe over the past two
weeks, with rationing coming to an end and queues disappearing at
most service stations, the daily Herald reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry is making every effort to ensure that there
will be adequate fuel supplies over the Easter holiday period,
especially in key tourism areas, said Spokesman for the oil
industry Tom Walter on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Motorists also reported that the fuel supply situation was
pleasing and would assure a good Easter holiday.
</P>
<P>
An attendant at a service station in Harare said fuel supplies
were now stable, most service stations continued to receive steady
deliveries of petrol and diesel.
</P>
<P>
Paraffin supplies are, however, still limited and stocking
service stations are failing to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
According to Walter, the fuel supply situation is expected to
improve steadily over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has been facing serious oil crisis since last

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Reports 23-Percent Profit Growth Despite Light PC Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp., already
embattled in an antitrust case with the federal government and 19
states, Thursday reported a 23-percent profit growth for its third
quarter, according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
That profit beats Wall Street estimates by 2 cents a share
despite what the world's biggest software company said was light
demand for business PCs in the period.
</P>
<P>
The Redmond, Washington-based giant said net profits for the
three months ending March 31 rose to 2.39 billion U.S. dollars, or
43 cents a share, compared to 1.91 billion dollars, or 35 cents a
share, in the same quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The company, which makes the Windows operating system found on
about 80 percent of personal computers, had been expected to earn
41 cents a share, according to consensus analyst estimates
compiled by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
Revenues for the three months rose to 5.66 billion dollars from
4.6 billion dollars a year earlier, but the company said sales to
computer makers were hit by a slowdown in demand for business PCs
early in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
Geographically, Microsoft saw the strongest improvement in Asia,
where an economic recovery powered 44-percent growth in sales, to
709 million dollars. Sales in the South Pacific and Americas
region grew 32 percent to 2.02 billion dollars while in Europe,
the Middle East and Africa rose 28 percent to 1.26 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This is pretty weak," said J.P. Morgan analyst William
Epifanio. "I expected much higher sales than this, even with the Y
2K bug effects in the last quarter."
</P>
<P>
Epifanio and other analysts say the new Windows 2000 operating
system, designed for corporate networks and work stations, will
help boost sales in the company's fiscal year 2001, which starts
July 1. Windows 2000 was introduced February 17, though most
corporations who might purchase it will take their time in testing
and installing the new software.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft shares were hit hard this month after a federal
judge's antitrust ruling against the company on April 3. U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft
violated antitrust law by illegally using its monopoly power. The
case stemmed from a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department and 19
states.
</P>
<P>
Since March 31, when the stock closed at 106.25 dollars,
Microsoft has plummeted more than 25 percent, contributing to a
major market selloff and investor uncertainty that continues to
linger.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Korea Institute for Industrial
Economics and Trade has readjusted South Korea's gross national
product (GDP) growth for this year up to 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a report issued Friday, the government-run think tank said
it raised the GDP growth up by 0.8 percentage points from its
original projection of 6.5 percent based on recovery in domestic
consumption and booming exports along with inventory buildup.
</P>
<P>
It also forecast growth of 6.4 percent in private consumption
and a rise of 5.6 percent in consumption expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Fixed investment is expected to grow 26.7 percent due to
improved corporate financial structure, booming exports and
increasing new venture businesses.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, exports are projected to expand 22.7 percent
to 176.3 billion U.S. dollars and imports 38.2 percent to 165.5
billion dollars with a trade surplus of 10.8 billion dollars,
which is down from original 13.9 billion.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will host a week-long
medical information drive to mark World Asthma Day, which falls on
May 3.

patients, an open-air fair providing consultations on asthma
control, and a medical training program on treating asthma.
</P>
<P>
The city established an asthma control society in 1992 which
now has more than 4,000 members, including 1,000 doctors and 3,000
patients.
</P>
<P>
About 150 million people worldwide suffer from asthma, a common

<P>
There are 500,000 asthma sufferers in China, 2.5 percent of
whom are below the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
Many people are stuck with asthma because they do not insist on
proper treatment, and therefore fail to find a complete cure. But
experts say the disease can be controlled with proper treatment.

<HEADLINE> Heart Bypass Surgery On-Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Web surfers can now watch the
entire heart bypass surgery operation performed at the Fuwai
Hospital attached to the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences,
China's top cardiovascular surgery hospital .
</P>
<P>
This will be the first live on-line telecast of heart bypass
surgery in China.
</P>
<P>
Lin Kejian, a 57-year-old retired worker from Beijing's
suburban Shunyi District, will be the patient undergoing the three
to four hours heart bypass procedure.
</P>
<P>
Lin suffered three heart attacks in the past six months, and
doctors at Fuwai Hospital say heart bypass surgery is the best
treatment for him.
</P>
<P>
Wu Qingyu, vice president of the hospital who will perform the
surgery, said that by accessing: www.cctv.com or www.bta.net.cn,
Internet users can learn more details about heart disease.
</P>
<P>
Today's Beijing Daily quoted the doctor as saying that coronary
heart disease has become the number one killer in the world, and
it is especially a threat to older people. However, prevention
and early treatment of the disease can help save lives.
</P>
<P>
He said that many people do not know much about cardiac surgery,
and are afraid of undergoing the operation because they believe it
is risky and very expensive.
</P>
<P>
Wu added that some patients miss the crucial time to undergoing
cardiac surgery, sometimes with fatal consequences.
</P>
<P>
He said coronary artery bypassing surgery is now a routine
procedure at his hospital, and the success rate has reached 99
percent.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he himself has performed some 700 coronary artery
bypass operations, once conducting three in one day.
</P>
<P>
Fuwai Hospital also has a telephone hotline for those who want
to ask questions about this operation. The phone numbers are

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Enhances Sewage Disposal to Curb Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province is making efforts to build sewage processing plants in
order to reduce the pollution of the rivers and the sea.
</P>
<P>
Du Qiugen, director of the Liaoning Provincial Environmental
Protection Bureau, said the province has planned 12 sewage
disposal plants, including three which have been completed, three
under construction, and six to be built.
</P>
<P>
The three sewage plants, completed in northern and southern
Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province, and in the city of Anshan
City, are now in trial operation.
</P>
<P>
According to Du, the designed daily sewage disposal capacity of
the 12 sewage plants in the eight cities is 2.8 million tons,
accounting for 75 percent of the total sewage daily discharged
there.
</P>
<P>
As an industrial base, Liaoning has a heavy task in curbing
pollution. The Liaohe River, running through eight cities in
Liaoning, has been seriously polluted by sewage discharged by the
cities.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Liaoning allocated seven million yuan for
preparation work on the construction of the sewage plants, and
plans to get more than 300 million yuan from state bond for their
construction.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, Liaoning will begin the construction
of seven other sewage disposal projects aimed at processing more
than 60 percent of the sewage now discharged into the Liaohe River.

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Enact Inheritance Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China is now ready to enact the
inheritance tax, a senior tax expert said here today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy director of the Taxation Science Research Institute
under the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) Liu Zuo told
Xinhua that the time is ripe to start collecting inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
From the founding of New China in 1949 until 1990, China twice
introduced the inheritance tax, but failed to actually collect it.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that things have changed greatly over the past decade
with rapid economic growth, and the per capita income of the
Chinese people is now more than 20 times of that of 40 years ago.
The gap of income disparity has also widened. Some 20 percent of
the population now holds more than 80 percent of all savings
deposits in the country.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the current economic situation also requires
that the government narrow the gap between rich and poor in order
to maintain social stability and stimulate consumption.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the inheritance tax is to curb the excessive growth
of wealth among a small group of individuals, re-distribute social
wealth, and increase fiscal revenues.
</P>
<P>
Since the awareness of taxation is growing in China, the
revenue from individual income tax also has been growing at a
double-digit rate over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In order to create sound conditions for levying the inheritance
tax, the government has imposed real name requirements on bank
savings accounts, and is developing a standardized notary system.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that only the richest one to three percent of the
population will be subject to the tax, and the taxable part of an
individual's inheritance will include both movable and immovable
assets. The rate of this inheritance tax may be as high as 50
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that income tax, property tax, and inheritance tax all
will become important leverages in the governments attempt to
adjust individual incomes.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks Report Lower Losses, Small Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Thai banks are reporting lower
net losses and small profits for the first quarter as banking
analysts predict brighter prospects for the whole sector this year,
local newspaper the Nation reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Leading the turnaround is Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), which
reported a first quarter net profit of 609 million baht (16.24
million U.S. dollars) against a loss of 222.4 million baht (5.93
million dollars) in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
It was the third consecutive quarter that the bank has been
profitable.
</P>
<P>
The result did not surprise analysts because the bank has
already set aside full provisions for loan losses.
</P>
<P>
The net profit mainly came from an increase in net interest and
dividend income, which the bank attributed to its debt
restructuring and the settlement of problem loans.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Asia also reported 211.27 million baht (5.6 million
dollars) net profits in the first quarter, compared with a loss of
175.63 million baht (4.68 million dollars) in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
DBS Thai Danu Bank announced a drop in net losses in the first
quarter to 174.7 million baht (4.65 million dollars) compared to a
loss of 347.3 million baht (9.98 million dollars) in the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Standard Chartered Nakornthon Bank also showed a much improved
first quarter result, with net losses down sharply from 410.73
million baht (10.95 million dollars) in the first quarter of last
year to 165.21 million baht (4.4 million dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Bangkok Bank, the country's largest commercial bank,
is expected to post further losses due to heavy loan provisioning
last month.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Arafat Hold Talks on Mideast Peace  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
Thursday he hoped Israel and the Palestinians could bridge their
differences so that a framework accord could be reached in May,
thus smoothing the way toward a final agreement in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders held a three-hour meeting at the White House
and Washington will take on "a more intensified role" at the
request of the Israeli and Palestinian leaders, according to a
White House official.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will
resume peace talks on the Middle East later this month. The last
round of talks ended last weekend at Bolling Air Force Base near
Washington without any progress on narrowing gaps over a series of
issues like borders, Jerusalem, refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Before his talks with Arafat, Clinton told reporters at the
White House that he noted the "risks and difficulties" for a final
peace agreement between the two sides, but said he hoped they
could be bridged.
</P>
<P>
he said the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations "reached a very
serious time in the peace process," and he would work hard along
with Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
"He and Prime Minister Ehud Barak have set for themselves an
ambitious timetable to reach a framework agreement as soon as they
can and then a final agreement by the middle of September. so we
are working hard on it, and I think we'll get some things done
today," Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this afternoon, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
met Arafat at her Georgetown residence. State Department spokesman
James Rubin did not disclose anything about their discussions at a
regular briefing, saying he was not aware of any new U.S. ideas
being presented, but he did not rule out the possibility of "
creative suggestions" at some points.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that the United States was prepared to play a more
active role in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations as the
September deadline for a final status agreement was drawing nearer.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is agreed that we will play a more involved role by
being at the table, trying to be creative, trying to help each
side figure out what its needs are," Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would do whatever he could to help bridge the
gap between Israel and the Palestinians over a series of issues,
like the borders, Jerusalem, refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Bill Clinton
wanted to use the face-to-face talks to make sure what Washington
could do to help Israeli-Palestinian negotiations move toward a
framework agreement and then a final status agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I think the president thought it would be useful and effective
to use this time to meet directly to see what we can do to keep
these (talks) on track," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Clinton held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Barak
to try to renew momentum in the negotiations between Israel and
the Palestinians as the target date for a framework agreement in
May was drawing nearer while gaps still remained wide between the
two parties.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said both Israel and the Palestinians were facing very
difficult issues, saying that "they have a very tight time line."
</P>
<P>
The second round of Bolling Air Force Base negotiations between
Israeli and the Palestinian delegations ended last weekend with an
exchange of position papers on the framework agreement but no
evidence of substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say that Washington is trying to help bridge the
gaps but it has not reached the stage of proposing compromises.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said Monday that he would take some "positive ideas" to
the White House, and considered his trip to Washington "a crucial
and basic step to push the peace process forward."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian cabinet minister Hassan Asfour Tuesday held out
little hope for a breakthrough when Arafat met Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing new to add, he said. "There is no place for
more flexibility. We were the party which made a historical
concession in 1993 and not the Israelis."
</P>
<P>
The year of 1993 was the year of the Oslo accords between
Israel and the PLO.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar newspaper Calls for Measures in Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Official newspaper The New Light
of Myanmar Friday called for taking remedial measures in the trade
sector for the betterment of Myanmar's economy after Asian nations
including Myanmar were hit by the economic turmoil which began in
mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
"Myanmar's foreign trade was also affected to a certain degree.
Another factor is the imposing of economic sanctions on Myanmar by
some big Western nations which led to blockades in national
economic progress," the paper said in an article.
</P>
<P>
The paper suggested some remedial measures to be taken for the
purpose which include: to pave way for the national entrepreneurs
to extend business and for the state to receive the tax revenues
as projected, to publicly announce the trade rules and procedures,
to effectively render services, to conduct organizational reforms
and work efficiency courses to bring about skilled personnel in
the services; to reform current trade laws.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's foreign trade,
including the border trade, amounted to 3.5889 billion U.S.
dollars in 1999, falling by 8.98 percent compared with 1998.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Asks U.S. to Extradite Ex-premier for Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine expects the United States to
extradite former prime minister Pavel Lazarenko as soon as
possible to face criminal investigations, said Ukrainian
Prosecutor-General Mikhail Potebeniko Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the presidential committee for
fighting corruption and organized crime, Potebeniko said that
Ukraine had received guarantee from U.S. to bring back Lazarenko,
who was accused by the country's procuratorate on charge of money-
laundering, abusing power and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko would be extradited via Switzerland if U.S. couldn't
extradite him directly to Ukraine, the Prosecutor-General said.
</P>
<P>
Potebeniko also denied west media reports that Ukraine didn't
want Lazarenko back after he was detained by U.S. police in April
last year.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko, 45, led Ukraine's government in 1996-97. He is

and illegally stashing about 4 million dollars in a Swiss bank
between 1993 and 1997.

In February 1999, Lazarenko fled to the United States and
applied for political asylum after being stripped of his
legislative immunity and served with an arrest warrant at home.

<HEADLINE> China Hastens Three Gorges Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The government of Chongqing has
decided to invest 45 billion yuan (5.4 billion U.S. dollars) to
build a highway network in upcoming four or five year.
</P>
<P>
Half of the highway network will cover the dam areas of the
Three Gorges Water-Control Project.
</P>
<P>
Relocation of residents living in the dam areas is part of the
smooth construction of the gigantic Three Gorges Power Project,
the largest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
As the construction of Three Gorges Dam has entered the second
stage, about 100,000 residents are required to move out of the dam
areas in each of the next 10 years. Shanghai and 10 provinces in
eastern China promise to receive the settlement of 70,000 migrants.
</P>
<P>
To help ensure the relocated people's life and production, the
building of more than 15 million sq. m. of houses is underway,
along with the construction of 684 km of roads, 2,260 km of power
transmission lines and 3,312 km of telecommunications lines.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government of Chongqing invested 400 million
yuan (48.1 million U.S. dollars) to build 820 km of roads linking
resettlement villages with the municipal highway network. New
roads with a total length of 350 km will be built this year. A
highway network connecting all the resettlement villages is
expected to be set up by 2001, said Li Jian, deputy director of
the Chongqing Municipal Communications Department.
</P>
<P>
As 164 primary and secondary schools at six counties in Wanzhou
Prefecture will be submerged during the second phase of the dam
construction, the local government will allocate 500 million yuan
(60 million U.S. dollars) to move 88 schools to other parts of the
prefecture this year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Wanzhou has moved 91 schools, 60 newly built schools
have been put to use. Relocation of schools have cost the
government a total of 250 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion of the gigantic Three Gorges Project in 2009,
over 1.3 million residents shall have been resettled, including
those from Hubei Province and Chongqing Municipality.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Enterprises Explore Overseas Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the end of 1998, 43 enterprises from the Chinese mainland
had taken in a total of 10 billion US dollars through listing on
overseas stock markets.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding performance of these enterprises has attracted
more and more foreign stock exchanges to invite Chinese
enterprises to become listed.
</P>
<P>
After a Shanghai seminar in 1998 about listing Chinese
enterprises on the Singapore Stock Exchange, eight Chinese
enterprises were listed on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
These overseas financial activities have greatly improved the
companies' capital structures and have connected them with the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Since the Asian financial crisis, the Chinese government has
utilized overseas processing trade and investment as effective
methods for increasing the exports of raw and processed materials,
components and parts, and machinery equipment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the General Office of the State Council announced
that those overseas Chinese enterprises which use materials made
in China will enjoy favorable policies in export rebates, foreign
exchange management, and financial services.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has already given approval to 50
competitive domestic enterprises to invest in overseas markets.
These businesses account for a combined investment of 40 million
US dollars in the areas of household electrical appliances, light
industry, pharmaceuticals, electro-mechanical products, and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
Their major target markets include Asian countries, the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and Eastern Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A number of Chinese enterprises
now have begun multinational operations, according to Financial
News.
</P>
<P>
Household electrical appliance manufacturers, who were among
the earliest to import foreign technology, have also become the
first to enter international investment projects.
</P>
<P>
China's household electrical appliance production capacity has
expanded dramatically since 1990, but the domestic market for
these products has long been stagnant.
</P>
<P>
To explore new markets, many of these companies have set up
factories in overseas.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen Konka Electronic Group Co. Ltd., for one, has taken
the first step toward establishing a color television assembly
factory in India. The new factory will have an annual capacity of
300,000 TV sets with components made in China.
</P>
<P>
The Changhong Electronics Group Corporation has collaborated
with Russian counterparts to establish a television assembly
factory in the outskirts of Moscow which will produce three
million TV sets a year for the Russian and Eastern European
markets.
</P>
<P>
The Qingdao Haier Refrigerator Co., Ltd. invested 30 million US
dollars in a South Carolina, U.S.A. refrigerator factory with a
current production capacity of some 200,000 refrigerators a year.
When the whole project is in full operation, output is expected to
reach 500,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Haier has also established refrigerator and washing machine
factory in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the Qingdao Beer Company Limited became the first
Chinese mainland enterprise to be listed on an overseas exchange,
the Hongkong Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> New Bright Spots Appears in China's FDI (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- New bright spots have appeared in
China's use of foreign direct investments (FDI), according to the
latest issue of Outlook, the country's most authoritative news
weekly.
</P>
<P>
The April 24 issue of the magazine said that over the past two
years, foreign direct investments in China have been on a decline
because of changes in the domestic economy and the lingering
impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, foreign direct investment in China stood at 40.4
billion U.S. dollars, down 11.4 percent from the previous year,
the first negative growth of FDI in China for several years.
</P>
<P>
However, changes now have taken place in both China and the
world. In China, the pace of entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) has quickened, and the strategy of developing
the vast western region is underway.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the global economy is witnessing a noticeable
recovery trend, and U.S. and European investors have begun once
again to show keen interest in investing in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, "new bright spots" have appeared in
China's use of FDI, which has also entered into a new phase of
development, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
One of the bright spots is large multinationals increasing
their investment in China, according to the news weekly.

<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics show that to date more than 400 of the world's 500
biggest multinationals are operating in China, engaged in
businesses ranging from machinery, electronics, chemicals, and
building materials to telecommunications, medicine, and food.
</P>
<P>
Before deciding to invest in China, multinationals usually make
a thorough investigation of the local investment environment. Once
decided, they sweep in and try to occupy as much of the market as
possible, and are disinclined to withdraw when minor changes occur
in the country, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Many multinationals have also moved their overseas headquarters
to China, and currently, China hosts over 100 multinational
regional headquarters.
</P>
<P>
One of these is Alcatel SA of France, which moved its Asia-
Pacific headquarters to Shanghai early this year. The
telecommunications equipment supplier now has 17 joint ventures
and 4 wholly owned businesses in China.
</P>
<P>
Also, Chinese companies have showed an enthusiasm to list on
overseas markets, especially those companies related to the new
information economy. China.dom.com, Netease, Sohu, Homeway, and
8848 all have been listed or are preparing to be listed on the U.S.
's NASDAQ, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
And many domestic companies are or are about to be listed in
the growth enterprises market in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The magazine noted that the Chinese government should remain
aware of the general trend of FDI in the country and take measures
that will best benefit the overall economy.

<HEADLINE> New e-Wave Bringing about Wireless Information  Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A new e-wave is bringing about
the much-expected wireless information society driven by the
greater convergence of communications and information technologies.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Economic Development Board Chairman Philip Yeo has
recently said that "communications industry itself envisions a
world with seamless wireless connection, with access to
information anywhere, anytime."
</P>
<P>
He said wireless technology infrastructure and wireless
content are two key factors that drive the growth of wireless
business and the development of solutions and services will help
deliver both the contents and the infrastructure to form a
wireless information society.
</P>
<P>
Rapid proliferation of mobile phones as well as other hand-
held devices like personal assistants (PDAs) and quick adoption of
new technologies that allows handphones to access the Internet is
greatly boosting the potential in the wireless market and setting
off a new upsurge of e-wave.
</P>
<P>
Handphone users have outstripped personal computer users by
450 million to 150 million globally and recent studies have
projected that the number of global mobile users will reach one
billion by 2003, a figure testifying to the prediction that there
will be more non-PC devices accessing the Internet than PCs by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, there are some 1.4 million mobile-phone users
out of its 3.8 million residents.
</P>
<P>
Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) technology, as the key
technology cornerstones, is a quick solution to the tricky
challenge of bringing together two very hot trends -- wireless and
Internet, which has opened the way into the future.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Business Times reported recently that more than 15
percent of handphones sold globally will be Net-ready this year
and by 2003 all handphones, PDAs and other pocket-sized electronic
devices are expected to access the Internet as a standard
functions.
</P>
<P>
Reports said wireless device users accessing the internet are
expected to increase a whopping 700 percent from 7.4 million in
1999 to 61.5 million by 2003 in the U.S. alone.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are seen seething across the world to get ready for
next e-wave: m-commerce which is e-commerce that is done over
mobile phones and other hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
Specialists have predicted that even before conventional e-
commerce can rise to its full potential, m-commerce will take the
central stage in the e-commerce businesses.
</P>
<P>
While some estimates have put global mobile related revenue at
10 billion U.S. dollars in 2003, Andersen Consulting projects
global m-commerce revenue to leap quadruple from 12.7 billion U.S.
dollars this year to 55.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2003 to 55.4
billion U.S. dollars by that year.
</P>
<P>
Fierce competition in wireless mobile sector looms large across
the world as world players are already at the starting blocks for
new e-wave race.
</P>
<P>
Oracle and Motorola have joined hands to form a venture that
seeks to cash in the explosive growth of wireless devices as well
as high evaluations now given to wireless business on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based Cap Gemini, one of the world's major
information technology providers, has launched its first multi-
million dollar global wireless Internet center in Asia and its
Singapore-based Asian-Pacific headquarters aims to become a
globally recognized center of excellence in developing key
technologies that enable mobile services and solutions based on
industry standard platform, .
</P>
<P>
It is clear that wireless "web" services will become a
dominant ecosystem in an increasingly networked and knowledge-
based society.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Use Biologic Method to Kill Cotton Aphid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed
a biologic method to prevent and kill cotton aphid so as to
guarantee cotton production and promote the development of animal
husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Ecological and Geological Research
Institute of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, affiliated with the
China Academy of Sciences, built belts of clover around the cotton
fields for the purpose to kill aphids.
</P>
<P>
Clover is the parasitic body for ladybugs and stink flies, both
are natural enemies of cotton aphids.
</P>
<P>
Cutting the clover at the time when the cotton aphids reach the
biggest number, the number of aphids is reduced by 97 percent from
70,000 to 2,000 head per mu (0.066 hectares), while the number of
ladybugs and stink flies increase by 19 times from 50 to almost 1,
000 head per mu.
</P>
<P>
As clover is also a kind of high-quality forage, large-scale
planting of clover has helped develop animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
If Xinjiang plants some 1.5 million mu (100,000 hectares) of
clover, or one-tenth of the total area of cotton fields, the
region can produce 1.5 million tons of dry forage and 1.5 billion
yuan (180 million U.S. dollars) of output value annually,
according to experts' calculation.

<HEADLINE> China to Streamline Textbooks, Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education will
streamline textbooks and simplify exams to reduce the homework of
senior middle school students while focusing the quality of
education on how children can apply knowledge, an official
announced yesterday.
</P>
<P>
To update senior middle school curricula and make students more
well rounded, 10 provinces and municipalities will try new
teaching approaches this fall term, "China Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
Textbooks and teaching methods will be changed to cater to a
reform of college entrance examinations. Many Chinese schools have
long practiced exam-oriented teaching methods and piled on
homework because higher exam grades confer honors and promotions
on teachers.
</P>
<P>
Li Lianning, director of the ministry's Department for Basic
Education, said the new teaching plans will help improve
instruction in the 12 compulsory subjects: politics, the Chinese
language, foreign languages, mathematics, physics, chemistry,
biology, history, geography, information technology, sports and
the arts.
</P>
<P>
The plans would phase out the use of rote textbook-based
memorization and combine it with practical skills such as
community services and academic experiments.
</P>
<P>
Outdated and overly complicated contents in the 12 subjects
will be removed from the curriculum to help reduce homework, said
Li.
</P>
<P>
Today, some schools grade students according to their exam
marks, and statistics indicate that about 70 percent of middle
school students are anxious about being graded after exams.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has called on senior middle schools, which used to
give many preparatory tests for college entrance examinations, to
reduce these tests to ease students' mental stress, Li said. The
annual entrance examinations once focused on testing students on
their memorization of texts.
</P>
<P>
College entrance examinations will be gradually rewritten to
emphasize comprehensive skills, such as flexibly using classroom
knowledge to solve social and daily life problems, said Zheng
Zengyi, an official with the ministry's Department for Senior
Middle School Affairs.
</P>
<P>
To help low-income children afford education, the ministry and
the State Press and Publication Administration have decided to
provide cheaper black and white textbooks for primary and middle
school students in poor areas, said Li.
</P>
<P>
China introduced color textbooks to primary and middle schools
in the 1980s, says the paper.

<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- West Ham star Joe Cole has
fractured his right leg - ending his hopes of a place in England's
Euro 2000 squad.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old was at first thought to have suffered just bad
bruising after a challenge in the Hammers' 2-1 win at Derby on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But Cole has been in pain since and was sent for a further scan
which indicated the fracture.
</P>
<P>
The news ends England coach Kevin Keegan's hopes that Cole
would break into the senior squad in time for June's European
championships. He had already been selected for Under-21 duty.
</P>
<P>
West Ham boss Harry Redknapp said: "I'm sorry to say Euro 2000
is now out of the window for him - this is a terrible blow for Joe
and the club. No one wants to lose a huge talent like his.
</P>
<P>
"We all feel for young Joe and I can assure you we will do all
we can to look after him until he is on his feet again and back in
action. But he is only 18 and there will be plenty more
championships for him to get involved in as an England player," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Fulham to Launch pro Women's Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- English fist division football
club Fulham has announced it is to launch England's first
professional women's team - with a built-in maternity clause.
</P>
<P>
The club has offered fixed-term contracts to a number of women
which include a provision for time off to have a baby.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian international midfielder Margunn Haugenes has already
been lured to the club, owned by Harrods boss Mohamed al-Fayed.
</P>
<P>
When the team is complete, the number of squad members will top
16 and is expected to be up and running for the 2000/2001 season.
</P>
<P>
The women will train most weekday afternoons at the club's
Motspur Park ground and will receive similar benefits to the men's
First Team, including health insurance.
</P>
<P>
Club chairman al-Fayed said: "After seeing some of the Women's
World Cup competition last summer in America, I realized the
tremendous potential of women's football.
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope that Fulham Football Club can play a part in
building opportunities for women to play professional football in
this country and in time enhance its profile," he said.
</P>
<P>
Women's amateur teams have been raising their profile in recent
years, and the Women's FA Cup final is now televised.
</P>
<P>
Last year's winners Arsenal Ladies will surrender their title
this year to either legendary women's team Doncaster Belles or
1998
finalists Croydon.
</P>
<P>
The two teams contest the final on 1 May at Sheffield United's
Bramhall Lane ground.
</P>
<P>
Mick McGuire, assistant chief executive of The Professional
Footballers' Association, backed the move.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We have always supported ladies' football and are
happy to offer them exactly the same benefits and support as our
current members. We are keen to enhance what is already a growing
industry and we welcome them on board."
</P>
<P>
Kelly Simmons, the Football Association's women's game co-
ordinator, added: "We think it's fantastic that Fulham are taking
the lead and being the first club to support a women's
professional team. It ties in very nicely with the FA's strategy
to establish a women's professional league within the next three
years and we hope other clubs will look to Fulham and follow suit.

LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Leeds United are out of the UEFA
Cup after a 2-2 draw against Galatasaray in the semi-final at
Elland Road on Thursday.

Trailing 2-0 from the first leg, the home side fell behind to a

<HEADLINE> Turkish President OKs Anti-Inflation Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
signed an anti-inflation document here on Friday, saying the
protracted high inflation is "the root cause for all evils and
discomfort in the country."
</P>
<P>
The document was prepared by Turkish Union of Chambers and
Commodities Exchanges (TOBB) and the Turkish Exporters' Assembly
(TIM) within the framework of their "Turkey is Defeating
Inflation " campaign, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Demirel asserted that the anti-inflation struggle should be
above party politics, saying that no matter what party comes to
power, the Turkish people's No. 1 problem is always to cope with
the high cost of living.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the president said, all countries' economic
programs aim to raise lower-class people to middle class and lift
middle class to upper class.
</P>
<P>
However, inflation creates the opposite effect, destroying the
middle class and widening the class gap, he said, adding "inflation
enlarges the lower and upper classes."
</P>
<P>
According to the TOBB-TIM document signed by Demirel, Turkey can
hardly sustain its economic and social development with the
country's two-digital annual inflation rate continuing.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the government embarked on a three-year structural
adjustment and stabilization program, aimed primarily at curbing
chronic inflation while ensuring a sustainable growth in output.
</P>
<P>
The program envisages cutting the inflation rate to 10 percent
by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Economy Recep Onal said in his speech at the
signing ceremony that the momentum gained in the structural reform
will be resolutely and decisively maintained by the government.
</P>
<P>
However, he called on the people to give full support to the
government's anti-inflation program on a long-term basis.

He suggested establishing a cooperative link between museums of
different countries and swapping historical belongings, of which
there were duplicates, as presents. This, he said, could be a
measure to check the trend of smuggling.
</P>
<P>
"We should try to legalize purchasing those historical
belongings for which there exist duplicates and let the collectors
sell their collections to others," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Russia's Ratification of Nuclear Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told a briefing that Russia'
s ratification of the treaty is "an important step. We welcome
that. "
</P>
<P>
Lockhart and State Department spokesman James Rubin both
defended the U.S. "leadership" in arms control although the treaty
was rejected by the U.S. Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
"I think that we work very closely around the world, and the
United States' leadership on arms control, nonproliferation is
unparalleled, and we look forward to working with the new Russian
government on a whole series of arms control issues," Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said it is the U.S. efforts that led to the signing of
the CTBT. "It was the United States that led the way in signing
the comprehensive test ban and pushing for its negotiation and
ultimately its agreement. So I think we feel quite confident that
it was our leadership that helped," Rubin told a briefing at the
State Department.
</P>
<P>
Both Rubin and Lockhart stressed that the U.S. government will
continue its efforts to persuade the Senate to ratify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that as time goes on and we are able to make our case
to the Senate, our Senate will follow the lead of many other
countries around the world and ratify an important treaty,"
Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Rubin told reporters that the government has appointed retired
Gen. John Shalikashvili, a former chairman of the joint chiefs of
staff, to oversee a campaign to win over U.S. senators to support

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Indians Oppose Celebration of Discovery (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The representatives of the indigenous ethnic groups will
demonstrate Saturday in Corona Vermelha, in the state of Bahia,
where Franciscan monk Henrique de Coimbra celebrated the first
mass on Brazilian soil 500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese navigator Pedro Alvares Cabral arrived in Brazil on
April 22, 1500.
</P>
<P>
The Indians say they have nothing to commemorate about and will
demonstrate against the lack of governmental attention to their
problems, especially the demarcation of their territories.
</P>
<P>
The Indians and the members of the Landless Movement will march
toward Porto Seguro, where the official events to remember the
date will be held, to be attended by Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and his Portuguese counterpart Jorge Sampaio.
Corona Vermelha is 22 kilometers away of Porto Seguro.
</P>
<P>
In Brazil, a country with over 8.5 million square kilometers of
soil, 90 percent of the land is in the hands of 20 percent of the
people, while the poorest 40 percent own just 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 people -- 2,000 Indians and 3,000 Landless Movement
members -- went to Corona Vermelha to take part in the Indigenous
Conference, supported by representatives of the Negro Movement,
labor unions, and popular organizations.
</P>
<P>
The urgent demarcation of their lands is the most outstanding
claim of the indigenous people, because their terrains are invaded
by mining and lumber firms and rural landholders.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Indians Oppose Celebration of Discovery (2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The authorities deployed 5,000 military and civilian policemen
to bar the demonstrators from entering the commemoration areas,
and placed ten police fences in the main entrances of the city of
Porto Seguro.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian government plans to exalt the history of the
country with the commemoration of the 500 years of the discovery,
but the indigenous people's protests will tarnish the
commemorative events.
</P>
<P>
According to historians, when Pedro Alvares Cabral arrived in
Brazil at the head of a Portuguese expedition, the territory had
five million indigenous people, most of whom were assassinated by
the Portuguese colonizers.
</P>
<P>
The last official statistics put the indigenous population at
350,000 people.
</P>
<P>
It can be understood that the indigenous peoples do not want to
commemorate the anniversary of the discovery, a tragedy for their
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
"If anyone should commemorate it's the Portuguese. They
discovered, colonized and plundered" Brazil, said Kebengele
Munanga of the Center for African Studies at the University of Sao
Paulo.

<HEADLINE> IMF Considers Too Demanding Economic Plan for Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- International Monetary Fund (IMF)
acting director Stanley Fisher said Friday that the economic plan
agreed on between the institution and Ecuador is "very demanding."
</P>
<P>
The plan "will affect all the people" and has as a goal the
protection of the poor, Fisher told the Ecuadoran press from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The IMF approved Wednesday an agreement with Ecuador for an
economic program that includes a 304 million dollar contingency
credit and a bimonthly vigilance of the country's finances.
</P>
<P>
"If the program is successful, it will be very important for
the future of Ecuador, but it is necessary for the political
system to act in a coordinated way," said Fisher.
</P>
<P>
"Whether Ecuador can or cannot fulfill his part of the
agreement is a question that must be addressed to Ecuador, to its
society, and to its congress," said the IMF director.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is done and to comply with it or not is a
question the Ecuadoran government must answer," said Fisher.
</P>
<P>
According to Fisher, the IMF examined with the Ecuadoran
government a calendar of adjustments, but its application is a
sovereign decision of the South American country.
</P>
<P>
The application of the adjustments responds to a macroeconomics
necessity, said Fisher, speaking highly of the seriousness of the
government of President Gustavo Noboa.

<HEADLINE> Reno Refuses to Set Timetable for Reuniting Elian, Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the 15-minute meeting at the Justice Department with Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, Reno said in a short statement that she told him
that "I could not commit to a particular course of action or
timetable."
</P>
<P>
"I was deeply moved by Mr. Gonzalez' evident love for his son...
I assured him I would continue working toward the goal of
reuniting him with his child," Reno said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Reno said the father expressed great concern for and requested
a quick reunion with the boy, who has been here for nearly five
months since he survived in the Atlantic sea off Florida. The boy
's mother and 10 others were all drowned.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place as Reno, having exhausted almost all
options, was waiting for her law enforcement officials to
determine how to make the boy transferred to his father.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton said Thursday that the six-year-old Cuban
shipwreck survivor, Elian Gonzalez, should be promptly and orderly
reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters at the White House that there is "no
conceivable argument" to keep Elian and his father apart after a
federal appeals court ruled the boy cannot leave the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I think he should be reunited with his son. That is the law
and the main argument of the family in Miami for not doing so has
now been removed," Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
asked Americans to write to Clinton and Attorney General Janet
Reno to pressure them to reunite him with Elian.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
issued an order that keeps Elian in the United States pending an
appeal for an asylum filed by the relatives in Miami for the boy.

<HEADLINE> 15,000 Russians Die of Clearing Up Chernobyl Disaster Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Over 15,000 Russians, involved in
the clearing operation following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in
Ukraine, have died of nuclear radiation, Chernobyl league
president Vyacheslav Grishin told a news conference in Moscow
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Another 50,000 people have become invalids, most of whom are
just 38-48 years old, and the number of invalids among people
involved in the clearing operation has increased nearly 12 folds
since 1991, he said.
</P>
<P>
The area polluted with over one curie/square kilometer of
cesium-137 totals 57,000 square meters. More than 52,000 out of 91,
000 people living in 267 villages near the accident scene have
left the polluted area, which was to become totally uninhabited,
but 8,400 families are still living there.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years after the disaster, the content of cesium-137 in
timber, the flesh of wild animals, mushrooms and berries in the
polluted area shows no signs of receding, Grishin said.

LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A British police helicopter Friday
crash landed on a house in a residential area of Cardiff, the
capital city of Welse.
</P>
<P>
A BBC report quoted witnesses as saying that they heard the
noise of the aircraft's engine and then saw it "park on a roof,"
at Coryton Crescent, Whitchurch, north Cardiff.
</P>

It had hovered above the houses for about 10 minutes when
something appeared to go wrong with the rotor blades.

</P>
<P>
No one has been killed, and no one has so far been reported as
seriously injured in the incident which South Wales Police said
happened at about 1920 GMT.

<HEADLINE> Erekat Demands Israel to Return All Captured Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel must return all the
land it captured during the 1967 Middle East War for a future
Palestinian state, Palestinian top negotiator Saed Erekat said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There is going to be a Palestinian state along the June 4,
1967, boundaries, with East Jerusalem as its capital next to
Israel," said Erekat, who was accompanying Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to Washington for a meeting with President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a news conference in Washington, in
which he also said Arafat was still in Washington after his
meeting with Clinton on Thursday and holding talks with
Palestinian colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Territorial concessions that Israel is prepared to make are far
more modest than those foreseen by Erekat. On Thursday, the State
Department said agreement is possible only if both sides are
prepared to settle for less than their maximum demands.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said that given the differences with Israel on
territorial and other issues, a new round of negotiations,
scheduled on April 30 - May 12, "is not going to be an easy
process."
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned Israel against renewed settlement activity,
saying: "We should work in an atmosphere devoid of any unilateral
steps, and unilateral actions that may reflect negatively on the
atmosphere required to achieve agreement."
</P>
<P>
Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestine Liberation Organization
representative in Washington, said U.N. Security Council
Resolution 242 will be the basis for Palestinian territorial
demands.
</P>
<P>
The resolution requires Israel to withdraw from occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said agreements with Israel specify clearly the coming
negotiations should lead to implementation of 242.

LAGOS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government on Friday
announced the compulsory retirement of four executive directors
and 17 general managers in a major shake-up of Nigerian
Telecommunications Corporation (NITEL).
</P>
<P>
Earmarked for privatization along with several other state-run
 inefficient and graft-ridden utilities, NITEL is a major revenue
earner for the country, perhaps next to oil and the customs
service.
</P>
<P>
But it is widely criticized for failure to provide a reliable
telephone service in Africa's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
As part of ongoing efforts by the 11-month-old government of
President Olusegun Obasanjo to rid state-run parastatals of
corruption and inefficiency, a number of chief executives have
been fired.
</P>
<P>
But the recent sacking of the entire management of Nigerian
Power Authority has had little effect on the erratic power supply
in the oil-rich nation.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Five Vow to Fight Terrorism Jointly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The police and security chiefs of
the "Shanghai Five" countries: Russia, China, Kyrgyzstan,
Kazakhstan and Tajikistan decided here Friday to develop a joint
strategy for combating the most dangerous types of crimes,
primarily terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Terrorism, extremism and separatism can be halted only by means
of joint efforts, "by combining all efforts into one fist,"
Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo told an extraordinary
meeting of the chiefs, who conferred to draft documents for the
Dushanbe summit of the Shanghai Five due in May.
</P>
<P>
The spread of terrorism in Central Asia and the North Caucasus
has seriously destabilized the regional situation, and it can be
curbed much more effectively through international anti-terrorist
cooperation, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Other delegations' leaders expressed support for Rushailo's
stand in their speeches and stressed the need for more energetic
efforts against manifestations of transnational terrorism and drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Bishkek Group, comprising the heads of law
enforcement agencies and special services of the five states,
approved an appeal to the Shanghai-5 heads of state for stepping
up their interaction in the law enforcement sphere.
</P>
<P>
The document contains specific proposals extending interaction
in the law enforcement field, including a five-nation program on
combating crime in concrete aspects and a five-nation treaty on
this.
</P>
<P>
During the group's meeting, measures were discussed to increase
the efficiency of interaction among these countries' law
enforcement agencies and special services in struggling against
terrorism, arms and drugs trafficking and illegal migration.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was also reached to create and use the five-nation
basis to further develop such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Each of the participants of the Moscow meeting noted that the
country they represent "has its own experience in combating
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Head of the Chinese delegation Public Security Minister
assistant Zhu Entao said China fully rejects terrorism in all its
forms and supports Russia's efforts to keep the country's
integrity as well as the counter-terrorist operation in the
Chechen republic.
</P>
<P>
Rushailo said that the results of the meeting "are not only of
Russian, but also of international significance."

<HEADLINE> E-Commerce in Asia-Pacific to Reach 1.6 Trln Dlrs in 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Buoyed by a combination of
regional strength, an American market research firm predicted this
week that e-commerce in Asia-Pacific will surge to 1.6 trillion U.
S. dollars in 2004.
</P>
<P>
According to Forrester Research, the region's countries will
benefit from local e-commerce development efforts and tight links
to international supply chains in a number of key industries.
</P>
<P>
These factors will make Asia-Pacific an important player in the
global Internet economy, which Forrester estimates will reach 6.9
trillion dollars in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the advantages that will accelerate the region's e-
commerce development, Forrester mentioned pressure from global
trading partners, falling trade barriers and government enthusiasm
for e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Deep links to global supply chains will accelerate the region's
adoption of e-commerce as industry leaders pull their trading
partners online, Forrester said, citing Singapore as an example.
The country's 86 percent exports to the United States are sold
into the computing and electronics industries at the leading edge
of online business trade. Meanwhile, the research firm said,
national commitments to infrastructure development and economic
growth will create new opportunities throughout the region. The
resulting e-commerce gains will be tightly linked to business-to-
business (B2B) trade in Asia-Pacific, with more than 1.5 trillion
dollars of the region's total online sales linked to B2B sector.
</P>
<P>
However, Forrester said, e-commerce will not develop uniformly
across the region. According to the firm, online trade requires
public policy support, including low barriers to trade, stable
currencies and flexible capital markets, as well as a technology
infrastructure to reach its full potential.
</P>
<P>
These contributing factors are not equally present in the
region, Forrester said. In Hong Kong, for instance, low trade
barriers are accelerating online trade, while India's substantial
tariffs are delaying its development. Meanwhile, China's role in
the Internet economy will be hindered by its weak infrastructure.
"This disparity will make Asia-Pacific one of the last regions to
reach full e-commerce maturity," Forrester said.
</P>
<P>
Forrester estimates that e-commerce will account for 8.6
percent of worldwide sales of goods and services in 2004. The
expansion of online trade, however, will be highly concentrated,
with 12 countries representing nearly 85 percent of worldwide Net
sales.
</P>
<P>
According to Forrester's forecast, the U.S. will continue to be
the global e-commerce leader with online sales reaching 3.2
trillion dollars in 2004. Western Europe will hit 1.5 trillion
dollars with stronger business-to-consumer (B2C) sales than Asia-
Pacific. Plagued by infrastructure deficiencies, e-commerce will
reach 82 billion dollars in Latin America, while Eastern Europe,
Africa and the Middle East will contribute a combined 68.6 billion
dollars in 2004.

<HEADLINE> Smaller, Entrepreneurial Firms Lure American Accounting Graduates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A new survey released Friday
suggests that the growth of high-tech industry and the enticement
of smaller, entrepreneurial firms have shifted an old trend in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
A generation ago, most American accounting and finance
graduates sought jobs at large public accounting firms or major
corporations. Now small to mid-sized companies rank first among
the most desired business environments, according to a new poll of
chief financial officers (CFOs).
</P>
<P>
The survey was developed by Accountemps, the largest U.S.
temporary staffing service for accounting, finance and bookkeeping
professionals. About 1,400 CFOs of U.S. companies with more than
20 employees were asked to identify the most attractive employment
environment among today's accounting graduates.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five CFOs surveyed identified small to mid-sized
companies, compared to 22 percent of them who considered large
corporations. Of the rest of the CFOs, 13 percent and 11 percent
respectively picked up small to mid-sized public accounting firms
and large public accounting firms.
</P>
<P>
"The career opportunities with rapidly growing small to mid-
sized companies are enticing, particularly the promise of having
an equity stake in the business," said Accountemps, analyzing the
results. "In addition, smaller firms are the ideal training ground
for hands-on experience with a variety of business functions."
</P>
<P>
Start-up companies were perceived as the least attractive
employment option by CFOs at firms of all sizes, as only 7 percent
selected them as the most attractive.
</P>
<P>
"Small yet established businesses offer an entrepreneurial,
fast-growth environment with fewer of the risks associated with an
untested venture, " Accountemps said.
</P>
<P>
CFOs at the largest companies with 500 or more employees in the
survey viewed jobs with the Big Five as most appealing. "A
position with a large public firm has been the traditional first
step in an accountant's career," the firm said. ""It's likely that
the finance executives surveyed at large corporations began their
own careers this way."
