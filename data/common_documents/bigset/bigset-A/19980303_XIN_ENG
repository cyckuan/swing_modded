LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Kim Nilsson of Denmark will replace
injured Anders Frisk of Sweden to officiate Wednesday's European
Cup quarter-final match between Bayer Leverkusen and Real Madrid,
UEFA said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
UEFA added that the match would mark a departure from the
normal practice of a refereeing team all coming from the same
country.
</P>
<P>
This was because assistant referee Mikael Nilsson of Sweden was
due to officiate at the World Cup finals in the summer and UEFA
wanted all officials for that tournament to get as much experience
as possible in the final phases of the continental club
competitions.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Trade Pullback for Security with Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny
Naveh Monday denied Israel has territorial ambition in Lebanon,
saying its only desire is to safeguard the security of residents
near the northern border.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Naveh said a way would be
found to reach a deal with Lebanese government to ensure southern
Lebanon does not serve as the basis for guerrilla attacks against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Naveh, who just returned from a visit to Paris, said that
Syria, which has 40,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, is the main
power in solving the current standoff in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Naveh and Uzi Arad, the foreign policy adviser of Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, were in France for a
one-day tour reportedly because of diplomatic signals that Syria
is interested in renewing negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, no details about the diplomatic mission have been
released.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Uri Lubrani, Israel's top official for Lebanon
affairs, said Monday that he backs the government initiative to
withdraw from Lebanon. However, he said it was just "the
beginning of the process" and Syria must be part of the process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman also expressed his hope that
Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai would
succeed in their efforts to pull Israeli troops out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops are engaged in an attrition war with resistance
forces in south Lebanon where they carved out a security zone in
1985 to prevent guerrillas from cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Their occupation has been costly - in 1997 more than 100
Israeli soldiers died in fightings or in accidents in Lebanon. And
last week, three Israeli soldiers were killed by a long-range
Hezbollah mortar attack on their outpost in the western sector of
the security zone.
</P>
<P>
There has been strong public appeal in Israel for a unilateral
troop withdrawal from Lebanon. However, the Netanyahu government
has been insisting that security arrangements be worked out with
Beirut before Israeli troops pull back.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Mordechai said Sunday that Israel was willing to
fulfill U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 which calls for
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, in exchange for guarantees that
it would not be attacked by guerrillas from across the border.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that this was the first time that Netanyahu had
made a direct reference to the U.N. resolution. Netanyahu and
Mordechai are expected to elaborate the government position on
Lebanon in separate trips to Europe this week.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu will be visiting Norway, which has peacekeepers in
south Lebanon. Mordechai has plans to travel to France, which has
long-standing interests in Lebanon and is a member of the
International Monitoring Committee in South Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Albania Calls for Peaceful End to Kosov Conflict: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano
said on Monday that he hopes to end the conflict in Kosov, of
Yugoslavia, through peaceful and diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, Nano said his government is
following closely the developments in Kosov, where ethnic
Albanians account for about 90 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
An autonomous province of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
since 1989, Kosov declared independent in 1991. But except for
Albania, no other countries have so far given their recognition.
</P>
<P>
As a latest development, a Yugoslavian Interior Ministry police
patrol was ambushed last Saturday in Glogovac, Kosovo, resulting
in the death of four policemen and 16 attackers.
</P>
<P>
The event highlighted the fact that there should be no more
delay in efforts to end the conflict and the Albanian government
was ready to play its role in the process, Nano said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Conducts National Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Monday began its
gigantic national census to enumerate the country's existing
population and garner national housing data.
</P>
<P>
As many as 280,000 civilian and army personnel are engaged in
conducting the fifth National Population and Housing Census on
March 2-18, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in a message on Sunday that
the census was inevitable for future planning and development of
the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the massive task, which is in the best national
interests, should be considered above any provincialism,
parochialism and personal interests.
</P>
<P>
The federal cabinet Saturday decided to give the go-ahead to
the long-awaited census as scheduled, contrary to days of
speculation that it would be put off again.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan conducted its last national census in 1981. But the
successive governments had not carried out one since then despite
a constitutional provision stipulating that a census should be
held every 10 years.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Receives First Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposal, calling for accelerating the development of risk
investment in China, has been raised by the Central Committee
of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA).
</P>
<P>
A member of CPPCC National Committee's Subcommittee for
Examining Proposals described the proposal as a "significant" one
showing great foresight. It has already received attention from
the State Planning Commission and the State Science and Technology
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Global competition, in final analysis, is one of national
strength and of science and technology. To gain a favorable
position in this competition, China must introduce the experience
of other countries in risk investment and promote high-tech
development, the proposal says.
</P>
<P>
Risk investment refers to investing in the research and
development of new and high technology having the risk of
failure.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is the result of one-year investigations led by
Cheng Siwei, a noted expert on management.
</P>
<P>
"China is a developing country, and the level of high
technology is closely related to its social progress and economic
take-off in the next century," said Xiong Dafang, head of the
Investigation and Study Department under the CDNCA Central
Committee who has contributed to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
At present, risk investment in China remains on a small scale
and sources of such investment are limited.
</P>
<P>
The proposal suggests that development of risk investment be
made a fundamental government policy to promote scientific
advancement and economic growth and that the policy be
incorporated into the country's medium and long-term development
program for national economic growth and social progress.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also suggests that regulations on the management
of risk investment be worked out as soon as possible so that the
rights of risk investment companies will be better protected.
</P>
<P>
Making proposals is an important way for CPPCC members to
participate in and deliberate state affairs. Over the past five
years, the CPPCC Eighth National Committee received more than
11,700 proposals.
</P>
<P>
Up to five o'clock this afternoon, 172 proposals had been
submitted to the First Session of the CPPCC Ninth National
Committee.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Implement Irrigation Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Nepal will implement an
irrigation project in the western part of the country to raise
agricultural production and farmers' income, the official RSS news
agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project, financed by a World Bank loan, will bring under
irrigation 60,000 hectares of land in 40 of the country's 75
districts.
</P>
<P>
At a workshop here Monday, World Bank country director Hans M.
Rothenbuhler stressed the need to expand irrigation in a country
like Nepal to increase agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Dwarikanath Dhungel, secretary at the Ministry for Water
Resources, said the government has adopted a 20-year Agriculture
Perspective Plan which accords priority to the expansion of
irrigation facilities.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Government Organs Asked to Cut Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti government organs have
been asked to reduce their expenditures by 25 percent due to a
drop of oil revenues caused by price plunge on world market, the
Kuwait News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted director of Finance Ministry's Budget
Department, Abdel Wahab, as saying that the government bodies were
required to cut their spending in the remaining period of the
current fiscal year (July 1, 1997 to June 30, 1998).
</P>
<P>
About 80 percent of the Kuwaiti revenues are from oil
exports. The government's budget predicted oil revenues at 2.6
billion dinars (8.58 billion U.S. dollars) in the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The budgeted expenditure, on the other hand, was 3.2 billion
Kuwait dinars (10.56 billion U.S. dollars). But Kuwaiti crude
prices dropped one to two dollars per barrel on the world market
over the past four months from the budgeted 12 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf country was granted a new quota of 2.19 million
barrels per day from 2 million during the first half of 1998 under
a new output ceiling agreed by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the anticipated increase in revenue was not achieved
because oversupply, warm winter, southeast Asia economic crisis
and Iraq's possible return to the oil market have conspired to
depress oil prices to their lowest level in four years.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian deputy foreign minister
G. B. Karasin arrived here Monday on a two-day visit to Pakistan
for talks with Pakistani officials on a host of issues including
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Karasin's visit coincides with the visit of a Russian
parliamentary delegation, which also arrived here Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Foreign Office said in a statement that these visits
are taking place against the backdrop of a consultation process
initiated between the two countries to promote understanding on
all bilateral, regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
"Russia and Pakistan are increasingly aware of the need to
adopt a fresh approach towards the development of relations in the
changed realities of the post cold-war period," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said "both countries have vital economic and
political stakes in the region. Their objectives and pursuits for
peace and stability stem from their common desire to promote
economic development and prosperity in the region."
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Pakistan, Karasin will meet with Foreign
Minister Gohar Ayub Khan and senior officials from the Foreign
Office.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani officials will brief Karasin on their country's
diplomatic efforts to find a negotiated settlement of the Afghan
issue.

<HEADLINE> British Govt to Make Concessions After Rural March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- British government promised on
Monday to have more consideration of the farmers rights after a
quarter of a million protesters marched through central London on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The government has been listening and has been making changes
in policy and we shall continue to do so," a government spokesman
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, from every corner of the country, protested
the government for policies which are threatening the rural way of
life, including the ban of selling beef on bones and the proposed
ban on fox-hunting.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman said Prime Minister Tony Blair had not
addressed the idea of setting up a separate ministry to handle
countryside issues, or reshaping his government to defuse the rural
protest.
</P>
<P>
Despite massive support from Labor MPs, the bill to ban
fox-hunting, introduced by Labor backbencher Michael Foster, is
thought certain to fail because of lack of parliamentary time.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of government time in this session for
the fox hunting bill," Blair's spokesman said, describing the
measure as not a priority for the government's future legislative
plans.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that farmers were facing a real problem because
of falling incomes, caused partly by the strong pound sterling.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government unveiled a string of concessions on
rural issues, including extra cash for farmers and more protection
for village schools.

ADDIS ABABA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopians throughout the
country Monday celebrated the 102nd anniversary of victory of Adwa
over the Italian invaders.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Addis Ababa, this victory day was
marked at the Menelik square in the presence of patriots of the
anti-colonial resistance and a huge crowd -- residents of Addis
Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Dawit Yohannes, Speaker of the House of People's
Representatives laid wreath of flowers on the Menelik monument.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony Monday morning, Chairman of the
Ethiopian Patriots Association Assefa Bayu said Adwa is the
victory of both Ethiopia and Africa. He called on the young
generation to keep the spirit of Adwa intact.
</P>
<P>
Celebrations of the Adwa victory day were held with all the
pomp throughout the country Monday, according to the Ethiopian
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
On March 1, 1986, Ethiopian soldiers led by Emperor Menelik ii
defeated 15,000 well-equipped Italian invaders at Adwa in
northern Ethiopia. The famous battle of Adwa forced the Italian
aggressors to recognize Ethiopia as a sovereign independent
state.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia celebrates the Adwa victory day every year on March 2
and March 2 is a public holiday for Ethiopians.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Urged to Respond to Appeal for Cross-Strait Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The members of the Ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) are concerned with the talks across the Taiwan
strait, according to a CPPCC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Under the principle of one China, it is an essential for
further expanding the across-strait relations to officially put an
end to the hostilities across the Taiwan Straits," said Liang
Jinquan, spokesman for the First Session of the Ninth CPPC
National Committee, at a press conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
The First Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee will be
held tomorrow and run through March 14.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) and the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) from
Taiwan should make prompt programmatic arrangements for political
talks and, on this basis, resume economic and routine business
talks.
</P>
<P>
"ARATS sent a formal message a week ago and we expect a timely
response from Taiwan side," said Liang.
</P>
<P>
The great concept of "one country, two systems" put forward by
Deng Xiaoping when he was the chairman of the Fifth CPPCC National
Conference, has been turned into a reality in Hong Kong, noted
Liang.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is certain that the motherland's reunification
will be accomplished under the guidance of "one country, two
systems", "reunification through peaceful means" set forth by Deng
Xiaoping and the Eight-Point proposal for promoting the
across-strait relations put forward by Jiang Zemin, and through
concerted efforts by people across the straits, the spokesman
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Registers Strong Gain in Personal Income in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. personal income
increased a strong 0.6 percent in January, the Commerce Department
reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The increase was bolstered by cost-of-living growth for Social
Security recipients and pay raises for federal employees. However,
even if without those and other special factors, incomes would
have increased a still healthy 0.5 percent, according to the
department. Incomes had increased 0.4 percent in December and 0.7
percent in November respectively.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, meanwhile, climbed up by a moderate 0.4
percent in January, no change from that of December and November.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the United States recorded a 3.8 percent growth in its
GDP, which was the strongest in nine years. The Asian financial
chaos is expected dampen U.S. growth this year by cutting American
export sales and encouraging more imports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
All categories of income increased in January, including the
most important wages and salaries, up 0.7 percent. Also higher
were transfer payments, such as Social Security and welfare, and
business owners' income, interest and dividend income.
</P>
<P>
The disposable, or after-tax, incomes shot up by 0.9 percent,
the largest increase in 19 months. Because after-tax incomes rose
more swiftly than spending, the savings rate rose to 4.2 percent
of disposable income, the most in seven months and up from 3.9
percent in December.

<HEADLINE> Germany's SPD Names Schroeder as Chancellor Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Germany's main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) today formally endorsed Gerhard Schroeder,
premier of the Lower Saxony state, as its candidate to challenge
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the national elections on September 27
this year.
</P>
<P>
The nomination was decided by the SPD presidency as well as its
executive committee at two separate meetings in Bonn on Monday,
one day after Schroeder scored a huge victory for the SPD at the
regional elections of Lower Saxony on Sunday by winning 47.9
percent of the vote, while Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
coming in at only 35.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The state election victory has enabled Schroeder to win over
his party chairman Oskar Lafontaine in their one-year rivalry over
the SPD chancellor candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, 53, is described by the German press as a more
dangerous challenger to Kohl because he has more chances to win
vital centrist votes much needed by Kohl's centre-right ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
As an active proponent of high-technology investments and a
former board member of Germany's largest carmaker Volkswagen AG,
Schroeder says he understands the challenges faced by German
businesses in global markets and pledges to undertake reforms to
improve Germany's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
And as one of five children raised by a war widow who earned a
living as a cleaning lady, Schroeder also says he wants to
preserve many of the country's welfare programs at a time when
Germany faces a post-war record unemployment of 4.8 million
people.
</P>
<P>
With Schroeder as the SPD chancellor candidate, German
commentators are now predicting a much harder re-election battle
for Kohl whose popularity has been trailing the SPD politician in
all recent opinions polls.
</P>
<P>
Despite Schroeder's victory in Lower Saxony, the CDU today
vowed to stand by their veteran leader and ruled out the
possibility to change candidate in the run-up to the September
ballot.
</P>
<P>
Describing Kohl as "the triumph card" of his party, CDU General
Secretary Peter Hintze said in an interview with the German ARD
television network that Kohl had not been strong in opinions
polls, but he had won all elections in his 16 years as German
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
Kohl himself today also told reporters that he would continue
to run for a re-election and said he saw "a clear chance" for a
victory in Autumn.

<HEADLINE> US Light Sentence to Drug Offender Annoys Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Monday criticized
U.S. anti-drug laws, saying the release of Pakistan Air Force
(PAF) squadron leader Frooq Ahmed Khan, who was caught smuggling
drugs to the United States last year, would "practically encourage
criminals."
</P>
<P>
"It is ironical that while the U.S. justifiably makes such an
issue of drug trafficking, yet the individuals involved in this
heinous crimes are not given exemplary and deterring punishment,"
a Foreign Office spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed surprise and dismay that the convicted
drug smuggler Farooq was given an extremely light sentence. "Apart
from causing a serious setback to our fight against drug
trafficking, such examples send wrong signals and practically
encourage criminals," he added.
</P>
<P>
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents arrested Farooq in
New York on April 9 last year after he brought two kilograms of
heroin from Pakistan on a PAF cargo plane. He was released on
February 27 after serving a year in prison.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that Pakistan had given two other
persons involved in this case stricter sentences and much longer
prison terms, which indicated the country's resolve against
tolerating such activities.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Increased Medical Coop with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Monday called for increased
medical cooperation with China and asked Beijing to provide
medical equipment to the country.
</P>
<P>
N. L. Magolo, Zambia's deputy permanent secretary of the
Health Ministry, expressed the hope in an interview here with a
group of Chinese photographers, who came to Zambia to cover the
work of the 27 Chinese doctors working in five hospitals in
Lusaka, Livingstone, Kabwe, Luanshya and Ndola.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his appreciation over the performance of the
Chinese doctors and thanked China for its assistance to his
country, a source told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Magolo hoped the assistance will be extended to rural areas of
Zambia because there is growing need for medical service.
</P>
<P>
There is a shortage of medical equipment in Zambia. If China
can bring its equipment to the country, both the Chinese doctors
and their local colleagues can play a greater role in their
service of Zambians, Magolo was quoted as having told the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Magolo also hoped the exchange of visits by medical
professionals will be increased between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China started to send its medical team to Zambia 20 years ago
as part of its assistance to the country.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years about one million Zambians have been
treated by Chinese doctors.
</P>
<P>
So far 10 teams have worked in the country, with each team
working for two years.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, Canada Agree on Defense Coop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Canada
Monday signed a memorandum of understanding which could culminate
in joint defense industry ventures between them.
</P>
<P>
Once signed, the agreement would seek to promote industrial
cooperation between the two countries in the fields of armaments,
military technology, and production, Defense Minister Joe Modise
said in Pretoria Monday.
</P>
<P>
Modise and his Canadian counterpart Art Eggleton initialed the
document at defense headquarters in Pretoria. They also signed a
technical arrangement.
</P>
<P>
"The memorandum aims to identify ventures related to defense
equipment for possible collaboration between our respective
industries," Modise said.
</P>
<P>
Such agreements were important to South Africa in more than
one respect, Modise said.
</P>
<P>
"As a developing country we are looking to partnership with
friendly countries to facilitate access to cutting-edge
technology, long-term investments, joint ventures and new
markets," he noted.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, on the other hand, also offered the world access
to an emerging market in a region with natural wealth and
potential, Modise said.
</P>
<P>
Eggleton's visit to South Africa is the first by a Canadian
defense minister in this century.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Banks Increase Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Facing no immediate stabilization
in Zimbabwe's macro-economic environment, some commercial banks
have increased their minimum lending rates by an average of 1.5
percent in less than three months.
</P>
<P>
Standard Chartered Bank announced in a statement Monday that
it increased its lending rates by 1.5 percent to 35 percent per
annum with effect from March 1.
</P>
<P>
"The rate increases reflect present market conditions and
economic fundamentals," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Stanbic Bank also raised its lending rate by 1.5 percent to
34.5 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
"This strategy does tie in with the official stance to counter
inflationary pressures in the economy," the bank said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bankers attributed the latest hikes to the current high cost
of money on the market caused by the shortage of cash created by
the reserve bank to control money supply growth.
</P>
<P>
They held that since Standard Chartered Bank and Stanbic Bank
have raised their lending rates, more could follow suit as the
instability that has been gripping the money market since the end
of last year continues.
</P>
<P>
The latest rise of an average three to four percent in the
lending rates of local banks took place last December in response
to the hiking of the rediscount rate by the reserve bank from
28.5 percent to 31.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rediscount rate is the rate at which commercial banks
borrow money from the central bank. Its movement upwards or
downwards determines the level of other rates.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Varsity Students Start Class Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Students at the National
University of Science and Technology (NUST) in Bulawayo, Monday
started a five-day class boycott in a bid to force the government
to doubled their grants, Zimbabwe News Agency ZIANA reported.
</P>
<P>
Hopewell Gumbo, president of NUST Students Representative
Council, said the boycott in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second biggest
city, would turn into a fully fledged demonstration unless the
government made a firm pledge on the pay-outs by Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The money we are getting from the government which was last
reviewed in 1995 can no longer sustain us because of the
escalating cost of living due to economic problems we are
facing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gumbo added that it was only a matter of time before students
from other higher education institutions joined the boycott.
</P>
<P>
In Mutare, east Zimbabwe, students from three of the four
higher institutions also started boycotting classes Monday,
demanding an increase in their vocational training loans. They
are also joined by students at Harare Polytechnic.
</P>
<P>
The boycott was peaceful with most students staying in their
halls of residences, while others were studying in lecture rooms
and the library.
</P>
<P>
Charlton Hwende, president of Student Representative Council,
said the boycott would continue until Friday after which the
Zimbabwe National Students Union would meet over the next course
of action.
</P>
<P>
He urged all the students to remain peaceful, saying those who
engaged in violent behavior would be disciplined by the student
body.
</P>
<P>
The students had nothing against the government, but simply
wanted an adjustment in their allowances in view of the
escalating cost of living, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But if the government does not respond during the week then
we cannot rule out the boycott degenerating into a
demonstration," he warned.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Trade Unions Give Strike Go Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Trade Unions, after two
meetings with the government Monday, has again urged a nationwide
stay-away from work Tuesday and Wednesday to press their demands
for the reduction of price increases and taxes.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions
(ZCTU) Morgan Tsvangirai told a news conference Monday that
negotiations with Florence Chitauro, Minister of Public Service,
Labor and Social Welfare, had failed after the government
demanded an unconditional withdrawal of the stay-awayi.
</P>
<P>
During the afternoon meeting, the ZCTU leadership informed the
minister that the stay-away will go ahead, adding that it is
ready for serious negotiations at any time.
</P>
<P>
Since no minister had a mandate to negotiate with the ZCTU,
only President Robert Mugabe could resolve the issue, Tsvangirai
said.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Mugabe is out of the country attending a
meeting of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in
Maputo, Mozambique. He will return home on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the ZCTU called for a mass stay-away from work to
press the government for the scrapping of the five percent
development levy and 15 percent tax on pensions as well as the
removal of the 2.5 sales tax increase on goods and services. It
also wants prices of basic goods restored to their pre-July 1997
levels.
</P>
<P>
Nathan Shamuyarira, Minister of Industry and Commerce, said
here Sunday night that drastic and punitive action will be taken
against employers and employees who will take part in the mass
strike.
</P>
<P>
He added that the police and the army will be deployed in the
capital to ensure peace.
</P>
<P>
Economic commentators said Monday the Zimbabwean economy,
already plagued by a host of problems, could be thrown into
further turmoil if the two-day national strike organized by the
ZCTU goes ahead.

<HEADLINE> Car Phones Pose no Less Hazard than Alcohol: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A British government funded study
finds that drivers in intense mobile phone conversation while
driving pose no less safety risk than those who drink up to the
legal alcohol limit.
</P>
<P>
The study says that drivers engaged in serious conversations
while driving often result in "considerable distraction" and
demonstrate the same lack of control as those whose alcohol level
was at the maximum of 80 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood.
</P>
<P>
Citing research results, the study says that holding phone
conversations is significantly more difficult than other tasks
such as changing radio stations and dialing a number is extremely
difficult, the same as trying to read a map while driving.
</P>
<P>
The report points out that when on the phone, drivers feel
pressured to keep up conversation flow even when they would idealy
like to dedicate full concentration on the driving task.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that concern about in-car phones rose last year
after two fatal accidents caused by drivers in mid-conversation
and the government is discussing whether to make use of phones
while driving a specific offense.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Former PM Blasts Biased Report on Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Marcolino Moco, executive
secretary of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries,
Monday blasted the world's media coverage of Africa, saying it
only reflects the dark side of African countries.
</P>
<P>
Moco, who is also Angola's former prime minister, made the
statement at the opening ceremony of the first Iberian
Journalists' Meeting, the Angola News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, due to the shortage of African reporters,
news on Africa are mostly covered by western news agencies, whose
reports are more often than not twisted or simplified.
</P>
<P>
These reports, he said, do not reflect the real picture in the
political, economic and social spheres in Africa, but give a
misleading impression that the daily event in African countries
are merely tribal conflicts, natural disasters and poverty.
</P>
<P>
The official urged African journalists to upgrade their
reporting skills and try to present the world with fair, just and
complete reports on Africa.
</P>
<P>
Portugal has started cooperation with Portuguese-speaking
countries in Africa in jointly setting up radio and television
stations.
</P>
<P>
This is a good experience which embodies the wishes of one of
the western countries to cooperate with African countries, and
its wishes to jointly report on Africa, Moco said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Be Realistic on Lebanon Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said Monday that Israel must be realistic in
face of the fact that it will have to deal with the difficult
situation in south Lebanon for some time.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after visiting Israel's northern border,
Mordechai reiterated that before Israel pulls back its troops,
Lebanese government must prove it is capable of establishing
authority over the entire country and preventing terrorist attacks
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said there was not an immediate resolution and it would take
some time before reaching an arrangement, which will deal with the
future of the southern Lebanon residents and the South Lebanon
Army which assists Israeli occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai noted that every effort should be made to find a way
of achieving an agreement with Lebanon. He also urged Syria, the
main power to resolve the current standoff in south Lebanon, to
resume peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some opposition Labor Party members highlighted the
importance of Syrian role in Lebanon, saying that there is no
possibility of a deal with Lebanon without negotiating with Syria
over the Golan Heights, which Israel seized in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Ehud Barak said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
must be ready to talk about the Golan Heights with the Damascus,
who has 40,000 troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Another Labor member Ori Ore, former head of Israeli Northern
Command, said that unless Netanyahu starts dealing on the Golan
issue with Syria there will be no solution to the difficult
situation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a security zone, about 10 percent of
Lebanon's territory, in southern Lebanon in 1985 to prevent
cross-border guerrilla attacks on its northern towns.
</P>
<P>
However, the Israeli presence has been costly - in 1997 alone
more than 100 Israeli soldiers lost their lives in fightings or
accidents in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
There has been strong public appeal in Israel for a unilateral
troop withdrawal from Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Surviving, Functioning Despite Embargo: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's President Pierre
Buyoya said in Kinshasa that his country is surviving and
functioning despite a regional economic embargo, the U.N.
humanitarian information unit IRIN reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya asserted that the trade embargo imposed on his central
African country by regional states to protest his 1996 coup would
disappear after failing to cripple Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"We've made efforts to survive the embargo. We've survived
it," he told Kinshasa television Sunday after meeting President
Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
"Burundi is standing despite 20 months of economic sanctions.
We think this situation will disappear soon," Buyoya added.
</P>
<P>
East and central African leaders decided at a summit in
Kampala last month to uphold sanctions until Burundi made more
progress toward returning to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
The summit gave Buyoya a rare chance to press his case for the
easing of sanctions. But he stormed out of the Ugandan capital
after he knew the sanctions would remain.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya said his talks with Kabila had been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Burundi radio before his departure, he said the
purpose of the visit was to explore bilateral issues including
security and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Syria to Cooperate in Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkey called for Syria's
cooperation on Monday in fighting terrorism to secure a good
environment for them.
</P>
<P>
"We have expressed our expectations to the Syrian side
regarding cooperation in fighting terrorism," Sermet Atacanli,
Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman told a weekly press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli said that during his visit last week to Syria, Turkish
Foreign Ministry official Aykut Chetirge discussed the issue with
the Syrian side.
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Chetirge's visit followed a statement made by Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouq Al-Sharaa that Damascus would like to have a
dialogue with the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
Describing the visit as "a positive step," Atacanli said the
contact was in the direction of improving the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Although the disputes are remaining unsolved, the visit has
opened up a channel for starting dialogues between the two
countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria, two Muslim neighbors, have long shared a
bitter relationship due to a number of disputes, including the
distribution of water resources and the issue of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has accused Damascus of supporting its outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party, which has been fighting the Turkish government for
autonomy in the southeastern areas.
</P>
<P>
Syria, however, has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish spokesman said that Chetirge briefed Syrian
officials on the Turkish-Israeli ties, saying that Turkey
understands the sensitivity of the Arab world, including Syria,
regarding the issue.
</P>
<P>
"We have made it very clear that our relations with Israel is
not aimed at any third party," said Atacanli, adding that the
Turkish-Israeli cooperation is of bilateral nature.

<HEADLINE> Armed Hutu Militia Free 80 Genocide Suspects in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Reports from Rwanda's central
Gitarama Prefecture, south of the capital Kigali, indicated that
the situation has returned to normal after the attack on
Nyakabanda commune Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Around 2,000 militiamen armed with guns and traditional
weapons stormed the local Nyakabanda prison and released over 80
genocide suspects, Rwanda News Agency said, in a special dispatch
to Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
"So far, only three suspects have reported back to
authorities," one official from the area was quoted by Rwanda
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that among the 80 prisoners released were 15
women. The other 300 prisoners detained in other cells were not
attacked, thanks to the intervention of security forces.
</P>
<P>
The assailants are said to have torched the mayor's house and
killed the local assistant-bourgmaster or mayor, whose name has
not been given, and two other people.
</P>
<P>
This brings the number of people killed to 20, including 17
militiamen. There has been no definite death toll of the attack.
</P>
<P>
No number of casualty was given on the government side.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Gitarama also noted that there has been a lot of
damages on property. A number of houses belonging to local
residents were set afire, as well as the building of a local
secondary school. Two vehicles were also burnt down by the
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
One health center was also looted, but the drugs were
recuperated by the army in neighboring Bulinga commune.
</P>
<P>
"The local population is now helping the army to track down
the assailants which have been pursued to their harbor in
southern Gisenyi," Prime Minister Pierre Celestin Rwigama told
reporters Monday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Border Guards Kill 9 MKO Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian border guards on Sunday
killed nine members of the outlawed Mujahideen Khalq Organization
(MKO) and wounded several others when they attempted to infiltrate
into the country, reported the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted the information department of the western province
of Ilam that the MKO members clashed with border guards while they
tried to cross into the country for "sabotage operations."
</P>
<P>
The group had infiltrated into Iranian soil in collaboration
with Iraqi regime, the information department said, adding the MKO
members were carrying Klashinkov rifles, rocket propeller
grenades, machine-guns and wireless communications.
</P>
<P>
One Iranian border guard was also killed in the gunfire, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian border guards have busted about 30 MKO members
grouped in six teams. The MKO, one of the main political groups
which fought against the late shah's regime, was outlawed in the
early 1980s due to serious political disputes with the Islamic
leadership of the country.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, particularly after the Iran-Iraq war
(1980-88), the group launched military attacks on Iranian
interests throughout the worlds, forcing Tehran to take several
air raids on its bases in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Russia Ready to Withdraw Troops from Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 2 (Xinhua) -- If it needs, Russia will remove its
troops from the bases located in Georgia, Russian Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev told the press Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister cited by the Interfax as saying that Russia is
prepared for any developments in discussing the future of the
Russian bases in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev also said preparations for his earlier postponed visit
to Georgia will be continued. He noted that the visit will be very
important, including for deciding the future of the Russian bases
and coming to terms on whether or not Georgia needs Russian
bases.
</P>
<P>
The Sergeyev's visit to Georgia had been scheduled for February
27-28.
</P>

Under a Russian-Georgian military treaty Russian troops came to
the Georgian territory in 1993, as part of the collective

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Why MPC Divided Over Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) - The Bank of England's Monetary
Policy Committee (MPC) is again likely to be split on the need for
higher interest rates at this week's crucial meeting ahead of the
Budget on March 17.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the first since a split on the committee was
made public. The minutes of January's meeting showed that five
members voted for no change on interest rates with three in favor
of an increase.
</P>
<P>
In its Inflation Report, which has to reflect the full range of
views on the committee, it concluded that another rate rise would
probably be needed if the Government were to hit its 2.5 percent
inflation target.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts in the City believe that the MPC is exercised by
the question of whether the economy is turning down and, if so,
how fast.
</P>
<P>
One of the analysts argued: "This is by no means an academic
problem; whether we get yet another interest rate rise depends on
the answer."
</P>
<P>
Economic data since the February meeting suggest that the
domestic economy remains robust but that the manufacturing sector,
and particularly exports, is struggling in the face of lower
demand from Asia and the strength of the pound.
</P>
<P>
Growth figures for the fourth quarter last week showed that
consumer spending grew 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997
and 4.5 percent over the year as a whole, the strongest growth
since the second quarter of 1989.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed here that one big concern within the
MPC is whether wage pressures may be mounting.
</P>
<P>
However, the pay figures, from the Engineering Employers'
Federation (EEF) released Monday showed that settlements in the
three months to the end of January averaged 3.5 percent, a drop
compared with the 3.6 percent average rate recorded in the three
months to December.
</P>
<P>
According to the EEF, the fall in settlements reflects the
intense pressures firms are under as a result of the strength of
sterling.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the ambiguous evidence of Britain's economy,
Bridget Rosewell, Chairman of Business Strategies Ltd, said: "A
2.5 percent anti-inflation target is awfully precise in this
uncertain world and a cautious person would want to under-shoot."
</P>
<P>
"I would rather take the risks on both sides and have a bit of
growth as well," he added.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Disasters Need Urgent Attention: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) Monday stressed the need to tackle environmental
disasters such as the forest fires burning in Indonesia and the
effects of the El Nino phenomenon in the world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of UNEP's High-level Committee
of Ministers and Officials meeting here, UNEP Executive Director
Klaus Topfer said, "we should join together as a family to
respond to this environmental catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
He told the three-day meeting which opened here Monday that he
would raise the forest fires issue during a visit to U.N.
headquarters next week and at the upcoming meeting of the U.N.
Senior Management Group.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of global freshwater resources, the
UNEP boss noted that there was a need for "early warning systems
to alert nations of potential conflicts over common, shared
resources."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the potential for conflict over the
world's remaining freshwater resources is great as there are a
small number of international agreements to manage water
resources contained in about 300 shared international river
basins around the world.
</P>
<P>
In UNEP, he said, "we should focus our attention toward
forging a regionalized Global Program of Action on Water.
</P>
<P>
"this would be an innovative instrument of disarmament in
hot-spots of water scarcity," he added.
</P>
<P>
The issue of freshwater is high on the Committee's agenda and
participants of the committee meeting will review UNEP's
freshwater strategy.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly highlighted the importance of the
freshwater issue at its special session on the environment in
June 1997, and it will be the focus of discussions at the
forthcoming Commission on Sustainable Development meeting in New
York from April 20 to May 1.
</P>
<P>
The High-level Committee of Ministers and Officials was
established by a decision at the nineteenth session of UNEP's
Governing Council held here last year.
</P>
<P>
The committee consists of 36 members elected from among
members of the United Nations and its specialized agencies.

<HEADLINE> Nothing New in Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares
Boueiz Monday refused Israeli proposal to withdraw conditionally
from south Lebanon, saying nothing new in the offer, the official
National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, he said that Lebanon will not
negotiate with Israel over the implementation of the United
Nations Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted by the U.N. in 1978 after Israeli first
invasion of Lebanon calls on Israel to end its occupation of
south Lebanon without conditions.
</P>
<P>
At a weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his willingness for the second time
in two days to implement the resolution provided security
arrangements are agreed by Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that the resolution is very clear and cannot be
negotiated, adding that sitting on negotiating table with Israel
means that Lebanon gives up the resolution.
</P>
<P>
He rejected any direct dialogue between Beirut and Tel Aviv
over the withdrawal, saying that the resolution 425 does not
stipulate security arrangements between Lebanon and Israel, but
arrangement between Israel and U.N. on the one side, and Lebanon
and the U.N. on the other.
</P>
<P>
Israel should inform the U.N. of the date and procedure of its
withdrawal and the U.N. in turn inform Lebanon that Israel will
withdraw. So Lebanon can take necessary steps for the deployment
of its army in the south.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that the Israeli proposal is a media ploy, aiming
at minimizing the pressure exerted on the Israeli government from
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France has been cautious when dealing with
the issue, adding even French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine in
Beirut said Israeli's acknowledgment of the resolution is
positive, but conditions attached is not mentioned in the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Israel has invited France, which has been enjoying good
relations with Lebanon and Syria, for a mediation role on the issue.
</P>
<P>
France has quickly responded to the move in a positive way by
saying it is ready to offer services for any possible negotiation
between Israel and Lebanon or Syria whose Golan Heights is being
occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai is expected to
travel to France on Thursday for discussions with French leaders
on this issue.

<HEADLINE> Khatami: Iran Against Terrorism in Any forms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Monday assured visiting Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
that Tehran would fight against terrorism in any forms.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian nation has suffered a lot from assassinations and
terrorism and is now engaged in a battle against this phenomenon,
Khatami was quoted as saying by the Iranian official news agency
IRNA.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Dini, Khatami announced his "full
readiness to sincerely contribute to the fight against such an
ugly phenomenon" in a hope to uproot all forms of terrorism,
either state terrorism or terrorist moves by individuals and
groups against each other.
</P>
<P>
Terrorism is one of the concerns of the European Union (EU) on
its relations with Iran, which was labeled by some western
countries as one of the main sponsors of state terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The EU also expressed concern over Iran's stance on weapons of
mass destruction, the Middle East peace process and the death
sentence on British writer Salman Rushdie, who was accused of
insulting the Islamic sanctities in his controversial novel "the
Satanic Verses."
</P>
<P>
"We should not fear difference of opinion because all of us
possess logic and any difference of opinion would be settled
through logic," the Iranian president said, adding that Iran is
strongly against use of violence either by governments against
other nations or by people against other people in order to
advance their objectives.
</P>
<P>
Assassination and violence result only in hatred, which is
devastating, he noted, efforts should be made to uproot such evil
acts from the face of the earth.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also lauded Italy for its "fair and realistic stance"
at the international forums, saying that Italy is considered by
Iran as a country with which Iran can build cooperation and open
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tehran and Rome should make use of the
opportunity available to expand bilateral relations in various
fields, adding that he was optimistic about the prospect of
Tehran-Rome relations in view of the two sides' good will.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Italian foreign minister said that during his
stay in Iran, he witnessed many realities and realized new
approaches in Iran's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that talks and tolerance were two basic keys to
promoting cooperation and Iran and Italy can play an effective
role in guaranteeing world stability by using the two
above-mentioned factors.
</P>
<P>
Dini also called on President Khatami to persuade Iraq to
respect the accords recently reached with the United Nations and
to strive for realization of peace and tranquility in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
The Italian foreign minister arrived here last Saturday for an
official visit at the invitation of his Iranian counterpart Kamal
Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
His visit is the first of its kind since the EU decided to
resume contacts with Iran at the ministerial level last Monday,
which were banned last April after a German court rule accused
Iranian leaders of sponsoring state terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Rift Valley Fever Kills 4 Tanzanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The deadly Rift Valley
Fever (RVF) has killed four people in Tanzania, and livestocks in
four districts of the country have been put under quarantine.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Ole Njoolay, Arusha Regional Commissioner, told
reporters Monday that the government and public are making joint
efforts to contain the disease, which causes haemorrhagic
fever-like illness.
</P>
<P>
He said the four who died are from Loliondo and that
investigations are underway to track people who may become
victims of the fever, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Districts under quarantine include Monduli, Ngorongoro,
Simanjiro and Hai where the disease was first detected last
month.
</P>
<P>
Blood samples of both animals and human beings confirmed that
the disease had spread from Kenya, he said.
</P>
<P>
RVF virus is mainly transmitted by mosquitoes. Humans can also
be infected by contact with blood or body fluids from infected
animals which may occur during slaughtering of the animals or
handling aborted foetuses, World Health Organization (WHO)
officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, the risk of human-to-human infection through direct
contact appears to be very low, they said.
</P>
<P>
Teams from WHO have arrived in Kenya to reinforce
international efforts to determine the causes and extent of the
outbreak of the RVF in northeastern Kenya and southern Somalia
where the disease has claimed more than 480 lives.

<HEADLINE> EU Grants More Aid for Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission President
Jacques Santer announced in Belfast Monday night an extra 100
million ECU (about 109 million U.S. dollars) aid for Northern
Ireland in a bid to bring permanent peace back to the region.
</P>
<P>
Santer, who is on a two-day visit to Northern Ireland, said the
new donation was a fresh effort to intensify a European Union (EU)
program designed to boost economic cooperation between the north
and south of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc's Peace and Reconciliation Program
originally provided 300 million ECU (about 309 million dollars) to
help regenerate deprived areas on both sides of the border between
1994 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a donation ceremony in Belfast, Santer paid tribute
to both the British and Irish governments for being "imaginative"
in brokering the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also called on all parties concerned in the Norther Ireland
peace talks to resolve their differences through peaceful
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"The history of the European Union is the story of people who
for centuries were enemies. Yet we have seen how history has
dramatically changed for the better," Santer said.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps the history of the European Union can provide some
hope and a reference point for the people of Northern Ireland as
you press for peace," he added.

<HEADLINE> SADC Special Session Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The special session of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) ended here Monday
with the decision to reform its regional political, defense and
security institutions.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano,
deputy chairman of SADC, after the meeting at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
A working group was set up to give the exact definition on the
regional defense and security agency, he said, adding the group
which consists of heads of state and government of some SADC
members, will also define the relationship between the agency and
SADC.
</P>
<P>
According to Chissano, the agency is aimed at seeking for
peaceful solutions for various issues which might affect regional
security, and studying on possible cooperation with other regions
in Africa to secure peace on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also ruled to enhance sanctions on Angola's former
rebel movement, the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) because it has not abided by the 1994 Lusaka peace
accord which ends the 19 years of civil war in the country.
</P>
<P>
On the Comoros crisis, which is high on the agenda of the
meeting, the president said, "SADC does not accept any sessionist
activities, we don't want a case like that in Africa."
</P>
<P>
Anjouan, one of the islands of the Comoros, wants to secede
from its motherland and become part of France or independent.
</P>
<P>
The session presided over by South African President Nelson
Mandela, had drawn leaders from fourteen SADC member states.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Surviving, Functioning Despite Embargo: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's President Pierre
Buyoya said in Kinshasa that his country is surviving and
functioning despite a regional economic embargo, the U.N.
humanitarian information unit IRIN reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya asserted that the trade embargo imposed on his central
African country by regional states to protest his 1996 coup would
disappear after failing to cripple Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"We've made efforts to survive the embargo. We've survived
it," he told Kinshasa television Sunday after meeting President
Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
"Burundi is standing despite 20 months of economic sanctions.
We think this situation will disappear soon," Buyoya added.
</P>
<P>
East and central African leaders decided at a summit in
Kampala last month to uphold sanctions until Burundi made more
progress toward returning to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
The summit gave Buyoya a rare chance to press his case for the
easing of sanctions. But he stormed out of the Ugandan capital
after he knew the sanctions would remain.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya said his talks with Kabila had been fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Burundi radio before his departure, he said the
purpose of the visit was to explore bilateral issues including
security and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Armed Hutu Militia Free 80 Genocide Suspects in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Reports from Rwanda's central
Gitarama Prefecture, south of the capital Kigali, indicated that
the situation has returned to normal after the attack on
Nyakabanda commune Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Around 2,000 militiamen armed with guns and traditional
weapons stormed the local Nyakabanda prison and released over 80
genocide suspects, Rwanda News Agency said, in a special dispatch
to Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
"So far, only three suspects have reported back to
authorities," one official from the area was quoted by Rwanda
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that among the 80 prisoners released were 15
women. The other 300 prisoners detained in other cells were not
attacked, thanks to the intervention of security forces.
</P>
<P>
The assailants are said to have torched the mayor's house and
killed the local assistant-bourgmaster or mayor, whose name has
not been given, and two other people.
</P>
<P>
This brings the number of people killed to 20, including 17
militiamen. There has been no definite death toll of the attack.
</P>
<P>
No number of casualty was given on the government side.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Gitarama also noted that there has been a lot of
damages on property. A number of houses belonging to local
residents were set afire, as well as the building of a local
secondary school. Two vehicles were also burnt down by the
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
One health center was also looted, but the drugs were
recuperated by the army in neighboring Bulinga commune.
</P>
<P>
"The local population is now helping the army to track down
the assailants which have been pursued to their harbor in
southern Gisenyi," Prime Minister Pierre Celestin Rwigama told
reporters Monday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Sacked Egyptians Allowed to Return to Qatar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Cairo and Doha have agreed to end
their dispute over the Egyptian workers who have been dismissed by
the Qatari government, the Middle East News Agency reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Manpower and Immigration Ahmed el-Amawi
and Qatari Minister of Housing and Civil Services Sheikh Falah Bin
Jassem al-Thani signed an agreement on settling the issue on
Sunday, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
As the first step in carrying out the agreement, Qatar allowed
150 Egyptians, whose contracts have been ended ahead of their
legal time limit, to return to the Gulf emirate.
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 Egyptians are living in Qatar. Since November
1996, hiring Egyptians was banned by the Qatari authorities after
Egypt was alleged to be involved in a failed coup in Doha in
February 1996.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two Arab states were worsened in
November 1997 when Egypt expressed opposition to the Middle East
and North Africa Economic Conference held in Doha. Since then,
about 160 Egyptians have been fired.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by Qatar's latest move, Egypt's Trade Union
Federation has decided to freeze a complaint it has filed against
Qatar with the 25th Arab Labor Conference, which started its
proceedings in the southern Egyptian city of Luxor in the day.
</P>
<P>
"The two ministers have discussed means to promote cooperation
between the two sides and enable the Egyptian workers to get their
pay back," Sayyed Rashed, chairman of the federation told
reporters on the fringes of the conference.
</P>
<P>
They have agreed that any other pending problems related to
Egyptian workers in Qatar will be resolved, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also reached another agreement to assess the
prospects of reopening the Qatari job market to Egyptians, the
union chairman said.
</P>
<P>
A thaw seems to be emerging between the two countries as
Egypt has said to attend a meeting of the eight-member Damascus
Declaration Signatory States in Doha this month.

<HEADLINE> European Shares End at New Record Closing Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
sustained their last week's rally and all stormed to new record
closing highs Monday, boosted by those bullish factors such as a
strong dollar, hopes of steady or lower interest rates, takeover
fever and strong institutional liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading shares closed up 53.3
points or 0.92 percent at a new high of 5,820.6, also its third
consecutive record closing high, but below a fresh intra-day peak
of 5,846.9, helped by positive news from the British conglomerate
BTR Plc and a renewed bid for the Energy Group.
</P>
<P>
BTR announced plans to distribute 2 billion pounds (3.3 billion
U.S. dollars) among its shareholders after the sale of its packing
business, reflecting the success of its disposals program.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that shares in the Energy Group climbed 3.5
percent after the U.S. group Texas Utilities launched a
long-awaited 810 pence a share bid.
</P>
<P>
Germany's DAX-30 index also surged ahead, ending at 4,736.74
points, 26.91 points or 0.57 percent higher, encouraged by
advances on other European bourses and fueled by gains for the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that the firm bond market was also a driving force
behind the gains, with some scattered corporate news generating
particular interest.
</P>
<P>
Paris has a similar story, with the CAC-40 index also setting a
record close at 3,446.70, up 24.78 points or 0.72 percent,
building on last week's near 5 percent gain and lifted by
spill-over bullishness from Wall Street and robust Asian markets,
but ended below a fresh life high.

<HEADLINE> Rubin: Mondale's Mission not to Ask Suharto to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin said on Monday that former Vice President Walter Mondale's
mission to Indonesia was to continue previous talks between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Indonesian President Suharto, but not
to ask President Suharto to quit.
</P>
<P>
In answering a reporter's question whether Mondale, President
Bill Clinton's special envoy to Indonesia, would suggest that
Suharto should step down, Rubin said: "It's plain and simple:
not true."
</P>
<P>
He said Mondale's mission was to continue previous talks
between Clinton and Suharto "with respect to the political and
economic issues involved in restoring confidence" rather than to
talks about the second tranche of an International Monetary Fund
reform program.
</P>
<P>
"That (a second tranche) is not the purpose of his mission,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Indonesia needed to follow through on the reforms
and also suggested that a recent policy initiative by Suharto,
dubbed "IMF-plus," had not been discussed with Washington in advance.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the idea is," Rubin said. "it's a little
bit hard to analyze something and evaluate and react to it if
you haven't seen it. The key ... with Indonesia, as with any
country with these kinds of problems, is to, on a sustained
basis, stay with an effective reform program."

<HEADLINE> Mkapa Calls for Coop in Developing Nile River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian president
Benjamin Mkapa today called on the 10 Nile Basin countries to
seal an agreement to exploit the Nile River waters for their
development.
</P>
<P>
In his speech read by Tanzanian Minister for Waters Pius
Ng'wandu, Mkapa told the meeting of representatives from six of
the 10 Nile Basin countries in Tanzania's northern city of
Arusha, that the Nile waters should help foster cooperation
instead of causing conflict among the Basin countries.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who is at a Summit of the Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC) in Maputo, Mozambique, said the prominent thing
is to develop a shared vision geared at eradicating poverty,
upgrading conservation and forging harmony in the basin.
</P>
<P>
"We must create a climate of trust among ourselves," Mkapa
said. "We should aim now at achieving real progress moving from
dialogue and planning to implementation."
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian president also appealed for external financial
and technical support for the Nile Basin countries which include
Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Tanzania,
Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Six ministers in charge of water affairs were present at the
opening session of the sixth meeting of their Council while their
counterparts from Rwanda, Congo (K), Burundi and Eritrea were
expected to join them later.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Confidant to Testify on Lewinsky Matter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Vernon Jordan, a confidant of
U.S. President Bill Clinton, is expected to testify Tuesday before
a grand jury investigating an alleged affair between Clinton and
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Jordan said Clinton and Lewinsky assured him there was
no sexual relationship. Jordan said he helped Lewinsky find a job
at the request of Clinton's private secretary, Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's attorney, William Ginsburg, told United Press
International that his client approached Jordan for help in early
November, well before she was named as a witness in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment case.
</P>
<P>
UPI quoted Ginsburg as saying he believes Jordan helped
Lewinsky because "he's a nice fellow," not to buy her silence.
</P>
<P>
Asked if it appeared odd that one of Washington's most
influential lawyers, and a friend of the president of the United
States, would meet and speak repeatedly with a former intern,
Ginsburg said, "That statement reflects the `celebrity mentality'
of this country. Just because someone has power, doesn't mean they
change. They can still be nice people," according to the UPI
report.
</P>
<P>
According to tapes recorded covertly by Linda Tripp, Lewinsky
told her that Jordan suggested she deny her relationship with
Clinton. Ginsburg said, "Linda Tripp should be in jail. She's a
sad, sad human being. I firmly believe what she did was illegal,
unethical, and un-American," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Burundi: FAO Warns of Impending Famine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- An FAO representative in
Bujumbura has warned of impending famine in Burundi, the U.N.
humanitarian information unit IRIN said in a press release here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Famine is here... possibly to stay as production has dropped
nationwide by more than 20 percent compared to normal years," FAO
official Joseph Tchikaya was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tchikaya said if there was no supplementary food aid,
malnutrition could intensify and many people risked death.
</P>
<P>
East and Central African states clamped a trade embargo on
Burundi in August, 1996 to protest a coup led by Pierre Buyoya,
and leaders of these states decided at a summit in Kampala last
month to uphold sanctions until Burundi made more progress toward
returning to civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
A statement released after the summit said the embargo, aimed
at cutting off vital oil imports, and exports of Burundi's hard
currency-earning tea and coffee crops, would remain in place
until Burundi improved internal conditions.
</P>
<P>
The conditions include beginning talks with Hutu opposition
groups within and outside Burundi, stopping political trials
until peace talks are under way, restoring security so that
internally displaced people can return home, and freeing
political prisoners held without charge.
</P>
<P>
Burundi Foreign Minister Luc Rukingama Friday appealed for
aid to help make up a shortfall of 300,000 tons of beans, rice
and bananas.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Ignore Call for Weakening it </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian former President
Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere Monday urged African countries to
ignore the call emanating from the north for the weakening of
African states.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address to the Conference on Governance in
Africa which opened here Monday morning, Nyerere said, "Our
states are so weak and anemic already that it would almost amount
to a crime to weaken them further."
</P>
<P>
"One result of weakening the state can be observed in Somalia.
There are many potential Somalias in Africa if we heed the
northern call to weaken the state," he warned.
</P>
<P>
"We have a duty to strengthen the African states almost in
every respect you can think of. One of the objectives of
improving the governance of our countries is to strengthen the
African state and thus enable it to serve the people of Africa
better," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to Nyerere, the key to a government's effectiveness
and its ability to lead the nation lies in a combination of its
closeness to its people, its responsiveness to their needs and
demands, its ability to coordinate, and the efficiency of the
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere referred to the criteria for a nation being defined as
"good governance" by the north as a tool for neo-colonialism,
which includes the so-called multi-party systems of democracy,
economies based on the principle of private ownership, and of
international free trade and a good record of human rights.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Africans need to improve governance
everywhere in Africa in order to enable African people to build
real freedom and real development for themselves and their
countries.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that African states, individually and in cooperation
with one another, can move toward "good governance" step by step
and in an ordered fashion.

<HEADLINE> Canadia's Economy Grows 3.8 Percent Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Canada's real gross domestic
product (GDP) grew 3.8 percent in 1997, its best performance since
1994 and second best this decade, Statistics Canada reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Final domestic demand jumped 4.4 percent, as consumer spending
and business investment were bolstered by low interest rates, low
inflation and brighter job and business prospects, the statistics
agency said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, personal expenditure on consumer goods and services
advanced 3.9 percent, led by an 11.9 percent increase in spending
on durable goods.
</P>
<P>
"Low interest rates and robust sales of new dwellings,
especially single family homes, spurred purchases of big-ticket
items such as furniture, household appliances and motor vehicles,"
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
While Canada's personal income was up slightly for the year,
the personal saving rate fell to a low of 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Individual Canadians have also become net borrowers, when
traditionally the personal sector has been a net lender to the
rest of the economy, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, corporation profits rebounded 17.3 percent,
returning to the double-digit gains seen between 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
With the torrid pace of investment, the country's corporate
sector returned to its more traditional position of net borrower
from the rest of the economy in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Canada's surplus on goods and services trade fell to
15.1 billion Canadian dollars (10.5 billion U.S. dollars), less
than half its 1996 level.
</P>
<P>
Its exports of goods and services were up 8.6 percent, while
its import jumped 13.4 percent, the biggest increase since 1988.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean President Unveils List of Cabinet Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
Tuesday unveiled a delayed lineup of 17 cabinet members amid the
country's financial crisis and political instability.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong-pil, honorary chairman of the United Liberal Democrats
(ULD), was named as acting prime minister after the National
Assembly, or parliament, failed to vote over his nomination as
prime minister Monday.
</P>
<P>
President Kim, whose administration has been without a cabinet
for a week due to the partisan dispute over Kim Jong-pil, named
the 17 ministers at the recommendation of outgoing Prime Minister
Koh Kun in an apparent attempt to minimize challenge to his moves
currently being shrouded in legal disputes.
</P>
<P>
Lee Kyu-sung, a professor of Kunyang University and former
finance minister in Roh Tae-woo's government, was named as finance
and economy minister while Park Chung-soo, a lawmaker of the
ruling National Congress for New Politics (NCNP), as foreign
affairs and trade minister.
</P>
<P>
Kang In-duck, a former intelligence official and head of the
Institute for East Asian Studies, was named as national
unification minister while Cheon Yong-taek of the NCNP, a retired
general, as defense minister. Both are a surprise for the public.
</P>
<P>
Hahn Seung-hun, a lawyer, was designated as acting chairman of
the Board of Audit and Inspection.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet is mainly dominated by politicians as it
includes seven former and incumbent legislators from the NCNP and
five from its coalition partner, the ULD.
</P>
<P>
Besides the retention of Labor Minister Lee Ki-ho of the
previous government, the cabinet list also included a few more
surprises.
</P>
<P>
Those recruited from outside the political community included
Information and Communication Minister Bae Soon-hoon, a top
executive of Daewoo Business Group, and Agriculture and Forestry
Minister Kim Sung-hoon, a professor of the Chungang University.
</P>
<P>
Former and incumbent NCNP lawmakers commissioned as cabinet
members are Park Sang-cheon at the Ministry of Justice, Kim
Jung-kil at the Ministry of Government Administration and Local
Autonomy and Lee Hae-chan at the Education Ministry, Park
Tae-young at the Ministry of Industry and Energy and Shin Nak-yun
at the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
Kang Chang-hee, secretary general of the ULD who headed the
list of five party members joining the Kim Dae-jung administration
under a power-sharing accord reached last December for winning the
presidential race, was named as science and technology minister.
</P>
<P>
Other ULD cabinet members are Kim Sun-kil at the Ministry of
Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Choi Jae-wook at the Ministry of
Environment, Joo Yang-ja at the Ministry of Heath and Welfare and
Lee Jung-moo at the Ministry of Construction and Transportation.
</P>
<P>
Shin and Joo are the only female appointees, falling short of
the president's promise to give 20 percent of cabinet posts to
women.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Park Jie-won said Tuesday that vice
ministerial appointments, including the new director of the Agency
for National Security Planning, would be made public later this
week.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Deputies on Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong deputies to the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) shared the view that Hong Kong
has experienced a stable economic and social development since its
return to the embrace of the motherland on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Chan Wing-kee, a Hong Kong industrialist,
the majority of Hong Kong residents feel no change in the social
system and the way of life in Hong Kong except the transfer of
power and a change of flags since July 1, 1997 and except the fact
that Hong Kong affairs are now managed by Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
With what it has done, the central government has demonstrated
that it has strictly implemented the principles of "one country,
two systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high
degree of autonomy for Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) has stood the test of Asian financial crisis proves that
Hong Kong people, who are working as masters of their own house,
can run their own affairs well.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Kan Fook-yee, a member of the Provisional Legislative
Council, said that a growing number of Hong Kong people who
earlier emigrated elsewhere have been returning to Hong Kong since
its return to the motherland, demonstrating people's growing
confidence in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Developments in Hong Kong in the past eight months testify to
the correctness of the "one country, two systems" policy and Hong
Kong people have full confidence in the future of Hong Kong, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Tam Wai-chu, deputy leader of the Hong Kong delegation,
said all principal officials of Hong Kong's previous government
have continued to serve the HKSAR after the transfer of power. The
HKSAR is operating well, the Court of Final Appeal has been
established smoothly and the Provisional Legislative Council has
done a great deal of legislative work necessary for the normal
operation of the HKSAR, she said.
</P>
<P>
The deputies are here to attend the first session of the Ninth
NPC, which is scheduled to begin on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Appoints Kokoshin New Security Council Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Andrei Kokoshin, Russia's chief
military inspector, was appointed Tuesday by President Boris
Yeltsin as new head of the nation's Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a briefing in the
Kremlin that the Defense Council where Kokoshin served as
secretary was abolished by the president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chief Military Inspectorate was integrated into
the Security Council, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Kokoshin was born in Moscow in 1945 and graduated from the
Bauman Higher Technical school as a computer engineer in 1969.
</P>
<P>
After finishing graduate studies in the United States and
Canada, he became deputy director of Academy of Sciences in the
former Soviet Union in 1984.
</P>
<P>
In April 1992, Kokoshin was appointed as first deputy defense
minister. He has been state secretary and first deputy defense
minister since January 1996.
</P>
<P>
Former secretary of the Russian Security Council, Ivan Rybkin,
was appointed as deputy prime minister on Monday.

<HEADLINE> HK's Special Legal Status Under Basic Law Highlighted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Over 200 multilateral treaties
have been extended to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), highlighting Hong Kong's special legal status provided
for in the Basic Law, a Hong Kong law officer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The treaties that apply to Hong Kong "cover a wide range of
matters including civil aviation, customs, narcotics, health,
human rights, private international law and merchant shipping,"
said David Little, a law officer (International Law) of the
Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
He said 40 percent of these treaties do not apply in the rest
of China.
</P>
<P>
All these treaties are important to Hong Kong and they play a
vital role in facilitating its legal and commercial links with the
international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
"So does Hong Kong's participation in a number of international
organizations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has joined the World Trade Organization on its own.
It also participates in the Asian Development Bank, the World
Health Organization, the World Customs Organization, the
International Maritime Organization and the World Intellectual
Property Organization, among others.
</P>
<P>
Further more, Hong Kong, unlike other cities, has its own
bilateral international agreements with foreign governments. "Few
people realize, for example, that Hong Kong has its own network of
investment protection and promotion agreements with trading
nations," Little said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has already signed with some countries or regions
about 50 agreements on air services, investment protection and
promotion, the surrender of fugitive offenders, mutual legal
assistance and the transfer of sentenced persons, he said.
</P>
<P>
All these kinds of legal arrangements are "provided for under
the Basic Law," Little noted. The HKSAR government is authorized
to enter into binding agreements with foreign states and
international organizations in the appropriate fields.
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" concept "has given a unique
status to Hong Kong," Little said. "This has been by no means a
simple feat, but is an attribute of Hong Kong's high degree of
autonomy that has been accepted by the international community."

<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- New faces make up half the
participants in the First Session of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
whereas fewer grey-haired were seen in the Great Hall of the
People, where the First Session of the Ninth CPPCC National
Committee was held today.
</P>
<P>
A reporter, who has covered the CPPCC sessions on a number of
occasions, said it is very hard to find old acquaintances for
interviews as there are too many new comers."
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhengmin, a reputed member of the CPPCC National Committee
who has witnessed the development of the CPPCC for half a century,
chatted delightly with some CPPCC members of his age in the East
Lounge of the Great Hall before the session began. Seeing one
after another young CPPCC members passing by, he was pleased at the
replacement of the olderly by younger members, which show that
the cause of the CPPCC has a contingent of successors.
</P>
<P>
A drastic rise in the recruitment of young CPPCC members has
reduced the average age of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee by
about two years.
</P>
<P>
The current CPPCC session included over 40 entrepreneurs from
the non-public sectors, some 20 more than in the preceding
session. This demonstrates that the non-public sector has been
playing a more important role in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Experts, rather than film and TV stars, are news-makers of the
current session. a crowd of reporters in the eastern lounge, are
seen looking for and chasing scholars and experts majored in the
fields of economy, science and technology and education for
possible interviews.
</P>
<P>
Take Gao Shangquan, a noted economist and vice-president of the

<HEADLINE> Iran, Turkmenistan Call for Caspian Legal Regime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Turkmenistan on Tuesday
called for expedition of the process of formulating a Caspian Sea
legal regime to settle disputes among littoral states, according
to Iran's official news agency.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi met with his Turkmen
counterpart Boris Shikhmuradov, who arrived here Monday on an
official visit, to focus on the issue of Caspian.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said only a sole legal regime acceptable to all
Caspian states could secure the desirable and legitimate
exploitation of resources as well as shipping in the sea.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers believed any unilateral exploitation of the
sea resources was against the interests of all states bordering
the world's largest lake, and vowed to continue bilateral
consultations over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Energy Experts said the Caspian has proven reserves of up to 16
billion barrels of oil and 8.3 trillion cubic meters of natural
gas. Disputes over the rights to exploit the wealth have erupted
among the five littoral states - Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia,
Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which opposed unilateral actions, has proposed setting up
a legal regime governing the Caspian. The legal regime, it said,
should be based on the Treaty of Amity concluded between Iran and
Russia in 1921 and the Commerce and Navigation Agreement it struck
with the former Soviet Union in 1940.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi visited Moscow last week to coordinate stance on the
Caspian issue with Russian officials. But there were no details of
the result of his mission.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan, which has vast gas reserves in its huge basin
below the desert, is probing to the possibility of lay a pipeline
through Iran to export gas. This topic was taken up by the two
ministers in their talks Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
They also reviewed further expansion of bilateral and regional
cooperation in political, economic, trade and oil fields, and
discussed the preparation for the forthcoming visit of Turkmen
President Saparmurad Niyazov to Tehran. However, no exact date was
given for the visit.

<HEADLINE> Peasant Woman Proud of Being NPC Deputy for Nine Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Shen Jilan, a peasant woman from
Shanxi Province and a deputy to the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC), said she feels proud to serve as an NPC deputy for
nine terms.
</P>
<P>
Shen was elected a deputy to the First NPC in 1954 when the
people's congress system was established. And she has been elected
to the NPC of all succeeding terms ever then. She is here to
attend the Ninth NPC's first session, which is to begin on coming
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the years, Shen has been cited as a model worker by
central and local governments on many occasions.
</P>
<P>
"Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can we
ordinary peasants have the right to be masters of our own
affairs," she said.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, she has put forward many proposals relating to
agriculture, water conservation and tree planting. Many of her
proposals have attracted the attention of the government, she said.
</P>
<P>
At the Fourth Session of the Eighth NPC in 1996, President
Jiang Zemin joined discussions with deputies from Shanxi
Province. Shen Jilan talked about the importance of having
enough food grains and the importance of agriculture as
peasants' lifeblood.
</P>
<P>
Shaking hands with her, the president said he appreciated her
proposal, Shen Jilan recalled.
</P>
<P>
"I think the people's congress system is the best form of
democracy, through which people can express their opinions to the
central authorities while the central authorities work out major
policies on the basis of public opinion," the deputy said.
</P>
<P>
"As long as I serve as a deputy to the NPC, I will speak on
behalf of the people," she said.

<P>
KUNMING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A new thermal power plant in
Qujing, southwest China's Yunnan Province, recently entered
operations following successful trial operations of its first
300,000 kw generator.
</P>
<P>
The plant plans to invest 2.94 billion yuan to install two
300,000 kw generators during the first phase construction. A
second 300,000 kw generator is expected to enter operations by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The plant is expected to ease power shortages which are
especially pronounced during the dry season.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan's installed generating capacity hit 6.18 million kw by
the end of 1997, with hydroelectric facilities accounting for over
70 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The province supplies power to other provinces during the rainy
season, but nonetheless faces severe local power shortages during
the dry season. The undesirable situation has prompted the
province to accelerate the construction of thermal power plants.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Brunei's Sultan Sir Muda Hassanal
Bolkiah is to arrive here Wednesday night for a two-day private
visit to the Philippines, the Philippine News Agency reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the sultan will meet Philippine President
Fidel Ramos to discuss the proposed trading system among members
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) using
regional currencies instead of the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The president and the sultan are also expected to discuss the
two countries' bilateral relations, especially economic
cooperation, trade and investment in the wake of the regional
financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Press Secretary Hector Villanueva said the sultan's
trip to Manila is "more of a goodwill visit because the sultan
wants to reciprocate previous visits of the president to Brunei."
</P>
<P>
Ramos went to Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei's capital in October
1992 for a social visit, and he paid a state visit to Brunei in
August 1994. Two years later, Ramos was there acting as one of the
principal sponsors at the wedding of the sultan's eldest daughter.
</P>
<P>
Sultan Bolkiah visited Manila in 1991 at the invitation of
former president Corazon Aquino, and in November 1996 for the
fourth Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' informal
meeting.

<HEADLINE> New Port of Entry Opens on Sino-Russian Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A new highway port of entry opened
earlier this week on the Sino-Russian border.
</P>
<P>
The facility links international highways leading to Manzhouli
in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Russian city of
Zabajkal'jesk City. The port features eight lanes capable of
handling one million tons of cargo and 1.2 million passengers
annually. First phase construction was completed at a cost of 35
million yuan (4.22 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Russia invested 30 million US dollars for construction
of the new port facility.
</P>
<P>
Manzhouli is a major border city linking China with the
Commonwealth of Independent States and countries in eastern
Europe. The port was constructed to relieve the stress of the
600,000 tons of cargo and 800,000 people handled by other ports of
entry in 1997.

<P>
Overseas investment has poured in at a daily rate of 8.3
million U.S. dollars since the Pudong New Area was announced in
April of 1990, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
The overseas-financed companies -- which are generally
large-scale with improved structure, highly advanced technology
and high paid-in investment rate -- have an aggregate investment
of 24 billion dollars, involving a contractual use of 15.6 billion
dollars of overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
The Jinqiao Export Processing Zone of Pudong, for instance, has

MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
Tuesday approved the release of 3 million pesos (75,000 U.S.
dollars) for ongoing emergency operations to contain a malaria

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2,070 Chinese and
foreign reporters have applied to cover the First Session of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) and the First Session of
the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
They include 209 reporters from the Hong Kong Special

<HEADLINE> Israeli Jets Strike Hezbollah Positions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Air force (IAF) jet
fighters struck Tuesday morning several Hezbollah (Party of God)
positions in south Lebanon in its fight against "terrorism," an
IAF announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Two IAF jet fighters launched their air raids on the Hezbollah
positions around the Soujud area in the northeast of the Israeli
self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon and all fighters
returned to their air base safely, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The fighters fired eight rockets and all hit the targets
correctly, it added.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the IAF jet fighters have
constantly been conducting air raids on Hezbollah positions in
the security zone due to the intensified armed conflicts between
Israeli Defense Force (IDF) and Lebanese resistance groups such as
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, four IAF paratroopers were lightly wounded when
they helped repulse an attack by Hezbollah gunmen on the South
Lebanese Army's Ghazlan outpost in the northeastern sector of the
security zone.
</P>
<P>
At least three of the Hezbollah attackers were killed by IDF
soliders during the Friday encounter, including one who was shot
while trying to raise Hezbollah's flag on the outpost.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, three IDF soldiers, two from the Givati Brigade
and the other from the intelligence corps, were killed when a
mortar round exploded directly outside their observation post at
the Karkum position in the western sector of the security zone.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security zone in south Lebanon was carved out in
1985 to protect its northern towns from guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Facing the tense military situation in south Lebanon, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered on Sunday to pullout
the IDF troops if the Lebanese government provides the requisite
security backup under the U.N. Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
But his proposal has reportedly been rejected by the Lebanese
side.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Resolution 425 was adopted in 1978,
which calls on Israel to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon
unconditionally.

JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny
Naveh and Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat met here
Tuesday to narrow the gaps between the two sides in the peace
talks, but no progress was made.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Naveh and Erekat discussed the opening

Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Erakat said after the meeting that Israeli and Palestinian

</P>
<P>
This was the second meeting between Naveh and Erekat in two
days. They also met Monday night in the residence of the
U.S. ambassador in Israel, and ended their talks inconclusively.

<HEADLINE> Rita Fan: "One Country, Two Systems" Successful in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- What happened in Hong Kong in the
past eight months proves successful the Chinese government's
concepts of "one country, two systems", and "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" with a high-degree autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai, a deputy from Hong Kong to the First
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's new
legislature which opens Thursday, made these remarks here today.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in history that Hong Kong has sent a
separate 35-member delegation to the annual session of the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has run its administrative, legislative and judicial
affairs quite smoothly, maintained social stability and steady
economic growth, and withheld the impact of the financial crisis
in Southeast Asia since China resumed the exercise of sovereignty
over it on July 1 last year, according to Rita Fan, also president
of the Provisional Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
"The prospects for Hong Kong remain quite rosy," she said.
"Hong Kong has set an excellent example for Macao's return to the
motherland next year and the complete accomplishment of the
country's future peaceful reunification."
</P>
<P>
She noted that Hong Kong SAR has, over the past eight months,
preserved its original social, economic systems, way of life and
basic laws, with no interference by the central government in its
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she acknowledged, the central government has rendered
support to Hong Kong in an all-out way, especially during the
financial crisis in the Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong needs the cooperation and support of the interior
areas to maintain its current status as an international finance,
trade and shipping center and be even more competitive in the
global economy," she added.
</P>
<P>
She pointed to the fact that while Hong Kong has preserved and
further developed its capitalist system and free economy, the
interior areas are effecting an economic shift toward the market
economy under the socialist system.
</P>
<P>
"We should make every effort to retain the characteristics of
both systems, and share our useful experience," she said.
</P>
<P>
She went on to say that it is a rare opportunity for her to be
elected to the NPC and come for the legislature's annual session.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I can have a better understanding of the reforms and
development in the interior areas and make new friends during the
session. Upon my return, I will introduce the session and other
latest developments in the interior to the public," Rita Fan said.

<HEADLINE> North China's Quake-Stricken County Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Zhangbei County, 400 km north of
Beijing, is fast rebuilding itself after being hit by a
magnitude-6.2 earthquake last January. More than 40,000 homeless
people from 16,000 households are expected to move into new homes
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to Luo Quanzhong, a deputy to the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) who comes from the county and is here to
attend the NPC's first session, a total of 39,500 houses with a
combined floor space of 684,000 square meters will be built in the
county before the end of the year. Most damaged houses will be
repaired before the year end, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, all the 130,000 earthquake-stricken people
in the county will have their houses repaired or rebuilt, he said.
</P>
<P>
Luo said most of the funds for reconstruction are coming from
the government, with quake-stricken people bearing part of the
cost in accordance with their financial capabilities.
</P>
<P>
By now, all roads, telecom facilities, power supply and
irrigation facilities in the county's stricken area have been
repaired. The four hospitals in the county town have resumed
operation. All the 397 primary and middle schools in the most
seriously hit towns and townships will open for classes on March 5
as scheduled, he said.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake, which hit Zhangbei and other three counties on
January 10, claimed 49 lives and injured 470,000 people. Total
damages caused by the quake amount to 2.4 billion yuan and those
in Zhangbei reach 1.5 billion yuan.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Security Council warned Iraq that it faces "the
severest consequences" if it breaks the agreement worked out by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan for U.N. inspectors to search for
hidden weapons without obstruction.
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates said tht if the
Justice Department prevails in a legal battle to block the
company's ability to add new features to its Windows software,
Microsoft "will be replaced" as a technology industry leader.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Security Council unanimously endorsed
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's agreement with Iraq. But a
majority of Security Council members -- led by China, France and
Russia -- rebuffed the United States by holding out against any
explicit threat, particularly wording that would appear to give a
green light to an American attack in the event Iraq violates the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton took aim at a Republican proposal to
abolish the current Federal tax code by the end of 2001, calling
it an irresponsible gimmick that could endanger the nations'
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Fresh inflation figures from three of Asia's battered
economies indicate that the region's financial crisis hasn't
stabilized, despite mounting optimism that -- with the exception
of Indonesia -- the worst is over.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. manufacturing sector grew at a faster rate in
February despite the Asian financial crisis, according to a
survey of purchasing managers. But question remains where, when
and to what extent the Asian storm clouds would move across the
Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Current Account Deficit Rises 22 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia's current account
deficit rose by 22 percent in the last three months of 1997 to
5.736 billion Australian dollars (3.87 billion U.S. dollars),
official figures released Tuesday showed.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
also showed Australia's foreign debts in 1997 rose to 222.291
billion Australian dollars (151.15 billion U.S. dollars), up 0.2
percent from the previous quarterly survey.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the current account deficit was attributed to a
turnaround in Australia's trade position from a surplus to a
deficit due to increases in merchandise imports and lower gold
exports during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
But the ABS pointed out that the December quarter's lower gold
exports followed the final installment of a Reserve Bank gold
sell-off in the previous quarter, which saw a 4.7 billion
Australian dollar (3.2 billion U.S. dollars) current account
deficit.
</P>
<P>
Other economic indicators released by the ABS showed a strong
increase in retail trade in January as shoppers took advantage of
the post-Christmas sales.
</P>
<P>
Retail turnover rose 2.1 percent in January compared with the
previous month, and was 5.3 percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Department stores recorded the largest rise in retail sales
during the month, with turnover climbing 6.3 percent over
December.
</P>
<P>
The total number of residential buildings approved in Australia
slipped back 1.5 percent in January.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Province to Construct High-Tech Research Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, an old
industrial center in northeast China, will build four major
high-tech research centers in an effort to revitalize traditional
industries, according to provincial officials.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the provincial commission of science and
technology said that the province will encourage scientific
research institutes and colleges of higher learning in the
province to cooperate extensively with local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning now has one-tenth of China's state-owned large and
medium-sized enterprises. It gradually lagged behind after its
heyday in the 1950s into the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The market share rate of high-tech products manufactured by
Liaoning companies is comparatively low, while the quality of some
locally produced commodities is not high. Rough-finished and
primary products make up 60 percent of the total shipped from
Liaoning to other parts of the country, according to the Liaoning
Provincial Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In setting goals for upgrading this old industrial base,
provincial authorities have put forward a principle of advancing
technology-oriented industries, and using technology to improve
traditional industries and processing primary products.
</P>
<P>
The four high-tech research centers will be the North China New
Materials Research and Development Center, the Liaoning
Information Technology and Development Center, the Liaoning
Advanced Manufacturing Technology Research and Development Center,
and the Liaoning Bio-Engineering Research and Development Center.
</P>
<P>
The province is home to 25 state and provincial engineering
technology centers involving computer software, automation,
numerical control and robots.

<HEADLINE> Kim Jong-pil Appointed S.Korean Acting Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
appointed a controversial figure as acting prime minister Tuesday,
a day after the parliament failed to vote over the same person's
nomination as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"I had no choice but to urgently appoint Kim Jong-pil as acting
prime minister," President Kim told his first press conference
since he took office last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The vote by the National Assembly, or parliament, on the
nomination was suspended Monday when lawmakers from the ruling
coalition of the National Congress, New Politics and United
Liberal Democrats physically clashed with those from the
opposition Grand National Party (GNP).
</P>
<P>
Members of the GNP, which occupies 161 seats at the 299-member
parliament against the ruling coalition's 122 seats, collectively
cast "unmarked" vote slips to veto the nomination.
</P>
<P>
The GNP said Kim Jong-pil, who formed an alliance with Kim
Dae-jung to win the presidential election last December, is not
qualified for the second highest position in the administration to
help the nation overcome the deepening financial crisis and steer
the nation into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, the president called for the public's
understanding to his decision, adding that it was inevitable for
him to end the week-long administrative vacuum.
</P>
<P>
Once served as prime minister, the 72-year-old Kim Jong-pil has
been a political heavyweight for nearly 40 years. He was also the
founder of the nation's Central Intelligence Agency after helping
late President Park Chung-hee mastermind the 1961 coup.
</P>
<P>
President Kim's appeal, however, immediately met strong
reaction from the opposition, which threatened to take all
possible countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
"It is illegal for the president to name an acting prime
minister. We will take all legal and political countermeasures,
including asking the court to issue an injunction to suspend the
premiership," GNP President Cho Soon said.
</P>
<P>
A financial crisis starting late last year due to corporate
failures and bad loans of financial institutions is deepening in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The nation, once the world's 11th largest economic power, has
to restructure its economy under an agreement signed with the
International Monetary Fund for a bailout loan of 57 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country has to return a large part of its
foreign debts of 164 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is the Chinese people's patriotic
united front organization, a key institution of multi-party
cooperation and political consultations under the leadership of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), and a major form to promote
socialist democracy in China's political life.
</P>
<P>
After the victory of the war of resistance against Japanese
Aggression in 1945, the CPC and the Kuomintang decided during
their negotiations in Chongqing to convene a political
consultative conference and organize a new government.
</P>
<P>
The conference was convened on January 10, 1946, and attended
by representatives of the Kuomintang, the CPC, the Democratic
League, the Youth Party and noted figures. In November the same
year, the Kuomintang unilaterally proclaimed the convention of a
"National Assembly" in violation of the resolution of the
political consultative conference.
</P>
<P>
The first plenary session of the CPPCC National Committee was
held in Beijing in September 1949, exercising the functions of the
supreme state bodies on behalf of the state.
</P>
<P>
The session adopted a "Common Program of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference" which bore the nature of a
temporary constitution, proclaiming the founding of the People's
Republic of China (PRC), electing the committee of the Central
People's Government of the PRC with Mao Zedong as its chairman,
and electing the First National Committee of the CPPCC. It also
designated the Chinese capital, national flag and national anthem,
and the way of recording the years.
</P>
<P>
In September 1954, the National People's Congress, the supreme
institution of state power in China, was set up and the CPPCC then
ceased to function on the NPC's behalf. But it continued to exist
as China's patriotic united front organization with broadest
representation and play a vital role in the country's political,
economic, cultural and social affairs and diplomatic exchanges.

central and local governments, key policy decisions concerning the
country's political, economic, cultural and social affairs before
the decisions are made, or main issues involved in the process
of carrying them out.
</P>
<P>
Democratic supervision means supervising, by the means of
offering suggestion and criticism over the implementation of the
China's Constitution, relevant laws, regulations and major
policies, over the work of state organs and their functionaries.
</P>
<P>
The participation in and deliberation of state affairs means to
organize various parties, organizations, people from various
ethnic groups and social sectors to take part in the country's
political, economic, cultural and social life in diversified
forms.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC has the National Committee and local committees, with
a five-year tenure for committee members. A plenary session is
held annually.
</P>
<P>
So far, the CPPCC has had Nine National Committees. Mao Zedong,
Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, Deng Yingchao, Li Xiannian and Li
Ruihuan have served successively as chairmen of the CPPCC National
Committees.

<HEADLINE> India's Major Parties Vow to Form Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- India's major parties vowed
Tuesday to form a new government, although counting of votes from
the general elections is still continuing.
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said it would form a
government at the center by taking support of groups and parties
which are opposed to the Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
According to sources of the Election Commission, 422 seats out
of the 535 were declared at 1600 (local time). The BJP and its
allies secured 181 seats while the Congress and its allies got
139. The United Front won 71 seats and others 31.
</P>
<P>
The remaining seats are expected to be declared late Tuesday or
early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will form the government," said Venkaiah Naidu, BJP general
secretary and spokesman. "What we need is just about 20 more MPs
and there are groups and parties which are committed to
anti-Congressism."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Congress and the main constituents of the
outgoing United Front favored a coalition government of all
secular parties to keep the BJP, labeled "communal forces," and
its allies out of power.
</P>
<P>
Congress General Secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad disclosed on
Tuesday that talks with the United Front on the formation of the
next government had already started, but he declined to give
details.
</P>
<P>
He said the Congress should head the coalition. But the United
Front has said repeatedly that the prime minister post should go
to the party that secures the maximum number of seats in
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Visits Gulf to Push for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan left here
Tuesday morning on a five-day visit to the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) and Oman to explain his initiative to open dialog between
Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The king has expressed the hope that such a dialog will help
dispel the deep-rooted antagonism between the Iraq and the
U.S. and achieve long-term stability in the region, semi-official
Jordan Times Tuesday quoted officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hussein paid his visits following the easing of Baghdad's
tension with the United Nations over weapons inspection, during
which the U.S. threatened to use military force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Direct dialog between the concerned parties is far better and
more productive than dealing through inspectors, monitors or
following police-like methods," the king said here Sunday during
an interview with Radio Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there is a need for dialog to give each party a
chance to offer its views and define its stand," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan Times Tuesday quoted Jordanian officials as saying that
the king proposed the initiative for dialog to U.S. President Bill
Clinton during a recent telephone conversation.
</P>
<P>
The idea needs further development and Washington has not
rejected it yet, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The king is also expected to pursue the initiative with
Clinton during an upcoming meeting between them in Washington
around March 15, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has not made comments about the king's initiative so far.
</P>
<P>
The four-month-long crisis was defused when Iraq struck a deal
with the United Nations on February 23 to averted a U.S.-led
military strike. The deal granted U.N. inspectors unlimited access
to the sites suspected of hiding banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
During the king's visits to UAE, he will meet President Sheikh
Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahayan.
</P>
<P>
From there, he is expected to leave for Muscat on Thursday for
talks with Omani Sultan Qaboos Bin Said.
</P>
<P>
The king is accompanied by Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali,
newly-appointed Chief of Royal Court Fayez Tarawneh as well as
other senior officials.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi Auctions State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The auctioning of some poorly
performing state enterprises in northwest China's Shaanxi Province
has provided more choices to reform the state sector.
</P>
<P>
Twelve small businesses found buyers in last month's auction,
and another 20 have signed contracts to sell property rights
involving 50 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Linwei District of Weinan initiated the activity. A
300-square-meter hall was crowded with nearly 2,000 participants,
including farmers. Farmer Meng Dawei purchased a shop for 101,000
yuan after a competitive round of bidding.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhiguo bought his own factory for 560,000 yuan on behalf of
eight workers. "We were determined to win the auction," Li
said. "We will certainly achieve good results so long as we do our
best, because we have good policies."
</P>
<P>
The district government adopted regulations to guide the
auction, as well as favorable policies to encourage the
effort. One policy allows some net assets of the sold enterprise
to be set aside to any buyer who is willing to accept laid-off
workers.
</P>
<P>
The auction was organized by the provincial Auctioneering
Center. "The whole auction process proved open, fair and just,"
said Hao Yuanxiao, an auctioneer with the center.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Continuing to Dominate World Climate, WMO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The weather phenomenon known as El
Nino has passed its peak in some areas like Australia, but its
influence is likely to continue well into May in some other areas.
</P>
<P>
The destructive phenomenon, said the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) in its special "El Nino Update" released here
Tuesday, dominated climatic conditions in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Triggered by abnormally warm ocean current, El Nino caused
extreme precipitation and severe storms in certain areas, and
exceptionally dry conditions in others, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Based on current conditions in the tropical Pacific, on
official sea-surface temperature predictions, and on results from
historical studies on El Nino's effects, the WMO forecasts:
</P>
<P>
-- Warm episode conditions are expected to continue through
April and to weaken during May-July. Drier-than-normal conditions
are expected over Indonesia, northern South America and parts of
southern Africa during the next few months.
</P>
<P>
-- Wetter-than-normal conditions should continue in central and
eastern equatorial Pacific, along the coasts of Ecuador and
northern Peru, and over south-eastern South America.
</P>
<P>
-- Increased storminess and wetter-than-normal conditions are
expected to continue over California and the southern third of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
-- Warmer-than-normal conditions will persist over much of
central North America.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Conference
of Sister Cities and Municipal Organizations opened here Tuesday
under the shadow of the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
About 700 delegates from over 50 countries participated in
the three-day event to discuss municipal problems at the turn of
the century, ways to enhance international municipal cooperation
and how to contribute to promoting international friendship and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Due to the stalemate in the Israeli-Arab peace process, Arab
cities boycotted the conference and the Palestinian National
Authority only sent three delegates to attend the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the conference, Israeli President Ezer Weizman
extended warm welcome to the Palestinian delegates, while
expressing the hope that in the future Israeli cities and
Palestinian cities would become "warm neighbors."
</P>
<P>
He added that "I would rather see happy neighbors are better
than hungry neighbors."
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opened his speech
with a strong statement that the disputed Jerusalem would remain
the eternal united capital of the Jewish people under Israeli
sovereignty. He, nevertheless, expressed the confidence that
Israel would conclude peace with all Arab neighbors so that
Israeli and Arab cities would become twin cities also.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed the importance of enhancing international
municipal cooperation in the face of an emerging global economy
caused by the drastic changes in modern technology.
</P>
<P>
Eberhard Diepgen, Chairman of International Union of Local
Authorities and Mayor of Cologne of Germany, emphasized the
important role that municipal cooperation has played in promoting
international understanding and exchanges as well as economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He issued a call to Israelis and Palestinians to continue
advancing the peace process on the basis of honoring Oslo
principles and international laws.
</P>
<P>
A strike was observed in the Arab East Jerusalem by
Palestinians to protest Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert's planned tour
of the city with conference participants. Several incidents of
stone-throwing by Palestinians were reported.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference will focus on tackling issues vital to
local governments around the world. Discussion groups will debate
municipal and economic cooperation, youth exchanges, urban
planning and the problems facing metropolitan and capital cities.
</P>
<P>
A seven-member Chinese delegation led by Su Guang, Vice
President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with
Foreign Countries, took part in the conference.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth Ministerial Action
Group (CMAG) began its meeting on Nigeria's transition to civil
rule program Monday in London, with Britain proposing another
CMAG visit to Nigeria to assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are Stan Mduenge, the CMAG chairman and
Zimbabwean foreign minister, British Foreign Office Minister Tony
Lloyd, Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworth and the foreign
ministers of Babados, Botswana, Ghana, Malaysia and New Zealand,
said reports reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Axworth reportedly said that the entire transition program was
tailored towards self-succession, without necessarily
accommodating the views of the opposition or providing a
conductive atmosphere for them to participate.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with just a few months to the August 1
presidential elections, credible candidates are yet to indicate
any interest to contest.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG was put in place shortly after Nigeria was suspended
from the Commonwealth in November 1995, following its execution
of nine minority activists for murder.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG visited Nigeria in November 1996.

The CPPCC National Committee has expanded its functions. The
Second Session of the Eighth National Committee of the CPPCC
adopted a revised Constitution of the CPPCC. According to the
revised Constitution, the CPPCC has the new function of
"participating in the deliberation and administration of state
affairs" in addition to that of "political consultation and
democratic supervision."
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC National Committee also regarded the reporting of
social conditions and popular feelings as one of its essential and
vital functions, he said. It opened up new sources of information,
launched its own information journal, set up offices for the
collection of information and established an information network,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"All these have opened up new channels for informing the
central authorities of social conditions and popular feelings and
offered a wider arena in which our members can participate in the
deliberation and administration of state affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Members of the CPPCC National Committee, local CPPCC
committees, the central committees of democratic parties and the
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce provided over 8,000
pieces of information on social conditions and popular feelings
and forwarded over 59,900 letters to the central leadership over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The country's top advisory body has also made contributions
to promoting unity and stability and to the reunification of the
motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with unified plans of the Chinese government, the
Eighth National Committee of the CPPCC cooperated with relevant
departments in ensuring the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the CPPCC expanded and strengthened
contacts and exchanges with people of all walks of life in Hong
Kong, compatriots in Macao and Taiwan and Chinese residing
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC publicized and adhered to the principled stand that
there is only one China in the world. It is opposed to splittism,
"independence of Taiwan," attempts to create "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan." And it promoted economic and cultural
exchanges and cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.
</P>
<P>
It has also done a great deal to accelerate the establishment
of direct postal, air and shipping services and trade between the
two sides and for the complete reunification of the motherland, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Export Structure Undergoes Change in North China's Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The export structure of Tianjin
has undergone a significant change, with exports of
electro-mechanical products rapidly replacing that of primary
products as the city's top item.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that exports of electro-mechanical
products totaled 2.28 billion U.S. dollars last year, accounting
for 45.36 percent of Tianjin's total exports of 5.018 billion
U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that exports of electro-mechanical
products have posted marked increases since 1995, with the net
increase rate surpassing 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exports of electro-mechanical products have also changed from
common machinery to products featuring high-tech and high added
value.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin exports commodities to such countries and regions as
the United States, the European Union, Japan, the Republic of
Korea and Southeast Asian counties.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say that, the change in Tianjin's export
structure has shown a rapid improvement of industrial and
technological standards in China's coastal areas, and an improved
competitiveness of China-made commodities on the international
market, which has played a positive role in enabling China to
maintain a stable economy amid the financial turmoil now
afflicting Southeast Asia.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The people of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) can, through their
participation in the National People's Congress (NPC) and the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), play a
unique role in the handling of state affairs, a Hong Kong
newspaper said in an editorial Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The First Session of the Ninth National Committee of the CPPCC
opens in Beijing on Tuesday while the First Session of the Ninth
National Committee of the NPC opens in the Chinese capital on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Commercial Daily said in its editorial that the
two conferences are of far-reaching significance as the deputies
are to elect a new state leadership who will lead the country into
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
For the people of the SAR, the editorial said, the two
conferences are unique as this is the first time such conferences
are to be held since Hong Kong's reunification with the motherland
last July. The fact that Hong Kong deputies had formed their
first ever independent delegations for the conferences,
demonstrated the change of Hong Kong's historical status.
</P>
<P>
Some deputies said that they had an entirely new feeling that a
new historical era has come and that they are going to handle the
state affairs as masters of their own country.
</P>
<P>
It also showed the central government has attached great
importance to the SAR people's participation and their role in
handling the country's major issues, the editorial pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Another daily newspaper Ta Kung Pao said in an editorial on
Tuesday that the opening of the conferences is a primary matter in
the political life of the Chinese people and it is an
unprecedented matter of historical significance to the SAR.
</P>
<P>
The participation in the conferences by the deputies of the SAR
as the citizens of the People's Republic of China is a most
important and fundamental change of the political status of the
Hong Kong people since the handover and it is a major milestone to
mark the end of the British rule, it added.
</P>
<P>
An article carried by Wen Wei Po, a daily newspaper, said
Tuesday that as the SAR deputies are facing a solemn and hard
task in the next five years, it is only natural that high
expectations are placed on them.
</P>
<P>
The conferences are of primary importance as they are to form a
new political structure with serving terms right into the next
century, and main topics such as election of a new leadership,
re-employment, guarding against financial crisis and fighting
against corruption, will all be in the limelight, the article
said.
</P>
<P>
Both Hong Kong and China's inland are confronted with new
opportunities and challenges when approaching to the new century,
the article said, adding that SAR's deputies are expected to be
competent for their historical tasks and duties, and they will
work hard to build a stronger and more vigorous China.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
continue to strengthen its partnership with the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) in times of change, a European
official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Willy De Clercq, Belgian Minister of State, told Hong Kong
business community Tuesday: "Notwithstanding the transition of
Hong Kong to China, the current financial crisis in Asia and the
internal tasks for Europe, the EU should seek to play a more
active role in this part of the world and strengthen its
relationship with the SAR, particularly now."
</P>
<P>
In a luncheon speech, entitled "EU-Hong Kong: Key partners for
the future", he highlighted the European interests in the city --
a deep economic involvement, close personal ties and continuing
political interests.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is EU's tenth largest trading partner, and the EU is
Hong Kong's third largest trading partner. Their bilateral trade
has increased by 20 percent annually over the past decade.
Moreover, about 50,000 EU citizens live in Hong Kong, more than
any other cities in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The depth and breadth of European interests in Hong Kong makes
it inevitable that Hong Kong will continue to be a key partner for
the EU in Asia," said De Clercq, also chairman of the Committee on
Legal Affairs and Citizen's right of the European parliament.
</P>
<P>
On the impact of the Asian financial crisis on Hong Kong, the
European official said that Hong Kong stood firm and was able to
keep its competitiveness though the economy was not left
unaffected. "Nevertheless, I am optimistic that Hong Kong will
weather the storm," he added.
</P>
<P>
De Clercq noted that business was as usual in Hong Kong after
July 1, 1997. He said: "... this handover has been peaceful and
successful, proving wrong those critics who predicted a doomsday
scenario after this historic transition."

<HEADLINE> Public Confidence in Banking Eroded in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The public confidence in banking
system in Zambia has been greatly eroded following the collapse
of four banks within a periold of four months, Financial Mail
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper reported that savings in banks have
drastically declined between December 1997 and February this
year.
</P>
<P>
Total deposits measured in terms of deposit liabilities to the
public declined drastically from 462.108 billion Kwacha (about
308 million U.S. dollars) in December last year to 415.512
billion Kwacha (about 277 million dollars) in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The decline in deposits reduced the commmercial banks' total
liabilities to the public from 487.59 billion Kwacha (about 325
million dollars) to 442.96 billion Kwacha (about 295 million
dollars) in February.
</P>
<P>
To the contrary, foreign currency deposits increased from
137.654 million dolllars to 143.479 million dollars during the
same period, indicating a shift from local currency deposits to a
more secured foreign currency deposits.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have attributed the drastic reduction in deposits to
the collapse of some local commericial banks which created fear
in the nation about the security of their money in remaining
banks.

<HEADLINE> Floriculture School to Be Opened in Lusaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Some enterprising youths are to
open a floriculture school in Lusaka this month to teach general
flower arrangements, Zambia Daily Mail reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
One of the youths, Kennedy Luo, who is already in
flower-growing business, said it is about time the local floral
industry receives some innovations.
</P>
<P>
He said that "everything is in place, we have acquired some
space from where to conduct lessons, the teaching materials are
there and we are just organizing furniture."
</P>
<P>
Among things to be taught include office, bridal, presentation
arrangements, and wreaths. Lessons in landscaping shall also be
provided in the school, probably the first of its kind in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Luo said the school will contribute to the alleviation of
youth unemployment and the people will be able to start their own
businesses once they have received formal training.
</P>
<P>
He said although flower arrangement is not a new concept in
the country it has not been fully exploited as a source of
income.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern at the lack of funds for youth projects
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Luo was trained in flower arrangement in the former Zaire now
the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
To diversify its economy, Zambia is attaching more and more
importance to non-traditional exports including floriculture
exports.

<P>
LAGOS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Clashes between Nigerian and
Camerounian soldiers on the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula has killed
at least 7 Camerounians, just before the International Court of
Justice resumed hearing on the issue Monday at the Hague,
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted the British Broadcasting Corporation as saying
that the weekend attack launched by Nigerian soldiers was sudden
and took the Camerounian soldiers off-guard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from the Hague quoted the head of the
Nigerian delegate, the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General,
Alhaji Abdullahi Ibrahim as asking the international court not to
entertain Cameroun's claim of sovereignty over Bakassi.
</P>
<P>
"If ultimately Cameroun were to succeed in her claim to
Bakassi, many tens of thousands of Nigerian people who have
always been Nigerian and have been governed from Nigeria will
suddenly find themselves and their property transferred to
another country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Those Nigerians will be evicted from their land and deprived
of their livelihood. We would hope that Cameroun will behave
well, but we have good reason to doubt them," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroun have clashed several times over the
ownership of the peninsula since 1994. Cameroun filed the case to
the international court in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun is expected to argue its case later this week.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia hoped to solve the ethnic
conflict in Yugoslavia's autonomous province of Kosovo through
political dialogue, according to report from Skoplj, the capital
of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Monday, Macedonian Foreign Ministry spokesman
expressed Macedonia's deep concern over further development of
the situation in the area.
</P>
<P>
He said Macedonia maintained that the Yugoslav authorities
should hold talks with the entity of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
-- the only way to solve the current problem.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman added, the possibility of international
intervention could not be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Macedonia started to mass troops in its border
areas with Yugoslavia for any emergency.
</P>
<P>
Tension in Kosovo heightened on March 1 after an escalation of
a larger armed conflict between Serbian police and local ethnic
Albanians, during which four policemen and 16 Albanians were
killed with another two policemen injured.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has a 90 percent ethnic Albanian majority which has been
seeking independence from Yugoslavia since 1981.
</P>
<P>
Violence there has been growing this year following the
non-implementation of an education agreement reached between
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and leader of the ethnic
Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Maps out New Proposal for Angolan Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The former rebel organization, the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), has
made a new proposal on the peace process in the country.
</P>
<P>
Behrooz Sadry, deputy representative of United Nations to
Angola said here Monday night that he has brought the letter
containing the new proposal to the Angolan government after his
10-hour talks with the UNITA leaders in central Angola's Andulo
city.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would forward the letter to the president
Wednesday, but could not reveal the content of the letter as he
had promised.
</P>
<P>
Sadry said that what on agenda is to have major breakthroughs
in the peace process, not a new time-table or whether UNITA army
should be totally dismantled, as many have speculated.
</P>
<P>
Sadry had his first meeting with UNITA leaders after the
February 28 deadline for the peace process in the country, which
was spoilt by the sabotage activities by the UNITA military men.
</P>
<P>
He carried letters from the joint committee of Angola peace
process, the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and the observer
countries to the UNITA leaders.
</P>
<P>
UNITA has been carrying on military activities throughout the
country against the government institutions, while enrolling new
members into military forces for fresh war against the
government.

<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China today hailed the
U.N. Security Council's unanimous passage of a resolution which
examined and approved the memorandum of understanding signed
between the United Nations and Iraq last week.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remarks
here at a regular news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The resolution will lay the foundation to fairly and justly
solve the Iraqi weapons-inspection issue thoroughly in a peaceful
way, he said.
</P>
<P>
China considers that the pressing matter of the moment is to
implement the memorandum of understanding as soon as possible, in
case of recurrence of the crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
China hopes Iraq observes its obligations conscientiously, he
said, adding that China consistently has upheld solving
international disputes by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the current resolution in no way means that
the U.N. Security Council will automatically authorize any state
to use force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Only the Security Council can discuss and determine whether
Iraq violates the memorandum of understanding and, if so, what
action can be taken, he added.

BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China supports all efforts that

Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao said at a regular news
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the recent situation in Cambodia, Zhu said
China, a friendly neighbor to Cambodia, has been following the
situation in Cambodia closely.
</P>

freely and fairly, and the Cambodian people can fully exercise
their rights and make independent decisions on the affairs of
their nation.

He stressed that Cambodia is a sovereign state, and its
internal problems should, in the final analysis, be resolved by
all the parties concerned in Cambodia through consultation.
</P>
<P>
China sincerely hopes that, under the leadership of King
Norodom Sihanouk and in the spirit of national reconciliation,
these parties will properly address their partisan political
differences and work together for the stability and development of
the nation, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Streamline Local Authorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is considering
rationalizing 843 local authorities to about 500, and reducing
the country's 11,300 councillors by half in terms of proposed
amendments to local government legislation, local daily Business
Day reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Much of the rationalization is expected to take place in
smaller towns and rural areas, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that about one third of all local authorities
are financially unviable and do not have managerial capacity or
discretionary funds to deliver services at an acceptable level.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, which attempts to address these and other
problems, has been approved by the cabinet and will be made
public soon, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Chippy Oliver, the Constitutional Affairs Department's local
government deputy director-general, said Monday the white paper
was intended to "leapfrog local government into the 21st
century".
</P>
<P>
There would be a major overhaul of administrative systems,
while consideration would be given to outsourcing and
corporatizing some functions and privatizing noncore businesses.
These included abattoirs and petrol stations owned by local
government.
</P>
<P>
Private and public sector partnerships could be established
for the provision of water, electricity and gas.
</P>
<P>
Oliver said the biggest task was to redemarcate municipal
boundaries. An independent board would oversee this process with
a municipal redemarcation bill scheduled to go before parliament
this month.
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan areas would be largely unaffected, but there
would be significant amalgamation of smaller towns and the
reincorporation of rural areas, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: SADC Leaders Plan to Resolve Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG,March 3 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state from the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) Monday appointed
three presidents from the grouping to resolve a long-standing
dispute over the running of the region's security affairs.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which ends an impasse of more than six months on
the dispute that threatened to sour relations in the SADC, was
made in Maputo, Mozambique, during a one-day special session of
the regional organization.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma, Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano and Malawian President Bakili Muluzi were tasked with
reconciling two proposals aimed at resolving the dispute over the
SADC's political, defense and security sub-committee.
</P>
<P>
The dispute, which came to a head last August, centred on
whether the sub-committee, chaired by Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, should have its status elevated to the same level as the
SADC itself.
</P>
<P>
If this view -- favored by Mugabe -- prevailed, then the
subcommittee would hold a separate summit and not report to the
SADC's chairman, South African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
South Africa felt that the subcommittee was a SADC's
institution that should logically report to the SADC chairman.
</P>
<P>
Monday's meeting, also attended by President Laurent Kabila of
the Democratic Republic of Congo, was the first serious attempt
by leaders to resolve the spat which saw Mandela threatening to
quit as the SADC's chairman.
</P>
<P>
South African presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana told the
press here Monday night that it was inappropriate to outline the
proposals at this stage, but progress was made at Monday's
meeting which he described as constructive.
</P>
<P>
The three-president committee, which was also expected to
discuss the matter with SADC security affairs ministers, would
unveil its finding in two months' time.
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee's activities were suspended in August,
pending the special session of the SADC leaders.
</P>
<P>
SADC was formed in 1992 to coordinate efforts for a common
market by 2000. The regional body is made up of 14 member states,
with a total population of 150 million and a combined gross
domestic product of 170 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> New Sino-Russian Railway Scheduled to Start Service on July 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the railway
linking Hunchun of northeast China's Jilin Province and the
Russian city of Mahalino is going on rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have agreed to start joint international
transportation on July 1, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
Ding Shicheng, adviser to the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) and chief planner of the Tumen River project, said
that the operation of the Sino-Russian railway and the completion
of other auxiliary facilities will help form a triangular rail
network along the lower reaches of the Tumen River. This network
will connect China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) and Russia and will create a better investment environment
in the region, Ding added.
</P>
<P>
The Tumen River flows along China's border with Russia and
the DPRK. In 1991, the U.N. decided to include the development of
the Tumen River area as one of its priority projects. A global
center for the exchange of materials is planned for the area
within 20 years at a cost of 30 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Russian border railway is part of the Northeast Asian
trunk transport line supported by the UNDP. The Tumen-Hunchun
section of the Sino-Russian railway has been in temporary use
since June 1996, and rails were laid for the Hunchun-Changlingzi
section, which was connected with the Russian line in October 1996.

<HEADLINE> Australia Grants Aid to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia would donate 3.6
million U.S. dollars to Indonesia for drought relief and job
creation, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer announced
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Australia will provide up to 2.6 million U.S. dollars in
assistance through non-government organizations for drought relief
and employment creation in eastern Indonesia, the foreign minister
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Downer also revealed Australia had intervened on Indonesia's
behalf with the World Bank, which is demanding major economic
reforms in return for bailing out Indonesia's economy.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian government was able to bring together a number
of other key donors, including the World Bank, to discuss food
shortages and the social impacts of the economic difficulties in
Indonesia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The aid announcement followed discussions last week with
Indonesia on how Australia could best help the country through its
economic crisis, Downer said.
</P>
<P>
The Small Activities Scheme, a long-standing grassroots
community development program administered by the Australian
Embassy in Jakarta, will now be used for drought relief and
employment creation and will be increased by about one million
U.S. dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
The announcement takes Australia's contribution to Indonesia to
5.8 million U.S. dollars since October last year.
</P>
<P>
Australia will also help Indonesia's National Planning Board
develop job creation programs and assist Indonesia to improve the
delivery of government services.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government, which regards Indonesia as one of
the four most important countries to Australia, including the
United States, Japan and China, expressed publicly last month its
concerns for the social and economic situation in its neighboring
Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Stronger After Data Flood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
stronger on Tuesday, after a raft of economic data signaled the
domestic economy was chugging along nicely but the external sector
was coming under pressure from Asia.
</P>
<P>
The unit closed at 68.35 U.S. cents, from 68.08 previously.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the data were mostly in line with expectations.
</P>
<P>
"But it may have been interpreted a little better than
expected," said IBJ Australia LTD Foreign Exchange Manager Darrin
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Tuesday released
retail trade and building approvals figures for January and a
further report on the current account deficit for the December
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said retail sales in January rose a
stronger-than-expected 2.1 percent, in seasonally adjusted terms.
</P>
<P>
January building approvals slid 1.5 percent, but the outcome
was in line with market expectations and came on the back of gains
of 6.7 percent in December and 1.6 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit widened to an as-expected 5.7
billion Australian dollars (3.87 billion U.S. dollars) in the
December quarter of 1997, from a deficit of 4.63 billion
Australian dollars (3.15 billion U.S. dollars) previously.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's armed forces are
prepared to station more personnel at the borders to check the
entry of illegal immigrants, Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces and police have reached an understanding on
this matter and military posts throughout the country have been
directed to assist police if the need arose, he told reporters
after visiting the demonstration site of the Defense Services Asia
Exhibition and Conference 98 (DSA) here, which will be held from
April 21 to 24.
</P>
<P>
The number of illegal immigrants entering Malaysia was reported
to have increased significantly in the past two months following
the economic downturn in some neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Police statistics show that 3,000 illegal immigrants were
arrested in just the first two weeks of last month compared to
9,000 in the whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
Police Inspector-General Rahim Noor recently ordered an
increase in the number of police personnel involved in checking
the entry of illegal immigrants along the west coast of the
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, which itself is experiencing an economic downturn due
to the contagion effects of the regional financial crisis, already
has some 2 million foreign workers, half of whom are said illegal.

<HEADLINE> Aziz: Iraq Will Observe Agreement on Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz said Tuesday that Iraq will observe the agreement with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on peacefully ending the crisis
over weapons inspection, Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said in a statement to the INA that Iraq who has put its
signature to the agreement will honor its commitment and respect
U.N. Security Council resolutions concerning the agreement.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to the U.N. Security Council resolution
adopted on Monday that warns Iraq of "severest consequences" if it
again bars U.N. arms inspectors from suspected sites in their
search for weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous vote Monday night, the 15-member U.N. Security
Council adopted the resolution drafted by Britain and Japan,
which declares that "any violation (of the agreement) would have
severest consequences for Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Under the Memorandum of Understanding signed by Annan and Aziz
on February 23, Iraq agreed to grant a U.N special group free,
unconditional and unrestricted access to its presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
The special group will comprise of senior diplomats appointed
by Annan and arms inspectors drawn from the U.N. Special
Commission on dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction,
known as UNSCOM, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted Monday does not spell out what the
consequences will be if Iraq violates the agreement on weapons
inspections, but U.S. officials have said any further violation by
Iraq would ensure strong support for military strikes.
</P>
<P>
Aziz criticized the United States for maintaining military
presence in the Gulf region, saying that Iraq was not, is
not and will not be scared by military threats.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the United States of committing crimes of
genocide against Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
However, Aziz said Iraq is ready to engage in "constructive and
civilised" dialogues at different levels with the United States
and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction, Aziz
said, adding that the U.N. sanctions imposed on it since 1990
should therefore be lifted.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq hoped to develop relationship with members
of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), including Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates and Qatar.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Foreign Exchange Inflows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's foreign exchange inflows
dropped only to 1.76 million U.S. Dollars in January this year
compared with 53.731 million dollars in December of 1997,
according to statistics of Bank of Zambia available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But in January 53.496 million dollars was released to service
external debt and to support the foreign exchange market that
experienced high demand leading to continued depreciation of the
country's currency of Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
The donor funding amounted to only 1.676 million dollars while
the remaining came from other non-government sources.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Zambia, the central bank of the country, released 23.6
million dollars onto the foreign exchange market to beef up the
dwindling market so as to save the Kwacha from further
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 23.118 million dollars was used to service the
country's external debt which continues to consume the lion's
share of its foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Last year foreign exchange inflows amounted to only 268.782
million dollars with 140.207 million coming from donors.
</P>
<P>
Outflows last year stood at 267.698 million dollars
constituting a surplus of 1.084 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 267.689 million dollars 146.013 went to service
debt.
</P>
<P>
Receipts from Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) amounted
to 45.05 million last year and the increased purchase from ZCCM
was led by the shortage of foreign exchange between September and
December compounded by the need to import relief maize.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said unless the situation changes for the better,
Zambians should brace themselves for a more depreciated Kwacha,
which in turn will push up prices of goods and services and
distort the balance of payments position of the country resulting
in higher inflation rate.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Airports Safe though Fuel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 3 (Xinhua) - Aircraft operators and
travelers can rest assured in using the Dar es Salaam and
Kilimanjaro international airports, Tanzanian minister for
Communications and Transport was quoted as saying by media here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
William Kusila has said in a statement that the basic
navigational facilities at the two main airports were in good
order with the serviceability status above 94 percent, and no
aircraft diversion has been recorded over the recent period of
the unusually bad weather linked with the El-Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
"Whilest it is accepted that there are occasional deficiencies
in the provision of airport and air navigation services in the
country," Kusila said, "at no time is the safety of aircraft
operations compromised."
</P>
<P>
He said that a brand new Doppler Very High Frequency Omni
Ranger Measuring Equipment and the new solar-powered
Non-Directional Beacons have been installed at the Kilimanjaro
airport since 1996 while notable improvement has also been made
in the Dar es Salaam airport.
</P>
<P>
Kusila also paid attention to the rising fuel prices, saying
that the government is studying the possibility to reduce them as
requested by aircraft operators.
</P>
<P>
"The government has noted the anxiety of airlines on the
escalating fuel prices and we are trying to solve it," the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a senior airline official has warned that airline
companies using Tanzania's airports intend to raise prices of
their plane tickets to compensate for the losses incurred after
the government recently hiked price of Jet A-1 fuel by almost 28
percent.
</P>
<P>
Gerwin Mhenga, Chairman of the Board of Airline
Representatives, said that if all other operational costs remain
constant, the hiked price of the fuel would account for 68
percent of the operational costs to airline companies.
</P>
<P>
He said that many foreign airline companies were forced to
refuel in neighboring countries leaving behind only the Air
Tanzania, the Alliance Air, the Precision Air, the British
Airways and the KLM.
</P>
<P>
Mhenga cautioned that the mass exodus of the airline companies
would affect adversely various sectors of Tanzania's economy.
</P>
<P>
He also quoted the airline companies as complaining that the
airports with leaking roofs lack security for their passengers
and cargo, display of flight information, air-conditioners as
well as reliable water and electricity services.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Play Increasing Role in Protecting Forests (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A consultant at the Nature Reserve
Management Office at China's Forestry Ministry says that the
Chinese women have become a major labor force in mountain areas
because they know from their daily lives and work that they will
be in great trouble if the forest resources are lost.
</P>
<P>
The role played by women in mountainous areas and the
protection of China's natural resources was the subject of a
Xinhua exclusive interview with the Forestry Ministry's official,
He Pikun, today, five days before International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
In a mountain village in China's Shennongjia area, a group of
women once staged a protest against the cutting of trees, which
had made a stream that was their main source of drinking water
much muddier. One woman in the area told visitors that the reason
the brook in front of her house was as clean as before was because
there was a national nature reserve up where the brook came from.
</P>
<P>
Women in mountainous areas are now burdened with much of the
farming, gathering of firewood, and getting water, as more and
more men go to nearby or distant cities to look for work and more
income. They are responsible for nearly all their fuel, animal
fodder, and even fertilizer. Their water needs to be saved by the
forests because their soil will erode and their farmland will
disappear if any of the forests are lost, so of course they know
from their own experience that protecting the forests means
protecting their own lives, He explains.

<TEXT>
<P>
Women in mountainous areas have also been the most interested
in afforestation, He says, because of the possibility of extra
income to help supporting their families and pay for children's
schooling by planting trees. One survey he did in Yunnan Province
showed that 80 percent of the tree planters were women.
</P>
<P>
Women in mountainous areas generally have a greater influence
on family decisions than men, and if they want something done,
then it is more likely to happen and be done well, he says, and
suggests that more attention be given to the special role played
by women in mountainous areas in order to better protect the
nation's natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 800 nature reserves now have pilot projects encouraging
greater participation by women in nature conservation.
</P>
<P>
In the Wuyi Mountain National Nature Reserve in Fujian
Province, one female volunteer nature-protection team has already
been in existence for several years and has proven quite
effective, the official says.

<HEADLINE> Students Rally in Iran Turns Violent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Violence occurred Monday afternoon
in a students rally here to protest against the rule of the
Constitutional Guardian Council to reject the qualifications of
several candidates for the Majlis (parliament), injuring several
people.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Iran News reported Tuesday that clashes happened
when members of the Union of Hizbollah Students of Tehran
University (UHSTU) tried to stop the rally arranged by another
student group the Unity Consolidation Office (UCO).
</P>
<P>
The UCO obtained a permit from the Interior Ministry to hold
the gathering after their candidates were rejected by the
Constitutional Guardian Council for the upcoming Majlis
by-elections for five seats.
</P>
<P>
However, the UHSTU also demanded to hold a rally at the same
time and the same place to protest the gathering of the UCO. The
UHSTU's demand was rejected by the Interior Ministry because it
received the UCO's demand one hour earlier than the UHSTU's.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts occurred when the UHSTU members entered the scene
and several people were injured, Iran News said. However,
security personnel did not intervene until UHSTU members tried to
enter the Tehran University campus.
</P>
<P>
The UCO joined the coalition which supported Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami in the May presidential elections last
year. However, the Constitutional Guardian Council denied the
qualification for several main figures from the coalition,
including former minister of heavy industries Behzad Nabavi.
</P>
<P>
Nabavi, a strong supporter of Khatami, also launched strong
protest to the council rule, accusing the rival political factions
of trying to weaken the government of President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The Majlis by-elections is scheduled to be held on March 13 in
four districts to elect five members for the 270-seat
parliament. Some 227 persons announced to contest the
by-elections.
</P>
<P>
So far the Constitutional Guardian Council, which is
responsible for screening the qualifications of all candidates,
has not announced the result of its work.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Committed to Combat Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Attorney-General Amos Wako
has said that the government would be more tough on tax evaders
to improve revenue collection in the country, according to an
East African Standard report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Wako as saying on Sunday in the port city of
Mombasa that many rich people still do not pay taxes and traders
at the Mombasa port are notorious tax evaders.
</P>
<P>
"If we collect taxes well, we can stop begging for funds from
the World Bank," stressed the Attorney-General who paid a
courtesy call on Coast Provincial Commissioner Timothy Sirma.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) is out to
eliminate corruption in all its operations, targeting import
business at the port.
</P>
<P>
During the courtesy call, Sirma asked the KRA to streamline
its revenue collection and remittance as a way of ensuring a
strong financial base for the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country has enough resources to support it
without donors if all the revenue due to the government is
collected and remitted to the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
Wako and KRA officials are in Mombasa for two-day tour of the
Coast Province in the wake of a massive import of sugar into the
East African country.
</P>
<P>
As the high-powered team toured the port, about 10,000 tons of
Brazilian sugar was expected to be discharged at the port of
Mombasa aboard two vessels.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government will once again have to steer the
economy for another half year without the crucial support of the
international donor community following the government failure to
convince the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to resume talks on
its suspended loan package.
</P>
<P>
The IMF mission which concluded a two-week review of Kenya's
economy last week said that "progress has been made in
implementing the measures but further actions are required to
complete the agreed program of measures."
</P>
<P>
Among the key measures agreed between the Kenyan government
and the IMF mission include reducing budget deficit from its
current 3.9 percent to 2.4 percent of the Gross Domestic Product,
more independence for the Kenya Revenue Authority and improved
governance.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here last Friday, Goodall Gondwe,
Deputy Director of the IMF African Department and leader of the
IMF mission, said that the Kenyan government should institute
measures for the recovery of substantial amounts of customs duty
not paid by sugar importers.

<HEADLINE> Farmers' Income in Chinese Province Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Per-capita income for
farmers in central China's Hunan Province reached 2,000 yuan for
the first time in 1997.
</P>
<P>
An official from the provincial government said that
per-capita income for farmers in the province was 2,037 yuan last
year, an increase of 8.9 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
As a large agricultural province, Hunan has a leading position
in China in the production of grain, cotton, tea, oil-bearing
crops and ramie.
</P>
<P>
Last year, farmers in Hunan Province grew high-yield rice on
67,000 hectares of land in 10 counties.
</P>
<P>
To help farmers increase their income, the provincial
government provided nearly one billion yuan of poverty-relief
funds in 1997. By the end of 1997, 900,000 poverty-stricken farmers
in the province rose above the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
With the increased income, Hunan farmers improved their
quality of life. Last year, each farmer in the province spent an
average of 1,815 yuan on communications, cultural activities and
services.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural research institutes
of China and the United States recently launched a turf-seed trial
project here.
</P>
<P>
In the initial two-year period of the China National Turf-seed
Variety Trials project, Chinese and American scientists will
conduct research on 110 types of turf grass seeds offered by 28
U.S. seed companies. The seeds will be planted in 11 trial areas
representing different environments in China.
</P>
<P>
The program -- co-sponsored by Oregon State University, Nanjing
Agricultural University and China Agricultural University -- is
the largest international grass-seed research project in which
Oregon has been involved in the world, according to Oregon
Gov. John Kitzhaber, who was present at Saturday's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
As one of the major grass-seed producers in the United States,
he said, Oregon will provide 121,000 U.S. dollars in financial
support, and technological expertise brought by professors,
researchers and farm-owners.
</P>
<P>
Chinese agronomists say the introduction of the
state-of-the-art turf-grass technology from the United States is
the result of the increasing importance of turf grass for erosion
control and for recreational facilities such as sports grounds and
parks.
</P>
<P>
Oregon is the largest turf-grass seed exporter to China. Last
year, it exported to China 7,000 tons of turf seeds worth five
million U.S. dollars.

CHANGSHA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- An "Old Photos" program
broadcast by Hunan Provincial Economic Television Station makes
old photos come alive to tell moving stories unknown to most
people.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of 100-years-old photos in Kunming, capital of
southwest China's Yunnan Province, has become a hot topic among

</P>
<P>
Collections of old photos and albums are taking prominent

Shandong Pictorial Publishing House pulled open the curtains of
this event by publishing a magazine titled "Old Photos" in 1996.

To date, 240,000 copies of the magazine have been sold.
</P>
<P>
Many of the photos included in the magazine reflect images of
noted people, the lives of older generations and their personal

</P>
<P>
Sociologists believe this is a new way for people to study
history in addition to writing articles.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Research Team Finds Another Alzheimer's Link in Genes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A team of U.S. researchers has
found a gene that may increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease
fourfold, acorrding to a report in the March issue of Nature
Genetics magazine.
</P>
<P>
The gene is linked to the sporadic form of Alzheimer's, which
generally appears in individuals who lack a family history of the
disorder. Now researchers at the University of Pittsburgh have
discovered a so-called susceptbility gene.
</P>
<P>
The report said that those with the gene won't necessarily
develop Alzheimer's, but their risk is higher. It carries the
blueprint for an enzyme involved in the metabolism of beta-amyloid
protein, the substance that destroys brain cells in Alzheimer's
patients.
</P>
<P>
The Pittsburgh team said that everybody has this enzyme, but
people with Alzheimer's appear to have an over representation of
it. The gene comes in an "A" form and a "G" form. Everybody
inherits two copies of the gene. The study suggests an effect only
when both copies are the "G" form.
</P>
<P>
An estimated four million people in the United States are
afflicted of Alzheimer's, a neurological disorder which destroys
memory and judgement.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in recent years also have identified genes on
chromosomes 1,14 and 21, linking them to the early onset of
Alzheimer's disease.

<HEADLINE> China Making Progress in Publicizing ISO9000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China has improved its quality
control of export-oriented enterprises and foreign trade by
adopting the internationally accepted ISO9000 standard series.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, 1,001 export-oriented enterprises have been
granted certificates for having met ISO9000 quality control
standards, according to statistics from the State Administration
for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that ISO9000 quality control standards were worked
out by the International Standardization Organization (ISO) in
1987 in light of modern management theories.
</P>
<P>
The ISO9000 quality standard certificate has been considered a
guarantee of good product quality, trustworthiness and modern
management, and a "passport" for businesses to compete in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
To improve the competitiveness of Chinese-made products in
world markets, China has established an ISO9000 working committee
to popularize the quality system in export-oriented companies.
</P>
<P>
The ISO9000 quality standard certificate has helped state-owned
enterprises transform their management mechanism, said officials
from the administration.
</P>
<P>
The Kunming Cable Company in southwest China's Yunnan Province,
one of the country's 26 key cable enterprises, earned 3.6 million
U.S. dollars of foreign exchange in 1997 because of the ISO9000
quality certificate it gained in 1995.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, export-oriented enterprises have raised their
credibility and competitiveness in the international market after
receiving ISO9000 certificates, said the officials.

<P>
TEHRAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran Monday strongly condemned the
attack on two Iranian reporters in France by a group of Jewish
youths, calling on the French government to punish those involved.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA Tuesday reported that
Iranian Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah
Mohajerani voiced Tehran's condemnation in a letter to French
Minister of Culture and Communication Catherine Trautmann.
</P>
<P>
A group of Jewish youths Friday attacked Abdolreza Mansouri and
Ahmad Moshrefi, reporter and photographer of the Islamic Republic
of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) in Paris, when they were trying to
cover the trial of the French writer Roger Garaudi.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani asked Trautmann to spare no effort in arresting and
handing over the involved persons to the French judicial
authorities, saying that the incident against Iranian and Arab
reporters outside the court would create the doubt that there is
no security in France for the foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said he also expects the French government to make efforts
to prevent activities of the extremists which are aimed at
creating disorder in the French society.
</P>
<P>
Garaudi was on trial for his book "Founding Myths of Israeli
Policy" which questioned the reality of the massacre of millions
of Jewish people by the German Nazi forces during the World War
II.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government and authorities have announced strong
support for Garaudi and asked the French judiciary to reconsider
the case in order to "protect freedom of speech."

TEHRAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mahmoud Mohammadi has lauded the decision by the International
Court of Justice in the Hague on Libya's case as a "realistic and
logical approach befitting an international agency."
</P>
<P>
The international court had taken a positive and significant step
for bolstering the agency's profile as a legal and judicial
international institute and strengthening the norms of legal
applications in the international arena, the Iranian official news

</P>
<P>
The Hague court Friday ruled that it had jurisdiction to hear
Libyan complains against Britain and the United States over their
demand to extradite two Libyan suspects who were alleged to have
bombed a U.S. airliner that exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland in
December 1988, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi expressed hope that the ruling would trigger a
peaceful settlement of the issue and ultimately annul the
U.N. sanctions imposed on Libya since 1992 for its refusal to hand
over the two Libyan suspects for trial in Britain or the United
states.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi Monday called on the
U.N. Security Council to lift the sanction immediately and

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The First Session of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was held in
Beijing between September 21 and 30, 1949, exercising the
functions of China's highest organ of state power. It was attended
by 662 representatives from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
The first CPPCC session adopted "Common Program of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference," proclaimed the
founding of the People's Republic of China and elected a Committee
of the Central People's Government with Mao Zedong as its
chairman. It also decided the national flag and national anthem,
elected the First National Committee of the CPPCC which was
composed of 180 members, and set October 1st as the National Day.
The CPPCC First National Committee held four sessions.
</P>
<P>
The First Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC
was held in Beijing in December 1954 with 559 participants.
</P>
<P>
According to "Constitution of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference" adopted at the session, the CPPCC would
no longer exercise the power of the National People's Congress
(NPC) owing to the convention of the NPC First Session. But the
CPPCC would continue to exist as an organization of people's
democratic united front work. The session elected Mao Zedong as
honorary chairman of the Second CPPCC National Committee and Zhou
Enlai as its chairman. The Second CPPCC National Committee had
three sessions.
</P>
<P>
The First Session of the Third CPPCC National Committee was
held in April, 1959 in Beijing, which was attended by 1,071
members. Starting from this session, CPPCC national committee members
attended NPC sessions in a non-voting capacity. Mao Zedong and
Zhou Enlai were elected, respectively, honorary chairman and
chairman of the Third CPPCC National Committee, which held four
sessions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> DPRK Demand for Fuel from China Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China's local customs office
neighboring the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has
asked trading companies to adjust their export strategy to meet
DPRK's increasing demand for fuel resources from China.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent issue of the International Business
Daily, DPRK had imported 134.8 tons of gasoline and 29.5 tons of
diesel oil from China from Jan. 1 to Feb. 11, accounting for 74
percent of its oil imports, as indicated by official statistics.
</P>
<P>
However, DPRK's imports of flour from China in the same period
stood at 30 tons, merely 13.5 percent of its total, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The report stated that food assistance from the United Nations
Food Program and the international community has so far been able
to satisfy DPRK's food demand.
</P>
<P>
However, as the country enters into its lumber harvesting
season, it is seeking more imports of fuel, which is in short
supply.

<HEADLINE> China Announces List of Hazardous Wastes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China has announced a list of
hazardous wastes, which is the first of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
The list -- jointly prepared by the National Environmental
Protection Agency (NEPA), the State Economic and Trade Commission,
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and the
Ministry of Public Security -- will go into effect July 1.
</P>
<P>
Hazardous wastes are one of the major causes of serious
pollution. They have great potential for danger, and can cause
persistent pollution to soil, water and air.
</P>
<P>
China produced 640 million tons of industrial waste in 1995, of
which hazardous wastes accounted for 3 percent, according to the
latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
A leading official of NEPA said that the implementation of the
list will provide a basis for the registration and management of
solid wastes and strict enforcement of the country's pollution law
governing solid waste disposal.
</P>
<P>
"It will help to keep close control over hazardous waste," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The list was drafted according to the Convention on the Control
of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal
and covers 47 types of waste.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the list will be amended with developments in
science and technology.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Rebel Negotiators Hold Special Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Peace negotiators of the Philippine
government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) are
holding a special meeting Tuesday to assess a five-point agreement
they signed last month, the Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the meeting is being held at a university
in Cotabato City, the Southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF deputy chairman for political affairs,
said the two peace panels will center their discussion on the
repositioning of troops in Buldon, Maguindanao province which the
military failed to implement.
</P>
<P>
He added that the reactivation of the Quick Reaction Force will
also be tackled during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Quick Reaction Force, tasked to resolve conflicts between
the military and the MILF, was created by the negotiators last
year, but became inactive when skirmishes between the two forces
recently occurred in Cotabato and Maguindanao provinces.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar, meanwhile, announced that the two panels will again
hold a meeting on March 10 in Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao, to
formally set the date and venue of their formal talks.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is currently the largest rebel group in the
Philippines. It has been engaged in low-level peace talks with the
government since last year, but the two sides made little progress
toward signing a final peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Ambassador Arrives in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Newly-appointed Turkish ambassador
to Iran Sencar Ozsoy arrived here early Tuesday morning, one year
after Ankara and Tehran recalled their ambassadors to the other,
a Turkish source told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Ozsoy, 56, served as Turkish ambassador
to Argentina before coming here.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Iran News reported Tuesday that Iranian
ambassador to Turkey Mohammad Hussein Lavasani would leave here
for Ankara this weekend.
</P>
<P>
In February last year, Iranian ambassador to Turkey Mohammad
Reza Baqeri angered the Turkish government by delivering a
pro-Islamic speech during a demonstration. Ankara ordered Baqeri
to leave the country and Tehran in turn expelled the Turkish
ambassador to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The two countries sent special envoys to each other in order
to repair their relations and they decided to exchange
ambassadors on the sidelines of the 8th summit of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) held in Tehran last
December in which Turkish President Suleyman Demirel took part.
</P>
<P>
However, serious differences still remain between Iran and
Turkey, particularly over Turkish military cooperation with Israel
and Turkish military incursion into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government strongly opposed Turkish military
cooperation with Israel and repeatedly asked Ankara to reconsider
its decision. Tehran also called on Ankara to respect Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.

BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- "I was cooking when the head of my
village came to tell me that I had been elected to the National
People's Congress. I felt very nervous then," recalled Ma
Xiangmei, a 23-year-old female farmer from northwest China's Gansu
Province.
</P>
<P>
One of the youngest members of China's new top lawmaking body,
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), Ma represents the
Bao'an Nationality, a small ethnic group in China with a
population of only 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"I shoulder grave responsibility for my fellow villagers and
people in my county, as well as my ethnic group," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth NPC, which will open its first annual session here on
Thursday, has 428 deputies from China's 55 ethnic minorities,
14.37 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The Hui ethnic group, China's Moslems, has taken the largest
proportion among the minorities with 67 seats in the new
legislature. It is followed by the Zhuang, Manchu, Mongolian and
Tibetan groups.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one ethnic minorities, including the Bao'an, have each
contributed one deputy to the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
There are 122 female deputies from various ethnic minorities,
accounting for four percent of the total number of legislators and
18.8 percent of women lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
"The statistics reflect improved political status and the
ability to participate in the running of state affairs of women
from ethnic minorities," commented Mahinur Sasim, vice-chairwoman
of All-China Women's Federation, who has been elected to the NPC
for seven times.

Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have helped more than one
million women from various ethnic minorities to master at least one
practical agricultural skill.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruzhong, an NPC deputy representing the Lahu ethnic group in
southwest China's Yunnan Province, said that thanks to the care
and assistance of the government, the 430,000 Lahu people have bid
farewell to their primitive way of life.
</P>
<P>
"We used to move around and hunt in the thick forests. Now We
have settled down, and some of us even own private cars," said Li,
head of the government of the country's sole Lahu autonomous
county.

<HEADLINE> US Wants Mideast Free of Powerful Weapons: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Washington is working to rid the
Middle East of all weapons of mass destruction, including
Israel's stockpile, but has zeroed in on Iraq because it has used
them before, a U.S. envoy said.
</P>
<P>
David Newton, a career diplomat, is in Beirut as part of a
regional trip to explain the merits of Washington's "diplomacy
with force behind it" policy toward Iraq, local newspaper the
Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Newton has met with Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz,
who said Lebanon wants the same pressure to be applied on Israel
to implement international resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"The tough policies on Iraq cannot be justified, because
Israel has its stockpile of weapons of mass destruction and
refuses to endorse the Non-Proliferation Treaty,
</P>
<P>
"It is illogical that the United Nations resolutions continue
to be applied by force against some countries while others are
made to feel they are above international law," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
Newton, however, said: "We'd like to eliminate all these
weapons not only from the region, but from the world. Iraq is an
exception because it has used these weapons before."
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, who was called back from retirement during the
crisis to undertake the regional trip on behalf of the U.S. state
department, appeared unconvinced that Iraq will keep the promise
it made to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to open all its
facilities to international inspectors searching for banned
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Had it not been for the U.S. "diplomacy with force behind it,"
the secretary general would not have succeeded in bringing Iraq to
agree to inspections," he said, adding that the past experience
with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's promises "is certainly not
encouraging."
</P>
<P>
He said his tour gave him a chance "to explain the American
position of this crisis to the Arab people and important
decision-makers," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Banks With High Interest Rates to be Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bankers Association of the
Philippines (BAP) said Tuesday that it will investigate banks
imposing excessive prime lending rates to businessmen in South
Cotabato province, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The "extremely high" interest rates eventually resulted in the
temporary closure of shops and the protest of hundreds of
businessmen in the province.
</P>
<P>
In response to the call of the business group, BAP President
Deogracias Vistan said he will send a team to verify reports that
the banks are slapping more than 40 percent interest on their
loans.
</P>
<P>
He added that the notice to limit lending rates between 21 to
27 percent on loans must have been ignored or neglected by the
banks.
</P>
<P>
The South Cotabato Business Association has urged the Central
Bank to issue an official circular to force banks nationwide to
observe the ceiling on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, central bank governor Gabriel Singson is set to
confer with the members of the Monetary Board as to whether the
ceiling of five percentage points above the Treasury bills rates
is practical.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, bankers have agreed to reduce their interest rates by
one percentage point every week until the rates fall to levels
that are acceptable to the public. However, the rates still
remained at high levels at present.

SHANGHAI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai International
Commodity Auction Company will hold a large auction of Chinese
stamps on March 15 and is expecting to raise more than six million
yuan from the sale.
</P>
<P>
Up for grabs will be 841 items, the most valuable of which is a

then decided not to issue them, but post offices in remote areas
got news late and several hundred were sold. They are expected to
bring at least 700,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Other rare stamps from the period will also be available, like
"The Great Victory of the Cultural Revolution". There are also
several unique stamps from the Republic of China (1912-1949),
which will bring at least 200,000 yuan each, a high price for a
single stamp. There are only a dozen of these stamps available in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The stamps will be on display for three days before the auction

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Province Sets Year's Economic Development Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
has set a goal of maintaining double-digit growth in its GDP
(gross domestic product) this year.
</P>
<P>
This goal was approved by the recent Provincial People's
Congress. Provincial officials are determined to chalk up an 11
percent rise in GDP over 1997 plus a 15 percent increase in
fixed-asset investment, a 15 percent rise in foreign trade and a
13 percent increase in service sector trade.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the province will continue to
place agriculture at the top of its agenda and work hard to
expand the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
The province's rapid economic growth has benefited from the
steady development of agriculture, especially a steady growth in
grain production, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The province will launch a campaign of increasing per-unit output
of grain, cotton and oil crops by 10 percent in its vast rural
areas and has set a goal for grain output at 34 million tons in
1998 while stabilizing its sown area of grain at 5.8 million
hectares.
</P>
<P>
Provincial officials also will focus on animal husbandry,
aquatic products and horticulture.
</P>
<P>
Improvements in the quality of industrial operations also is
high on the province's priority list as well as maintaining the
rate of development to achieve an average growth rate of 11
percent in industrial added value, sales income and pre-tax profit.
</P>
<P>
Governor Zheng Silin said provincial officials would make
great efforts to foster its new economic powerhouses and establish
its new advantages for economic development by expanding
industrialized farming, electronic information systems,
automobiles, ship-building, petrochemicals, fine chemicals,
biological medicine and real estate.

<HEADLINE> US Urges Indonesia to Fully Implement Reform Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting US special envoy Walter
Mondale said here Tuesday that the best way to restore public
confidence in the Indonesia economy is fully implementing the IMF
(International Monetary Fund) reform program.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen after a 90-minute meeting with Indonesian
President Soeharto at the latter's residence in Central Jakarta,
Mondale said they mainly discussed the recent economic situation
in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and the IMF signed an agreement on January 15 this
year on an IMF-led 43 billion U.S. dollar bailout, and in
exchange, the Indonesian government agreed to carry out economic
and financial reforms to overcome its current monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
Besides the IMF reforms, Mondale said, they also discussed
further steps necessary to restore economic growth as well as
reestablish market confidence in the future for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Mondale, former US vice president under Jimmy Carter, arrived
here on Monday for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The US agreed in October last year to offer 3 billion U.S.
dollars in the IMF-framework to Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Multi-Party Cooperation &AMP; Political Consultation System  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The multi-party cooperation and
political consultation system under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) is one of China's basic political
systems.
</P>
<P>
China is a multi-party country. Except the CPC, China's ruling
party, the country has eight non-Communist parties. They are the
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China
Democratic League, the China Democratic National Construction
Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the
Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, the China Zhi
Gong Party, the Jiu San Society, and the Taiwan Democratic
Self-Government League.
</P>
<P>
Before major decisions concerning the national economy and
people's livelihood are made, the CPC would consult with the
the non-Communist parties and personages without party affiliation
to seek a consensus.
</P>
<P>
Non-Communist parties and non-party personages have
representatives in the National People's Congress and its standing
committee and subcommittees and in people's congresses at various
levels. In this way, they have been able to take an active part in
the running of state affairs and play a supervisory role. They
also recommend non-Communist party members and personages with no
party affiliation for leading posts of governments and judicial
organs at various levels.
</P>
<P>
The multi-party cooperation and political consultation system
under the leadership of the CPC took shape and developed in a long
period of revolution and economic construction. "Long-term
coexistence, mutual supervision, treating each other sincerely and
sharing weal and woe" is a historical summation of CPC's
cooperation with the non-Communist parties as well as a principle
for their mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The CPC is the ruling party in China. The eight non-Communist
parties are political organizations having connections with people
of particular social circles. They are friends of the CPC and are
working together with the latter to advance the socialist cause in
the country. They are parties that take part in the running of
state affairs, which cover the formulation of major state
policies, the election of government leaders, the enactment of
laws and regulations, and law enforcement, among others.

<P>
Its main task is to conduct political consultation and
democratic supervision and participate in the discussion and
running of state affairs.
</P>
<P>
Non-Communist party members and non-party personages are
invited to discussions organized by the CPC Central Committee and
CPC committees at various levels.
</P>
<P>
Senior leaders of the CPC Central Committee also invite them to
discussions, at which non-Communist parties and non-party
personages are informed of major policies to be adopted by the
CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Apart from expressing their views at consultative discussions,
non-Communist parties and personages without party affiliation can
raise their opinions concerning major state policies and
political, economic and cultural developments in written form or
in the presence of leaders of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, non-Communist parties have raised more
than 100 proposals of major significance. National supervisory,
procuratorial, auditing and educational departments have set up
supervisory systems of their own and invited non-Communist party
members and non-party personages to offer assistance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a growing number of members of non-Communist parties
and personages with no party affiliation have been promoted to
leading posts at various levels. Recent statistics show that 8,000
people who are not CPC members hold leading posts in 23 provinces,
five autonomous regions and four centrally-administered
municipalities.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Encouraging Technology Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China's Shandong Province plans to
increase technology trade with foreign countries in the coming
years, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Shandong's foreign trade is worth 20 billion US
dollars annually, but technology exports account for only one
percent of that.
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, the province expects to increase its
technology exports to 3 billion US dollars a year, or 6 percent of
the foreign trade, and technology imports to 15 percent by 2010.
</P>
<P>
In the past, technology exports mostly consisted of equipment
for small power stations, the rubber industry, or paper mills, but
in the future, the province will export hi-tech products. It will
also encourage local companies to work on large industrial
projects overseas in various ways.

<HEADLINE> Mini Automobiles Gain in Popularity in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese-built mini automobiles
(with engines smaller than 1.0 liter) are expected to perform well
in 1998 in the domestic market after seven years of fast growth in
production and sales.
</P>
<P>
The demand for such vehicles this year is estimated at 520,000
to 550,000, according to the Department of Auto Industry of
China's Ministry of Machine Building Industry.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 497,000 mini automobiles were produced in
1997, up 21.6 percent over 1996. The sales reached 486,000, up
20.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say the rising individual demand has strongly
promoted the production and sales of mini vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Business records of North Auto Market and Asian Games Village
Auto Market in Beijing reveal individual purchases accounted for
85 percent of mini sales there last year.
</P>
<P>
State regulations on the abandoning, consumption and use of
automobiles that became effective this year embodied government
encouragement for use of automobiles with the small engines.
</P>
<P>
Taxi services in small- and medium-size cities are primarily
using mini vans and cars. In big cities, many mini-van taxis --
called "bread-loaf taxis" because of their shape -- are entering
their obsolescence period.
</P>
<P>
In big-city suburbs and relatively well-off rural areas, an
increasing number of vehicles for agricultural use are being
replaced by pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
Mini autos are becoming increasingly popular with businesses
and government agencies, one of the factors that help enlarge the
minis' market share.
</P>
<P>
However, the production and sales increase of mini vehicles is
unlikely to remain as big as last year. Analysts believe sales
will be affected by a relatively tight financial policy, a further
drop in tariffs and the non-involvement of financial institutions
in auto loans and leases.

HAIKOU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has bought

<P>
The State-owned reclamation farms in the tropical province
produced a record 208,000 tons of rubber in 1997, accounting for
90 percent of the island's output and half of the country's
total.
</P>

However, the income from rubber is expected to drop by 900

</P>
<P>
According to Election Commission sources, 224 out of 535 seats
were declared at 7:00 a.m. (local time) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the two
major national political parties, got 80 and 52 seats
respectively.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that all the 535 seats will be declared late
Tuesday or early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The BJP, the Congress and the United Front, the three main
political forces in the country, have decided to hold meetings
themselves to discuss new strategies after the poll.
</P>
<P>
Poll Surveys and counting trends have shown that no single
party could be able to get a simple majority of the 543 seats in
the 12th Lower House of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)
(CPI-M) H. S. Surjeet said here Monday evening that the United
Front would make efforts to bring all secular forces together to
prevent the BJP from coming to power at the Center in case of a
hung Parliament. CPI-M is one of the 14-party constituents of the
United Front.
</P>
<P>
"If the BJP and its allies are in a position to form a
government, let them. Otherwise we will try to bring together all
secular forces," he told Doordarshan television here.
</P>
<P>
The BJP, which is expected to emerge as the largest party in
the elections, has already met here and decided to meet again on
March 6 in a bid to muster enough support from small parties to
come to power at the Center.
</P>
<P>
India started its general elections from February 16 and after
three phases of polling on February 16, 22, and 28, the election

BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China scored average annual
economic growth of 11 percent from 1993 to 1997, or 7.3 percentage
points above the world's annual average for the same period,
according to today's "People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
The paper reported on China's social and economic achievement
for the past year and said China came in 7th in the world in GDP
for 1997, narrowing the gap between it and the major developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to 1996, China stayed in 1st place in cereal grain,
cotton, rapeseed, meat, coal, cloth, cement, and TV output and
ranked high in power, chemical fertilizer, sugar, and crude oil
output. It produced 101 million tons of steel in 1996, bringing it
up to 1st place in the world from No.2 in 1995, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It did 325 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign trade in 1997,
putting it in 10th position in the world. It introduced 64 billion
U.S. dollars worth of overseas investment, a 64 percent increase
since 1993, putting it in 2nd place, after the United States.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange reserves stood at 139.9 billion
U.S. dollars y the end of 1997, putting it in 2nd place after
Japan. Its Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ranked 7th in
foreign exchange reserves in 1996 and 3rd in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, China earned 12.1 billion U.S. dollars from
overseas tourism, an 18 percent increase from 1996, putting it in
8th place in the world in hard currency earnings from tourism, up
one from the previous year's position.

<HEADLINE> Island Province Improves Economic Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China's largest island province
of Hainan has edged into the country's
top 10 economic competitors, a senior provincial government
official had disclosed recently.
</P>
<P>
The province which is also the country's largest Special
Economic Zone had a gross domestic product (GDP) of 41.8 billion
yuan in 1997, up 6.7 percent over the previous year, lagging
behind most of China's 30-odd provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities. However, its comprehensive economic
competitiveness ranks 10th in China after Shanghai, Beijing,
Guangdong and some other economic powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
Hainan now has basically recovered from an economic slump in
the past few years, brought about by speculative investments in
real estate, securities, finance and catering services.
</P>
<P>
The province has been making the most of its resource-rich
advantages, and found some new economic growth areas. Tropical
agriculture is one example. Last year, the island produced more
than two million tons of fruits and vegetables to become one of
the country's major suppliers.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thai Consumer Price Index Up 8.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The consumer price index (CPI)
soared 8.7 percent in the last twelve months while the monthly
index jumped 0.7 percent in February, Tuesday's Bangkok Post
reported.
</P>
<P>
Vithun Tulyanond, deputy director of the Business Economics
Department, attributed the jump to the price hikes in food and
beverage sectors.
</P>
<P>
Prices of food and beverage in February increased 1.6 percent
from January and 10.1 percent from those of the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
Among them, rice, flour and flour-made products saw the
sharpest price rises of 6.9 percent from January and 47.1 percent
from February 1997 due to an overwhelming demand, particularly for
exports.
</P>
<P>
As for non-food items, prices increased 0.3 percent last month
from January and 8.0 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Some economists predicted that this year's CPI was likely to
reach 14 percent, but someone disagreed.
</P>
<P>
Nateetip Tongkoa-on, director of the Trade and Economic Index
Division, explained that although production costs continued to
increase, most manufacturers tried to maintain selling prices
since they were afraid high prices will stop customers from buying
their products or services.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Striving to Attract Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province has
published a wide range of preferential policies to encourage
overseas investors in specific fields.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, overseas investors will be given
tax breaks and price cuts for the acquisition of land-use rights
if they invest in infrastructure projects, comprehensive
agricultural development projects, export-oriented farming or
high-tech projects.
</P>
<P>
The overseas investors will also be given other forms of
preferential treatment if they invest in technical upgrading of
local manufacturers or engage in the construction of
housing for families with low and middle incomes.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to attract more overseas funds in
accordance with local conditions in this coastal province and help
it open wider to the outside world, officials said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the province had altogether approved
establishment of overseas-financed projects with contracts
involving an agreed use of 36.5 billion U.S. dollars of overseas
investment. And the actual paid-in sum of overseas investment
stands at 20.2 billion U.S. dollars.

DHAKA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The six-month long boycott of
Parliament by the main opposition, the Bangladesh National Party
(BNP), will end by March 8, following an agreement signed between
the ruling Awami (people's) League and the BNP late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The BNP lawmakers had continued to abstain from attending

"All the 113 BNP MPs shall be inducted in parliamentary
standing committees on 35 ministries," it stated, adding that the
committees earlier constituted by the ruling party would be
reorganized in consultation with the opposition.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia and Bosnia resumed
airline flights between Belgrade and Banja Luka Monday, with the
landing of a Yugoslav air transport plane at the Banja Luka
airport.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovich, who headed an
economic delegation and flew to Banja Luka on the first flight,
said the resumption of the flight service emphasized the two
countries' progress and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic and Prime Minister
Milorad Dodik welcomed the Yugoslav delegation at the airport. The
officials discussed extending the cooperation between them.
</P>
<P>
The flight is the first between Yugoslavia and Bosnia in six
years. The Yugoslav airline stopped flying to Bosnia in April
1992, following Yugoslavia's division into five separate
countries.
</P>
<P>
Rida Attarashan, spokesman for the International High
Representative's office, said in Sarajevo Monday that the flight
was resumed under an agreement between representatives of Yugoslav
airlines JAT and the Bosnian national air carrier Air Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Sarajevo-Belgrade and Sarajevo-Pristina flight is expected
to resume soon.
</P>
<P>
Normalization of relations between Yugoslavia and
Bosnia-Herzegovina have not yet been firmly
established. Yugoslavia is demanding that Bosnian leader
Izetbegovic withdraw charges filed in the Hague's International
Tribunal claiming that Yugoslavia was an aggressor. Bosnia has
refused to withdraw the charges.

<HEADLINE> China's Poorest Region to Shake Off Poverty Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua)-- Xihaigu, one of China's poorest
regions in the northwestern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, is
expected to shake off poverty before the end of this century, a
local official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Home to a large number of Chinese Moslems, Ningxia is one of
the most underdeveloped regions in China, while Xihaigu, a
mountainous area frequented by natural disasters, is the poorest
part of Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
Ma Jinhu, a deputy from Ningxia to the Ninth National People's
Congress, China's new legislature that opens here Thursday, said
that most people in Xihaigu now have adequate food and clothing
thanks to the government assistance.
</P>
<P>
"The proportion of the needy to the total population in Xihaigu
has dropped to the current 25 percent from 70 percent in the
1970s, and the region is expected to bid farewell to poverty
soon," said Ma, commissioner of the Guyuan Prefecture to which the
Xihaigu region belongs.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, he said, the central government and the
autonomous regional government have spent tens of millions of yuan
each year to help the Xihaigu region to improve local farming
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Despite the constant dry spells that have hit the region in
recent years, the grain output in Xihaigu surged to 678 million
kilograms in 1997, the second highest in history.
</P>
<P>
"We're convinced that Xihaigu will no longer be under the reign
of poverty at the beginning of the next century," he said.

<HEADLINE> China's NPC Active in Diplomatic Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth National People's
Congress (NPC) has actively expanded friendly exchanges with
foreign parliaments since its establishment five years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheng Xiangqing, director of research in the
General Office under the NPC Standing Committee, the NPC Standing
Committee's foreign exchange constitutes an important part of
China's diplomacy and is playing an irreplaceable role.
</P>
<P>
Up to now the NPC has forged ties with parliaments of
approximately 140 countries, and received more than 150
delegations led by speakers or vice-speakers or organized by
foreign parliamentary organizations over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The NPC particularly expanded exchanges with the parliaments
of Russia, Japan, major developed countries in Europe and America,
and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Newt Gingrich, speaker of the US House of
Representatives, and Storm Thurmond, president pro tempore of the
US Senate, visited China at the invitation of the NPC, he noted.
</P>
<P>
During their visits, President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese
leaders conferred with them on Sino-US relations, he said. As a
result, the visits enhanced their mutual understanding of China
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, heads of the Iraqi National Assembly and
Esthonian parliament visited China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, delegations led by NPC Chairman Qiao Shi and other
senior legislators visited countries in Asia, including the member
nations of the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
Latin America, Africa and Europe in the past five years, studying
legislative work in these countries and drawing on the useful
experience for China's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The NPC is a member of some international parliamentary
organizations such as the Inter-Parliamentary Union, Asia-Pacific
Parliamentary Forum, and Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on
Population and Development.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the NPC sponsored the 96th Inter-Parliamentary
Conference in Beijing, which raised China's status in the world
and increased friendly cooperation between China and participating
countries.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges have also helped to promote economic and trade,
cultural, scientific and technological cooperation between China
and other countries.

<HEADLINE> Factory Owners Given Deadline to Sack Illegal Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Factory owners of nine sectors are
given 45 days from March 15 to lay off illegal foreign workers as
part of the country's efforts to solve the soaring unemployment
problem, the English Bangkok Post newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Labor Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri as
saying that officers from a special subcommittee will begin
inspecting workplaces of the nine sectors from May 1.
</P>
<P>
The nine sectors affected are garments and textile, food, heavy
industries, chemicals, wood, paper and publishing, service,
transportation and commercial sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to Trairong, deputy chairman of the subcommittee to
solve the problem of illegal foreign laborers, the Interior
Ministry will repatriate illegal foreign workers from March 15 to
30.
</P>
<P>
The government put weight on solving the problem of illegal
alien workers by inflicting heavy punishment to employers.
</P>
<P>
Those found to continue hiring foreign workers after the
deadline will face five years' imprisonment and/or a 50,000 baht
(1,150 US dollars) fine for violating the immigration act, and
three years in prison and/or a 60,000 baht (1,380 dollars) fine
for violating a law concerning illegal workers.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is confronted with soaring unemployment after the
economic crisis broke out in July 1997. The number of jobless
people is believed to have exceeded 1 million.
</P>
<P>
The government, therefore, started repatriating illegal foreign
workers, mainly from Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia, to alleviate the
pressure.

On the whole, the investment condition has greatly improved in

The president severely criticized the government's absence of
alacrity in improving investment conditions. He vowed to curb the
misbehavior of government officials.
</P>
<P>
Government officials should meet and communicate with foreign
investors to help them succeed in business in Kazakhstan, the

</P>
<P>
More than 200 foreign companies have invested in
Kazakhstan. They have made tremendous contributions to the
economic development and social stability of the country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns Iraq to Comply with U.N. Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Monday night warned Iraq of severest consequences if it fails to
comply with a new U.N. resolution that demands Baghdad allow
U.N. weapons inspectors access to any suspected sites.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight's unanimous vote by the United Nations Security
Council sends the clearest possible message. Iraq must make good
on its commitment to give the international weapons inspectors
immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access to any suspected
sites, any place, any time," Clinton said in a statement read by a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's statement came after the Security Council on Monday
unanimously adopted a resolution that warns Iraq of severest
consequences if it again bars U.N. arms inspectors from suspected
sites in their search for weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"All of the members of the Council agree that failure to do so
will result in the severest consequences for Iraq," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
In coming days and weeks, inspectors would renew their mission
to find and destroy Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons capacity, and the missiles to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq now has the responsibility to turn the commitment it has
made into full compliance," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Neither Clinton nor the U.N. document spelled out what the
consequences would be if Iraq refuses weapons inspectors access to
any suspected sites. But U.S. officials have said any further
violation by Iraq would ensure strong support for military
strikes.

<HEADLINE> Thai Commercial Banks Encouraged to Aid Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai commercial banks were
encouraged to extend more loans to local exporters as the central
bank approved the change in capital adequacy requirement, the
Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand agreed Monday to reduce the risk weighting
of pre-shipment credits from 100 percent to 20 percent, which
means commercial banks could maintain less capital in managing
their loan portfolios.
</P>
<P>
Under the capital adequacy guideline, banks must maintain
capital funds equal to 8.5 percent of risk assets.
</P>
<P>
Risk assets, which are primarily loans, are given different
weights according to the relative risks involved.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks had asked regulators to adjust the risk
weightings so that they could increase their credit lines to
exporters while gaining more flexibility in maintaining the
capital-to-risk assets ratio within the 8.5 percent minimum.

<HEADLINE> China's Rural Purchasing Power to Expand Faster This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 3 (Xinhua) -- China's vast rural market is
likely to grow faster than the urban market this year, the results
of a nationwide survey among farmers indicated.
</P>
<P>
The rural markets will further reveal their vitality and
potential this year by growing about 10 percent over last year's
1.04 trillion yuan (125.89 billion US dollars), today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The survey, arranged recently by the All China Federation of
Supply and Marketing Co-operatives, was conducted among 14,408
rural households in different parts of the country. It found that
the expenditure on everyday commodities and production materials
would continue to increase because of growing income levels last
year.
</P>
<P>
Spending on food will still be on top of farmers' shopping list
in 1998. However, as indicated by the survey, there will be
bigger increases in farmers' spending on durable goods for home
use and farming machinery as durable goods are becoming
increasingly popular among rural families. China's rural areas are
home to 72 percent of the country's 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
The market for durable goods such as color TV sets,
refrigerators, VCDs and washing machines will be brisk in the
central and western areas, with rural consumer demand expected to
grow by about 17 percent, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Demand for house construction and decoration materials will be
a "hot spot" which will boost the rural market in some
regions. And farmers' demand for production materials will also
continue to grow by six percent, it said.

<HEADLINE> 11 Banks to Fund Trade Financing in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Development Bank (ADB)
and 10 international banks have agreed to lend Thailand 1 billion
US dollars to fund trade financing for local importers, a source
at the Bank of Thailand said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Finance Ministry and the banks were expected to sign
an agreement to this effect on April 1, said the source who
refused to be named.
</P>
<P>
The five-year loan, guaranteed by the Thai government, will be
disbursed through the Export-Import Bank. Terms call for an annual
interest rate of libor (London interbank offered rate) plus 0.80
percent, the source explained.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is also guaranteeing principal and interest on the loan
for the first three years, which helped lower risk premiums
significantly on the borrowing.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be used to finance raw material imports for
export production as well as post-shipment financing.
</P>
<P>
Banks participating in the ADB-initiated loan included the Bank
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Asia and the Industrial Bank
of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The loan was the first taken by the Thai Finance Ministry since
the currency crisis engulfed Thailand and the region last July.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said the approval of the loan was a sign that
confidence in the Thai economy was improving within the
international financial markets.

<HEADLINE> 100 Million Latin-American Children Live in Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARTAGENA, Colombia, March 2 (Xinhua) -- About 100 million
Latin American children, half of the child population in the
region, are living in complete poverty, a report from the
Inter-American Institute of the Child said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The institute, with its headquarters in Montevideo, Uruguay,
said 100 million children lack the minimal conditions to survive.
</P>
<P>
It said: "Millions of Latin American residents under the age of
18 have not escaped from oppression and misery."
</P>
<P>
The report said the judicial treatment of children in the
region was precarious because many countries had ratified the
United Nations convention on children's rights in 1989.
</P>
<P>
However, not all the nations had improved their own legislature
according to the U.N. principles. This was why Latin American
children remained poor and defenseless.
</P>
<P>
The report has been contributed to the Regional Summit for
Infancy, which is convened by the First Lady of Colombia, Jacquin
Strouss de Samper, and participated in by more than 20 first
ladies from the region.

PRAGUE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The budget surplus of the Czech
Republic reached 4.8 billion koruna (about 145 million
U.S. dollars) during the first two months this year, Michal
Jirkovsky, a spokesman for the Financial Ministry, said Monday.

<HEADLINE> Drop in Peru's Mineral Exports Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Peru's mineral exports will
experience a 4.7 percent decline this year to 2.5 billion
U.S. dollars due primarily to a drop in metal prices in
international markets, a senior official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Manager of the National Society of Mining and Petroleum Carlos
Diez Canseco said the financial crisis in southeast Asia and the
over-supply in the second half of last year has forced the price
of copper to plummet from 99 cents per pound in 1997 to the
current 88 cents per pound, registering an 11 percent decline, the
biggest drop among all minerals.
</P>
<P>
Copper exports, which account for 40 percent of the country's
total mineral exports, are expected to fall by 7.5 percent this
year to about one billion U.S. dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
Canseco also predicted that gold prices will fall by 10.7
percent, which currently stand at 300 U.S. dollars per
ounce. Peru's gold exports will fall by 8.1 percent to 459 million
dollars because of the price.
</P>
<P>
The consequences of falling prices are visible. Three mines
have closed indefinitely in Peru and another has closed
temporarily. Though the mines are small, their importance cannot
be underestimated, Canseco said.

The monopoly of the tickets selling by the French organising

FIFA claimed that their measures were following guidelines agreed
by the EU some two years ago.
</P>
<P>
But CFO and FIFA received rampant complains from national

<P>
MOSCOW, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry called
on Yugoslav authorities and ethnic Albanian leaders to show
restraint and start talking to end the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Monday, the ministry voiced deep concern over
the tense situation in Kosovo and condemned terrorist actions
there.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged both sides of the conflict to abandon their
use of force. It called for a settlement of the Kosovo issue on
the principle of maintaining the integrity of Yugoslavia and
respecting the rights of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanian community, which accounts for 90 percent of
the population of Kosovo, has been seeking independence for the
province from the Republic of Serbia in Yugoslavia. This has been
resolutely opposed by the Yugoslavian authorities.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, separatists have carried out terrorist
actions in the province. A Yugoslav Interior Ministry police
patrol was ambushed last Saturday in Glovgovac, Kosovo, resulting
in the death of four policemen and 16 attackers.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Rising commodity prices pushed
Indonesia's monthly inflation rate to 12.76 percent in February,
the highest in the 30 years of President Soeharto's government,
the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) said.
</P>
<P>
The February inflation rate doubled the January level of 6.88
percent, and increased 12 times compared to the 1.05 percent in
February last year.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, inflation rate for the first two months of 1998

</P>
<P>
In February, food prices increased 16.07 percent, housing by
10.03 percent, clothing by 15.62 percent and miscellaneous goods
and services by 9.31 percent, the figures issued by BPS Monday
showed.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate started to increase significantly in September
last year at 1.29 percent as the currency woes, which first hit
the country in July, began to take effect.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Considers Regulating Banks' Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
is seriously considering capping commercial bank's interest rates
to only five percent above the 90-day treasury bill rate, the
Philippine Star reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted central bank governor Gabriel Singson as
saying that he is scheduled to meet anew this week with Bankers
Association of the Philippines President Deogracias Vistan to
discuss what other steps could be taken to reduce the banks' prime
lending rates.
</P>
<P>
If their lending rates will remain at their current level after
the meeting, Singson said the central bank may have to issue a
circular limiting the spread of the banks to just five percent.
</P>
<P>
Banks that violate the limit would face sanctions, Singson
added.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists and bankers have warned against such a
fixed interest ceiling.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Vistan said the bankers had reached a gentlemen
agreement with his association, agreeing to lower their prime
lending rates one percent every week starting February 2, but on a
voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the depreciation of the peso, the interest rates
in the country have been soaring in the past few months, dealing a
heavy blow to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Despite the efforts of the central bank, the interest rates
still remained high at between 25 percent and 30 percent, forcing
hundreds of businessmen to close shops to protest against the
"extremely high" rates.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Province in east China has
worked out a detailed program to gain a bigger share of the world
market, according to a provincial government official in charge of
foreign trade and economy.
</P>
<P>
The program is also aimed to keep the effects of the Asian
financial crisis in the local foreign trade sector to a minimum,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is one of the largest economic powers in the
country. Local products have been exported to more than 170
foreign countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
However, the about 60 percent of the local exports have gone to
neighboring countries in Asia, 30 percent have gone to the United
States and EU, while only a tiny few percent of exports have gone
to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Under the provincial plan, in the coming few years Shandong
will continue to focus on the Asia-Pacific area as well as
neighboring and surrounding countries and regions. Meanwhile,
efforts will be made to explore markets in CIS, the Middle East,
Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, by 2000 the province's exports to the
U.S and EU will reach 7 billion U.S. dollars, exports to Japan,
ROK and Southeast Asian countries will be 8 billion U.S. dollars
while 4 billion U.S. dollars worth of local products are expected
to be sold to the new markets.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government plans to issue more preferential
policies to stimulate its foreign trade sector.

<HEADLINE> Abuse of Child Labor Serious in Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARTAGENA, Colombia, March 2 (Xinhua) -- About 17 million
children between the ages of 10 and 14 are currently working in
Latin America and the Caribbean region. At least 90 percent of
them receive wages under the minimum wage level.
</P>
<P>
The figure indicates that one of every five children living in
that region is forced to become a child laborer, said Victor
Tokman, regional director of the International Labor
Organization. Tokman's report was submitted Sunday to the summit
on children's rights in Latin-America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from more than 30 countries in the region,
including 22 first ladies, took part in the three-day summit in
Cartagena, Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Also in his report, Tokman said there are more boys employed as
laborers than girls; and children living in rural areas go to work
at an earlier age than children living in cities.
</P>
<P>
The kind of work child laborers do is usually stressful and
they are grossly underpaid. The children also work long shifts of
35-46 hours per week, Tokman added.
</P>
<P>
He called for a program that would put an end to the abuse of
child labor and said a high priority should be placed on
preventing the employment of children in harsh and dangerous
positions.
</P>
<P>
The issue of child labor has topped all other topics during the
summit, including family violence, child sexual abuse and children
in armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the meeting, a document to prevent the abuse of
child labor is expected to be approved.

<HEADLINE> Burns Wins First World Champion in Safari Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Briton Richard Burns scored his
first win in the World Rally Championship (WRC) events Monday here
with "fantastic" feelings when standing on the start-and-end ramp
of the Safari Rally.
</P>
<P>
Burns finished with eight hours, 57 minutes and 34 seconds in
total at the WRC third round race. His average speed over the
1,063 kilometers of competitive sections was 119 kilometers per
hour, with a peak single section average of 141kph.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so, so chuffed!", the 27-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
His short hair was wet by spurting champagne, his smile full on
the face. His white Mitsubishi Carisma car, without a particle of
dust on, reflected the brilliance of the hot sun overhead.
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it. I am totally overcome," said Burn's
co-driver Robert Reid who had tears of joy streaming down his face.
</P>
<P>
Finnish Juha Kankkunen in a Ford was second with nine hours,
seven minutes and one second, only 25 seconds ahead of teammate
Ari Vatanen, also a Finn. They are followed by Toyota's French
driver Didier Auriol, 9:12:00.
</P>
<P>
First-timers SEAT had an outstanding debut, winning the
two-liter class and finishing fifth overall through Harri
Rovanpera in 11:03:12.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Luis Climent won GP N by a huge margin with a
Mitsubishi car. He also took the seventh place on the top ten with
11:25:37.
</P>
<P>
Safari has always been by far the longest and roughest WRC
event. This time, hot weather, thick dust and rocky roads took
toll of several top-seeded drivers including Finn Tommi Makinen,
Briton Colin McRae and Spaniard Carlos Sainz.
</P>
<P>
Makinen and McRae made shock exits due to engine failure when
approaching to the end of the 1139-kilometer second leg Sunday
afternoon, at the time they were taking the first two places of
the rally.
</P>
<P>
Sainz retired Monday morning soon after his rear strut broke.
The tyre then rubbered against the damaged strut and bodywork and
caught fire. However, he tried to continue on only three wheels
until ultimately the car was unable to drag itself any further.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Safari Rally, the sole WRC event in Africa,
started Saturday and run over a total of 2339.21 kilometers, 86
kilometers shorter than that of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Safari, started in 1953 as a sport of fun for amateur drivers
keen on driving around the roads of east Africa, nowadays is
widely recognized as one of the most glamorous events on the World
Championship calendar.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Giver Full Support to Johansson FIFA Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- European soccer governing body UEFA
confirmed on Monday it give its full support to Lennart Johansson
in his bid for the FIFA presidency.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation was a move designed to end rumours of a split
among its members in the build-up to the election in June.
</P>
<P>
The eight members of UEFA's executive committee, who are also
members of FIFA's executive committee, said they wanted Sepp
Blatter, FIFA'S secretary-general to say once and for all next
week whether or not he was standing for the presidency and end
weeks of rumour about his intentions.
</P>
<P>
The European members of FIFA's executive committee plus four
members from Africa and one from Oceania have called for an
extraordinary meeting of the FIFA executive committee in Zurich on
March 13 with just one topic on the agenda -- Blatter's position
in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
While UEFA itself is technically at least not directly involved
in the election, their eight FIFA members have repeatedly said
that Blatter should not run for the presidency if he remains in
his post as FIFA's secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Matarrese of Italy, who is also a FIFA vice-president,
said on Monday that Johansson, the UEFA president, had the full
backing of the entire executive which appeared to end rumours that
Switzerland might break ranks with UEFA and back Blatter.

<HEADLINE> Study: 400,000 Gulf War Veterans Exposed to Uranium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- As many as 400,000 U.S. troops
may have been exposed to hazardous depleted uranium from shells
fired by U.S. tanks and aircraft during the Persian Gulf War, said
a study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by the National Gulf War Resource Center,
estimated at least 400,000 service men and women had contact with
depleted uranium either during combat while recovering
contaminated weapons or while visiting the battleground after the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Veterans have been left twisting in the wind for seven years,"
said Paul Sullivan, executive director of the center that oversees
45 veterans groups. "We firmly believe this is a conservative
estimate of those exposed."
</P>
<P>
Depleted uranium is a metal residue left when natural uranium
is refined. It is used in artillery shells and bombs designed to
penetrate the armor of tanks. It also is used as a protective
shell on armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
When a depleted uranium shell hits its target, some of the
metal burns and oxidizes into small particles. This creates an
airborne dust that, if inhaled or ingested, can be toxic in
humans.
</P>
<P>
Short term symptoms include nausea, vomiting and weakness, the
study indicated. Ingestion of large amounts of dust can cause
kidney and liver damage, depressed immune system and cancer.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon office investigating Gulf War illnesses has
insisted that only 27 soldiers had possibly been exposed to
depleted uranium. But the Office of the Special Assistant for Gulf
War Illnesses admitted that thousands of troops may have been
exposed.

<HEADLINE> Greece Voices Concern Over Kosovo Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday voiced its concern
over the current situation in the Yugoslav region of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement issued Monday, the Greek Foreign Ministry
said that Athens would promote all initiatives in order to achieve
immediate commencement of talks between the parties concerned "so
as to find a solution with which the sovereignty and
unity-integrity of Yugoslavia as well as the rights of the
Albanian majority in Kosovo will be respected."
</P>
<P>
As a latest development, a Yugoslav Interior Ministry police
patrol was ambushed last Saturday in Glogovac, Kosovo, resulting
in the death of four policemen and 16 attackers.
</P>
<P>
Greece has said that it opposes Kosovo's independence from
Yugoslavia and respects the borders of Yugoslavia, coupled with
prospects for wide-ranging autonomy for Kosovo where 90 percent of
the 1.9 million population are made up of Albanians.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, Greece offered to host a meeting between
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Albanian Prime Minister
Fatos Nano and the leader of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
Ibrahim Rugova, to help resolve the Kosovo problem which often
leads to violence due to renewed calls by the Albanian minority
for independence from Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Meets Allies on Possible Action Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- As the U.N. Security Council is
preparing to adopt a resolution on a U.N. deal with Iraq over
weapons inspections, U.S. officials met with ambassadors of over
30 countries here Monday to discuss continued preparations for
possible military force should Iraq fail to comply with the deal.
</P>
<P>
Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas Pickering
and Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military
Affairs Eric Newsom "emphasized the importance of continued
coalition preparations," the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
It said the United States hoped the agreement negotiated with
Baghdad last month by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan would
provide access to all suspected sites where weapons of mass
destruction may be hidden.
</P>
<P>
"But as recent events have made clear, it is necessary that the
international community remain prepared to act forcefully it
Baghdad fails to comply with its commitments and obligations," it
added in a statement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials refused to list all the countries represented at
Monday's meeting. Britain has been Washington's leading supporter.
Other NATO nations, Australia, Argentina and some East European
states have also promised help.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the United States
hoped the resolution would send "s strong signal to Iraq that if
it does violate this agreement... that they understand what the
consequences would be."
</P>
<P>
"We have made clear what those consequences would be, and we
have also made clear that we don't see the need to return to the
Security Council," Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"And we also have very clear assurances from key governments
that they would understand and be more supportive of that decision
if it comes to that," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. armed forces buildup in the Gulf will stay in place
and operate at a high tempo for at least the next 90 days while
U.N. inspectors resume their search for Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, senior military official here said.
</P>
<P>
They said the Pentagon believed it would take that long for
inspectors to visit "test-case" sites, such as presidential
compounds suspected of holding components for biological and
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will travel to Europe and
Canada for a six-day visit. She will discuss with U.S. key allies
like Britain, France, Germany Italy and Canada. And possible
action against Iraq will come up during her talks with officials
of these countries.
</P>
<P>
"I would fully expect them to go over the Iraq issue in great
detail and plan for possible contingencies if past is prologue and
Iraq does violate the agreement," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Quebec's Johnson Steps Down As Liberal Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Daniel Johnson, leader of the
Liberal Party of Quebec, announced Monday that he will step down
to give his party a better chance of winning the next provincial
election.
</P>
<P>
"Today, with the issues of the next election taking shape, I
think the time has come to announce that I will be leaving public
life," Johnson told a press conference broadcast live on
television.
</P>
<P>
"The election will be extremely important for all Quebecers and
I am convinced that the Quebec Liberal party will win it," he said
from Quebec City, capital of Canada's French-speaking province of
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 53, has been the leader of Quebec's opposition Liberal
Party for four years. He will remain as leader until a successor
is chosen.
</P>
<P>
His party was defeated in a 1993 provincial election by the
ruling Parti Quebecois, which has been trying to separate the
province from the rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Monday's announcement will likely mean that Quebec Premier
Lucien Bouchard will put off an election that he had been hinting
could be held as early as this Spring, according to analysts here.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Newsprint Output Down in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian newsprint industry
produced a total of 763,000 tons of newsprint in January, down
4.2 percent from that of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association said Monday that the
industry's operating rate also dipped to 87 percent of its
capacity from 93 percent in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
"During the month, total shipments from Canadian producers
declined by 7.6 percent, with deliveries to the U.S. dropping by
2.0 percent and those to offshore markets by 27.3 percent," the
association said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Canada's domestic deliveries grew by 7.7
percent over January 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the end of January, Canadian newsprint producers held
336,000 tons in inventory, which represents an increase of 82,000
tons from the end of December.
</P>
<P>
"It should be noted that producers' stocks typically increase
in January," it said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Iran's Opposition to Terrorism "Encouraging" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Monday it was encouraged by Iran's statement of opposing
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian statement was reported by Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini, who is on a visit to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
statement was "encouraging to us."
</P>
<P>
"Foreign Minister Dini has described his discussion with
(Iranian) President (Mohhamad) Khatami in encouraging terms --
namely that the government of Iran has indicated that it opposes
terrorism," he told reporters. "This is encouraging to us."
</P>
<P>
Dini, the first cabinet-rank official to visit Iran since the
European Union lifted a ban last week on high-level visits, said
the United States would be pushed by the realities of Gulf
politics to pursue a more normal relationship with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would likely
raise with Dini his thoughts on the visit when she travels to
Rome later in the week.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says No Plans for further Food Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States has no plans
to send more food to the Democratic People's Repubic of Korea
(DPRK), the State Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have no plans for further assistance," Spokesman for the
Department James Rubin told a briefing. But he added: "We
encourage other members of the international community to
contribute."
</P>
<P>
The DPRK's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) has said that
grain rations were cut in January and February but supplies were
still expected to run out by mid-March.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the announcement by KCNA was "not a surprise to us"
and the U.N. World Food Program had predicted such a situation.
</P>
<P>
The United States has pledged 200,000 tones of food aid this
year for the famine-stricken DPRK, and the first shipment of
22,000 tons is expected to arrive in the country around the
beginning of April.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program is currently supplying 98,000 tons of
grain to DPRK. It also launched a new international appeal in
January for 658,000 tons of food to help 7. 47 mil in the country
-- about a third of the population.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Current Account Posts Big Deficit in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Canada's current account returned
to a deficit of 17.0 billion dollars (11.9 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1997, following a small surplus in 1996, Statistics Canada
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The change in 1997 was chiefly due to a large reduction in the
surplus on goods and, to a lesser extent, to a higher deficit on
investment income," the statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Canada's surplus on goods drooped by 17.6 billion
dollars to 23.4 billion dollars, as imports outpaced exports for
the first time in six years.
</P>
<P>
Strength in Canadian demand caused imports to rise across a
wide spectrum of goods, while exports surged mainly in auto,
machinery and equipment, industrial materials and energy products.
</P>
<P>
As foreign multinational corporations earned higher profits in
Canada, the country's deficit on investment income showed a rise
of 4.1 billion dollars in 1997 to a high of 31.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign corporations reinvested the bulk of these
profits into their Canadian operations in 1997, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Central Asian Countries to Cooperate in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and four Central Asian
countries announced Monday that they will cooperate closely in
exploiting the Caspian oil, the Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministers of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan
and Turkmenistan discussed the issue on Sunday and Monday in
Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers confirmed the significance of transporting these
resources to international markets in safety through economically
and commercially feasible multiple oil and natural gas
pipelines," said a communique issued at the end of the
ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
It added that the five countries agree that a pipeline
route through Azerbaijan, Georgia as well as Turkey will be a
wise choice for oil transportation.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said that the planned
Baku-Ceyhan pipeline, which has 468 kilometers in Azerbaijan,
225 kilometers in Georgia and 1037 kilometers in Turkey, has
gained general support of the five countries.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this will be realized some day. But, still,
we should not raise our expectations too high," he said.
</P>
<P>
Officials closed to the meeting said that Azerbaijan and
Georgia expressed full support for the Baku-Ceyhan project put
forwarded by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan, however, said that they favored the Baku-Ceyhan
project but that they could support it only if the financial
and technical problems involved get resolved.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been playing an active role in exploiting the
abundant Caspian oil in order to meet its rapidly increasing
energy demands and also earn foreign exchange through supplying
pipelines.
</P>
<P>
As an energy-starving country, Turkey has to import oil and
natural gas from its neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> "We Want Peace," Israelis Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAQOURA, Jordan, March 2 (Xinhua) -- "We want peace," said the
Israelis who came here Monday to attend a eulogy ceremony for
seven Israeli school girls killed near the Jordan-Israel border by
a Jordanian soldier on March 13, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We come to visit 'the area of peace'," said Yossi Atiyas,
whose 14-year-old cousin Meiri Yeela was shot dead by Ahmad Al
Dakamseh with six other schoolmates when they were touring the
border area.
</P>
<P>
Atiyas attended Monday's ceremony together with 14 other
relatives of Yeela's family at the invitation of the Jordanian
government. "Peace is good. We all expect peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 450 Israelis, including all the family members of
the seven school girls, arrived at the daisy-covered highland to
commemorate the victims.
</P>
<P>
Meghldish Aliel's grandmother burst into tears as soon as she
got off the bus, saying her granddaughter was killed by "a crazy
man."
</P>
<P>
"What we say is that she was dead before the gun of a crazy
man, but what we do not want to say is that she was dead due to
the long-time conflicts between Arab (countries) and Israel," said
Aliel's grandfather, who was supporting his wife from falling down
to the ground.
</P>
<P>
Relatives lined up on the slope where the girls were shot and
killed, for making fun of the soldier praying. Some cried, some
murmured and others stared at the yellow flowers covering the
slope.
</P>
<P>
Among the mourners was a 10-year-old boy Sagi Musay, whose
cousin Ptichi Sivan was one of the victims.
</P>
<P>
"I loved Sivan. We used to play together, shop together and go
to school together. When she was killed, I lost one of my best
friends," he said.
</P>
<P>
"She was killed because she was Jewish. There are conflicts
between the Jewish people and the Arab people. There is no
peace. We expect peace," said the boy.
</P>
<P>
The girls teacher, Yafa Shukrun, made a speech soon after the
ceremony started. She expressed hope that the Jewish and Arab
peoples will co-exist in peace.
</P>
<P>
"We share the water of a river and we share the scent of daisy
flowers, I hope we could bury the axe and strive for peace," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The Yarmouk River flows between Jordan and Israel and Baqoura,
where the shooting occurred, stands beside the river.
</P>
<P>
Representative of the Jordanian army Major General Abed Khalaf
Najada told the mourners that the armies of the two countries have
been coordinating closely with each other in the past months to
prevent such violence from happening again.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein and Crown Prince Hassan have contacted with
Israeli leaders several times to arrange the ceremony, which was
to show Jordan's determination to avert new violence and establish
peace between the two peoples, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All of us will do everything to make better peace both in
Israel and Jordan," he added.
</P>
<P>
A similar eulogy ceremony was held in Nahraim, Israel, just
across the border, during the day, which was attended by Jordanian
Chief Chaberlain Raad Ben Zeid and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The killer Dakamseh was sentenced to death last year and the
victims' families received compensation from Hussein
himself. However, the court ruling and the compensation triggered
strong opposition in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and was
believed to be Israel's best friend among its many hostile Arab
neighbors. Some Jordanians, however, are reluctant to go along
with the government line.

WASHINGTON, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will discuss the Iraqi situation and other
issues on a trip starting Thursday to Ukraine, Italy, Germany,
France, Britain and Canada.
</P>
<P>
"The two-fold purpose of her trip will be to maintain our close
relationship with some of our strongest allies... and to nurture
our relationship with a new and important partner, Ukraine,"
announced State Department spokesman James Rubin.

Albright is expected to examine closely with members of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) the agreement signed

Kofi Annan, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Albright's first stop will be Ukraine. She and Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma will discuss nonproliferation concerns and
the business and investment climate in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
During her visit to Italy, Albright will go to the Vatican for
a discussion with Pope John Paul II on his recent trip to Cuba and
other issues.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Egypt Warns Against Manipulating World Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Monday sounded alarm
against the tendency of big powers manipulating the United Nations
and international relations sliding into anarchy, the Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a symposium opened here Monday, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa expressed regret that the U.N. is being
controlled by "forces which care only for their interests and do
not abide by international legitimacy."
</P>
<P>
"We are passing through a period marked by duality of
resolutions and selective application of these resolutions, thus
under-estimating international legitimacy and law," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
He added that since the end of the cold war, there is "only one
country" capable of applying influence on the international scene
and tampering with the international will.
</P>
<P>
"It interferes in the international decision-making process in
such a way that does not spare the Middle East," he said,
apparently referring to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., despite international call for a peaceful settlement
of the Iraqi crisis over weapons inspections, had repeatedly
threatened to use force against Baghdad before U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan brokered a deal with Iraq late last
month.
</P>
<P>
Even after the signing of the deal, Washington decided to keep
its warplanes, air-craft carriers and other combat ships in the
Gulf region and insisted on punishing Iraq if it again breaches
signed accords and U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Moussa warned that challenges facing the Arab world have
redoubled since the Arab-Israeli war in June 1967, as more Arab
lands have been occupied since then and international politics
poised to protect "world conglomerates."
</P>
<P>
Moussa called for restructuring the U.N., stressing the
importance of the world organization to Third World countries in
particular.
