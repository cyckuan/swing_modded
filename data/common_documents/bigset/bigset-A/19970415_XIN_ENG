<HEADLINE> Dennis Wins Bus Export Orders from Hongkong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Export orders worth 70 million
pounds (112 million US dollars) have been placed with Dennis
Specialist Vehicles by three of Hongkong's biggest bus operators,
according to an announcement here today.
</P>
<P>
"Dennis has been supplying double-deck buses to Hongkong for
almost 20 years without a break," said Roger Heard, Dennis sales
and marketing director, "which gives us a track record no other
chassis manufacturer can match."
</P>
<P>
"With the Trident we are now taking the lead in the supply of
accessible double-deckers, which we believe will ultimately
strengthen our position as supplier of buses to mainland China,
where demand for transport is growing rapidly," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 112 million US dollars order is divided between two new
Dennis double-deck models -- the trend-setting low-floor Trident,
and an improved three-axle Dragon powered by the latest
low-emission Cummins M11 engine, which is also used in the
Trident.
</P>
<P>
The three companies which have placed orders are all existing
Dennis users. Among them, the Kowloon Motor Bus Company runs the
world's biggest Dennis Fleet (with more than 1,600 in daily
service) and is adding to this almost 350 Tridents and Dragons.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong Citybus has also ordered low-floor Tridents, while the
China Motor Bus Company is taking a quantity of Dragons.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the deal, the British Motor Industry said in a
statement: "The orders for 421 double-decker buses demonstrate
the Hongkong bus operators' commitment to improving services after
the colony's return to mainland China."
</P>
<P>
"They provide Dennis with an ideal opportunity to strengthen
its relationships with potential new customers in China, where the
expanding economy is creating new demands for transport," it
added.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Praises Canada for Efforts to Bolster Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 14 (Xinhua) - Canada is trying to get all the
parties concerned to the negotiating table and help overcome the
obstacles facing the stalemated Middle East peace process,
visiting Canadian Middle East peace coordinator Andrew Robinson
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Robinson made the remarks while meeting with Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdul Salam Majali, who praised Canada for its
contributions to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to Radio Jordan, Majali and Robinson reviewed the
efforts underway to get the peace process back on track and the
issue of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister underlined that the refugee issue could only
be settled when the Palestinians regained their political identity
through the establishment of their own state on their national
soil.
</P>
<P>
Canada has been playing a minor role in speeding up the peace
process. However, the Canadian participation is expected to be
effective to some extent, since King Hussein's recent
visit to the United States produced no concrete results for the
peace mark.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian move came after the U.S. has shunned away from
efforts to bring the peace process back on track and to defuse the
Arab-Israeli tension caused by Israeli government's building of a
Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> France Encouraged by Declarations of Mobutu, Kabila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it is
encouraged by the declarations made last weekend by Zairian
President Mobutu Sese Seko and Zairian rebel leader Laurent-Desire
Kabila that they are likely to hold direct talks.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said
that France "wants to consider the declarations of President
Mobutu" and those of Kabila "as not excluding the possibility of
a meeting, and that appeared encouraging to us."
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion of the ceasefire as well as the pursuit of
political dialogue between the Zairian parties are necessary and
urgent," said the spokesman, adding that France "strongly
encourages the rapid resumption of inter-Zairian talks."
</P>
<P>
Mobutu said last Saturday that he was ready to meet Kabila if
he asked for such a meeting in a polite way, and rejected an
ultimatum by Kabila who asked Mobutu to meet him within three days
to negotiate the terms for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
The "foreign minister" of the Zairian rebels, Bizima Karaha,
said on Sunday that Kabila would travel very soon -- probably to
South Africa -- to "dynamize" negotiation with the Zairian
government, and that if necessary, he would meet Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
The delegates of Mobutu and Kabila held talks for four days
last week in South Africa under the mediation of the United
Nations special envoy for the Great Lakes region, Mohammed
Sahnoun.
</P>
<P>
France last Friday called for a meeting between Mobutu and
Kabila, which Paris said "would contribute to facilitating a
pacific solution."

<P>
ATHENS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Greece's current accounts deficit
reached 4.5 billion U.S. dollars this year, compared to 2.8
billion dollars last year, figures released by the bank of Greece
said today.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the increase mainly to the trade
deficit rise and invisible surplus drop.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Greece's trade deficit has reportedly increased by 1.2
billion dollars while the invisible surplus dropped by 469 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the bank said, inflows of private capital
increased this year to reach 7.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In March, exchange reserves in the country reached a record
high, totaling 19.4 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Economy Grows, Signals End of Slump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia's gross domestic product
(GDP) grew year-on-year by 0.2 percent in the first quarter, in a
further sign that the country's six-year slump may be over.
</P>
<P>
The small rise in GDP for the first quarter over the first
quarter of 1996, quoted by the State Statistics Committee, comes
three days after figures showing industrial output rose 0.7
percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Services still accounted for more than half of GDP, rising from
50.5 percent in the first quarter of 1996 to 51.8 percent, but the
proportion of GDP accounted for by manufacturing rose from 36.8
percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
GDP in Russia has fallen every year since the collapse of the
Soviet Union in 1991 as the country has undergone painful
reforms.
</P>
<P>
But GDP and industrial output have risen every month so far
this year compared with year-earlier comparisons and government
officials have forecast that GDP will rise by 2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the World Bank, in a report issued last month, forecast
zero growth this year, and two percent growth in 1998.

<HEADLINE> UK Output, Input Prices Both Fall in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Both Britain's output prices and
input prices fell unexpectedly last month, boosting the
re-election campaign of the ruling Conservative Party, which still
lags far behind the opposition Labor Party in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released today by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS), output, or factory gate prices fell by 0.1
percent in March on the previous month, giving a 1.0 percent
increase on the year, against a forecast of a 0.1 percent rise for
the month.
</P>
<P>
This compared with a 0.1 percent monthly fall and a 1.2 percent
year-on-year rise in February.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, input, or raw materials prices fell by 0.5 percent
on the month and 7.6 percent on the year.
</P>
<P>
UK government, facing the general election on May 1, welcomed
the data, saying that the figures were proof that its policies had
brought about a sound economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Clarke, Chancellor of the Exchequer, said the figures
showed "Conservative policies have made Britain a low inflation
economy", adding "we are achieving sustainable growth without
either inflation or balance of payments problems, building
prosperity that lasts".
</P>
<P>
Although some economists said that the data indicated that
inflation is not an issue people should be worrying about, others
believed that interest rates would probably still have to rise
after the general election.
</P>
<P>
They argued that today's data only suggest that inflation is
not a real problem for the manufacturing sector, a relatively
small part of the economy.
</P>
<P>
But the service sector, making up a far greater part of the
whole economy, has already showed signs of inflationary pressures.

FREETOWN, April 15 (Xinhua)-- The Sierra Leone Association of
Journalists (SLAJ) Monday stepped up its attack on the press bill
to be debated by parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The association in a statement issued Monday, the second
within 36 hours, said the bill "reflects a slant in favour of
political rather than professional interest".
</P>
<P>
SLAJ's president Frank Kposowa in an interview with Xinhua
accused information minister Abdul Thorlu-Bangura of "betraying
the confidence of SLAJ which had the feeling it enjoyed the
cooperation with the authorities to effect the necessary
improvement of press laws".
</P>
<P>
Information minister Thorlu-Bangura in an interview said the
bill "is necessary to bring sanity to the profession and save the
trade from being swamped by dead woods".
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the bill has also come in from the Pan African
Association for Human Rights and Democracy which advises the
government to allow SLAJ "to reslove problems within the armbit
of journalism".
</P>
<P>
"The bill is a direct step to muzzle if not censure the
press", the association says.

<HEADLINE> Kim Young-sam to decide whether to grant Amnesty to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior South Korean official today
stressed that only President Kim Young-sam can decide whether and
when to grant a pardon to former presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh
Tae-woo.
</P>
<P>
The granting of amnesty is an authority and privilege held only
by the president, said Kang In-sup, presidential secretary for
political affairs.
</P>
<P>
"It is too early to talk about whether and when the president
will pardon the former presidents," said Kang in response to some
news reports that the ruling camp and presidential secretariat
intend to grant a presidential amnesty to Chun and Roh.
</P>
<P>
The move will help conclude President Kim's term in
reconciliation and provide a momentum for national unity, said
these reports.
</P>
<P>
"At present, the president is not considering the matter," said
Kang.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh, both jailed for mutiny, treason and corruption
charges, face a final verdict by the Supreme Court on April 17.
</P>
<P>
With the ruling by the highest court approaching, some
presidential aspirants of the ruling New Korea Party (NKP) have
recently called for the granting of a special amnesty to the
former presidents.
</P>
<P>
The recent Hanbo scandal in which several ruling party
representatives and government officials were involved defaced the
NKP and the government.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who initiated the trials, is believed by most
mass-communications to have the matter better concluded by
granting pardons to the former presidents before his five-year
term ends.

<HEADLINE> EU Suspends Panel on Helms-Burton Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
decided to delay submitting its complaint against the United
States' Helms-Burton Bill to a WTO trade dispute panel.
</P>
<P>
The EU was due to submit its complaint against U.S. legislation
penalizing foreign companies trading with or investing in Cuba to
the WTO today.
</P>
<P>
But after a preliminary deal between the two sides last Friday,
in which the U.S. agreed to modify the law, known as the
Helms-Burton Bill, EU Trade Commission Sir Leon Brittan said the
EU would suspend the submission of its complaint and start talks
with the U.S. over the dispute.
</P>
<P>
However, the EU has not ruled out reviving the complaint and
Brittan emphasised that this was only a preliminary agreement. He
said the EU hoped to sign a final agreement with the U.S. in
October.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress passed the Helms-Burton Bill last year to
isolate Cuba by preventing foreigners investing in the Caribbean
country.
</P>
<P>
The bill would allow Americans to sue in U.S. courts foreign
companies deemed to have profited from investments in property
confiscated by Havana.
</P>
<P>
But the EU, along with other main trading partners of the
U.S. protested against the bill and threatened to take its
complaint to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said that although the complaint had been suspended,
the EU remains "absolutely resolute" in its opposition to the
unacceptable extraterritorial nature of the Helms-Burton legislation.
</P>
<P>
"It is not acceptable for one country to seek to obtain foreign
policy objective by imposing or threatening to impose sanctions on
what other countries are doing in third countries," he said.

<P>
MAPUTO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A Malaysian businessmen
delegation arrived at Mozambique's capital Maputo today for
probing the possibility of investing in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
Dato Wahab, the spokesman for the delegation, said at the
Maputo airport that they will meet their counterparts in
Mozambique's automaking, construction and trade sectors.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to explore the investment opportunities in the
Mozambican economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian delegation is expected to meet with Mozambican
President Joaquim Chissano, Mozambican Minister for Finance and
Planning Tomaz Salomao and the head of the Mozambique Bank.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will also tour the Maputo port and the Matola
industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
Egas Mussanhane, a Mozambican businessman, said the visit of
Malaysian businessmen opens new prospects for cooperation among
countries along the Indian Ocean.
</P>

The delegation will wind up its visit on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Second African Oil Trade Conference Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A four-day Second African Oil
Trade Conference started here today, seeking to provide a unique
forum for learning about the latest in oil marketing, risk
management and financing techniques.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting, Zimbabwean transport and energy minister
Simon Moyo said given the high cost of imports, African
countries, the majority of which are landlocked, were
increasingly facing the problem of ensuring that they offered
fuel at an affordable price.
</P>
<P>
The minister said since a few African countries had oil
resources, a number of logistical problems still militated
against cost effective and satisfactory product distribution on
the world's poorest continent.
</P>
<P>
He said, "our region depends heavily on petroleum imports and
as such we rely on prices dictated to us by the international
market.
</P>
<P>
"Accordingly this has strengthened our commitment to regional
cooperation through such institutions as COMESA (Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa), SADC (Southern African
Development Community) and indeed the PTA bank (the Eastern and
Southern African Trade and Development bank) itself," said Moyo.
</P>
<P>
The conference was organised by the PTA bank, the African
export import bank, Citibank, Nigeria National Petroleum
Corporation, Shell International, Gulf Africa Petroleum
Corporation and Zimbabwe Banking Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The conference is a follow up to last year's conference which
was also held in Harare.

<HEADLINE> Greece: Position to Recall Envoy in Iran Not Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government reaffirmed
today that there had been no change concerning the issue of
recalling its ambassador from Iran following a European Union (EU)
Presidency request that all EU member-states should do so.
</P>
<P>
The Eu call came after a German court accused Iranian political
leaders of ordering the assassination of exiled Kurdish dissidents
in the German capital city of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Greece, the only EU country not to recall its envoy from
Tehran, was continuing to examine the issue "in its details" in
order "to see how it will handle" the matter, Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said.
</P>
<P>
Late last week, Greece voiced reservations over the EU request,
saying "the isolation of a country in order to help it be
incorporated in an international system is not the best way," and
"we are examining the whole issue."
</P>
<P>
Bonn immediately reacted with the German Foreign Ministry
expressing "surprise" at Athens' stance and warning that such a
move refused the " European solidarity towards Germany."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the German reaction, Reppas today stressed that
there was "solidarity" with Germany, but there was "no antagonism"
with Iran.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Calls for Cease-fire in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday again called for cease-fire in Zaire after
learning that the government and rebel force had accepted a
U.N.five-point peace plan.
</P>
<P>
"While I am pleased that the parties to the conflict in Zaire
have accepted the five-point peace plan endorsed by the Security
Council, I am concerned that its implementation has not yet began
in earnest," Annan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Saying he was encouraged that President Mobutu had agreed to a
dialogue, Annan appealed to all member states to press Kabila,
leader of the advancing rebel force, and his supporters to seek a
negotiated solution through a cease-fire and sustained talks on
the future of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"A durable solution cannot be achieved through military means,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Annan also called for concerted international efforts in
bringing a peaceful solution of the Zaire conflict.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that Zaire is on the verge of major political
change," he said. "but this change has to be managed, with the
support of the international community, in a concerted and focused
manner."
</P>
<P>
"The stakes are high," he said. "If we are successful, Zaire
could begin to move in the direction of national reconciliation,
democracy and prosperity. If we fail, it will mean misery and
stagnation for millions of people in the region."

<TEXT>
<P>
KISANGANI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- It is the general hope of some
75,000 refugees in the Kasese camp, eastern Zaire, to end their
exodus, return home and live a peaceful life.
</P>
<P>
About 100 to 200 refugees die every day in the camp, located
in bushes 26 kilometers south of Kisangani, the third largest
city in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Cholera and other infectious diseases are seen among the
refugees, most of them Hutus fleeing Rwanda during the 1994
genocide and traveling over 1,000 kilometers to the Kisangani
region.
</P>
<P>
Mukakabanda Beata, 11, wanders in the camp every day with her
5-month-old brother on her back. When asked where are her
parents, Beata cried,"I am missing mama and papa."
</P>
<P>
Beata and her brother are now taken care of by her mother's
sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
Nkerabahizi Donatien from Burundi also missed his parents and
came to Zaire with his younger brother and sister. He even does
not know if his parents are still alive.
</P>
<P>
There are no newspapers or radios in the camp, leaving no
means for the refugees to get to know what has happened in their
home countries. Many refugees said what they can hope is just
that things will get better.
</P>
<P>
Once security in their home countries gets restored, they will
return, the refugees repeated.
</P>
<P>
"I like my country. The Hutus and Tutsis should be brothers.
They should not kill each other. Once I get to know there is
security in my country, I will return there to make some
contribution to national development," said Furuha Soidi, a
refugee in the camp.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A three-day southern African
irrigation technology transfer workshop in support of food
security started here today.
</P>
<P>
Opening the workshop, Zimbabwean agriculture minister Dennis
Norman said southern African countries need sound investment in
water harvesting and irrigation infrastructure for the region to
reduce the variability of agricultural production and ensure food
security.
</P>
<P>
He said recurrent droughts and uneven distribution of rainfall
were serious constraints to agricultural production and food
security in many African countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed good government policies were required for
establishing a conducive environment for the participation of
smallholder farmers and well-trained farmers and personnel with
adequate technical knowledge required for the implementation and
monitoring of various irrigation projects.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was jointly organised by the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the International Programme
for Technology Research in Irrigation and Drainage (IPTRID) of
the world bank.
</P>
<P>
The participants will look at ways of reducing the cost and
improving access to irrigation technologies for individual
farmers or smallholder farmer groups, the promotion of local
manufacture and demonstration of irrigation equipment and
provision of technical services.

<P>
HARARE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean agriculture minister
Dennis Norman today ruled out any possibility of the country's
tobacco being affected by the blue mould disease, saying the
disease does not occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said it was impossible for Zimbabwean tobacco to have been
affected by the disease.
</P>
<P>
"It does not exist here nor this part of the world but in
north and south America, Europe, Australia and the Mediterranean
regions," said Norman.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, relevant authorities would soon launch their
own investigations into the matter.
</P>
<P>
The disease is said to cause substantial damage to seedlings
in nurseries and to tobacco in the field. In countries where it
is endemic, it is controlled by means of very expensive
fungicides.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is the world's third largest exporter of tobacco,
with the crop being the country's single largest foreign currency
earner, bringing into the country 636 million U.S. dollars last
year.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Urges Somali Factions to Reconcile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid said here today the league is exerting strenuous
efforts to push all Somali factions to attend the National
Reconciliation Conference scheduled to be held in June.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after a meeting with Somalia National
Alliance leader Hussein Farah Aideed today.
</P>
<P>
Meguid reiterated that the league will maintain dialog with
different factions in Somali in order to reach a settlement for
the crisis acceptable to all.
</P>
<P>
As part of the recent Egyptian consultations with various
Somali factions, President Hosni Mubarak today also held talks
with Aideed on rebuilding Somalia and the reconciliation process
initiated by the transitional government since March.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said after meeting the
visiting Somali leader Sunday that "it is vital for Somali leaders
to find common ground for ending the problems in the country."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Somali faction leader said he has appealed for
"moral" and "regional" support from Egypt to help resume
contacts with neighboring countries and restore stability.
</P>
<P>
Aideed, leader of the most powerful militia in the southern
half of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, arrived here Friday.
</P>
<P>
His visit followed the one paid last month by his rivals in the
Somali National Salvation Council, an umbrella group representing
26 factions fighting him.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Ali Mahdi Mohamed, leader of Mogadishu's
northern section, also came here to meet Egyptian officials
mediating in the six-year Somali conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 ouster of the late President Mohamed Siad Barre,
Somalia has been fragmented into fiefdoms protected by factional
leaders, who continued to fight to expand their turfs despite
several peace conferences.

<HEADLINE> No Crisis in Angola's Peace Process: U.N. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The abstention of opposition
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi in the inauguration ceremony of the
new Angolan government can not constitute a crisis to the
country's peace process, U.N. envoy to Angola Blondin Beye said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), failed to attend the inauguration
ceremony of the government of national unity and reconciliation
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, Beye was quoted by the Angolan News Agency today that
what's important is the government's assuming office, so the aim
has been reached.
</P>
<P>
He added he was satisfied with the speech UNITA Vice Chairman
Antonio Dembo made at the ceremony on behalf of Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration of the government will help solve all pending
problems about the Lusaka peace accord, he said.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA members in the new government will create conditions
for Savimbi to arrive at and settle in Luanda as soon as
possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
A new U.N. Verification Mission to Angola will be set up soon
to monitor arms confiscation, mine-clearance, the forming of the
united army and the nationwide administration system, and the
definition of the status of UNITA radios, he said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Proceeds from the
oil-for-food plan, a program to alleviate the severe humanitarian
situation in Iraq, have exceeded one billion dollars so far, a UN
spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the news briefing, Juan Carlos Brandt, associate
spokesman for UN secretary-general, said that funds deposited and
distributed came to 1,046 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs reported that Iraqi side
has submitted 48 oil contracts and all of them have been approved,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 468 goods applications have been submitted to UN
Secretariat and 124 goods applications submitted to the sanctions
committee.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has imposed strict economic sanctions
against Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. To
alleviate the severe sanctions impact, the UN Security Council
adopted resolution 986 in April 1995, allowing Iraq to export oil
worth two billion dollars in six months. The UN Secretary-General
approved implementation of the oil-for-food plan in December 1996.

LONDON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
has vowed to block the reform process of the European Union (EU)
at the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) unless Britain's EU
partners agree to reform the bloc's fishing policies.
</P>
<P>
Major, whose ruling Conservative Party is lagging behind the
opposition Labor Party by some 18 percentage points, was taking a
firmer line on relations with the EU in a bid to win back more
votes in the May 1 general election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an election campaign rally in the fishing port of
Newlyn of southwest England today, Major said he was prepared to
veto the EU's long-running IGC conference when it concludes in
Amsterdam in June.
</P>
<P>
"The IGC won't come to a successful conclusion until... the
problem of quota-hopping is resolved satisfactorily and it cannot
come to a solution without unanimity," Major said.
</P>
<P>
Major warned last year that he would block the IGC, crucial to
EU's plans to expand from 15 members to more than 20 in the coming
decade, if it did not solve the quota-hopping issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan official today called
on African countries to make use of medicinal plants to produce
value added products for higher earnings.
</P>
<P>
The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Environment and
Natural Resources, William Mayaka, was opening here today a
regional workshop on medicinal plants and herbal medicine in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that at least 7,000 medicinal compounds used in
the West to manufacture medicines are derived from plants
originating from the tropical countries, particularly from
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official noted that the pharmaceutical industry in
the West based on plant compounds generate an average 320 billion
U.S. Dollars every year.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, this amount of money has not had any impact
on economies of the African countries from which many medicinal
plants originate.
</P>
<P>
He urged African countries to put more investment in research
into new uses of their medicinal plants and into the ways of
obtaining value added products.
</P>
<P>
The workshop organized by OAU Scientific, Technological and
Research Commission is scheduled to discuss policy issues
regarding access, ownership and conservation of medicinal plants
and herbal medicine in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Attending the workshop were representatives from Nigeria,
Cameroon, Madagascar, Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa, Malawi,
Ethiopia and Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Students Threaten to Seize German Embassy </HEADLINE>

<P>
TEHRAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian students warned here
today that they would seize the German Embassy unless the German
government make a formal apology to the Iranian nation and
retreat from hostility against Iran.
</P>
<P>
The move is the harshest reaction from the Iranian students
since the announcement of the ruling of the Berlin court last
Thursday which charged Iran's top political leaders with ordering
the assassination of four Kurdish opposition leaders in Berlin's
Mykonos restaurant in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that hundreds of
university students staged the anti-German demonstration in front
of the German Embassy this afternoon. The law enforcement forces
had cordoned off the embassy and Ferdowsi street where the
embassy is located.
</P>
<P>
The report said the special guards protecting the German
embassy in Tehran arrested some of the students who attempted to
break into the security line of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
Police had cordoned off the whole Ferdowsi street leading to
the embassy. The demonstration caused traffic jam in the streets
near the embassy where police prevented the protesters from
reaching the embassy compound, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The students chanting slogans urged the German government to
make formal apology to Iran for "the blunder perpetrated by a
German court against Iran."
</P>
<P>
This was the third demonstration held by Iranians within a
week in the wake of the ruling of the Berlin court regarding to
the Mykonos case.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iran launched a nationwide anti-German wave with
tens of thousands of people turning out here to protest the
Berlin court verdict.
</P>
<P>
Similar demonstrations were also held in 12 Iranian cities,
including Qom, Shiraz and Tabriz.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators urged the Iranian government to sever diplomatic
relations and economic ties between Bonn and Tehran, to
prosecute German firms which provide chemical weapons to Iraq
during the Iranian-Iraqi war between 1980 and 1988.

trade and the private sector in their economic development, a
Zimbabwean business figure said today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UN Special Envoy for Cyprus to Step Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. special envoy on Cyprus Han
Sung Joo officially announced here today that he will step down
from his post at the end of his term in office on April 30.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Han, who arrived here
Saturday on his final trip to the island as U.N. special envoy,
said that due to the growing level of intensity of efforts aimed
at bringing together the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities, it would be better to have someone who would devote
"more time, more presence and would be more involved" in the
ongoing effort.
</P>
<P>
However, Han, the former foreign minister of Republic of
Korea, declined to specify who will be his successor.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed as U.N. Secretary-General's special
representative for Cyprus to replace former Canadian prime
minister Joe Clark in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Han cited his other responsibilities and the distance between
Cyprus and Seoul as difficulties that impede his task as special
representative.
</P>
<P>
"I have told the Secretary-General that I do not wish to be
considered for an extension once my initial period of
appointment is completed at the end of April," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Coming from a divided country myself, I do not underestimate
the delicate complexities involved in trying to balance both
internal and external pressures and interests," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy called on Cypriots of both communities to
provide their leaders with the support and encouragement they
need to negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
Han said both community leaders have "love and devotion" to
their respective communities. He expressed the hope that this
will translate into a negotiated settlement that will benefit
both communities by ensuring security, equality and prosperity
for all Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Han's current visit followed a meeting between U.N. Chief Kofi
Annan and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in Geneva last
week.
</P>
<P>
Han is expected to meet Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and
Denktash as part of the ongoing U.N.-sponsored proximity talks,
aimed at getting the two veteran leaders to negotiating table
for face-to-face talks on solving the protracted Cyprus problem,
which has remained unsolved for the past 23 years.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the 37 percent of the island in the wake of a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Botswana to Depreciate National Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Botswana will depreciate
its currency Pula to offset problems likely to affect its
national economy, Southern African Broadcasting Association
(SABA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
A strong Pula would have had an adverse effect on Botswana's
economy and led to increased unemployment, SABA quoted Botswanan
Vice-President and Finance Minister Festus Mogae as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said although the decision to let Pula slip against
South African currency Rand has put Botswana-based importers at a
disadvantage, the overall result will be positive to the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Currently the exchange rate of Pula against Rand is about
0.7810 to one.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said Botswana's foreign reserves are kept in the central
banks of 18 countries, including Britain, the Netherlands, Japan,
South Africa and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Wishes Partnership Between NATO, Baltic States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today told visiting Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis that the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) could envisage a
``partnership of security'' with its candidate countries which
cannot join it in the first wave, such as the Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
The NATO Madrid summit to be held in July will decide which
countries can join it in the first wave in 1999. Hungary, Poland,
the Czech Republic and, as France wishes, probably Romania, will
be admitted in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
The French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said that
Baltic and other eastern European countries which wish to join the
NATO can reinforce their relations with NATO, the European Union,
the Western European Union and Scandinavian countries through
signing such a partnership of security.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also raised the idea of establishing a charter between
the NATO and five non-NATO Baltic states: Latvia, Lithuania,
Estonia, Finland and Sweden, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
The Latvian president, who is on a state visit here until
Wednesday, expressed his wish that the security concern of the
three former Soviet Baltic states should be taken into account and
their candidacy not be turned down by NATO.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Sets Tough Rules for State Tenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has adopted
strict measures for state tenders as part of government's bid to
generate economic benefits for the local economy, said a source
here today.
</P>
<P>
Under the National Industrial Participation Program, all local
companies tendering for state contracts with an imported content
exceeding 10 million U.S. Dollars, like their overseas
counterparts, should be required to set up a separate business.
</P>
<P>
The program, drawn up by the Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI), has been criticized by some business communities for lack
of consultation with concerned role-players, said the source.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa's main business bodies, including the
South African Chamber of Business and the Foundation for African
Business and Consumer Services, do not yet formally respond to
the program, the source added.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the program, winners of state tenders, at all
governmental and parastatal levels, must start projects which are
economically viable as part of a bid to increase jobs, exports
and investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The winners should also help encourage technology transfer,
accelerate affirmative action and the development of small
business.
</P>
<P>
Vassie Ponsamy, a DTI director in charge of the program, said
the program should be used at the imported content level and as a
benchmark.
</P>
<P>
Ponsamy admitted the government could have consulted business
more meaningfully at the National Economic, Development and
Labour Council before the formal presentation of the program.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed claims that the program would raise the cost of
state tenders, adding normal competitive bidding would instead
bring down the price significantly.

<HEADLINE> Horticultural Industry Code Launched in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Horticultural Crops
Development Authority today launched a code of conduct for the
industry to enhance its reputation on the world market.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here today said that the code is
designed to serve as a guideline for both the buyer and seller of
fresh horticultural produce in the country.
</P>
<P>
The code will also act as a framework to the development of
legally binding contract to be executed by the buyer and seller.
</P>
<P>
At the launching ceremony, the Director of Agriculture, T.K.
Tuei, called on both producers and buyers to stick to agreed
obligations for the benefit of the horticultural industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that last year fresh produce exports grew by 18
percent to 84,824 tons, earning for the country about 120 million
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The industry has been growing rapidly in the eastern African
country in the last two decades, registering constant growth
rates of between 10 to 20 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
The industry is now the fourth biggest foreign exchange earner
after tourism, tea and coffee in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Tuei noted that there was need to encourage responsible
production and marketing practices to ensure produce quality and
meet the international market demands including social and
environmental aspects.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
provide family life education to children and youth so as to make
them ready for responsible parenthood, according to No. 1
Sessional Paper of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government will strengthen existing child-youth programs
and formulate new plans to deal with reproductive health,
adolescent fertility, education and employment, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to help Kenyans under age 24 to solve problems
facing them, which are identified as sexually transmitted
diseases including HIV/AIDS, teenage pregnancies, abortion and
drug abuse.
</P>

As many as 55 percent of Kenyans are under 18 years old and
the Kenyan youth, defined between age 15 and 24, accounts for
one-fifth of the total population.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, Kenya would make the population
problem central to all national development agenda because its
population is the greatest asset in the development of natural
capital.

<HEADLINE> More Emergency Relief Supplies Donated For Flood </HEADLINE>

DAR ES SALAAM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government
has donated emergency relief supplies worth 119,000 US dollars
for flood victims in Lindi Region, eastern Tanzania, a staement
said.
</P>

The statement released by the Tanzania Information Services
here today indicated that the supplies consists of 50 tents, 864
sleeping mats, two rolls of plastic sheet, 1,200 blankets and
medicine and medical kit for 10,000 people for three months.
</P>
<P>
Last week the United Nations Department of Humanitarian
Affairs (DHA) provided an emergency grant of 20,000 US dollars to
Tanzania to meet immediate needs for Kilwa District in Lindi
Region flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Chilldren's Fund (UNICEF) also offered 12

<HEADLINE> Egypt Launches Intensive Peace Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will send a top envoy to
Washington Tuesday in a move to step up its diplomatic campaign
to restart the stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Osama el-Baz, President Hosni Mubarak's political advisor, will
head for Washington for talks with Dennis Ross, U.S. Mideast Peace
Coordinator, on U.S.-European proposals aimed at pushing forward
Arab-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Baz will present
Egypt's ideas to the United States since the Egyptian side has been
updated on the European and U.S. proposals in general.
</P>
<P>
"Baz will fully explain that Egyptian stand within the
framework of its well-known lines," Moussa told reporters
following a meeting between Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit came as the separate initiatives proposed by the
U.S. and the EU to revive Israeli-Palestinian talks had flopped.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the intensive diplomatic drive launched by Egypt to
revive the Mideast peace process, Moussa pointed to "three focal
points."
</P>
<P>
He mentioned Jerusalem and the construction of settlements in
the occupied Arab lands, implementation of Oslo agreements, with
particular focus on redeployment, and resumption of peace talks,
which he called "the core of the matter."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian diplomatic move followed the attempts by U.S. and
EU to discourage Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu from a
controversial Jewish housing project in East Jerusalem, a condition
the Palestinians insist for resuming the talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu rejects any link between Palestinian attempts to halt
violence and Israeli settlement policies and vows to press ahead
with the construction of the Har Homa neighborhood, a move that
has stranded the peace talks and sparked daily clashes in West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Arafat's visit to Cairo, Mubarak said
U.S. President Bill Clinton had asked him to send a top envoy to
meet with U.S. officials on means of breaking the peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the Palestinians are ready for negotiations,
provided that the negotiating process be balanced.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the U.S. peace initiative demands a halt of the Har
Homa settlement, Moussa said: "I am not in a position to speak
about the initiative but I hope that any initiative would include
this (settlement freeze)."
</P>
<P>
Moussa emphasized no peace initiative may proceed without
touching on the question of Jerusalem and Jewish settlements,
maintaining that peace talks should resume on the basis of the
land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed reports to the effect that arrangements are
under way for an Arab summit following the greater Bairam,
an annual holy occasion for Muslims.
</P>
<P>
He said the statement of last year's Cairo Arab summit, the
first plenary top-level Arab meeting in six years, are in effect.
</P>
<P>
However, Moussa said it is possible to conduct swift
consultations and adopt suitable decisions among the Arab
countries in the current Mideast peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Arafat would fly to Valletta, Malta to attend the
Euro-Mediterranean conference where he will meet with Ross and
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> S. Arabia Extends No Invitation to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has not yet
extended an invitation to Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani for a state visit, a senior Saudi diplomat said
here tonight in contradiction with a previous statement by the
Iranian side.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Ambassador to Iran Abdullatif Abdullah Al-Maimanee told
Xinhua that President Rafsanjani will not pay a visit to Saudi
Arabia during the hajj pilgrimage. He also said that the Iranian
president will "definitely" not go to Saudi Arabia in April.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, President Rafsanjani does not need an
invitation if he goes to Saudi Arabia during the hajj pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
"All Muslims can go to Mecca. That is the invitation extended
by God. It is the same to Rafsanjani," he added.
</P>
<P>
What the senior Saudi diplomat said contradicts a statement made
by Iranian Ambassador to Riyadh Nouri Shahroodi, who claimed early
this month that Iranian President Rafsanjani would go to Saudi
Arabia during hajj pilgrimage in April.
</P>
<P>
Some Iranian official sources said that Rafsanjani would
go to Saudi Arabia after the 7th presidential elections --
maybe in June.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi ambassador said: "That is what they are
talking about. As for me, I have heard no information of the
visit by President Rafsanjani to Saudi Arabia either from my
country or from the Iranian government."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian media made a large publicity campaign about the
visit by President Rafsanjani to Saudi Arabia, claiming that a
chapter is forthcoming to enhance the relations between the two
giants in the Persian Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said in
a press conference on April 9 that the timetable had not yet been
set for the visit by Rafsanjani to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
But, he noted that Rafsanjani was invited to make an official
visit to Saudi Arabia during his meeting with Saudi Prince
Abdullah on the sideline of a conference of the Organization of
Islamic Countries (OIC) in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Some Iranian sources said that Rafsanjani could not go to
Saudi Arabia because he is now fully occupied with domestic
affairs, especially the State Expediency Council which is
headed by Rafsanjani himself.
</P>
<P>
But, some observers here noted that the reason for Saudi
King Fahd not to extend the official invitation to Rafsanjani is
due pressure from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi king would not like to take the risk of offending
U.S. President Bill Clinton by inviting the enemy of the United
States, which still accuses Iran of involvement in an explosion of
the U.S. military complex in Saudi Arabia last year.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab diplomats said that the Saudi king made a cold
response even to an invitation extended by Iranian President
Rafsanjani to attend an OIC summit scheduled in Tehran in
December.
</P>
<P>
The king only welcomed the invitation, but he did not
promise his visit to Tehran at that time.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that Iran is trying its best to improve
relations with Persian Gulf countries, especially Saudi Arabia, in
a bid to confront the military threat by the United States
and the international isolation.
</P>
<P>
But it would be very difficult for the Arab countries in the
Gulf to make a big stride in improving their relations with Iran
since they are still distrusting Tehran and accusing it of
interfering with the internal affairs of the Gulf countries and
exporting Islamic revolution.

<HEADLINE> OAU Urges Warring Parties in Zaire to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim today urged
Zaire's warring parties to end fighting and engage in
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, he said OAU wishes Zaire crisis be
resolved as soon as possible, adding that OAU will offer support
to any efforts concerned.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that the second round of talks on Zaire
to be held in South Africa this week would bear fruits in
restoring peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
The first round of talks on Zaire's peace was held in South
Africa last week.
</P>
<P>
However, Salim stressed that the decision on whom to lead the
central African country would be made by the people of Zaire and
not anybody else.
</P>
<P>
"Let the people decide who they want through elections and let
us respect their choice," he said, adding that there should be a
ceasefire first so as to allow peaceful and democratic
transition.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, Zaire's rebels led by
Laurent Kabila gave Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko the
deadline of last Sunday to signal his intention of stepping down.
</P>
<P>
Salim said he personally followed President Mobutu in France
last December and advised him to go back home and negotiate with
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said he also sent an OAU representative to deliver the same
suggestion to Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"What we want is united democratic Zaire, because if we have a
stable Zaire, South Africa, Southern Africa, West Africa and East
Africa, it will change the outlook of Africa which it is
perceived on other continents as a place where people kill each
other," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim stressed that African problems and crisis will not be
solved by anyone other than the Africans themselves.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the OAU chief appealed to Tanzanians to cultivate
the culture of cooperation and tolerance, saying negotiations are
the best solution to disputes.
</P>
<P>
On the boycott of the House of Representatives sessions by
lawmakers from the opposition party in Zanzibar, he called on the
ruling party and the opposition Civic United Front (CUF) to
discuss the differences instead of boycotting.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the parties to ban their lawmakers from
boycotting the sessions, saying by this way they were doing
injustice to the people who elected them their representatives in
the house.
</P>
<P>
Salim further expressed optimism that the Liberia crisis would
be resolved in the near future and the general elections would be
held next month.
</P>
<P>
Salim said there are also hopes of resolving the conflicts in
Sierra Leone and that efforts were still being made by OAU to
create peace in the horn of Africa, Somalia in particular.

PARIS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A 48-year-old father was given 18
months in jail and three years under police guidance by a Paris
court today for domestic hooliganism on his 28-year-old daughter,
reported the Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Jacques Girard, a self-styled writer and scenerist, tried twice

match on television in their home in Trappes outside Paris on
March 4.
</P>

The girl managed to get away from his paws and called police,

<HEADLINE> Dozens of Students Arrested in Front of German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Iranian students were
arrested by anti-riot policemen as they tried to break through a
protective line in a bid to seize the German flag at the top of
German Embassy here today.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses told Xinhua that there were clashes between some
400 university students and 1,000 policemen who beat and kicked
the demonstrators away from the compound of the German Embassy.
</P>
<P>
However, a well-informed source said that most of the
students who were arrested by the police have been released
under the pressure of other students.
</P>
<P>
The students staged a 90-minute demonstration in front of the
German Embassy while trying to enter the compound to express what
they called Iran's fury over its leadership being implicated by
the Berlin court in an alleged political assassination.
</P>
<P>
Chanting "Death to Germany" and "Death to the Zionist judge,"
the students warned that they would seize the German Embassy
unless the German government make a formal apology to the Iranian
nation and retreat from hostility against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Some of them tried to negotiate with the police about the
entry into the German Embassy compound and some tried to break
through the six human protective chains formed by the policemen,
shouting "We will occupy the embassy and pay back the insult
against our sanctities and leaders."
</P>
<P>
Eventually the students began dispersing while the police
maintained their huge presence in the downtown area in a bid to
prevent further attempt to break into the German Embassy by the
students, a likely prospect reminiscent of what happened to the
U.S. embassy 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was organized by the University Islamic
Society.
</P>
<P>
The move is the harshest reaction from the Iranian students
in the past four days since the ruling of the Berlin court
which charged Iran's top political leaders with ordering the
assassination of four Kurdish opposition leaders in a restaurant
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that police had
cordoned off the whole Ferdowsi street leading to the embassy. The
demonstration caused traffic jam in the streets nearby the
embassy where the police prevented the protesters from reaching
the embassy.
</P>
<P>
This was the third demonstration held by Iranians within a
week in the wake of the ruling of the Berlin court
regarding the Mykonos case verdict.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iran launched a nationwide anti-German wave with
tens of thousands of people turning out to streets to protest
against the Berlin court verdict.
</P>
<P>
Similar demonstrations were also held in 12 Iranian cities,
including Qom, Shiraz and Tabriz.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators urged the Iranian government to sever diplomatic
relations and economic ties with Bonn and to prosecute German
firms which provide chemical weapons to Iraq during the war with
Iran between 1980 and 1988.

<HEADLINE> GM's Profits Increase 76 Percent in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Detroit-based General Motors
Corp. announced today its first-quarter earnings increased 76
percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The world's largest automaker said it earned nearly 1.8 billion
U.S. dollars, or 2.30 dollars a share, as compared with the 1.02
billion dollars, or 94 cents a share, in the corresponding period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Revenues totaled 42.26 billion dollars, marking an 8 percent
growth from 39.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
GM's North American Operations automotive unit earned 764
million dollars, as against a 279 million dollars loss in the
first three months of 1996. The profit in the quarter is the
highest level in the operation for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
The growth came even though GM's sales of cars and light trucks
in the first quarter were down 1 percent. GM said its U.S. market
share fell to 30.2 percent from 31.2 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The auto-maker's earnings increase was largely attributed to
the introduction of some 15 new models that are less costly to
produce and reductions in the costs of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
GM's financial arm, General Motors Acceptance Corp., earned 372
million dollars in the recent period, up 20 percent from 309
million dollars a year ago.

<P>
YAOUNDE, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Cameroun and Malaysia are palm
oil producing countries and should seize the opportunity to share
their experiences, said Ndioro Justin, the Camerounian minister
of trade and industry in Yaounde this morning while meeting with
the visiting Malaysian business delegation.
</P>
<P>
Headed by Lim Keng Kaik, the Malaysian minister of primary
industry, the 42-men Malaysian business delegation is in Cameroun
to contact with Camerounian business partners on investment
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
Lim Kaik said the purpose of the dialogue is to provide a
forum to discuss the investment opportunity in the timber and
palm oil industries and also to share Malaysia's experiences in
developing the timber and palm oil industries, he added that
Malaysian scientists and experts are willing to help Camerounians
acquire technique know-how and proper planatation management in
oil palm development.
</P>
<P>
According to Lim Kaik, agriculture sector, in particular the
primary commodity sector, plays an important role in the
development of the country. The basis of Malaysia's strong timber
industry lies in the sound management of the forestry resources.
Exports receipts from timber and timber products amounted for 5.5
billion U.S. dollars in 1996. As for oil palm, Malaysia has
established itself as the largest producer and exporter of palm
oil accounting for 53 percent and 63 percent of the world total
production in 1996.
</P>
<P>
While in Cameroun, the agriculture and forestry sector is an
important component of the country's economy, providing
employment for majority of the population.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen from the two countries are now exploring the
possibility of setting up joint-ventures in timber and palm oil
industries.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia initiated its economic practises in the central
African countries since last year. Some Malaysia companies
invested in the countries like Cameroun, Equatorial Guinea. They
mainly work on forest exploration.

<P>
BONN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
today assured that Germany is and will continue to be a reliable
advocate of Poland being one of the first candidates to join the
European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a German-Polish forum in Bonn, Kinkel also stressed
that the guideline for the integration of Poland as well as the
Czech Republic, Hungary and other eastern European countries is a
swift adjustment of their political and economic general
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Some countries would make the grade soon while others would
still need some time, Kinkel said, adding that for the latter the
EU should make sure that they will be able to catch up quickly.
</P>
<P>
The German foreign minister also stressed that the opening of
the EU and the NATO should not be allowed to lead to new rifts in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Given Russia's weight and importance, it must be treated
equally during the integration process, Kinkel said, adding that
the security and stability in Europe are unimaginable without
Russia.
</P>
<P>
But he called on Moscow to speak out against the Cold-War-style
"demonization" of NATO during public debates, saying that this
also belongs to confidence-building.

<HEADLINE> Victims' Rights Amendment Re-introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Advocates for crime victims
are making another effort to gain public support to amend the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Supporters say the Constitution gives the accused more than a
dozen rights but none for crime victims. They contend that makes
victims "second-class citizens" who can be ignored or barred from
trials.
</P>
<P>
Senators Dianne Feinstein and Jon Kyl are co-sponsoring the
proposed amendment for the second year. A similar amendment
introduced last year had President Bill Clinton's backing, but
neither house of Congress acted on it.
</P>
<P>
If the legislation was adopted, crime victims would be told of
court proceedings and allowed to attend, permitted to make
statements about a release, plea agreement or sentence, and
notified when an offender escapes or is released from custody.
</P>
<P>
It also would extend restitution rights and would require that
victims' safety be considered before an assailant is released.
</P>
<P>
"The victim should have these basic rights," Ms. Feinstein said
at the announcement Monday, which marked National Crime Victims'
Rights Week. "The only way to provide them with certainty... is to
amend the Constitution."
</P>
<P>
Also attending the event were John Walsh, Marc Klass and Fred
Goldman, parents of murdered children whose cases were highly
publicized.
</P>
<P>
Amending the Constitution requires the approval of two-thirds
of the House and Senate and 38 state legislatures. The Senate
Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on the measure for
Wednesday.

UNITED NATIONS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- No indication of
prohibited equipment, materials or activities was detected in Iraq
in the past six months by the nuclear monitoring experts, said the
lastest report of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA reported that from last October 2 to March 31, its
Baghdad-based Nuclear Monitoring Group conducted more than 200
monitoring inspections at some 91 sites, 28 of which were carried
out at sites that had not been previously inspected. This brought
the total number of inspections to over 850 since establishment of
the NMG in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
The majority of these inspections were carried out with no
prior announcement and a number of them were conducted in
cooperation with monitoring groups like the UN Special Commission
(UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
The IAEA had not detected in Iraq activities, equipment or
materials proscribed by Security Council resolutions, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Though the IAEA affirmed Iraq's cooperation in several fields,
it urged Iraq to respect the IAEA's and the UNSCOM's unrestricted
rights to use fixed and rotary wing aircraft for overflights
throughout Iraq for all relevant purposes.

</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 60.21 points to
6,451.90. It was bolstered by some strong first-quarter profit
reports. The Dow, which traded at a modest loss for much of the

what had been a 10 percent gain for the year.
</P>
<P>
The Dow struggled much of the day despite better-than-expected

Motors.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where its volume totaled 406.78
million shares down from 440.48 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Most major measures also turned positive in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 6.08 to 743.73, and
the NYSE's composite index rose 2.02 to 391.49.

The Nasdaq composite index rose 9.51 to 1,216.41, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.16 to 52.97.

There were no major economic reports today to calm or aggravate

</P>

Fed officials have warned that the central bank will raise
interest rates aggressively to slow the pace of borrowing and

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright announced today that she will send U.S. mediator Dennis
Ross to the Middle East this week in an attempt to revive the
stalled peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after Albright held a telephone talk
over the weekend with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, which was
described by State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns as "a good
round of discussions."
</P>
<P>
Ross' mission, Albright said, was aimed to get Israel and the
Palestinians to drop their conditions and resume negotiations,
which have stalled for several weeks as a result of Israel's
decision to build Jewish homes in traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ross will consult separately with Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on "how to stem the violence and on
what steps they are prepared to take to stop the deterioration and
lay the basis for making the peace process work again," Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state said she did not know whether the two
sides were prepared to take that step. But a decision will be made
on what to do next when Ross returns back from his Mideast trip
with assessment of the situation there.

agreement is good news for Hong Kong's textile industry, as it
provides for the smooth continuation of bilateral trade relations
between the two countries, says Hong Kong Trade Development
Council's latest Trade Watch report.
</P>
<P>
The four-year agreement, which was signed between China and the
U.S. on February 2 this year after months of negotiations,
replaced the 1992 accord which expired on December 31 last year.
</P>
<P>
It contains four major changes in the previous one. There were
changes in China's quotas for 50 categories or subcategories.
Provisions were made for adjusting China's quotas after it becomes
a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The report points out that the changes in China's quotas will
have an effect on Hong Kong since many Hong Kong companies operate
production facilities in southern China.
</P>
<P>
For highly utilized categories where the quotas were increased,
Hong Kong can anticipate improved re-export levels in 1997. For
categories where the quotas were reduced, by and large there will
be little impact on trade flows as few were highly utilized, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Beyond the quota changes, the new agreement will provide new
trade opportunities as well as challenges for Hong Kong's
companies, the report says.

<HEADLINE> Albania Welcomes Arrival of Multinational Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government today
hailed the arrival of the Italian-led multinational force which is
to protect humanitarian relief operations and help stabilize the
Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Albania's Prime Minister Bashkim Fino welcomed the arrival,
saying the force will help restore peace and order to the country
which has been gripped by violence and unrest over the last two
months.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Albania extends its best thanks in the
name of the Albanian people for the readiness they have
demonstrated in helping us at this delicate time," Fino said.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,200 Italian, French and Spanish soldiers landed in
Albania today and fanned out across the country to take control of
harbors, airports and other main communication facilities after
weeks of violence.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government promised to carry out constructive and
close cooperation with the multinational force approved by the
United Nations late last month.
</P>
<P>
The Italian-led eight-nation force on the mission called
"Operation Alba" will have the right to defend themselves,
although they are not authorized to disarm Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Albania is awash with guns since people looted weapons
following unrest caused by the collapse of fraudulent savings
schemes in January.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 people have been killed in the past months of
near-anarchy and much of southern Albania is still under the
control of armed protesters who insist that President Sali
Berisha resign over the collapse of the savings schemes in which
thousands of Albanian families lost their savings.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong and the United States
signed two agreements here today, one on mutual legal assistance
in criminal matters and the other on the transfer of sentenced
persons.
</P>
<P>
The Agreement on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons (TSP
Agreement) is the first agreement which Hong Kong has signed on
international cooperation in the enforcement of penal sentences.
</P>
<P>
The Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters
(MLA) Agreement) is the second agreement which Hong Kong has
signed on international cooperation against crime. The first was
signed with Australia in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
The main aspects of the assistance stipulated by the MLA
agreement include taking evidence, searching for and seizing items
which are relevant to criminal matters, producing documentary
evidence relevant to the criminal matters, transferring persons
(including prisoners) between the Hong Kong and the US
jurisdiction, confiscating the proceeds of crime and serving
documents.
</P>
<P>
The TSP Agreement contains essential safeguards which are
normally found in agreements governing the transfer of sentenced
persons. They include: the conduct in respect of which the
sentenced person is imprisoned must be criminal in both
jurisdictions and any adjustment to the sentence by the sending
jurisdiction must be executed by the receiving jurisdiction.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Import Yellow Corn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will import
350,000 tons of yellow corn with 35 percent preferential tariff to
ease a corn shortage in the country, a senior food official said
today.
</P>
<P>
Joemari Gerochi, head of the National Food Authority (NFA),
said the country's food producers had earlier asked the authority
to approve the importation of 400,000 tons of yellow corn to meet
an estimated corn shortage of 800,000 tons this year.
</P>
<P>
But he said the NFA limited the requested imports to 350,000
tons to prevent competition with local production.
</P>
<P>
The planned imports will come from the United States and
Argentina, according to Gerochi.
</P>
<P>
But the corn import volume has yet to be endorsed by the
cabinet, the president and finally the congress.
</P>
<P>
The NFA will hold talks with the United States and Argentine
this month to ensure that the imports will all come in by June,
one month before corn harvest starts in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to Gerochi, half of the 350,000 tons of corn imports
will be allocated to hog and poultry farmers while the other half
will be bid out to allow those with small allocations to have
additional supply to meet their corn requirements.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Population Grows 5.7 Percent in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada had a population of
28,846,761 on May 14, 1996, when the latest census was conducted,
Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
International migration and natural increase added more than
1.5 million or 5.7 percent to Canada's population over the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
Canada's population has doubled in 45 years from just over 14
million in 1951, the federal agency said in the release of the
first data from the 1996 census. Other data will be released over
the next 14 months.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Canada's rate of population growth slowed between 1991
and 1996, compared to the previous five-year period, which saw a
growth rate of 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Yet, compared to the rest of the industrialized world, Canada
is still a front-runner. Its population grew at an annual average
rate of 1.1 percent, the highest of all G-7 industrialized
nations.
</P>
<P>
Average annual increases for the rest of G-7 countries varied
from 0.1 percent for Italy to 1.0 percent for the United States.
</P>
<P>
The overall number of people on the planet rose at an annual
growth rate of 1.5 percent between 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Canada accounts for about 0.5 percent of the global
population.
</P>
<P>
The census also showed that every province and territory,
except Newfoundland, recorded an increase in population over the
past five years. British Columbia recorded by far the highest
growth rate of 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The agency noted that the 1996 census confirmed a trend seen
for a number of years showing the distribution of Canada's
population shifting from east to west.
</P>
<P>
In 1951, 15 percent of Canada's population lived in Alberta and
British Columbia. By 1996, that had increased to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Ontario's share of the population has increased from
33 percent in 1951 to 37 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Over this 45-year period, the Atlantic Provinces' proportion
has fallen from 12 percent to the current eight percent, while the
population in Quebec has declined from 29 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Manitoba's share of the population declined
from six percent in 1951 to four percent in 1996. Saskatchewan's
dropped from six percent to three percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today called on Russians to buy Russian-made products in order to
help ailing national industries.
</P>
<P>
In a radio address Yeltsin stated that his appeal is
buttressed by higher quality of goods produced in the country as
a result of honest competition.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin said the support for Russian products would not
pose a threat to foreign imports. "There should be no concern that
I am going to ban foreign products on the Russian
market. Absolutely not. Honest competition must reign in Russia,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said "I want our people to give preference to
Russian-made products, wear costumes and shoes made in Russian
factories and buy Russian-made refrigerators and furniture".
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin meanwhile said that it was not mean there to be a tough
protectionism to ban foreign goods from the Russian market, but
"Russian-made goods should excel in quality."
</P>
<P>
In the radio address, Yeltsin also ordered officials to buy
Russian-made cars.
</P>
<P>
Citing an example in Russian defense products which many
foreign countries are willing to buy, Yeltsin said that far
from all goods made overseas were quite good and drew attention
to insufficient advertising of national products.

BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Chairman of China's Central
Military Commission Liu Huaqing said here today the establishment
and advancement of the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative
partnership catering to the needs of the 21st century is not only
in the fundamental interests of the Chinese and Russian peoples,
but conducive to the regional and global peace, stability, and
development.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the visiting Russian Minister of National
Defense Igor Nikolayevich Rodionov, Liu said China and Russia, and
their armed forces enjoy a good relationship, and the growth of
this relationship has a solid foundation.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, described
Rodionov's trip to China as an important one.
</P>
<P>
He briefed the Russian visitors on China's economic situation

</P>
<P>
The "China threat theory" spread by a small number of people

<HEADLINE> Agreement Reached on First Batch of PLA Advance Personnel in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The two sides of the
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) have reached agreement on
the first batch of advance personnel of the future People's
Liberation Army (PLA) garrison in Hong Kong, the Chinese side on
JLG announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side today received a sticking note from the
British side, which said that the British side had accepted the
Chinese side's proposals on the first batch of PLA advance troops.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese representative on the JLG, Chen Zuo'er, said the
Chinese side welcomes this, adding that the agreement was hard-won
as the two sides had held prolonged discussions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that with only 77 days left before the handover, the
two sides should make persistent and concerted efforts to reach
consensus as soon as possible on the following batches of the
advance personnel in the interest of the smooth transfer of
defense responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
According to Hong Kong Government Information Services (GIS),
40 advance personnel of the PLA garrison will arrive in Hong Kong
in late April.
</P>
<P>
"The group will be led by a Deputy Commander of the future
Chinese garrison who is an officer of the rank of Major General,"
said a Hong Kong government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"A liaison group of 28 personnel, led by the deputy commander,
will be co-located with the British Forces at the Prince of Wales
Barracks. The other 12 will be co-located with the British
garrison at Stonecutters Island Barracks," he said.
</P>
<P>
The duties of advance personnel are to make practical
preparations for the PLA to take over the responsibility for the
defense of Hong Kong, including familiarization with the military
sites, liaison with the British Forces and the Hong Kong
government, and co-ordination of communications support.

<HEADLINE> HK Newspapers Welcome China's Policy on HK Residents' Nationality, Right of Abode </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Nearly all the local newspapers
published commentaries here today, highly appraising China's
policy on Hong Kong residents' nationality and right of abode.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of
China's State Council on Sunday in Beijing gave a detailed account
of the policies regarding Hong Kong residents' nationality and
right of abode issues.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers praised these policies as clear, generous and
practicable, saying they took into full consideration Hong Kong
people's interests and will no doubt alleviate the worries of
those living in the territory and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the newspapers pointed out that the nationality and
right of abode issues are internal affairs of China, and related
legislative work should be up to the Provisional Legislative
Council (PLC), the legislative arm of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
The commentary carried by Wen Wei Po said the policies show
flexibility when implementing China's Nationality Law in Hong
Kong, and provide a chance for emigrants to participate in the
cause of bettering Hong Kong after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial Daily noted in an editorial that the
Chinese government has solicited advice and opinions from Hong
Kong people in laying out the policies.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Economic Times said the policies will not only help
maintain Hong Kong people's confidence but also avoid the swarming
home of emigrants on the eve of the handover. They are "good news"
to Hong Kong, it said.
</P>
<P>
Under the policies, Hong Kong emigrants, now living in Canada
and some other countries, can retain their permanent resident
status without giving up foreign nationality if they return to the
territory by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The English-language South China Morning Post and Hong Kong
Standard also gave wide coverage to the policies and reactions
they generated among Hong Kong people.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Impose Valued Added Tax Late This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
decided to postpone the implementation of the Value Added Tax
(VAT) system till late this year.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry's VAT Department announced today that the
government will begin to collect the VAT from November 16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The decision came out after the local business community voiced
strong opposition to the government's earlier announcement to
impose the VAT from the coming fiscal year starting in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen claimed that the country's economy, tax authorities
and business circles lack adequate preparations for the new tax
regime.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government, in a bid to prevent tax evasion and
increase national revenue, began to prepare for the VAT over two
years ago and it earlier decided to impose the new tax from the
1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The new tax system is expected to help the government double
its annual tax revenue to about 200 million U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Ten stolen vehicles and one
container were returned today to Hong Kong police by their
counterparts in neighboring Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Returned at Huanggang Border Crossing Point in Shenzhen were
seven saloons, two crane lorries, one heavy goods vehicle and one
40-feet-long container, with a total value of 4.94 million HK
dollars (633,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The vehicles had been reported stolen at various locations in
Hong Kong between February 1992 and August 1996.
</P>
<P>
The return is the 16th of its kind since the Guangdong Public
Security Bureau started to hand over recovered vehicles to Hong
Kong police in 1991, bringing the total number of returned private
cars and lorries to 98 and four respectively.
</P>
<P>
This is also the first time a stolen container was returned to
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hong Kong police said today's handing back of
stolen cars symbolized the continual commitment and cooperation
between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland in combating
cross-border crimes, especially in tackling the problem of
smuggling stolen vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a steady decrease over the past years with a
total of 2,561 cases of missing vehicles recorded last year, a
63-percent drop over 1992," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Hails Sino-Mauritian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
spoke highly of Sino-Mauritian relations during a meeting with
visiting Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam here today,
hailing Ramgoolam's China tour as of "great significance" to
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Since the two countries established diplomatic relations, Jiang
said, they have carried out fruitful co-operation in various
fields, steadily increased their economic and trade links, and
closely co-operated with and supported each other in international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Some 25 years ago, Ramgoolam's father, then prime minister of
Mauritius, and the first generation of Chinese leadership, forged
diplomatic ties between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that this laid a solid foundation for the development
of friendship between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, he said, China and Mauritius have
increased the exchange of visits between their leaders, enhancing
bilateral friendly relations. While Mauritius has scored
tremendous economic achievements, China has achieved rapid
development in the reform, opening up and the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
China will resume the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong
Kong in more than two months, the president said, expressing the
belief all these favorable conditions will further stimulate
the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Ramgoolam said he is delighted to visit China in celebration of
the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ramgoolam said that his father, as the first prime minister of
Mauritius after its independence, realized China's important
status in the international arena, and decided to forge diplomatic
ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Mauritius has always been pursuing the "one China"
policy, which, he pledged, will never change in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister expressed his gratitude to China for its
assistance to Mauritius, which has played a significant role in
the economic development of Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
During his current visit, he said, the two countries signed an
agreement on the maintenance of a Mauritian honorary consulate
general in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Hong Kong's return to China will
benefit economic co-operation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang said that China holds that world stability and
development are inseparable from a favorable international and
regional environment.
</P>
<P>
Mauritius has always pursued a foreign policy of neutrality,
peace and non-alliance, actively promoted peace and progress in
Africa, and exerted unremitting efforts to establish a peaceful
region of the Indian Ocean, Jiang said, adding that this
constitutes an important factor for the success of Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
Mauritius, enjoying geographic advantages, wishes to serve as a
bridge between east Asia and Africa, Ramgoolam said, and as the
first presidential country of the Indian Ocean Association for
Regional Co-operation, Mauritius is devoted to the the development
of economic co-operation in the region, and expects China's
participation.

<HEADLINE> Cooperation Promising Between Insurers from Taiwan, Hong Kong and inland areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from the
insurance industries of China's inland areas, Hong Kong, and
Taiwan say they plan to do more to cultivate cooperation between
the three places, in order to unite the insurance markets for all
Chinese in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The 200 representatives are attending an ongoing insurance
seminar co-sponsored by the Insurance Institute of China and the
Hong Kong Federation of Insurers (HKFI).
</P>
<P>
Wu-Tsung Chen, executive vice president of Cathay Life
Insurance Co., Ltd headquartered in Taipei, said at the seminar
that a strategic alliance is necessary among insurers of the
Taiwan Straits and Hong Kong, and that it will be the first step
toward combining the insurance markets of all Chinese in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, Asia's insurance market has risen to become the top
in the world, an achievement due in part to the combined insurance
market shares of Chinese in these three places, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yongwei, president of the People's Insurance Company of
China(PICC), the country's biggest insurer, said at the seminar's
opening ceremony that the mainland still has great untapped
potential for insurers.
</P>
<P>
"There is bright future to enhance cooperation among the
insurers of Hong Kong, and the two sides of the Straits," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
China, with a 1.2 billion population and a vast insurance
market, generated 75.6 billion yuan in premium income from the
insurance sector last year. The figure will reach 250 billion yuan
by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the mainland insurance market will see double
digit growth rate in the coming years. Recent sample tests show
that nearly half of the urban residents have said they are
considering purchasing life insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
Steven Lau, chairman of HKFI, said that Hong Kong will still
function as a source of advanced knowledge for insurance companies
in the motherland after the handover of Hong Kong on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong now has 221 registered insurance companies, which
generated a total premium income of 18.4 billion Hong Kong dollars
last year.
</P>
<P>
The tough competition between Hong Kong insurers will continue,
and Hong Kong will maintain a stable growth of premium income this
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the possible cooperation among insurers from
the two sides of the Straits and Hong Kong will not only be based
on their shared cultural background, but also Hong Kong's and
Taiwan's similar experiences in rapidly developing the insurance
industry.
</P>
<P>
"What is happening in China's inland areas has happened to both
Hong Kong and Taiwan before, which could serve as a 'mirror' for
the opening-up of the insurance industry of the mainland," a Hong
Kong businessmen said.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between the three places in near future will be
based on information-sharing, and Hong Kong will help train the
employees of mainland insurance companies who need it most, said
Dennis J. Pedini, managing director of East Asia Aetna Insurance
Group.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Early Reach of Medicines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Health Minister Omid
Medhat Mubarak today called for early reach of medicines in Iraq
under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The minister made this call in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua before attending a scientific lecture here.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Health Minister accused the U.S. of obstructing the
arrival of medicines in Iraq and the approval of contracts for the
purchase of medicines concluded by Iraq with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the UN Sanctions Committee has so far
approved 40 contracts for the purchase of medicines, but the first
batch of these medicines would not arrive in Iraq before the end
of this month or early next month.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Health Minister added that Iraq has submitted to the
UN Sanctions Committee more than 500 contracts for the purchase of
medicines which are badly needed by Iraqi hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food agreement reached between the UN and
Iraq, Iraq has been allowed to export 20 billion dollars of oil in
six months. 30 percent of which will be funneled to the fund for
gulf war reparations and meeting other UN costs. Then Iraq would
have access to about 1.3 billion dollars to purchase food,
medicine and other daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Food started reaching Iraq on March 20. According to a UN
official, Iraq has since then received 200,000 tonnes of food
articles.
</P>
<P>
So far the UN Sanction Committee has approved 13 out of 90
contracts concluded by Iraq for the purchase of food
articles.

<HEADLINE> China to Strictly Implement State's Environment Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China today asked governments at
all levels to strictly implement the State's decision on
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Environmental Protection (SBEP) and the
Ministry of Supervision at a news briefing here today that they
will examine the governments' implementation of the decision
issued last year by the State Council on environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, the SBEP's director said that the decision is a
programmatic document of the country's environmental protection
work and the basic guarantee for the country to fulfill its
environment blueprint by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Since the issue of the decision, the country has scored
remarkable progress in environmental protection, Xie said,
however, some government officials are still not determined,
especially when the regional interests are infringed upon.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that the State Council has asked the SBEP to check the
regional governments' efforts at fighting pollution with the help
of the supervision departments.
</P>
<P>
The inspection this time is to give a push to the pollution
control throughout the country, Xie noted, adding that the
officials who act against the decision are "sure to receive severe
punishment."
</P>
<P>

MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) have agreed to hold their
third round of low-level talks on April 23-24 in Cotabato city,
the southern province of Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed today by Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice-chairman
for political affairs, according to the Philippine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming technical committee meeting will discuss
matters regarding the implementation of a local cease-fire
agreement and the positioning of combatants in Buldon,
Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar said the much-awaited result of the investigations on
the controversial March 16 bombing incident which killed 10
students and one teacher in a Buldon school, might also be tackled
in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Cease-fire Monitoring Committee, an independent
group tasked by the government and MILF to investigate the Buldon
tragedy, is expected to come up with their findings this week.
</P>
<P>
The government and MILF technical committee talks had
originally been scheduled for April 9.
</P>
<P>
But the MILF boycotted the talks, saying it would not resume
the talks unless the cease-fire monitoring committee determined
which side was responsible for the March 16 bomb attack.

ROME, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Patrick Head, Williams team

appeared in the first time Tuesday at Ayrton Senna death trial,
reports said from Imola, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Head and Newey, present to hear other testimony and not to give

Neither made any comment to reporters covering the trial, which

Head, Newey and team chief Frank Williams deny prosecution
allegations that a faulty weld on the steering column of Senna's
car contributed to the death of the three times world champion.
</P>
<P>
The three other accused, Belgian international race director
Roland Bruynseraede and Imola officials Federico Bendinelli and
Giorgio Poggi are also charged with manslaughter as a result of
alleged track deficiencies. They, too, deny the charges.

GUANGZHOU, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Police in South China's
Guangdong Province have ferreted out 361 people selling or using
head-rocking pills, a new kind of drug, in Guangzhou and

Having been popular among western drug abusers for years, the
pills were first found in China in October last year in dancing

Recently, police in Guangzhou and Shenzhen ferreted out 361
people selling or using the drugs and confiscated nearly 1,000

<HEADLINE> Hamas Calls for Escalation of anti-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The militant Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) today called on Palestinians to
intensify their violent struggle against Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In a leaflet received by Xinhua, Hamas denounced Israel for
having imposed a total military closure on the Palestinian
village Kafr Ysurif near Hebron since the March 21 suicide
bombing in Tel Aviv, in which four people including the Hamas
suicide bomber Moussa Ranimat were killed.
</P>
<P>
Ranimat was living in Kafr Ysurif. His home has been recently
destroyed by Israel as a form of punishment, leaving his wife and
four children homeless.
</P>
<P>
The militant group charged the closure had caused the death of
four Palestinian patients at Israeli checkpoints after they were
refused entry to receive medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
"What is happening in Ysurif reflects the Israeli policy of
collective punishment against our unarmed citizens," the leaflet
said.
</P>
<P>
"We declare our solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and
sisters in Ysurif who are confronting the Zionist terror. We
call upon all Palestinians to escalate their blessed Intifada
(Arab uprising) all over Palestinian lands," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Hamas also slammed the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
for helping Israeli security services to crack down its
activists.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel decided in March to build the Har Homa Jewish
settlement in controversial East Jerusalem, Palestinian
protesters across the Palestinian territories have been clashing
with Israeli soldiers by throwing stones and petrol bombs. So far
three Palestinians have been killed and hundreds of others
wounded in the current wave of violence.
</P>
<P>
Following the March Tel Aviv bombing, Israel has imposed a
total closure on the Palestinian territories, barring tens of
thousands of Palestinian workers from entering Israel to
work. The closure was only eased in the past days after the
situation became relatively calm.
</P>
<P>
But a new flare-up of violence can be triggered because of
the deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel has conditioned the resumption of peace talks with the
Palestinian side on the PNA's commitment to launching a long-term
crackdown on Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups.

ROME, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian Defense Minister Beniamino
Andreatta today gave a formal send-off in Bridisi to Italian
troops bound for Albania to protect the humanitarian relief
operation and help stabilize the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Andreatta, accompanied by Chief of Staff Admiral Guido

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebels Surrender in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A total of 33 Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) fighters surrendered to the Philippine
government forces last week, the Presidential Press Office said
today.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the office said a group of 15 MILF members
gave themselves up to the 11th Infantry Battalion in Sultan town
in the southern province of Maguindanao on April 7.
</P>
<P>
Another group of 18 MILF guerrillas surrendered two days later
to the 1st Infantry Division in Lamitan town in Basilan Province,
the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Edgardo Batenga, presidential consultant on military
affairs, was quoted as saying the surrender of the two MILF groups
within one week was a "big loss to the southern Philippines armed
force in terms of manpower and logistical resources."
</P>
<P>
"These surrenders indicate a breakdown in command and control
of the MILF with its subordinate forces," Batenga said.
</P>
<P>
The press release was issued one day after MILF leaders told
the press that some 5,000 disgruntled Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) have joined the MILF during the past months.
</P>
<P>
The MILF leaders said these MNLF men defected after being
disillusioned with the slow implementation of the peace deal
signed last September between the MNLF and the government.
</P>
<P>
But the alleged MNLF men's massive defection was quickly denied
by the Philippine military, which accused the MILF leadership of
trying to launch a "propaganda" campaign to defame the government
and the rival MNLF.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the MNLF, is currently the
largest anti-government force in the country, with an estimated
membership of 12,000.
</P>
<P>
The MILF refused to accept the peace deal concluded between the
government and MNLF and sought its own peace talks with the
government.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Russian Strategic Partnership Important: Rodionov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Russian partnership of
strategic cooperation will not only benefit peace and stability in
the Asia-Pacific region and the world, but also facilitate the
establishment of new, fair, and multipolarized international
political and economic orders, Russian Minister of National
Defense Igor Nikolayevich Rodionov said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a lecture at the Academy of Military Science of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army (PLA), Rodionov said that the strategic
partnership is built on the foundation of common or similar views
that the two countries share on a number of crucial issues about
global development. The partnership has won support from the two
peoples, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the lecture titled "Sino-Russian Partnership Is the Most
Important Factor of Peace and Stability in the Asia-Pacific
Region," he said that both countries oppose some other countries
seeking hegemony and discriminating among countries as leaders and
followers. He said that both countries adhere to the principle of
equality among all members of the international community and work
for the establishment of a new and fair international security
system.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia highly values China's concern about the
eastward expansion of NATO. He said that Russia is diametrically
opposed to the West using the issues of human rights, Tibet, and
Taiwan to apply pressure on China.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the two countries are able to and should
set up and strengthen effective multilateral and bilateral
cooperative frameworks on peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
region.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov said that the coordinated stands of the two countries
on global issues have had significant influence on the resolution
of these issues, including disarmament, limitation on offensive
strategic weapons, maintaining the principle of nuclear
non-proliferation, and reform of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Russia will always stick to the "one China"
policy on the Taiwan issue. On the Tibet issue, Russia also holds
that Tibet is part of China, inseparable from the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov hopes that the two countries will further develop the
partnership of strategic cooperation and conduct intensive and
constructive dialogues in the military and political arena to
improve mutual trust and respect.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Investors Invited to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian investors are
being invited to participate actively in Egypt's economic
development in line with the Middle Eastern country's open door
policy towards foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The offer was made by Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal Ahmed El
Ganzoury today at a news conference at the end of his two-day
official visit here.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian investors could take part in at least four big
joint venture projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome Malaysian investors to participate in the
agro-based industry complex in the New Valley Canal where 60,000
acres had been set aside for cotton growing," El Ganzoury said.
</P>
<P>
The second project where Malaysians could be involved is the
upgrading of a shipyard in Alexandria, which is also important to
Egypt, he said.
</P>
<P>
The third project deals with high technology and Malaysian
investors are also encouraged to set up jointly a palm oil
refinery in Egypt to enable the country to cut down on imports of
edible oil amounting to 500 million U.S. dollars a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister hoped that several other projects which
would be jointly set up by the private sector either in Malaysia
or Egypt will bring about a new era of joint ventures between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
El Ganzoury assured Malaysian investors that they would be
given top priority.
</P>
<P>
He said his government had amended 53 laws to ensure that
foreign investments were easy, secure and profitable.
</P>
<P>
"We are also opening our doors to products from other
countries, I promise that Malaysian products will be there in
Egypt," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he had very constructive discussions with his Malaysian
counterpart Mahathir Mohamad and the two signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) on economic cooperation between the two
countries today.
</P>
<P>
He said businessmen of the two countries also had "very
fruitful" negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, Malaysia and Egypt signed five agreements and MoUs
covering different areas.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Prime Minister said that follow-up action would be
taken to ensure everything starts in the near future as planned.
</P>
<P>
He said he and Mahathir also discussed political issues.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Prime Minister left here for Singapore.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
lower today after losing more than half a U.S. cent in the
previous 24 hours, on the back of selling by offshore accounts.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 77.63 U.S. cents, down from
78.17 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Traders cited recent signs that an upswing in economic activity
was so far subdued, encouraging market talks that a rate cut just
could be in the cards.
</P>
<P>
While the United States has taken on a tighter monetary policy
stance in the face of growing inflationary pressures in the
economy, policy in Australia is generally expected to remain
steady to the end of the year on the back of a low inflation
outlook for 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, since the release of much weaker-than-expected local
employment figures last week, a few market participants have been
mulling over the chances of an easing in monetary policy before
year-end.
</P>
<P>
"It is not looking real good for the Australian dollar in the
short term," IBJ foreign exchange manager Shane Spurway said.
</P>
<P>
On cross rates today, the Australian dollar ended at 97.89,
down from 98.82 against the Japanese yen and at 1.3417, down from
1.3431 against the Deutsche mark.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Dutch international star Ruud
Gullit has been asked by Nelson Mandela to play a soccer friendly
match in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The South African leader asked Gullit to join the Dutch

</P>
<P>
The friendly international is billed as the Nelson Mandela
Inauguration Challenge, an annual event since 1994.

Gullit, former Feyenoord and AC Milan player, was named
European Footballer of the year in 1987 and he dedicated his honor
to Mandela, at the time still in prison.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch, now player-coach of the Chelsea club, has said an
invitation from Mandela would be a great honor and one he would be
pleased to accept.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Finance Secretary to Bid for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary
Roberto de Ocampo has confirmed his bid to run for the presidency
in the May 1998 general elections, the Philippine News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo announced his bid during a meeting with a group of
city, municipal and provincial treasurers over the weekend, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
He said his intention to run for the presidency is to sustain
the growing momentum of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"I know the president wants somebody to replace him with
understanding about the economy of the world and the principle of
globalization," de Ocampo said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he needs the "anointment" of President Fidel Ramos for
his bid, de Ocampo said, "That would certainly help if the
president chooses me. And I have been loyal to the president's
administration that I cannot turn my back on him."
</P>
<P>
Besides de Ocampo, other possible presidential contenders
include Vice President Joseph Estrada, Defense Secretary Renato de
Villa and Speaker of the House of Representatives Jose de venecia.
</P>
<P>
But observers here believe the ruling Lakas-NUCD Party will be
divided if de Ocampo and de Venecia, both senior Lakas members,
all want to run next year for the party and compete for the
anointment of Ramos, who is chairman of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, whose single six-year term will expire in May 1998,
cannot run for re-election under the country's current
constitution. Ramos himself has repeatedly confirmed his
determination to step down in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China has closed down 62,561
factories causing serious pollution, or 85.5 percent of the
polluting factories that should be shut down, according to the
latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the State Bureau of Environmental
Protection today show that the closed-down factories included
small paper mills, leather tanning factories, printing and dyeing
mills, coking plants using outdated production processes, and
other factories causing serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
The move was in line with a decree of the State Council last
year that required that all of the country's 15 kinds of
small-sized factories causing serious pollution be close down.
</P>
<P>
These polluters have caused serious environmental problems,
seriously affecting the country's economic development and the
improvement of the living environment.
</P>
<P>
Official figures reveal that the number of polluters that
should be closed had increased to 73,149 by March 31, 1,556 more
than at the end of January.
</P>
<P>
Twenty province-level areas including Beijing, Heilongjiang,
Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Qinghai have nearly completed their
polluter shut-down task, according to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The shut-down rates of Yunnan Province in southwest China and
Qinghai Province in northwestern China have climbed to 70.9
percent and 97.8 percent respectively from January's 55 percent
and 86 percent.

Leone-Ghana, Gabon-Morocco and Nigeria-Guinea.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Postpones Exchange of Important Visits with Denmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China will postpone its planned
exchange of important visits with Denmark and freeze exchanges and
cooperation with it in the human rights area, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang announced at a routine press
conference here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In response to a reporter's question, Shen said China
consistently attaches great importance and makes continuous
efforts to developing Sino-Danish relations.
</P>
<P>
He continued that Denmark, however, shows no consideration for
bilateral friendly relations and norms concerning international
relations, intensifying its vain attempts and taking the lead in
putting forth an anti-China motion to This year's annual meeting
of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva and sparing no effort
to draw other countries over to its side to confront with China.
</P>
<P>
The activity by Denmark is an interference in China's internal
affairs, he said, adding that it hurts the feeling of the Chinese
people, damages the good atmosphere of the Sino-Danish relations
and sets up an obstacle to the smooth development of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
As a result to what Denmark has done, he stated, China has to
take necessary response, including delay of planned exchange of
important visits and suspension of contacts cooperation with it in
human rights area.
</P>
<P>
Shen noted that the Sino-Danish relations have been harmed
since the Danish side clings obstinately to its course. "What has
taken place is something that the Chinese side does not like to
see. We sincerely hope that on human rights issue, Denmark will
remove confrontation with China and return to the way to equal
dialogue and cooperation, which is in the fundamental and
long-term interests of the two countries and two peoples." Shen
said.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Chinese Region Turns Fruit Into Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- It's not uncommon to eat fruit in
winter in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, as
fruit growing has become a pillar industry there.
</P>
<P>
The region, long famous for its Hami melons and Turpan grapes,
produced 2.2 million tons of fruit from 183,000 ha of farmland
last year, and had 130 kg of fruit per capita, ranking first among
regions and provinces in China.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers grew fruit mainly for self-consumption 20 years
ago, but now the market economy has promoted the cottage industry
into a major source of farmers' income and local revenue.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 100,000 households are engaged in fruit growing, while
more than three million farmers make good money from growing fruit
as a sideline.
</P>
<P>
The region, rich in light and heat resources for fruit
cultivation, has built seven national-level fruit production bases
and 20 regional bases, covering 80,000 ha of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The name-brand products, like Hami Melon, Turpan Grape, and
Korla Fragrant Pear, have accounted for 63 percent of the total
output, and sell well at home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Number of HK Drug Abusers Remain Stable for '96: Anti-drug Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Number of Hong Kong's drug
abusers has remained relatively stable, chairman of the Action
Committee Against Narcotics (ACAN) said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chai-nie said that a total of 19,626 abusers of all ages
were reported to Hong Kong's Central Registry of Drug Abuse, which
represented a 1.5 percent increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
But it represented a 3.4 percent decrease from the 1994 figure,
Chan said.
</P>
<P>
So the proportion of local people involved in drug abuse also
remained relatively small, which is about 3.5 per thousand
population, Chan continued.
</P>
<P>
The most commonly abused drugs were heroin (86.6 percent),
cannabis (8.4 percent), cough medicine (3.0 percent), triazolam
(2.9 percent) and methyl amphetamine or "ice" (2.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
The number of drug abusers reported to have abused psycho
tropic substances increased by 28.3 percent in 1996 over the
previous year, from 2,618 to 3,358.
</P>
<P>
The upward trend of female drug abusing persisted in 1996, with
2,417 being reported, which represented a 4.18 percent increase
over the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
The ACAN's Research Sub-committee will commission a two-year
study to identify relevant factors affecting the changes in drug
abuse pattern.
</P>
<P>
And the ACAN Sub-committee on Treatment and Rehabilitation will
concurrently examine how to further strengthen the existing
services for female drug abusers and psycho tropic substance
abusers to better cater for their rehabilitation strategy.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto and
Vice Chairperson of China's State Science and Technology
Commission Deng Nan expressed the hope here today that the two
countries will expand cooperation in economic and technical
fields.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting at the Merdeka Palace, Soeharto told Deng, who
arrived in Indonesia on April 11 for a 10-day official visit, that
the two countries "have no reason not to strengthen their
cooperation, as we are all developing countries."
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia and China, which established their relations
on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, have
much common ground, including the fact that they are both rich in
human and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
But, he noted, it is not enough only with rich human and
natural resources. "We should use them better by developing
technology and paying great attention to education."
</P>
<P>
The president proposed that the two countries should start
their technical cooperation from concrete projects, such as in the
fields of industry, agriculture and culture.
</P>
<P>
Deng, who agreed with the president's proposal, said the
technical cooperation will also push forward political, economic
and trade relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
She said that with their large population and broad markets,
the two countries' relations have bright prospects.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Deng and her party also met with State Minister
for Research and Technology Bacharudin Jusuf Habibie.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Habibie said Indonesia will stick to its "one
China" policy. Indonesia will not develop political relations with
Taiwan except in the fields of economy and trade, he noted.

Israel in May for expansion of military cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Israel Bir will discuss with Israeli
officials in the military training agreement signed last year to
determine 1997 plans and details about the planned military
exercises, the Daily News quoting sources in the General staff
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The senior army official accompanied by a group of
high-ranking officers, is also expected to inspect the Israel
Aircraft Industries which is responsible for upgrading Turkish Air
Force' F-4 fighters in line with the Israeli-Turkish accord.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Bir will be briefed on Israel's recent
proposal to modernize Turkish M-60 tanks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he will discuss with the Israelis their offer to
refit 48 F-5 fighter jets as well as plans to manufacture a
modern type of rifles to replace the G-3 type small arms
currently used by the Turkish infantry.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli officials are also likely to recommend their
early-warning aircraft to Turkey which has long desired to
possess its own early-warning system.
</P>
<P>
With its Phalcon model, Israel is among the candidates hoping
to get involved in Turkey's bid to buy early-warning aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish armed forces has been playing a key role in
developing defense relations with Israel, and has strongly
defended the necessity of such Turkish-Israeli agreements,
despite pro-Islamic Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's
reluctance to do so.
</P>
<P>
The ties between Turkey and Israel were greatly enhanced last
year following the signing of a military training agreement and
another accord on defense industry cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreements with Israel have sparked
criticisms from some Middle East countries which believe that
Turkey is aligning itself with the Jewish state to oppose the
interests of the Arab world.

CHANGCHUN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Quanhe Port of Entry, which
has in the past only been open to Chinese and residents of
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, became passable for foreign
travelers earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The outlet in Huichun City, Jilin Province, is the only passage

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- It has become rarer for a
foreign visitor to Hong Kong to have a panoramic view of Victoria
Harbor as a result of a rocketing number of smoggy days over the
past years, according to local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists blame increased pollution and are calling for
a limit on vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A study by the Royal Observatory counted the number of hours
each day for the past three decades when visibility fell to less
than eight kilometers in the Victoria Harbor and outlying areas.
</P>
<P>
Poor visibility caused by weather such as fog, rain, mist and
high humidity was excluded.
</P>
<P>
Results showed that the harbor was blanketed in smog for 450
hours per year in the early 1990s, up from about 180 hours per
year in the 1970s, while outside the harbor, a similar worsening
trend was also recorded.
</P>
<P>
A local environment-friendly organization warned that the smog,
generated by vehicles and construction, would raise hazards for
shipping and air traffic, and urged the government to limit the
vehicle growth.

<HEADLINE> Rockwell Hopes to Join AE 100 Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The head of Rockwell
International, a leading industrial automation and electronics
company in the world, says he hopes his company will be the
supplier of avionic products for the 100-seat jets to be developed
by China, Europe and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Donald R. Beall, chairman and chief executive officer of the
US-based company who is attending a corporate meeting in Beijing,
said today the AE 100 program will be a prospective new field
in which Rockwell can further its cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
He added Rockwell is working with the Aviation Industries of
China (AVIC) to develop avionics for the new 100-seaters, and
"while the decision process continues, we will work aggressively
to maximize our participation" in the program.
</P>
<P>
The AE 100 program, with an estimated cost of two billion US
dollars, is the largest Sino-foreign cooperative project for
China's aircraft manufacturing industry. China aims at the
development of the new jets to help raise industry standards and
meet the demand for regional jetliners in the world over the next
two decades.
</P>
<P>
Rockwell also hopes to sell its GPS-based air traffic
management system to China, Beall said, adding that its new GPS
(global positioning system) manufacturing plants in Shanghai might
be involved in building the air traffic management systems in the
future.
</P>
<P>
He noted the company's interest in co-producing with Chinese
partners Rockwell's air traffic alert and collision avoidance
systems for aircraft. "The software expertise found in China could
help us greatly in these product areas, and we could build on our
long-held relationship with our Chinese airline customers," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Collins, a Rockwell subsidiary, has been providing avionics
equipment for Chinese carriers over the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
Beall estimated that Rockwell's turnover will hit eight billion
US dollars this year, of which about 15 percent will come from the
Asia-Pacific region. The company's sales in the region are
projected to hit about two billion US dollars by 2001, double
the current figure, and the sales of its electronic products in
China will stand at 200 million US dollars by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Rockwell has invested about 50 million US dollars in China, and
set up four joint ventures, primarily in the automotive industry,
according to Beall.

<HEADLINE> TV Series Features Political Struggles in Ancient China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A 60-part TV series depicting the
political struggles involved in China's transformation from a
slave-owning society to feudalism 2,000 years ago recently won
praise from viewers.
</P>
<P>
The China Central Television Station (CCTV), which produced the
show, said that the cost of each segment of the drama "Later Years
of the Zhou Dynasty" was 400,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The station started the showing of the TV series earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
During the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC) and the
Warring States (475-221 BC), Chinese society experienced many
tremendous changes.
</P>
<P>
Chinese culture was revitalized in two separate periods, and a
number of thinkers and strategists emerged, such as Lao Zi, the
founder of Taoism, Confucius, a great educator and thinker, and
Sun Wu, who wrote China's earliest-known military work "Master
Sun's Art of War."
</P>
<P>
The series, adapted from some early works on Chinese history,
including "Annals of the Spring and Autumn Period," "Kuo Yu" and
"Tso Chuan," emphasizes historical facts rather than fictional
stories.
</P>
<P>
Director Shen Haofang, who also directed another popular
historical series "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," said that the
filming of such a program is meant to popularize knowledge of
Chinese history and inspire patriotism in young people.
</P>
<P>
Many viewers have noticed that many daily-used words and idioms
originated from stories during the two periods. "It is valid to
popularize ancient Chinese culture through TV programs," said Yang
Shengnan with the Chinese Academy of Social Science, who acted as
a consultant for the drama,
</P>
<P>
The series was co-written by Wang Peigong, Guo Qihong and
Ouyang Yibing, who say they believe that ancient people's
pioneering spirit of reform and their emphasis on talent will
benefit today's social progress.
</P>
<P>
Central China's Henan Province also built a city with Spring
and Autumn Period-style buildings, which has become a favorite
tourist destination, according to the production group.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Further Strengthen Ties With Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad today held talks with the visiting Foreign and Law
Minister of Singapore S. Jayakumar on bilateral and other issues
of common concern, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers had an overview of the state of ties,
expressed satisfaction over the growing links and explored
possibilities of expanding cooperation in different fields between
their countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed trade relationship and agreed to
increase the economic and trade links. The total turnover of
bilateral trade is about 1 billion U.S. dollars and Bangladesh
exports account for only 40 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi side in the talks stressed the need for
Singapore to increase exports from the country, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dhaka also wants more Singapore investment, which is
relatively low compared with the capital Singapore has put in
Bangladesh's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's membership in the Indian Ocean Rim (IOR) was also
discussed and Singapore, which is an active member of the group,
has reportedly assured of its support on this matter.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, the Singapore foreign minister called on
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who said her country
could benefit from the experience of Singapore in urban
development and managing airports and seaports.

BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A series of Chinese-made
high-performance computers have been used in a major information
project of Tianjin, breaking up foreign corporations' monopoly
over this slice of the market.
</P>
<P>
Qu Weizhi, vice-mayor of Tianjin, made the announcement at
today's press conference on the successful application of
high-performance computers made by the Dawning Information
Industry Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>

achievements of China's hi-tech program, and is a leading maker of
high-performance computers in China.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin first began experimenting with the use of advanced
computers in November, 1996. It plans to invest 140 million yuan
(about 17 million US dollars) in launching an information project,
using 200 Dawning series products.
</P>
<P>
As many as 50 Dawning computers have been used in the project,
covering tax collection management, scientific research, commerce
and trade, and foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Dawning Corp., established in Shenzhen in 1995, is a key
vehicle for technology transfer and commercializing the research
findings of the national high-tech program.

<P>
VALLETTA, MALTA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat arrived here today to attend
the second European-Mediterranean conference.
</P>
<P>
He will be attending the conference with Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy and ministers from 25 other European and
Mediterranean countries.
</P>
<P>
The conference, to focus on how to push forward the Euro-Med
cooperation launched at the first Barcelona conference in 1995,
is also expected to discuss the faltering of the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks have been virtually brought to
a halt as the Israeli hardline policies, particularly the Jewish
settlement plans in East Jerusalem, angered the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League decided on March 31 to stop normalization
process of their relations with Israel, revive the economic
boycott and withdraw from Mideast multilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that Arafat might meet Levy bilaterally during the
conference on ways to defuse the current crisis and get the peace
talks back on track.
</P>
<P>
European officials have said here that European Union's (EU)
Middle East Envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos has been trying to
broker an Arafat-Levy meeting in Malta.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference is to open later today and bring
together ministers from the 15 EU members and their 12
Mediterranean partners, namely Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel,

<HEADLINE> Motor Vehicle Insurance Booms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics from the
Pacific Ocean Insurance Co., Ltd. show China's total premium
earnings from motor vehicle insurance reached 26 billion yuan last
year, up 25 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
The figure accounted for nearly 60 percent of the country's
total premium earnings from property insurance, Xu Jinghui, deputy
manager of the Domestic Business Department of the Pacific Ocean
Insurance Co., Ltd, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Motor motor insurance has become the most important source of
income and profit for Chinese property insurance companies, and
will see rapid growth in the coming years, Xu said in an address
to an ongoing seminar on the insurance business, co-sponsored by
the Insurance Institute of China and the Hong Kong Federation of
Insurers (HKFI).
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, China will have 16 million motor vehicles for
civilian use and a 1.2 million kilometers of roads.
</P>
<P>
Based on this, China's premium of motor vehicle insurance is
expected to top 45 billion yuan by the end of this century,
growing at an average annual rate of about 20 percent, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese property insures have been competing with one
another for a big slice of the motor vehicle insurance pie, and
are also cooperating with each other in introducing a sound
service system for their clients, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC)
still holds 80.7 percent of the country's motor vehicle insurance
market, leaving the rest for other insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
But domestic property insurance companies are also dealing with
a skyrocketing number of compensation claims from their policy
holders.
</P>
<P>
The three giant insurance companies in China, namely, the PICC,
Pacific Ocean Insurance Co. Ltd. and Ping'an Insurance Co. Ltd.
paid a total of 15 billion yuan in claims last year.

<HEADLINE> Experts on Setup of State Reinsurance Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Experts from the Reinsurance
Company of the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC) have
suggested that China set up a state reinsurance company just as
other developing countries have done, in order to curb the market
disorder and develop a national reinsurance industry.
</P>
<P>
China plans to establish some policy insurance companies
separating from the commercial firms to further its
commercialization of the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
The policy insurance companies to be formed include a company
dealing in agricultural insurance, one that specializes in export
credit insurance and a state reinsurance business.
</P>
<P>
PICC Reinsurance, one of the three subsidiaries of the PICC,
now functions as a state reinsurance company authorized by the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
"But it is unfair for other Chinese insurance companies if PICC
Reinsurance continues its role as a state reinsurance company, as
it is a commercial company," a Chinese insurance official said.
</P>
<P>
Many other Chinese insurers, including Pacific Ocean Insurance
and Ping'an Insurance Co., Ltd., have started businesses in the
country's reinsurance market, which formerly was monopolized by
PICC.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that the state reinsurance company to be set
up will be a combination of a policy and commercial insurance
firm, mainly dealing with compulsory reinsurance business, and
playing the leading role in China's reinsurance market.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that a few commercial reinsurance
companies should be built, and a pool should be established among
all insurance companies in Taiwan, Hong Kong and the inland areas
by both home and overseas Chinese to handle special insurance
needs such as coverage for natural disasters or nuclear hazards.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that the total income of the reinsurance
industry in China's inland areas will be around 23 billion yuan by
the end of this century.

<HEADLINE> More Blind Chinese to Become Massagists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- New measures taken by certain
Chinese authorities will enable more blind people in the country
to become massagists.
</P>
<P>
The China Massage Center for the Blind plans to train 20,000
blind people in massage techniques and 500 key teaching personnels
by the year 2000, according to a report in today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
At present, about 10,000 blind massagists are working at 1,630
establishments and clinics across the country.
</P>
<P>
The center will encourage local massage bodies and training
centers run by blind people to train those pursuing massage
careers while inviting massage departments in the country's three
medical colleges and technical schools to support such training,
Cheng Weiping, deputy office director of the center, told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The center has compiled and published 18 kinds of teaching
materials and teaching plans for such medical massage work, in
both Braille and Chinese, Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, China's development plan for disabled people
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) has designated that
national and local federations for the disabled be independently
in charge of training and employment of those pursuing massage
careers.
</P>
<P>
The state has basically completed the drafting of regulations
and policies for the appraisal of technical titles for blind
people involved in massage career, as well as for their training,
employment and administration, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Massage has been a major field of work for blind people in
China. Others have found handicraft jobs such as knitting,
packaging of products, tuning of musical instruments and jobs as
telephone operators.
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 blind people received training in performing
massage last year, three times the annual training record in the
1991-1995 period, the newspaper said.

LUSAKA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Plans are underway to export
Zambia's electric power to neighboring Tanzania, Namibia and
Botswana, Zambian Energy Minister Suresh Desai said.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted him as saying that an

<HEADLINE> Singapore Woman Police Officer Jailed for Stealing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A woman police officer of
Singapore was sentenced to seven years in prison for stealing 800
Singapore dollars (about 556 U.S. dollars) from a Myanmar
overstayer, local television reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the court was told Yvonne Yeo Seow Hwee, 22,
was the officer on duty at the Central Police Division lock-up
when the incident happened two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Yeo searched the overstayer, 36-year-old Myo Mahn, who was
being detained, and found a coin box and a pouch containing stacks
of money.
</P>
<P>
Before registering the contents, the officer secretly pocketed
a wad of 50-dollar bills and wrote out a prison's property receipt
which accounted only for the rest of the contents.
</P>
<P>
The detainee disputed the amount in the receipt and Yeo
panicked, the report said. It said she then hid the cash in a can
of air freshener in the toilet, and the theft was later
discovered.
</P>
<P>
Yeo said she stole because of family circumstances. But the
district judge said he felt the need to impose a deterrent
sentence, because Yeo was tasked with upholding justice, but she
had abused that power, the judge said.

<HEADLINE> Life Insurance Seeing Rapid Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China's total premium income
generated from life insurance services hit 33 billion yuan last
year, an increase of 70 percent over 1995 figures, statistics from
the Ping'an Insurance Co., Ltd. show.
</P>
<P>
He Zhiguang, deputy manager of the Ping'an Insurance Company
Shanghai branch, said that about half of the nearly 300 million
Chinese urban residents, whose annual incomes are showing stable
growth, have considered buying life insurance.
</P>
<P>
The per capita annual income of urban residents was about 4,500
yuan last year, which made life insurance costs more affordable at
a time when China is reshaping its social welfare system.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank predicts that by the turn of the century, the
total income of China's insurance industry will reach 250 billion
yuan, half of which comes from life insurance premium income.
</P>
<P>
"This creates a big life insurance market for both home and
overseas insurers, and one which has kept growing at a
double-digit rate over the past few years," he said.
</P>
<P>
After the country adopted a law on insurance administration
last year, a well-regulated and standardized life insurance market
has taken shape in China, he noted.
</P>
<P>
But compared with other countries in the world, China's life
insurance market still remains underdeveloped, he added.
</P>
<P>
Data show that the per capita spending on life insurance
services of Chinese residents was no more than 1.4 US dollars last
year, with the total premium income of life insurance accounting
for less than 0.3 percent of the country's gross national product.
</P>
<P>
China now has five nationwide players on the life insurance
market, including the three giant insurers -- the People's
Insurance Company of China, Pacific Ocean Insurance Co., ltd,
Ping'an Insurance Co., Ltd. -- and New China and Taikang companies
set up last year.
</P>
<P>
The American Insurance International Group(AIG) has also
started business in Shanghai and Guangzhou, as well as a joint
venture insurance company.

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- In a major attempt to give a
boost to the cash-starved Indian industry, the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI) today cut interest rates by 1 percent to 11 percent,
abolished cash reserve ratio on interbank liabilities and reduced
interest rates on short-term domestic deposits.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling the slack season credit policy, RBI Governor C.
Rangarajan told a press conference in Mumbai (Bombay) that the cut
in interest rates would send an "effective signal" to the
cash-starved Indian industry and give freedom to banks to evolve
their own methods of assessing working capital needs of industry.
</P>
<P>
Under the credit policy for 1997-98 (April-March), the interest
rate on domestic term deposits for maturity of 30 days and up to
one year was reduced to 9 percent from the present 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has also adopted some financial schemes to
attract foreign exchange from non-resident Indians, according to
the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
It also attempted to improve the credit delivery system and
give complete freedom to banks on credit dispensation.

<HEADLINE> Iran Pledges Safety of German Embassy, Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran pledged here today it will
protect foreign nationals in the country and would not allow
extremist Muslim students to capture German embassy as what
happened to the U.S. Embassy here 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said at a press
conference "We have observed and will keep observing the
international rules and regulations."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian speaker made the statement while answering a
question posed by Xinhua on his stance to toward the students'
warning to seize the German Embassy unless the German government
makes an apology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
On Monday afternoon, about 400 students clashed with some
1,000 anti-riot policemen in front of the German Embassy and
dozens of extremist students were arrested as they tried to break
through the protection line a bid to remove the German flag at
the top of the embassy building.
</P>
<P>
The incident induced grave concern over the safety and
security of foreign embassies and foreign nationals working and
living in Iran.
</P>
<P>
At present some 500 Germans are living and working in Iran, but
about 30 engineers from the Siemens have left the country since
the anti-German wave started in the Islamic republic Thursday
after the Berlin court announced its verdict accusing top
political leadership in Iran of ordering the assassination of four
Kurdish opposition leaders in a Berlin Mykonos restaurant in
1992, .
</P>
<P>
"Our people would have never done that and will never do
that," he replied to the question on whether what happened to the
U.S. embassy here 18 years ago would recur.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian extremist students occupied the U.S. Embassy to
Tehran and held all the embassy staff hostage in 1979 when the
Islamic Revolution began, and the seizure lasted 444 days.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old speaker made a guarantee that the foreign
embassies and their nationals will be safe and in no danger
despite the escalating tension between Iran and Germany
following the Berlin court verdict.
</P>
<P>
He said "we have an obligation to protect the lives of foreign
nationals in Iran just as we have an obligation to protect the
lives of our own people," adding that "Our people are not the kind
who would endanger the lives of foreigners living in this
country."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, Iran was making the pledge despite that fact
that "the Germans have not been able, or being incompetent, to
keep counter-revolutionaries off our embassy in Bonn."
</P>
<P>
They raided the Iranian embassy many times, set fire to parts
of the embassy compound and harassed the Iranian employees, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the verdict by the Berlin court accusing top political
leadership in Iran of ordering the assassination of four Kurdish
opposition leaders in a Berlin Mykonos restaurant in 1992, he said,
"it is regretful for the Germans to have undertaken such an
illogical measure and have brought into existence such crisis."
</P>
<P>
Iran has launched a nationwide anti-German demonstration with
tens of thousands of people turning out in 12 cities to protest
against the Berlin court ruling over the Mykonos case.
</P>
<P>
The protesters urged the government to sever its diplomatic
and economic ties with Germany and prosecute 24 German companies
which exported chemical weapons to Iraq during the eight-year
war with Iran starting from 1980.
</P>
<P>
On the question whether Iran will downgrade or cut relations
with Germany, he replied that the government would examine the
case and respond to the Parliament's request accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri, who is a front-runner in the 7th presidential
election scheduled in May 23, stressed "We must keep
concentrating on our own national interests before anything
else."
</P>
<P>
On the relations between Iran and European Union (EU)
countries, he said, "what the European Union countries are doing
is even more illogical than what Germans have done."
</P>
<P>
"These EU countries are rushing into something whose dimensions
are not as yet understood by them," he noted.
</P>
<P>
All the 15-EU-member countries, except Greece, have recalled
their ambassadors in a protest against the involvement of Iranian
leaders in the assassination of Kurdish opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We are not worried whether the EU countries sever ties or
recall their ambassadors," he said.
</P>
<P>
The speaker noted that the EU decision against Iran is no
bigger than the U.S. D' Amato bill of imposing sanctions against
oil companies to invest over 40 million U.S. dollars in Iran and
Libya, which failed to harm Iran or bring the Iranians to their
knees.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin court verdict sparked a fierce diplomatic battle
between Iran and Germany. The two sides had recalled their
ambassadors and expelled four diplomats from each side.
</P>
<P>
Besides EU countries, countries like Australia and New Zealand
have also recalled their ambassadors.

<HEADLINE> Drop of International Crude Oil Prices Raises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices in the world
market have crashed below the Nigeria's official selling price of
17 U.S. Dollars per barrel, causing major concern among economy
watchers in the Africa's largest oil-producing country.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of petroleum Export Countries (OPEC) said on
Monday that the price of its basket of crudes, including
Nigeria's Bonny Light, dropped to 16.91 U.S. Dollars per barrel
compared with 17.74 U.S. Dollars last week.
</P>
<P>
The new price represents nine cents or 0.5 percent below the
Nigerian government's budget price of 17 U.S. Dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Unrestrained production, particularly by members of OPEC, was
linked to the falling oil prices. Total output by the
organization last month was 27.175 million barrels per day, which
was 2.142 million above the group's ceiling of 25.033 million.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has projected a foreign exchange
revenue of 9.202 billion U.S. Dollars from oil exports this
fiscal year based on the selling price of 17 U.S. Dollars per
barrel.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Discuss Iran Issue With Other Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Australia will hold discussions
with the United States, Canada and members of the European Union
before taking any further action against Iran over its alleged
terrorist activities, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
today.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Brisbane for a federal cabinet meeting
today, Downer said, "We want to have discussions with our partners
before taking any further action beyond the recall of the
ambassador."
</P>
<P>
Australia recalled its ambassador, Stuart Hume, from Iran after
the announcement of the German High Court last week that Iran had
ordered a group of terrorists into Germany to assassinate Kurdish
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Downer said he had not received full details of the German High
Court decision, but the federal government wanted "very carefully
to assess" what the court had said.
</P>
<P>
Australia has gained much out of the former Labor government's
refusal to back a U.S. trade boycott against Iran in 1995, with
exports to the Islamic republic having since topped 1 billion
Australian dollars (780 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the last financial year alone, exports to Iran reached 540
million Australian dollars (421 million U.S. dollars), including
470 million dollars in wheat, coal, wool and sugar.

LAGOS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's military administration
has restated its commitment to the program of transition to
democratically-elected civilian government.
</P>
<P>
In a speech on Monday, Head of State General Sani Abacha

constitutional roles as the deadline from the military's
disengagement from governance approaches.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that sanctions against Nigeria by western

operations of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF).
</P>

But it was gratifying that creative innovativeness of the force

The sanctions, including embargo on the sales and service of

"In spite of the confrontation and hostility by a section of

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The deputies of the French National Assembly today began to
study a draft law on social cohesion which is aimed at reducing
social disparity in the country.
</P>
<P>
The law includes articles on protection of the voting right for
the homeless, eradicating the disease of tuberculosis,
facilitating access to public housing, fighting illiteracy and
creating an observatory on poverty and exclusion.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. state of Alabama was on the verge of a revolt as
thousands of people gathered last weekend in its capital
Montgomery to support Roy Moore, a local judge, who became a hero
overnight by defying a higher court banning on the insertion of
the 10 Commandments of the Bible into the local constitution.
</P>
<P>
The event reflects the resurgence of Christian fundamentalism
in the American Deep South which is nostalgic of a "White,
Christian South" before the American Civil War last century.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- France, which had been making efforts to improve relations
with Iran, was apparently embarrassed by the abrupt deterioration
of relations between Iran and the European Union, which
unexpectedly occurred last week after a German court accused
Tehran of being involved in a terrorist attack in Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the European Union countries now seem to have chosen
to appease Tehran after recalling their ambassadors from Iran.
</P>
<P>
-- Canadian Governor-General Romeo Leblanc, who is here this
week to commemorate the Canadians died in France during World War
I, said that he would seek to "double the partnership" between
Canada and France.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister
Kamal Ahmed el-Ganzouri today signed a memorandum of understanding
on economic cooperation with his Malaysian counterpart, Mahathir
Mohamad, before concluding his two-day visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the document by the two leaders reflected the
importance of yesterday's discussions between the two governments
and the subsequent interactions of private sectors of both
countries, said Deva Mohd Ridzam, Malaysian Foreign Ministry
undersecretary for West Asia, Africa and the Organization of the
Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
"Both prime ministers are attached to the relations from now
on. In a nutshell, it puts the relations on a forward momentum,"
he told reporters after the signing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier yesterday, Malaysia and Egypt also signed three
agreements and two other memorandums of understanding, including
accords on avoiding double taxation and on investment guarantee.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, el-Ganzouri called on Mahathir at his office and had
an audience with Malaysian King Tuanku Ja'afar.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian prime minister left here for Singapore today.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Enjoys Trade Surplus With U.S. in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, Africa's largest
oil-producting country, enjoyed in 1996 a trade surplus of five
billion U.S. Dollars with the United States, with a total trade
volume of 6.6 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Information Service said in an annual trade review
that Nigeria exported 5.8 billion U.S. Dollars worth of goods,
mainly oil products, to the U.S. in 1996, as against an import of
816 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the surplus on the Nigerian side is 4.2 billion U.S.
Dollars, the review said, adding that Nigeria is now the No. 57
foreign market for the U.S. in terms of size.
</P>
<P>
The review put the U.S. direct investment in Nigeria in 1995
at 5.95 million U.S. Dollars, representing an increase of 84.8
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. investment in Nigeria is concentrated largely in the
manufacturing sector, it said.
</P>
<P>
The review listed inadequate and poorly-maintained
infrastructure, confusing and inconsistent regulations as leading
obstacles to increased U.S. investment in the west African
country, despite the government's many efforts to boost direct
foreign investment in the last few years.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Launches "Buy Russian" Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today called on Russians to give preference to national goods in
order to help the country's ailing industries.
</P>
<P>
In a radio address, Yeltsin said that his appeal is buttressed
by better quality of goods produced in the country.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the Russian market has been filled
with foreign-made goods.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to resolve a new task. I want our people to
give preference to Russia-made products, such as wear costumes,
shoes, refrigerators and furniture," said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yeltsin stressed that it did not mean there is to be
a tough protectionism to ban foreign goods from the Russian
market, but "Russia-made goods should excel in quality."
</P>
<P>
"Russia should encourage honest competition. Any administrative
pressure is inadmissible," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Some reports say that up to half of the food consumed by
Russians is imported and that Russians prefer in many cases to buy
Western products, particularly electronic goods, because the
equivalent items manufactured in Russia do not meet world
standards.

<HEADLINE> Israel Official Forecasts Increase in Arms Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official has
reportedly revealed that Israel expects to export about 1.7
billion U.S. dollars of weapons this year and 2 billion
U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministry director-general Ilan Biran made the remarks
in an interview published on this week's Bitahon, a magazine of
Israeli Defense Ministry employees.
</P>
<P>
However, Biran did not elaborate on his assessment of arms
exports, and in fact the magazine does not even quote him
directly making these assessments.
</P>
<P>
"Regarding security exports, the Defense Ministry
director-general is a man of good news," Bitahon reads.
</P>
<P>
"He speaks of a total of 1.7 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 and
of a goal for exports to the tune of 2 billion U.S. dollars in
1998-99."
</P>
<P>
Biran's forecast contrasts with that of senior executives in
the defense industries, who say Israel is facing increasing
competition to sell weapons.
</P>
<P>
In mid-March, senior Israeli defense executives warned that
unless the industry embarked on significant layoffs and
eliminated duplication, exports would decline and research and
development would be underfunded.
</P>
<P>
However, other executives said Biran's forecasts are in line
with those of the larger defense contractors in Israel, who view
new markets in Asia and Western Europe as having great growth
potential.
</P>
<P>
Israel's arms exports last year were reported at 1.6 billion
U.S. dollars, largely because of the 650 million-U.S.-dollar deal
which Israel Aircraft Industries signed with Turkey for the
latter's upgrading of 54 F-4 Phantom jets.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan, Israel Cooperate on Flower Production, Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan and Israel plan to jointly
build China's largest flower production and exportation base in
this southwest province.
</P>
<P>
Planting and exporting flowers is the most attractive project
included in a bilateral economic cooperation package between
Yunnan and Israel, said Ora Namir, the Israeli ambassador to China.
</P>
<P>
Namir made the remark during a visit to Yunnan last week,
accompanied by a group of Israeli entrepreneurs. During her trip,
Yunnan and Israel decided to increase cooperation in agriculture
and other fields, and signed a series of cooperation agreements.
</P>
<P>
With a favorable climate, Yunnan is already China's top flower
producer with an annual output of more than 200 million bouquets
of fresh flowers. And flower planting plays a leading role in a
large biological resources development plan sponsored by the
provincial government.
</P>
<P>
However, Namir pointed out, Yunnan's flower industry is still
in its infancy, with a large quantity but few quality products,
and the flowers are mainly sold on the domestic market. Israel, as
the fourth biggest flower exporter in the world, can offer
advanced management expertise in developing the flower industry.
</P>
<P>
She said the two sides had shown great enthusiasm in
co-developing flower production in Yunnan, and signed, during her
current visit, cooperative projects on training, funding and
technological exchange.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said she has confidence in the broad prospects
for bilateral cooperation in flower production, and she hopes the
The Yunnan Flower Industrial Co. Ltd. -- the first Israeli
invested project -- will become an example for bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The company, with an investment of 1.5 million US dollars from
Israel, has completed the construction of six hectares of
high-standard greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
Namir added that Israel is ready to promote bilateral
cooperation in other fields such as science and technology,
medical appliances, telecommunications, and development of solar
energy.

<HEADLINE> First Marche Restaurant Opens in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Movenpick Marche, one of the
world's leading restaurant groups in Switzerland, and the Sincere
Company, one of Hong Kong's retail groups, today jointly opened a
restaurant in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Christian Karl Nothhaft, director of Movenpick Marche's
international operations, said the marketplace in Asia represents
an enormous potential for restaurant service.
</P>
<P>
He said that Movenpick Marche restaurants have enjoyed much
success throughout the world and he is looking forward to further
cooperation with sincere Company in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>

Stuttgart, Germany, by Movenpick Enterprises. After that, Marche
restaurants have been opened throughout Europe, North America,
other parts of Asia and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
This year, there will be a total of 60 Marche restaurants with

<HEADLINE> Iran Pledges Safety of German Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran pledged here today that
it will not allow extremist Moslem students to capture the
German Embassy here as what happened to the American embassy
18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri said at a press
conference "We have observed and will keep observing the
international rules and regulations."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian speaker made the statement while answering a
question posed by Xinhua on his stance toward students' warning
to seize the German Embassy unless the German government makes an
apology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Monday afternoon, about 400 students clashed with 1,000
anti-riot policemen in front of the German Embassy and dozens of
extremist students were arrested as they tried to break through
the protective line a bid to seize the German flag at the top of
German Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The incident roused grave concern over the safety and security
of foreign embassies and foreign nationals working and living in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
"Our people would have never done that and will never do
that,' he replied to the question on whether Iran would repeat
what happened to the American embassy 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old speaker made a guarantee that the foreign
embassies and foreign nationals will be safe and in no danger
despite the escalating tension between Iran and Germany following
the Berlin court verdict.
</P>
<P>
He said, "we have an obligation to protect the lives of
foreign nationals in Iran just as we have an obligation to
protect the lives of our own people."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, "this is on the conditions that the
Germans have not been able, or being incompetent, to keep
counter- revolutionaries off our embassy in Bonn."
</P>
<P>
They raided the Iranian embassy many times, set fire to
parts of the embassy and harassed the Iranian employees, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the verdict by the Berlin court charging top political
leadership in Iran of the ordering the assassination of four
Kurdish opposition leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992, he
said, "it is regretful for the Germans to have undertaken such an
illogical measure and have brought into existence such crisis."
</P>
<P>
Iran has launched a nationwide anti-German wave with tens
of thousands of people turning out in 12 cities to protest
the insult by the Berlin court in the Mykonos case. The
demonstrators urged the government to sever the diplomatic and
economic ties with Germany and prosecute 24 German companies
which exported chemical weapons to Iraq during the eight-year
war with Iran from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
On a question whether Iran will downgrade or cut relations
with Germany, he replied, "the government would examine the
case and respond to the Parliament request accordingly."
</P>
<P>
Nateq-Nouri, who is a front-runner in the 7th presidential
election scheduled in May 23, stressed "We must keep
concentrating on our own national interests before anything else."

<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands Euro-Asia Flower
Group plans to transfer part of its production base to China, the
group's president Bin Yang announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the group, which is a combination of 14 flower
companies in the Netherlands, France and Belgium, has already set
up in Ghina factories to manufacture cold storage facilities as
well as greenhouses and farms to young plants and bulbs of tulips,
roses, Gladioli, chrysanthemum, hyacinths and connassions.
</P>
<P>
Yang also said that the company will also set up factories to
produce flower soil, flower medicine, flower packaging and dry
flowers in China.
</P>
<P>

ongoing month-long tulip show in Beijing, which ends on May 12.
The company's tulips are also being shown in Shanghai, Tianjin,
Jinan and Ningbo.
</P>
<P>
He said that his company has started construction near Beijing
Airport for Asia's biggest flower supermarket and auction market,
which is scheduled for completion in Beijing at the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the businessman added, China's cheap labor force is
one of the factors that encouraged his company to move part of its
operations to China.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Envoy Heads for U.S. on Peace Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President's Political
Advisor Osama el-Baz left here for Washington on a stepped-up
diplomatic drive to revive the stalled Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
His visit will be part of a flurry of wide-spread diplomatic
contacts Egypt is launching in the coming weeks to lobby the
United States and the European Union for new initiatives that it
hopes to salvage the faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a pre-departure statement, Baz said in Washington he will
meet with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, U.S. Mideast
Peace Coordinator Dennis Ross as well as with the U.S. National
Security Adviser to discuss means to break the current Mideast
peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
"I will discuss the U.S. initiatives with these officials and
get acquainted with their view regarding the EU idea," said Baz.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Arab attempts to activate the European role, Baz
said that Arabs welcome a European role but such a role should be
coordinated with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
In fact the Europeans are joining hands with the U.S. in order
to hammer out a proposal, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Europeans are discussing their initiative with the U.S. to
stage a joint European-U.S. initiative," he added, saying that he
was carrying Egypt's own proposals but refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa has told reporters that Baz will
brief the U.S. side on Egypt's ideas, which fall "within the
framework of its well-known lines."
</P>
<P>
Moussa also outlined the objectives of Egypt's intensive
diplomatic campaign underway, saying that its aim is to reach a
springboard taking into consideration Jerusalem, the settlements,
implementation of Oslo agreements on troop redeployment, and
resumption of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian diplomatic move followed the separate initiatives
proposed by the U.S. and EU to revive Israeli Palestinian talks
had flopped, failing to discourage Israel from a controversial
Jewish housing project in East Jerusalem, a condition the
Palestinians insist for resuming the talks.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak sent his top envoy to meet
U.S. officials to break the peace deadlock just one day after he
had talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's in Cairo,
reportedly at the request of U.S. President Bill Clinton who sent
a message to Mubarak Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians refuse to hold talks with Israel until it
stops work on the 6,500-house settlement on the edge of Arab East
Jerusalem, a project that has stalled the peace talks and sparked
almost daily clashes in the occupied lands.
</P>
<P>
Arafat today will leave here for Valletta, Malta to attend the
Euro-Mediterranean conference and meet with Ross.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Host Two NATO Military Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is preparing to host two
military exercises of NATO member countries under the alliance's
schedule, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Troops from the United States, Canada, Italy, Norway, the
Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Britain will reportedly
participate in the maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
The first one, named Ardent Ground '97, is to be conducted in
Turkey's European territory of Thrace, the closest part of the
country to its traditional rival Greece.
</P>
<P>
Ardent Ground '97, which will be backed by air support, aims
to improve the combat ability of NATO's light mobile land forces,
military sources said.
</P>
<P>
Distant Thunder, a second Turkey-hosted exercise, is expected
to be carried out by land and sea forces in western Anatolia
and the eastern Mediterranean between April 28 and May 18 with
the participation of Italy, Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Greece will take part in neither of the two military
exercises due to its bad relationship with Ankara, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that, however, the troops from Turkey and
Greece would participate in a joint military exercise in the

<HEADLINE> Airbus to Enhance Operation in Asia-Pacific Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The airlines of the
Asia-Pacific region will continue to experience the strongest
growth of any region in the world over the next two decades, an
Airbus Industrie official said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, John Leahy, senior vice president and
head of the Commercial Directorate, said that the Asia-Pacific
Region will become the dominant world market for new civil
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest market forecast for the region from
Airbus released here today, passenger traffic to, from and within
the region will rise at an average rate of 6.4 percent per year
over the forecast period, compared with the world average of 5.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Asia-Pacific region is a core market for
Airbus Industrie, accounting for one quarter of all sales recorded
by the consortium to date, with over 400 widebody aircraft
currently in service with 31 operators.
</P>
<P>
This higher than average growth for the region will generate a
requirement for triple the number of airline seats currently
available, rising from today's level of around 416,000 to 1.3
million, or 32 percent of total world capacity.
</P>
<P>
He said that Airbus Industrie predicts a high requirement for
replacement aircraft and, with some airlines expected to replace
current fleets twice over, this market will be equal to the
current fleet size of 1,800.
</P>
<P>
He said that this leaves a requirement for 2,300 additional
aircraft to meet growth, adding that with an existing backlog of
almost 500 aircraft already ordered by Asia-Pacific airlines,
potential sales in the region therefore total some 3,600 aircraft,
valued at 375 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1970, Airbus Industrie is a multi-national
consortium owned by Europe's four leading aerospace manufacturers
and it has grown to become the world's second largest supplier of
large civil aircraft with a product line covering everything from
short haul single aisle market to the ultra-long rang sector.

<HEADLINE> Israel Further Eases Closure on West Bank, Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army today
further eased a total closure imposed on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, allowing more Palestinians to return to their jobs
inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
As of this morning, Palestinians, married and aged over 30,
from the West Bank and Gaza Strip will be permitted to
enter Israel for work, according to an announcement issued by
the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
In addition, visits to Palestinian "security prisoners" will
be renewed, but limited to 300 per day, reads the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israel imposed the total closure on the West
Bank and Gaza Strip immediately after a suicide bombing attack
in a down town coffee shop in Tel Aviv, which left three
women dead and over 50 injured.
</P>
<P>
The closure has barred tens of thousands of Palestinians
from returning to their jobs inside Israel, and from traveling
between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and
army chief of staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak decided to ease the
closure, allowing 20,000 Palestinian workers enter into Israel,
</P>
<P>
The permits then was only to be given to married men
over the age of 45.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, the Israeli army allowed Gaza Strip
residents in the West Bank to return to the strip, as well
as West Bank residents in the Gaza Strip to travel home.
</P>
<P>
The army was also letting Palestinians who are married to
Jerusalem residents with Israeli identity cards to enter the
city.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, another 22 Palestinian ambulances were allowed to
enter Israel on an emergency basis, bringing to 36 the
number of ambulances allowed to cross into Israel from the
Palestinian autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army said that one hundred Palestinian laborers
who have jobs in tourist industries were also being let in
Israel, but stressed that all entrance permits are subjected
to strict security clearances.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Villages Undergoing Uurbanization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Booming township and village
enterprises in east China's Shandong Province have turned
grass-roots units into corporations through mergers.
</P>
<P>
Dingjia Village in the city of Laizhou set up the Shandong
Hongxiang Electrical Appliances Group Corporation, which has
gradually become popular, while the its original is no longer in
use.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 villages changes their names owing to annexation
and mergers in the province's east coastal areas over the past few
years. Local residents began to use new names or addresses in
writing letters.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, annexation and mergers are used
as means to overcome unbalanced development of villages.
</P>
<P>
Qiansongjia Village in Shandong's Longkou city, has grown into
the Nanshan Group Corporation from a once poverty-stricken area.
The village established factories of textiles, alumina, and wood,
and badly needed to obtain more land resources and manpower as its
production scale rapidly expanded.
</P>
<P>
The idea of annexation met with immediate support from the
neighboring poor villages and authorities concerned, and three of
the villages have been merged into the group beginning in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The village, once only one sq km in area, now covers 10 sq km,
and its population has more than tripled to 3,700. The
village-turned-group, with 1.2 billion yuan of fixed assets and
20,000 staff and workers, produced annual sales worth of 1.6
billion yuan last year, and was graded a national-level
first-class township enterprise by the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The group built villa-like buildings for newly-merged villagers
and employed them in factories. "We didn't expect such great
changes before annexation. We lost our village's names, but we
make more money, and live a more cultured life," one farmer said.

<HEADLINE> NZ Records Largest Quarterly Price Fall Since 1961 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Prices dropped by 0.3 percent
in the first quarter this year, the biggest quarterly fall since
1961.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by Statistics New Zealand today showed that
the 0.3 percent fall was attributed to lower mortgage and other
retail lending rates, and falling prices for transport, clothes
and footwear.
</P>
<P>
The previous biggest fall in a quarter came in March 1961, when
prices dipped by 0.43 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the yearly basis, Statistics NZ said prices for the year
ending March rose 1.8 percent, lower than most economists
predicted.
</P>
<P>
The main factor pushing prices down was a sharp fall in retail
lending rates.
</P>
<P>
Floating rates for mortgages have now slid to around 9.5
percent, much lower than a year ago, and some economists forecast
they are likely to go down further on the back of today's
inflation news.

<HEADLINE> Two Million Pilgrims Head toward Mena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 15 (Xinhua) -- About two million pilgrims
converged on the holy site of Mena in Saudi Arabia to start the
first Hajj rituals today.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims, 1.2 million from the Arab and Islamic world and
the rest, the Saudis and residents in the Kingdom, would perform
short prayers either at Kheif mosque or stay there in Mena to
spend the whole day, according to Kuwait News Agency (KUNA)
reports from Mecca.
</P>
<P>
After sunrise Wednesday, the pilgrims will ascend to Mount
Arafat for Hajj.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia announced earlier April 16 would be the climax of
Hajj when the pilgrims would march to Mount Arafat. The following
day would be the beginning of Eid Al-Adha, when pilgrims
symbolically stone the devil and slaughter sheep and other
animals.
</P>
<P>
Pilgrims have been arriving in the kingdom for weeks and Saudi
television shows footage every day of pilgrims walking around the
Holy Kaaba in Mecca Grand Mosque.
</P>
<P>
Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz, Custodian of the two holy
mosques, called upon all governmental departments earlier this
month to offer maximum services to help pilgrims perform their
rituals with utmost ease and comfort and in an atmosphere of peace
and security.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi Hajj authorities have intensified their efforts to
ease traffic for pilgrims and secure their needs.
</P>
<P>
Local security and traffic officers and staff took positions
at main centers to ease difficulties facing the two million
pilgrims rushing to the limited area of Mena which they have
to reach before noon, KUNA said.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters and highly sophisticated communication systems were
used to monitor the movement of pilgrims and ease any
bottlenecks hampering the process.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of health centers have been established in various
areas to provide services.
</P>
<P>
High-tech fire extinguishing devices were also employed to
automatically, quickly and forcefully sprinkle water to cap any
fire possible during the Hajj festival.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Raise Water Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- South African Water Affairs
and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal has warned that more water
price increase is on the way following the 12 percent increase in
water tariffs starting from April 1.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to make people cut their use of water is to put
up the cost, and the April increase was part of this process,"
local daily "The Citizen" today quoted Asmal as saying.
</P>
<P>
"South Africa is already experiencing water stress. The
equitable allocation of water and its efficient and beneficial
use will be critical for the sustainable economic and social
development of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is prone to recurring droughts and water
shortages. Although most major dams are full following recent
rains, this has not changed the long-term prognosis, local water
experts said.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure that the water in storage can bridge the droughts
to come, it is imperative to apply water conservation measures on
the continuous basis, of which a sound tariff policy is a key
element," Asmal stressed.

<HEADLINE> Southwest Province Builds Modern Highway Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan province
is pooling efforts to build a modern highway network to upgrade
its outdated transport facilities before the next century.
</P>
<P>
The provincial authorities plan to invest a total of 21 billion
yuan in building highways exclusively for motor vehicles in the
1996-2000 period, more than three times that of the 1991-1995
period.
</P>
<P>
With the investment, Yunnan will have a highway network by 2000
that provides access to the sea on the east via neighboring
Guangxi, connects it with Myanmar on the west, and with Laos and
Thailand on the south, and with neighboring Sichuan and Guizhou
provinces on the north.
</P>
<P>
Underdeveloped transport facilities have been the main factor
impeding Yunnan's economic expansion. With 94 percent of its
394,000-sq-km-territory mountains and hills, and a location far
from the coast and economically developed areas, Yunnan has been
one of the poorest areas in China.
</P>
<P>
The province built its first Grade 2 highway exclusively for
motor vehicles at the end of 1980s. The 120-km road on the
outskirts of Kunming, the provincial capital, increased the speed
for motor vehicles from 40 km per hour to 80 km, after
enlightening local people on the importance of good roads.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan has since built 1,969 km of highways above Grade 2, and
a high-grade highway network has been formed in an area with
Kunming as the center of a radius of 200 km. The high-grade roads,
however, only account for 2.8 percent of Yunnan's total length of
roads.
</P>
<P>
The province is now building more than 400 km of Grade 1
highways, which will increase the speed of motor vehicles to above
120 km per hour.

<HEADLINE> Youth Plant Trees To Earn Pension For Their Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- During the past month young
people in the town of Chaoyang in east China's Anhui province have
been busy planting fruit trees as a means to earn old-age pension
for their parents, according to China Forest News.
</P>
<P>
This year more than 600 hectare of fruit trees have been
planted in Chaoyang located in Lingbi county.
</P>
<P>
"Starting from several years ago, this old-age pension tree
planting effort has brought more pocket money for the old in the
town," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In rural China most old people do not get certain monthly
pensions as do those living in urban areas. The lack of pocket
money often caused family disputes between the aged parents and
their children.
</P>
<P>
Trees, especially fruit trees planting, is usually an important
source of cash for rural Chinese. In China, forest has long been
viewed as a "green bank".

<HEADLINE> Smooth Beijing-Kowloon Railway Traffic Guaranteed Against Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangxi Province
will give top priority in this year's flood prevention to ensure
smooth operation of the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, which runs more
than 720 km throughout.
</P>
<P>
There are several hundred reservoirs along the railway within
the province's boundary, 199 of which pose a threat during flood
seasons to the line.
</P>
<P>
Most of the reservoirs were built in the 1950s and 1960s, with
no consideration for railway's safety taken into account, and now
operate in poor conditions, vulnerable to flood.
</P>
<P>
Primary Party and government officials above township level are
held accountable for designated reservoirs in flood control and
the safety of the railway, which links China's capital with Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
An inspection for hidden perils is going strong at all the
reservoir areas. Some reservoirs are required to operate with
limited storage of water, and some even empty their stored water,
to prepare for potential flood pressure.
</P>
<P>
Localities have increased their contacts with railway
departments to coordinate efforts in flood prevention, while
hydrological and meteorological departments inform railway
stations of potential risks.
</P>
<P>
Materials for flood prevention are being carried to where
necessary, as an anti-flood campaign goes full speed along the
line.

<P>
HUHHOT, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 260 white swans recently
flied to a village in Wunniute Banner, an administrative division
in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, for the fifth
time.
</P>
<P>
The village, in Erjiazi Township, was surrounded by desert some
twenty years ago. In 1986, the local government enhanced their
afforestation efforts when the second phase of the "three north
shelterbelt systems project" was started.
</P>
<P>
The forest coverage in the whole township has now reached 38
percent, and the environment has been significantly improved.
</P>

Apart from the fact that the swans will stay there for about
one month before continuing their trip to the north for the
summer, the township now has become home to over ten species of
wild animals.

<HEADLINE> More Lawns, Better Living Environment For Shanghai's Pudong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Pudong New Area is
making great efforts to beautify its environment through
afforestation in new construction area.
</P>
<P>
Lujiazui Development Company of Pudong New Area, Shanghai, has
taken a loan of 800 million yuan for building a park in the area's
Lujiazui Zone of Finance and Trade.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the 100,000 sq m green land will
be covered by 65,000 sq m ever-green lawns grown with imported
strains dotted with lush green trees. An artificial lake covering
10,000 sq m and a fountain system will be sunk in the middle of
the area.
</P>
<P>
The park is to open to the public on July 1.
</P>
<P>
In building Pudong New Area, Shanghai has worked out
regulations that require planting of greenery surrounding
newly-built residential quarters, production factories, and
institutions. They also stipulate that large public facilities
must not be less than 30 percent of their respective total area of
land covered.
</P>
<P>
The municipal authorities have also set a goal of increasing
its forest cover to 35 percent in Pudong New Area by the early
21st century, with the per capita green land area amounting to 20
sq m.
</P>
<P>
Pudong has also set up a special team to help the enforcement
of the regulations.
</P>
<P>
During the past 17 years of forestation efforts, a total of 18
million ha of desolate area in China has been covered with green
plants, with the forest cover rate in the three areas rising from
five percent in 1977 to the current nine percent, according to
earlier reports.

</P>
<P>
Fujian has built three national development zones, two bonded

township level.
</P>
<P>
Their export value totalled 2.73 billion US dollars last year,

<P>
These development zones have drawn an overseas investment of
4.9 billion US dollars in building 2,256 projects. Some 1,500
firms have started operation so far.
</P>
<P>
These zones have given priority to the development of light
industry, electronic, textile, and food industry. Some hi-tech
companies in Fuxing Rongqiao Development Zone and Fuzhou
Development Zone are in the forefront of the country in production
scale and in the percentage of science and technology played in
production.

<P>
ROME, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) today backed an Italian-led
multinational military operation in Albania to protect humanitarian
relief delivery.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, OSCE
Chairman-in-Office Niels Helveg Petersen said that OSCE will play
a "guiding and liaison role" in both civilian and military
aspects of the mission code-named "Operation Alba (Dawn)."
</P>
<P>
The operation, which was announced to start shortly after
midnight on Monday, was designed to put Albania back on the road
to normality and promote national reconciliation in the Balkan
country, Dini said.
</P>
<P>
Albania, ravaged by unrest and violence in recent months, needs
assistance from the international community, especially with the

forces, Dini said.
</P>
<P>
Petersen, who is the Danish foreign minister, also confirmed
the dispatch of Danish soldiers for the operation.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to give the size of the Danish contingent
because it needs to be approved by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Italy has pledged to contribute the largest contingent of 2,500
troops to the multinational force. Apart from Italy and Denmark,
the other countries which will take part in the operation are
France, Spain, Turkey, Greece, Romania and Austria.
</P>
<P>
The advance parties from Italy and France have already been
deployed in Albania to prepare for the arrival of the main
contingents.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 soldiers from Italy, France and Spain were set
to land at the Albanian port of Durres early on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
In Athens, Greek military sources said that the first units of
the 760-strong Greek contingent are expected to travel to Vlore by
sea on Thursday to be followed by the rest to fly to Tirana on

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Congress party leadership
decided on Monday night to restore support to the 13-party United
Front (UF) for the formation of a new government, the Hindustan
Times said today.
</P>
<P>
The party, at a meeting of its supreme decision making body,
the Congress Working Committee (CWC), also decided to withdraw its
claim to form a government before the president as soon as the
front elected a new leader to replace caretaker prime minister H.
D. Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party formally staked the claim soon after it
withdrew its support to the 10-month-old UF government on March
30.
</P>
<P>
The CWC made it clear that it was opposed to a mid-term poll
and the party would not stake its claim to form a government
provided the UF changed its leader.
</P>
<P>
The CWC, which met for two-and-a-half hours late Monday night,
authorized party president Sitaram Kesri to constitute a team to
talk to the UF to sort out all irritants after the front elected
its new leader.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deve Gowda confirmed on Monday that he had
offered to resign from the UF parliamentary group leadership to
pave the way for a new arrangement between the UF and the Congress
party.
</P>
<P>
The UF is expected to elect a successor to the prime minister
later this week.
</P>
<P>
The CWC did not specify whether the Congress party will join
the new government or not.

ROME, April 14 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary General

In a statement issued during his visit to Italy, Annan urged

negotiated settlement of the crisis in the African country.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he was concerned that the five-point peace plan
supported by the UN Security Council had not resulted in the
signing of a ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
However, he was encouraged by the fact that Zaire President
Mobuto had started talks with Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"A lasting solution cannot be achieved through force of arms,"
the the secretary general said.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that Zaire is on the brink of a great political

<HEADLINE> Colombian Minister on Peru' Withdrawal From Andean Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Peru's withdrawal from
the Andean Community will not affect the subregional trade bloc
but will prompt its talks with the South American Common Market
(Mercosur), a Colombian minister said today.
</P>
<P>
Peru's departure will not affect in any way the trade
development among the community's other member countries which
are Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, Colombian Foreign
Trade Minister Carlos Ronderos said in a statement to the RCN
radio network.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori announced Friday that
Peru would quit the Andean Group, claiming that the free-trade
bloc is not living up to its mission of creating freer trade in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said generating jobs and improving Peru's productive
capacity were top priorities, and achieving "those important
goals cannot be ensured continuing to work inside the Andean
Group under current conditions."
</P>
<P>
However, Peru's decision came after other members of the trade
bloc refused to allow Lima exemptions from the free-trade
regime. They said Peru has not complied with its commitments in
the Andean Group which recently renamed itself the Andean
Community.
</P>
<P>
Ronderos said that, contrary to what people might think, the
subregional group was completely fortified because there is a
"Bolivarian" union among the four countries that do not have any
differences and will respond positively to the principles of a
free trade area.
</P>
<P>
He believed that it would now be easier to negotiate with the
Mercosur, formed by Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, for
there are clear rules that provide a better environment for
carrying out talks and consolidating a South American Free Trade
Area.
</P>
<P>
From now on, he pointed out, a very interesting phase will
begin for the new Andean Pact whose objective is to fortify
itself completely.

YINCHUAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A World Food Program (WFP)
project is doing well in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region and serves as a model in promoting local agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The project, providing relief with free grain, named "4071",
covers three poor counties in the region, with a planned
investment of 110.47 million yuan-worth of grains. It involves 10
sub-projects in water conservancy, farmland improvement, and
science and technology training.
</P>
<P>
A total of 43.15 million yuan has been put in the project,
which started in 1994. The project areas produced 54 million kg of
grains last year, and had 347 kg per capita, 10 percent higher
than areas that the projects do not cover.
</P>
<P>
The region has set up a special office to supervise the
operation of the project. Nearly 2,000 projects of varying sizes
have been built to ensure water for irrigation, consumption by man
and livestock.
</P>
<P>
Eight thousand ha of hillside fields have been terraced into
farmland, and 3,000 ha planted with trees. Local farmers collected
7.87 million yuan by planting grass and breeding livestock, over
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Agro-sciences like plastic sheeting technique were introduced
into the project areas and are contributing greatly to local
agricultural development. More and more villagers are
participating in training classes.

<HEADLINE> Manila Denies MNLF Men's Massive Defection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military has
dismissed as "mere propaganda" earlier reports that more than
5,000 Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) fighters have joined
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), local press reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Arnulfo Acedera was quoted as
saying Monday that the MILF was likely churning out defection
reports to cover up its thinning ranks.
</P>
<P>
He noted MILF rebels have been surrendering to the military in
the last few months.
</P>
<P>
He also said the armed forces have yet to receive an official
report of MNLF members joining the MILF.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said about 5,000 MNLF fighters have joined the
MILF after being "discouraged" over the slow implementation of the
peace deal struck last September between the MNLF and Manila.
</P>
<P>
With the joining of the MNLF men, the MILF's force has
increased from some 10,000 to 15,000, becoming the largest
anti-government group in the country.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the MNLF, refused to accept
the peace agreement between the MNLF and the government.
</P>
<P>
The MILF began its own peace talks with the government late
last year, but the talks have been stalled due to sporadic
fighting between the MILF guerrillas and the government troops in
the southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Canada Backs Out of China Resolution at UN Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government announced
today that Canada will not co-sponsor a resolution on China's
human rights situation at a meeting of the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"The government has decided, in light of the significant
weakening in consensus on the resolution among its traditional
co-sponsors, that it no longer carries the same weight it has in
past years," said Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, we concluded that Canada could have a
greater influence on the state of human rights in China by
pursuing and intensifying our promising bilateral measures,"
Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
"Through intensified dialogue with the Chinese government,
an agreement was reached on the establishment of a joint
Canada-China human rights committee, which will address all human
rights issues including religious freedom," he added.
</P>
<P>
The commitment also included a wider array of projects on legal
reform and institution building, such as Canadian assistance to
develop a legal aid system. It included more training of Chinese
judges, work towards implementation of China's obligations under
the United Nations Convention on Torture, and co-operative work on
minority affairs, the release said.
</P>
<P>
"Agreement with China on this package of bilateral co-operation
is an important development in our relations," the minister
added.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Follow-ups to Human Rights Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Alternate Representative of the
Chinese delegation Li Baodong said today that a lot of follow-up
work remains to be done although the international community has
made great efforts since the World Conference on Human Rights in
1993.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd session of the United Nations Commission
on Human Rights, Li said, "At present, how to further put into
practice the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action, and to pave
the way for the smooth follow-up to the World Conference has
become a priority facing the international community as well as
this commission."
</P>
<P>
Li said that any attempt to misinterpret the Vienna Declaration
and Program of Action, either by quoting a section out of context,
or stressing certain section at the expense of the other, should
be prevented.
</P>
<P>
Certain countries emphasize only civil and political rights and
neglect economic, social and cultural rights; They play down
development while talking about democracy and human rights. They
set their minds merely on the universality of human rights, paying
little attention to the national, regional, historical and
cultural particularities, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
This line of action is obviously not conducive to the follow-up
to the conference, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is stated in the Vienna Declaration and Program of
Action that democracy, development and respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We in China have learned from our own experience of reform and
opening-up that only by concentrating our efforts on economic
development under the precondition of national and social
stability, while sparing no efforts in the building-up of
democracy and legal system, will a country like ours be able to
achieve steady progress and full enjoyment of all human rights by
its people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Any lopsided emphases of one factor while neglecting another,
or any development strategy or democracy model copied blindly in
disregard of one's own national conditions are bound to bring
about adverse effects to the full enjoyment of various human
rights and fundamental freedoms by the people, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Li called for dialogues and cooperation in the international
field of human rights on the basis of equality and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
At the 51st session of the UN General Assembly, the resolution
entitled Enhancement of International Cooperation in the Field of
Human Rights was adopted by an overwhelming majority of votes, Li
recalled.
</P>
<P>
"This is a clear indication of developing countries' strong
demand to replace confrontation by dialogue and cooperation on
human rights issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some Western countries pay lip service when they say that they
are not in favor of confrontation and what they are doing have
time and again deviated from the spirit of cooperation embodied in
the Vienna Declaration, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li urged the countries concerned to positively respond to the
demand of the developing countries for cooperation, dialogue and
consensus and give up their erroneous approach of confrontation in
the human rights field to join the developing countries for
progress in the international protection of human rights.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (23-24) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (23-24)
in a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: How will residents of the Hong Kong SAR participate
in the administration of state affairs?
</P>
<P>
Answer: After China resumes its exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong, Chinese citizens among Hong Kong residents will become
masters of the country and enjoy the basic rights and freedoms
that citizens of a sovereign state are entitled to.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Article 21 of the Basic Law stipulates,
"Chinese citizens who are residents of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region shall be entitled to participate in the
management of state affairs according to law. In accordance with
the assigned number of seats and the selection method specified by
the National People's Congress, Chinese citizens among residents
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall locally elect
deputies of the Region to the National People's Congress to
participate in the work of the highest organ of state power."
</P>
<P>
Question: Will it be convenient for people bearing passports of
the Hong Kong SAR to travel outside the region?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Hong Kong people have a fast pace of life. Travelling
is a favourite holiday activity for many of them. Because of Hong
Kong's special status, people there have long enjoyed the freedom
to travel.
</P>
<P>
In the light of realities in Hong Kong, the Basic Law
stipulates that, after 1997, Hong Kong people, whether they were
born before or after 1997, be issued passports of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region of China. With this passport, a Hong
Kong resident can conveniently go to various countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
As a free port and a financial and trade center, and as a
bridge between China's inland areas and the rest of the world,
Hong Kong has a special place in the world.
</P>
<P>
Foreign countries and regions, out of concern for their own
interests, will naturally recognize the passports of the Hong Kong
SAR and provide convenience for holders of such passports.
</P>
<P>
According to Article 155 of the Basic Law, the central
government will assist or authorize the Hong Kong SAR government
to conclude visa abolition agreements with foreign states or
regions.

<HEADLINE> Economic News of The Mercosur (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Uruguay's Chamber of Industries (CIU, its
acronym in Spanish) demanded last Thursday greater coordination
between Mercosur ministers to prevent the application of
measures such as the import restrictions imposed by Brazil.
</P>
<P>
He requested that a Mercosur Intra-ministerial Council be
formed so there will be greater coordination of macroeconomic
policies.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, the CIU also announced an upcoming
meeting of the Mercosur Industrial Council (CIM, its acronym in
Spanish) in which the presidents of the four industrial
associations of that trade bloc will sign the statement proposed
by the CIU to reject the Brazil's measures.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- On April 9 the Argentine government renewed
its intention to resolve its trade dispute with Brazil by
proposing a harmonious financing system for imports.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's Industry Minister Alieto Guadagni said that he
sent a letter to his Brazilian counterpart Francisco Dornelles
recommending the use of a tool approved in 1995 by the
Mercosur Common Market Group (GMC, its acronym in Spanish) that
gives equal and consensual control over financing.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- The Uruguayan senate approved a bill on the
agreement between Uruguay and the Mercosur so that its
Administrative Secretariat will be based in Montevideo.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat was created through a protocol addendum to
the Asunction Treaty over the institutional structure of the
Mercosur, signed in Ouro Preto, Brazil in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Uruguay's aspiration to create a body with
supranational powers that will resolve Mercosur trade disputes
does not have the support of Argentine Presient Carlos Menem.
</P>
<P>
On April 6 the Argentine press published Menem's statements
that "the Mercosur is a tariff union and not a territorial unit
like the one Europe has wanted to be since the beginning of its
integration."
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, there is a much simpler recourse than the
creation of a court, which is my permanent contact with Fernando
Henrique (Cardoso, the Brazilian president), that, up till now,
has had good results," underlined Menem.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- On April 4 Uruguay signed the Protocol for
the Solution of Disputes of the Latin American Integration
Association (ALADI, its acronym in Spanish) through which its
can enjoy the preferential treatment of Brazil's new credit
regulations on imports.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay's ratification (the only one missing of the ALADI
countries), confirms that this protocol will be able to become
effective on May 4 as part of the agreement on reciprocal credits
and payments.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the protocol will enable that, as in the case of
the other members of the Mercosur, Uruguay will benefit from the
exemptions to the credit regulations on Brazilian imports.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- If Brazil "does not understand that it is a
member of a real common market," Uruguay "will have to seek other
kinds of solutions, such as the Free Trade Area of the Americas
(FTAA) or any other open market relation," said Daniel
Soloducho, president of the Uruguayan Exporters Union (UEU) last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He aruged the need to seek other markets outside of the
region so that Uruguay's foreign trade will not have to depend on
the vicissitudes of Argentina and Brazil's economies.
</P>
<P>
"Uruguay should be as open as possible to the world," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Uruguayan Economy Minister Luis Mosca confirmed
last Friday that he agreed wtih his Brazilian counterpart
Pedro Malan on the application of a permanent bilateral mechanism
of consultation and coordination that will complement the one
already existing in the Mercosur at the level of economy ministers
and central bank presidents.
</P>
<P>
Mosca expressed his confidence that the meeting on a
multilateral mechanism to be held in Asuncion, Paraguay this April
23 will lead to a solution of the restrictive measures imposed by
Brazil on goods and products imported from its Mercosur partners.

<HEADLINE> Multinational Force to Land in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 14 (Xinhua) -- A 1,000-strong multinational force
will land at the Albanian port of Durres after midnight tonight to
protect humanitarian aid supplies to this Balkan country, Italian
Chief of Defense Staff Admiral Guido Venturoni said today.
</P>
<P>
The Italian-led force comprising Italian, French and Spanish
troops will carry out a mission code-named "Operation Alba,"
Venturoni told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
But he did not reveal the precise time for the start of the
landing.
</P>
<P>
The operation will allow food supplies to be sent in and safely
stockpiled in the country and make a limited distribution possible.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, Venturoni said, a group of 150 Italian
soldiers will fly to Tirana airport to join the advance party
which was deployed Friday.
</P>
<P>
The first 10 days of the operation will focus on securing
bridgeheads at Durres, Tirana airport and Vlore, the admiral said.
</P>
<P>
The force will build up to its maximum of some 6,000 troops in
three months when contingents from Turkey, Greece, Denmark,
Romania and Austria come to join it, he said.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the force is Italian general Luciano Forlani
and the headquarters for the force will be set up in Tirana,
capital of Albania.

<HEADLINE> NZ Tries to Repair Ties with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- It is still not clear today
whether Iran will go ahead with its ban on trade with New Zealand
after the meeting between the NZ Foreign Minister and the Iranian
Ambassador here last night.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Don McKinnon held emergency talks with Iranian
Ambassador Mehdi Sazegara last night in an effort to avert a
diplomatic rift which threatens trade between the two countries.
McKinnon said this morning he hopes the trade crisis with Iran
could be solved this week.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has ordered the suspension of all trade
agreements with NZ because of NZ's support for a German court
ruling that top Iranian officials had been involved in the murder
of four dissidents in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
NZ has recalled its Ambassador from Tehran and Sazegara had
been withdrawn by his government and was to leave NZ today.
</P>
<P>
But last night, Sazegara said he might not leave after all and
was seeking advice from his government. He also said that he had
not received any formal advice from Iran of a trade ban.
</P>
<P>
NZ exports to Iran amount to 170 million dollars (120 million
US dollars) last year, mainly meat, butter, wool and fish. NZ
exporters said that they are not worried about Iran's trade ban
because the amounts exported to the country are not very big.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Help Restore Stability in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States will take
measures to help restore stability in disaster-stricken Albania, a
U.S. official has said in Macedonia's capital city of Skoplje.
</P>
<P>
John Kornblum, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for
European and Canadian affairs, made the remarks at a press
conference on Sunday after meeting with Macedonian President Kiro
Gligorov, and Foreign Minister Ljubomir Frckovski.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not think the crisis in Albania would expand to
other countries, the Macedonian press center reported.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a lasting peace in southeast Europe, however, it was
necessary to maintain stability and prosperity in the region, in
particular, in Albania, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the U.S. would make efforts to help the United
Nations Protective Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) remain in the
Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
The collapse of pyramid savings schemes in Albania sparked
massive protests early this year, which turned into armed revolt
in early March. More than 150 people have been killed in the
violence.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, US to Make Compromise on Pork Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A compromise agreement is being
worked out on the United States' complaint against Philippine
market access commitments under the World Trade Organization, the
local newspaper Business World reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview with the newspaper, Agriculture
Assistant Secretary Marinela Castillo said the compromise accord
was raised during bilateral talks held in Manila early this month.
</P>
<P>
He said the accord will be discussed further and finalized in
the Geneva meeting this month. But he declined to give details of
the compromise agreement.
</P>
<P>
The trade dispute arose from a U.S. complaint alleging Manila
has been reneging on its commitment to allow a specified volume of
pork and poultry products imports at preferential tariff rates.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials criticized Manila's system of assigning the bulk
of pork import allocations to local pork producers who are not
expected to prefer importing a product that would directly compete
with their own.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has already filed an official complaint
with the dispute settlement body of the WTO in Geneva. Prior to
formal hearings by the body, however, the two parties are given
time to settle the matter out of court.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Mercosur and European Union
entrepreneurs get together.
</P>
<P>
MONETVIDEO -- Representatives of more than 500 companies from
the Southern Common Market (Mercosur, its acronym in Spanish)
and the European Union (EU) will gather in this city this
December 4 and 5 for the first "European Union-Mercosur
Partnership" forum.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti
recently announced that the gathering will promote the exchange of
products and technologies and services through joint investments,
cooperation agreements, transfers of technology, and manufacturing
licences, etc.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Negotiations for a free trade area between the
Mercosur and the EU will begin in 1999, announced Uruguayan
Foreign Minister Alvaro Ramos on returning to the country last
Friday after attending the VII ministerial meeting between the
Rio Group and the EU in Noordwijk, Holland.
</P>
<P>
He said that 1997 will be the year in which a diagnosis of
the initial situation of both trade blocs can be completed on
three issues: the sale of goods, the sale of services and
commercial disciplines.
</P>
<P>
Once a diagnosis has been completed, they will tackle
negotiating positions in 1998.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- The Mercosur has achieved notable success in
expanding its trade and investments with its partners but must
still overcome serious challenges, says a report by the Institute
for the Integration of Latin America and the Caribbean (INTAL,
its acronym in Spanish), an independent body of the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
</P>
<P>
Intal economists stated that the Mercosur "is the most
successful example of integration in Latin America and a model
of open regionalism."
</P>
<P>
The report points out that the common market stimulates the
flow of private investment among its member countries, a
phenomenon that he described as mostly absent in previous
integration attempts.
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Hungarian President Arpad Gonzo recently
emphasized here the need to increase bilateral trade with
Argentina as a springboard for greater exchanges between that
European nation and the Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
During his official visit to Argentina, Gonzo underlined his
country's interest in reaching the Mercosur and stressed that
Hungary has a strategic geographical location since it is the
gateway to eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Spanish President Jose Maria Aznar will pay an
official visit to Brazil between April 16-19 which will have an
economic and entrepreneurial focus.
</P>
<P>
On April 20, Aznar will travel to Argentina to continue his
tour and will remain there until April 22.
</P>
<P>
Aznar's tour through the two countries reflects Spain's and
the Euorpean Union's keen interest in the Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- The mayors of the capital cities of Mercosur
member countries will meet in this city on April 18 and 19.
</P>
<P>
At the meetings they will analyze the juridical-budgetary
relations between capital cities and central governemnts.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the municipal leaders will sign the
"Declaration of Brasilia" at the end of their meeting.
</P>
<P>
ASUNCION -- Paraguay called an urgent meeting of economy
ministers and central bank presidents of the Mercosur for April
23 to discuss the trade restrictions adopted by Brazil,
Paraguayan Finance Minister Miguel Maidana said recently.
</P>
<P>
He explained that different issues will be dealt with at the
meeting with emphasis on Brazil's import restrictions.
</P>
<P>
He said that they have already notified Brazilian Economy
Minister Pedro Malan of the meeting. Malan said he "understood
our situation but asked us for detailed analytical studies before
taking any measures," added Maidana. (to be continued)

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Support UN Session on Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of
developing countries today reiterated their support for the
convening of an emergency special session of the General Assembly
so as to save the peace process in the Middle East and stop
Israeli construction in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable
Rights of the Palestinian People, Permanent Observer for Palestine
Nasser al-Kidwa said that the serious situation in the Meddle East
had resulted from the actions of Israel, especially the plans for
its illegal settlement in Jabal Abu Ghneim, as well as its illegal
activities in general in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
The new Israeli settlement, located to the south of east
Jerusalem, was designed to bring in 25,000 Israeli settlers. It
would isolate the Arab neighborhoods and the holy city from the
rest of the West Bank, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is continuously deteriorating. The peace process
is in danger and that constitutes a threat to international peace
and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
As other efforts to stop construction had failed because of
vetoes cast by the United States at the Security Council, al-Kidwa
said, there remained one resort -- to call for a special emergency
session of the General Assembly to recommend necessary and
appropriate means to end Israel's illegal actions and save the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Iabra Deguene Ka of Senegal, chairman of the committee, was
committed to doing everything possible to save the peace process
and support it at such a critical phase.
</P>
<P>
Bruno Rodriguez-Parilia of Cuba said that the assembly and all
of its member states were obligated to shoulder specific
responsibilities regarding the situation in Palestine. The General
Assembly should use its powers to ensure compliance with
commitments assumed in the peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qiyue of China said that her country had always supported
the just cause of the Palestinian people. Her delegation had
already sent a letter to the UN secretary-general in support of an
emergency session. She hoped that such a session would be convened
shortly, given the deteriorating situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Marty Muliana Natalegawa of Indonesia said that as chairman of
the Islamic Group, his country had submitted a formal letter
supporting the convening of the session.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of other countries also noted the firm
commitment to Palestine at the recent Non-Aligned Movement meeting
in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Group submitted a request for an emergency special
session of the General Assembly on March 30. Following the action,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent a memo to member states
requesting their views on the request. The convening of such a
session needs 94 positive responses from the 185 UN member states.
So far, the UN Secretariat has received 60 letters supporting the
special session.

<HEADLINE> German Economy Should Model Itself on Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The president of the Federal
Federation of German Industry (BDI) today said that Germany should
learn more from successful foreign countries in conducting
courageous economic reforms to overcome domestic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the world's largest industrial fair opened to the
public today in Hannover, BDI President Hans-Olaf Henkel said that
it was high time for German decision makers to learn from
successful foreign experiences so long as demanded by
globalization.
</P>
<P>
As an example, Henkel mentioned the United States, which had
managed to overcome economic difficulties in the 1970s and
achieved "unequaled employment dynamic" nowadays.
</P>
<P>
Another good model listed by Henkel was Sweden, which had
conducted fundamental reforms of its problematic welfare systems
and had clearly reduced its unemployment over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Many countries had showed "how people can change course through
courageous reforms, he said.
</P>
<P>
Germany is now plagued by a post-war record high of
unemployment and high labor costs which have driven much of
investment out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Fully aware of the urgency of the current situation, political
parties in Bonn however still have great difficulties in agreeing
on what should be done to improve it.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony of the Hannover Fair Sunday
evening, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl described the planned tax
reforms and a promotion of job-creating investment as the most
urgent tasks of his government.
</P>
<P>
But whether such tasks could be fulfilled would heavily depend
on whether a quick compromise could be found during the tax reform
negotiations due to be resumed Tuesday between leaders of the
government and the main opposition Social Democratic Party.

<HEADLINE> National Reconciliation Key to Afghanistan Issue: China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Ambassador Wang Xuexian,
Chinese deputy permanent representative to the United Nations,
said today that national reconciliation is the key to the
Afghanistan question.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Wang noted that the final settlement of the question
depends on the Afghan people themselves. The parties concerned
should show a sincere political will to settle their differences
through peaceful negotiations, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Wang made the remarks at an open debate on the
situation of Afghanistan and the ways to promote a negotiated
settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
He said that the parties concerned should immediately implement
a cease-fire and cease hostilities. "In our view, the attempt to
use military means to settle the conflict only lead to aggravation
of the conflict, plunging the Afghan people into misery
indefinitely."
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Wang also expressed support for the good offices
provided by Secretary-General Kofi Annan and his special envoy and
hoped that the United Nations would continue to play a leading
role in this field.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen countries are scheduled to address the
Security Council on the subject.

<HEADLINE> US Urges Zairian Government, Rebels to Negotiate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States today urged
the Zairian government and rebels to negotiate a solution to their
conflict as rebel leader Laurent Kabila "appears to have momentum"
in his struggle against President Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
"We hope very much that Mr Kabila, the rebel forces, and the
government will agree to continue those negotiations under the
auspices of the United Nations, and we hope those talks will start
again soon," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
As the rebel forces continue extending their offensive, Zaire
"risks falling apart under the strains of this civil war, under
the strain of the humanitarian crisis in the north and of the
political chaos in Kinshasa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Burns said rebel leader Kabila "does not have much of a track
record as a leader of a government," but the United States will
try "to do our very best in influencing him to be an open leader
if he does become the leader."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the White House indicated that the United States
would not support Mobutu as he "is about to become a creature of
history."

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Speaker Blasts Israeli Policy on Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The Middle East peace process
is undergoing a retrogression due to Israel's hardline policy
which has faltered peace talks in the region, Speaker of the
Lebanese National Assembly Nabih Berri said in the Qatari capital
of Doha today.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Doha, Berri also said
that Lebanon firmly opposes the Israeli occupation in south
Lebanon and it will fight until the Israeli troops withdraw from
the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held in Doha today, the Lebanese
speaker, who was on a three-day visit to Qatar, said the peace
process is turning backwards because the Israeli government
rejected the principle of peace.
</P>
<P>
"The Netanyahu government refused to accept the Madrid peace
principles and it also rejected negotiations with Palestinians,
leading the peace process to a great retrogression," Berri said.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians were
suspended after the Israeli government decided in February to
build a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, which
Palestinians want to be the capital of their future state. The
decision soon sparked wide-spread protests violence that have
continued so far.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing to prove that Israel is going forward for a
just peace and we found that after (former Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak) Rabin's assassination, Israel has not been prepared for
the acception of peace in the region," the Lebanese speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist in November of
1995.
</P>
<P>
Asked what his country will do towards Israeli in view of the
Israeli intransigent hardline policy, Berri said that Lebanon will
continue fight Israel until it withdraws all its troops from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We will use two hands, one is U.N. Security Council resolution
425 and another is resistance against Israel's occupation (in
south Lebanon)," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel could not stay in the south part of his
country for too long because most of the Lebanese are against its
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Berri, who arrived in Doha Saturday, held talks with a number of
senior Qatari officials on bilateral ties and the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> UN Mission in Angola to Be Extended, Transformed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 14 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today recommended that the Security Council extend the
mandate of the UN peacekeeping force in Angola until June 30 and
then transform it into an observer mission.
</P>
<P>
The largest UN peacekeeping force, known as the UN Angola
Verification Mission (UNAVEM III), was established by the Security
Council to help implement the 1994 Lusaka Protocol ending the
two-decade civil war. It consists of nearly 5,500 persons now,
compared to over 7,000 during its peak period. Its current mandate
will expire Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He recommended that the United Nations Observer Mission in
Angola be formally established on July 1, though he has not
specified the size of the new mission.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the swearing-in last Friday of a government of
unity and national reconciliation, Annan said, "The developments
of the last two weeks in Angola have been very encouraging. Never
before has the country been so close to the final resolution of
its devastating conflict and to the attainment of lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the sincere hope that rapid progress could be made
in completing the implementation of other aspects of the Lusaka
Protocol in a spirit of cooperation and mutual accommodation.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that the long-awaited meeting between President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi, leader of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), would soon
take place.
</P>
<P>
With establishment of the Government of Unity and National
Reconciliation, the parties should move expeditiously to normalize
state administration throughout the whole country, to complete the
formation of the unified armed forces and national police, as well
as to demobilize the excess UNITA military personnel, Annan noted.

<HEADLINE> Peace Up to Bosnians Themselves, US Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, April 14 (Xinhua) -- Senior U.S. officials today
rejected criticism of not doing enough for building peace in
Bosnia, saying that the responsibility rests on its own people.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how sincere the engagement of the international
community and the United States, building peace is the
responsibility of Bosnians," said John Kornblum, the outgoing
assistant secretary of state for Europe and Canada and also
special US envoy to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum and his successor Robert Gelbard were visiting
Sarajevo as part of their tour of the Balkan countries. Kornblum
made more than 20 trips to Bosnia last year to press the Bosnian
parties into compliance with provisions of the Dayton peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his farewell reception, Kornblum noted that while
progress has been made on implementing the Dayton accords by the
Bosnian sides, "far too much energy is still going into individual
gain and the pursuit of rancor rather than actively working to
build the central institutions of a modern nation."
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the criticism in the Bosnian press and by some
Bosnian officials that the international community has not done
enough to help create a new and functional Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He said, "No amount of political will or resources from the
international community can achieve the tolerance and economic and
political security envisioned by the (Dayton) Peace Agreement."
</P>
<P>
"It is the Bosnians of all backgrounds who have a real
self-interest in showing enough statesmanship and commitment to
work for a peaceful future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gelbard said that the United States has never been so engaged
both politically and financially in the Balkan region and "as
practical capitalists, we expect to see return on this
investment."
</P>
<P>
The return should be in the form of Bosnia's development and
peace, capable of taking their place fully in Europe, contributing
to, instead of detracting from, the stability of the region, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Gelbard also said that the United States and its allies cannot
impose peace and national reconciliation on Bosnia and "ultimately
it is up to the people of Bosnia and Hercegovina to use their
great capacity to fulfill the promises" in the Dayton accords.

WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States will make an
announcement within 24 hours on whether it would provide new food
aid to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the State
Department said today.
</P>
<P>
"The United States is now finishing its internal deliberations
on the issue of whether or not to respond to the augmented appeal
of the World Food Program for a greater level of food assistance
to North Korea, and I would expect within the next 24 hours that I
will have an announcement to make on that issue," State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Burns also revealed that the United States and the DPRK had
agreed to hold talks in New York on May 12-13 on bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, DPRK officials will give response to a U.S.-South
Korean proposal on four-party peace talks at a meeting in New York
with U.S. and South Korean officials.

<HEADLINE> US President Proposes New Code on "Sweatshops" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
proposed a code of conduct today to help improve working
conditions in the U.S. apparel industry.
</P>
<P>
Joined by a task force of human rights groups, unions,
religious leaders and a few clothing manufacturers, Clinton urged
U.S. companies to adhere to the voluntary standards so children
and adults won't have to work long hours for abysmally low pay.
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the code include a guaranteed minimum wage pegged
to existing standards in individual nations, a maximum 60-hour
work week with at least one day off, and an independent monitor of
conditions in overseas factories used by U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
The code also would bar harassment and abuse in the workplace
and prohibit using workers younger than 15. It would allow
participating companies to use a "no sweatshops" label on their
garments.
</P>
<P>
"We support the proposition that businesses are in business to
make a profit," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that in order for the code to succeed, it must
be embraced throughout the apparel industry. "We know sweatshop
labor will not vanish overnight," he said.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Not to Go to Iran for OIC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
will not go to Iran for the forthcoming summit of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) scheduled for December
here, a senior Iraqi diplomat said today.
</P>
<P>
Salah N. Al-Samarmad, Charge D'affaires of the Iraqi embassy,
told Xinhua in an exclusive interview that the Iraqi president
will not come here despite the invitation by Iranian President
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
However, he said one of Iraq's vice-presidents will come here
for the OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
He believed that Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
will go to Baghdad and deliver Rafsanjani's invitation to his
Iraqi counterpart Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Iran formerly planned to send Roads and Transport Minister
Akbar Torkan to Baghdad for the mission, he added, but now
Velayati will go instead because of Thursday's verdict by the
Berlin court ruling that Iranian leaders gave the order for the
killing of four Kurdish opposition leaders in Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The verdict triggered demonstrations against Germany in Iran
over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi diplomat said that the forthcoming visit by the
Iranian foreign minister would indicate the improvement of the
relations between Baghdad and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "the Iranian foreign minister should first
go to Baghdad because the invitation was extended to him two
years ago. His visit will be followed by the trip of the Iraqi
foreign minister."
</P>
<P>
Al-Samarmad admitted that both Iraq and Iran have the
intention to improve their bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
As a goodwill gesture, he added, the Iraqi side will soon
release 64 Iranian prisoners who were captured in southern Iraq
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iran earlier claimed that Iraq still holds more than 15,000
Iranian POWs according to the documents it has. But Iraq repeatedly
rejected the claim.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities said that the remains of 20 Iranian
soldiers killed in the Iranian-Iraqi war from 1980 to 1988 will be
exchanged for the remains of 55 Iraqi soldiers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the desire of the two sides to improve the bilateral
relations, there are several obstacles to block the two countries
to improve their ties, namely: the issue of prisoners of war
(POW), the support of each other's opposition groups, the war
reparations and the return of Iraqi aircraft.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Rallies in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rallied late
today to a 38-month high against the mark and rose sharply in
other dealings after remarks by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
incited a selloff in European currencies.
</P>
<P>
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.7300 marks, the
strongest since February 1994, after Rubin spoke in Washington. It
settled in New York at 1.7298, up from 1.7201 Friday. The dollar
cost 126.20 yen, up from 126.03. The pound cost 1.6210 U.S.
dollars, down from 1.6284 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
During his appearance at a news conference, Rubin said U.S.
support for a strong dollar hasn't changed. But he didn't rule out
intervention to keep the yen from weakening, which is widening
the U.S.-Japan trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
A modest rally in U.S. stock prices, more signs of economic
weakness in Japan and remarks by Japanese officials suggesting
interest rates would remain low also contributed to the dollar's
gain.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Friday: 1.4705
Swiss francs, up from 1.4603; 5.8155 French francs, up from 5.7840;
1,700.75 Italian lire, up from 1,696.25; 1.3992 Canadian dollars,
up from 1.3982.
