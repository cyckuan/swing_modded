CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TAKES LAST-MINUTE ACTION, OR NOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Unified School District officials
found enough support in the Assembly on Thursday to fight off
efforts to impose a state-appointed watchdog over the struggling
district.
</P>
<P>
   The measure became stalled before the Legislature ended its
1999-2000 session in a furious rush of last-minute activity. The
Senate bill would have required the state school superintendent to
name a monitor for the LAUSD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawmakers understood this was an unnecessary complication
because we already have accountability,'' said LAUSD board
President Genethia Hayes. ``We need people to help us push the
truck (of reform), not someone to sit on top with a stopwatch.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, who authored the bill to
try to ensure that the district properly spends its $8.9 billion
budget, wanted the monitor to have the authority to recommend a
breakup of the school district after a three-year audit.
</P>
<P>
   District representatives voiced satisfaction after the bill
stalled, saying time is needed for improvements under new
Superintendent Roy Romer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (defeat) is an important step forward for the district,''
said LAUSD legislative consultant Fabian Nunez. ``This gives a
chance to the new leadership to prove what they can do to create
schools for 65,000 new students in the next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Thursday, a handgun bill was shelved by its author,
Assemblyman Jack Scott, D-Pasadena, after learning the governor
planned to veto it. The measure would have required those
purchasing new handguns to undergo a safety course and background
check as well as applying for a license from the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on conversations with the Governor's Office,'' Scott
said in a prepared statement, ``I reluctantly have become convinced
that my best chance for seeing this bill become law is to pursue it
next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis had indicated that he did not want to approve
any additional gun legislation until a massive gun-control package
he approved last year has been given sufficient time to prove its
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   In other action Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   -- Two bills intended to discourage runaway film production by
Hollywood received final legislative approval and were being sent
to the governor for consideration. Senate Bill 2061 would identify
surplus state properties, such as parkland and warehouses, that
could be rented to filmmakers. Assembly Bill 484 would create a $15
million annual fund to reimburse producers for some costs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Senate Bill 165, requiring local bond measures adhere to the
same accountability rules as state bond measures, received final
Senate approval and was sent to the governor. The bill was drafted
following complaints that a Los Angeles police facilities bond
measure failed to deliver on the promises made to voters.
</P>
<P>
   -- Assembly Bill 1785, adding hate crimes and hate-motivated
incidents to the current standard school crime report form,
received final Senate approval and was forwarded to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   -- Senate Bill 1845, prohibiting polygraph tests as a condition
of employment for most workers and requiring that any tests be
videotaped, was given final approval and sent to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has until Sept. 30 to veto the bills or sign them into
law.

ACCIDENT SLOWS ARMSTRONG, BUT HE'LL RIDE AT OLYMPICS
</HEADLINE>
  By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ ``Very banged up'' but with no major damage found by
doctors, Lance Armstrong, the American who won his second
successive Tour de France this summer, was resting at his home in
Nice Thursday after he was hit by a car during a training ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing broken or serious,'' he reported on his Web
site, www.lancearmstrong.com. He was otherwise unavailable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a helmet on so we're safe there, but I'm off the bike
for two days or so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Osipow, director of operations for Armstrong's U.S. Postal
Service team, confirmed that the rider ``was not hurt seriously''
after the head-on crash on Tuesday. It occurred as Armstrong was
descending a hill in the countryside near Nice with two U.S.
teammates, Tyler Hamilton and Frankie Andreu.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was also knocked down by the car, but, also writing on
the Web, said, ``I made it through relatively unscathed.'' He
scraped an elbow and knee. ``Frankie didn't crash at all,
thankfully,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said the three were on a mountain road, descending
through some hairpin turns, when ``a speeding car appeared out of
nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The car drove straight into Lance, but luckily his bike took
most of the impact,'' he wrote. ``Lance went flying off the bike
and tumbled down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   After Armstrong went to the hospital, the team reported, X-rays
to his back and neck proved negative.
</P>
<P>
   Johan Bruyneel, Armstrong's team director, said: ``There isn't a
concussion. It's important that he completely rests for several
days.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the rider's program for September remains
unchanged. Although Armstrong was scheduled to ride in at least one
more European race, the Grand Prix des Nations, his major goal for
the rest of the year is the time trial championship at the Olympic
Games in Sydney, Australia, this month.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 28, will also ride in the road race there, but has
said he will primarily be assisting another teammate, George
Hincapie.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second notable accident this year for the Tour de
France champion. In May, while he was training in the Pyrenees, his
bicycle hit a pothole on a descent and he went flying over the
handlebars. He was taken to a hospital in Lourdes for tests, which
proved negative. After he skipped a scheduled race and rested at
home, Armstrong returned to action and two months later won the
Tour for the second time.  &QL;

TEACHERS FACE NEW CHALLENGES IN PREPARING FOR SCHOOL YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For some teachers, preparing for back-to-school
Tuesday has meant more than just learning students' names,
absorbing new curriculum and planning the year.
</P>
<P>
   It also means some serious manual labor.
</P>
<P>
   Belinda Gonzales, for example, a second-grade teacher at
Pinewood Avenue Elementary School in the growing Tujunga
neighborhood, was busy this week moving and arranging student
chairs in her classroom, squeezing them in past a stack of 30 boxes
filled with new textbooks and class materials.
</P>
<P>
   And that is just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a lot of material that has to be unboxed,'' she said
with some understatement, as she maneuvered a cartload of blue
plastic chairs into her room.
</P>
<P>
   The school has three custodians, but they were all busy on other
projects like stripping and redoing the floors _ plus Gonzales'
aide quit Wednesday, leaving her to rely on help from a school
volunteer's two children.
</P>
<P>
   As for the intellectual heavy lifting, like reviewing new
materials and getting mentally prepared for the start of school,
she said, ``That's what Labor Day weekend is for.''
</P>
<P>
   This always is a hectic time of year for teachers, a time for
last-minute preparations and staff development, of rearranging
furniture and wondering exactly what kind of students they'll have
to deal with for the next nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them spent at least some of their summer getting ready.
</P>
<P>
   Meg Schaffer, a seventh-grade math teacher at Hale Middle School
in suburban, affluent Woodland Hills, wanted to identify with her
students more, so she spent the summer reading all four Harry
Potter books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the books they argue over,'' she said. ``I want to
see what they're reading. And you know what? They're fun to read.''
</P>
<P>
   While not every teacher will have as much physical work as
Gonzales, many in the primary grades of the Los Angeles Unified
School District will have to rearrange their classrooms because of
a new reading program called Open Court.
</P>
<P>
   The program requires students to make eye contact with the
teacher at all times, and deal directly with the teacher more,
rather than a teacher's aide. That means teachers who had their
classrooms arranged in clusters of desks, where students face each
other, are now rearranging them into a semicircle surrounding the
teacher's desk.
</P>
<P>
   It was once different:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a teacher's aide would say, this is the group I work
with and the teacher has this group. (Now) it's all
teacher-directed,'' said Pinewood Principal Esther Macias.
``Everybody's seats have to be facing the front so they can all be
looking at the teacher. In the past, it wasn't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   For certain other teachers, moving will be a constant chore
throughout this school year.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``rovers,'' some teachers at year-round schools have to
change classrooms every time the track switches.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, that meant Sharon Levine, a teacher at Hart Street
School in middle-class Canoga Park, had to change classrooms every
other month.
</P>
<P>
   She did have movers helping her, she said, but she was never
quite sure when they'd arrive, or whether all her stuff would
survive the move. Plus, it was disruptive to the educational
process to constantly change classes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not roving, it's really good because you get a break
during the year, the kids get a break during the year,'' Levine
said. ``But if you're the rover, it's horrendous.''

WACO WHISTLE-BLOWER IS SAID TO BE FACING INDICTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A federal prosecutor who warned Attorney General
Janet Reno last year that Justice Department officials might have
withheld evidence in the investigation of the standoff with the
Branch Davidians outside Waco, Texas, may soon be indicted by
prosecutors working for the special counsel, John Danforth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People close to the former assistant U.S. attorney in Waco, Bill
Johnston, said Thursday that he had been told by Danforth's office
that he would soon face charges that could include obstruction of
justice and making false statements to federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Johnston nor Danforth could be reached for comment. But
Johnston's lawyer, Michael J. Kennedy of New York, confirmed to The
Dallas Morning News that Johnston was facing indictment. ``This law
office and Mr. Johnston believe that he was unfairly targeted for
his frequent criticism of the U.S. government and for blowing the
whistle on the government's efforts to mislead the public about the
government's use of pyrotechnic devices against the Branch
Davidians,'' Kennedy said in a written statement quoted on the
newspaper's Web site Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Johnston helped reignite controversy over the Waco
standoff when he wrote to Reno. ``I have formed the belief that
facts may have been kept from you _ and quite possibly are being
kept from you even now, by components of the department,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Although he remained on the government payroll for six months
after sending the letter, it effectively ended his career with the
federal government. He resigned in February. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The letter sparked further inquiry into the incident near Waco
that led to the deaths of about 80 people when the Branch Davidian
compound burned on April 19, 1993, and helped convince Reno to
appoint Danforth to reopen the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Danforth issued his preliminary report and found
that there was no evidence of a ``massive conspiracy and cover-up''
after the 51-day siege and that there was no evidence to support
allegations that the military had played an active role in the
incident

FUSAICHI PEGASUS ON TRACK TO WIN ECLIPSE AWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fusaichi Pegasus (remember him?) is scheduled to
fly from Los Angeles to New York on Sunday to prepare for the final
races of his career.
</P>
<P>
   This will be his third visit to New York in 2000. He went to
Aqueduct in April and won the Wood Memorial. After winning the
Kentucky Derby brilliantly and losing the Preakness in a subpar
effort, he went to Belmont Park in June with an eye on the Belmont
Stakes, only to suffer a hoof injury in his stall and miss the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus hasn't competed since then, and he resumed
workouts only last week, recording a pair of 3-furlong works at
Hollywood Park. He is expected to have one prep race at Belmont
before bowing out in the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic at
Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., on Nov. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the anticipation for his return to action is the fact no
other 3-year-old has come along all spring and summer to replace
him as the leader of the division. Fusaichi Pegasus was No. 1 in
his age group in the NTRA media poll as far back as March. He
remains No. 1 this week.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a revolving door at Nos. 2 and 3. Six different
horses have inhabited those slots since May - Red Bullet, Aptitude,
Commendable, More Than Ready, Dixie Union and Unshaded. They and
other pretenders to the 3-year-old championship have taken turns
knocking each other off.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet upset Fusaichi Pegasus in the Preakness, but skipped
the Belmont, finished third in the Dwyer, and is out for the year
with physical ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Other major-race winners were similarly humbled: Commendable won
the Belmont, but ran fourth in the Dwyer to begin a three-race
losing streak. Albert the Great won the Dwyer, but finished seventh
in the Jim Dandy and second in the Travers. Graeme Hall won the Jim
Dandy, then was sidelined with a knee fracture. Captain Steve won
the Swaps at Hollywood Park, then ran second in the Haskell. Dixie
Union won the Haskell, then ran fourth in the Travers.
</P>
<P>
   And so on. The challenger of the moment is Unshaded. He's the
new No. 2 in the rankings following his Travers victory Saturday at
Saratoga. But can he wrest the Eclipse Award for outstanding
3-year-old away from Fusaichi Pegasus?
</P>
<P>
   It gets complicated. At this time of year, the top 3-year-olds
are expected to begin to take on their elders. So if Unshaded wants
to win a race over Fusaichi Pegasus, he may have to beat leading
older horses like Lemon Drop Kid as well.
</P>
<P>
   There remains some skepticism that Fusaichi Pegasus will
actually race again. While he has been away, he was sold by owner
Fusao Sekiguchi to Ashford Stud for a reported $60 million and
scheduled to begin breeding duties in the winter. Surely his health
won't be put at risk if the slightest thing goes wrong in his
training.
</P>
<P>
   But if he does race, it's possible both he and Unshaded will
step up to the 3-year-olds-and-up division and use the 1-mile
Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont on Oct. 14 as a prep for the 1-mile
Breeders' Cup Classic. Unless Fusaichi Pegasus uses the 1-mile
Jerome Handicap against 3-year-olds at Belmont on Sept. 23 as his
stepping stone instead.
</P>
<P>
   Unshaded will have to meet and beat Fusaichi Pegasus in one of
those races to have any shot at the 3-year-old title.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus will win the title if he captures the Gold Cup
or the Breeders' Cup Classic. Or, the way this year has gone, even
if he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Classic recap: Skimming's victory over Tiznow in the $1
million Pacific Classic was the most exciting possible outcome for
Del Mar's marquee race. Skimming is an up-and-comer with an
aggressive front-running style, and Tiznow is a promising
3-year-old with the added intrigue of being Budroyale's full
brother.
</P>
<P>
   But how strong was the race? The exacta horses outran
third-place Ecton Park and fourth-place General Challenge, neither
at his Grade I-winning best. And although Skimming put up fast
fractions, he might have been carried by the Del Mar surface's
apparent affinity for pacesetters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Skimming's 1-mile clocking of 2:01 1/5 was the slowest in the
Pacific Classic's 10 runnings, but it earned a 117 Beyer speed
figure because the track wasn't playing all that fast. That's the
fourth highest Beyer figure of the year in races of more than 1
mile. Tiznow's 114 is third fastest among 3-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed signals will have to be sorted out when Skimming faces
sharper horses with more early speed on a more representative
track. He is pointing for the Oct. 15 Goodwood Handicap at Santa
Anita.
</P>
<P>
   More Pacific Classic fallout:
</P>
<P>
   --General Challenge's season appears to be over after he came
out of the race with swelling in his right foreleg. This was his
third defeat in a row since his Santa Anita Handicap victory. He'll
be sent to owners John and Betty Mabee's Golden Eagle Farm in San
Diego County for R&AMP;R.
</P>
<P>
   --Bobby Frankel's victories on consecutive weekends in the
Arlington Million (Chester House) and Pacific Classic lifted him
over Bob Baffert and into the national earnings lead.
Frankel-trained horses have earned $7.2 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day weekend: Del Mar's full stakes schedule for the long
weekend includes Saturday's Del Mar Debutante for 2-year-old
fillies (with Notable Career going for her third straight victory)
and Sunday's Del Mar Breeders' Cup Handicap (headed by Prime
Timber).
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga marks the end of its season Monday with Perfect Sting
running in the Diana Handicap.

GOP COMMERCIAL REVISITS MOMENTS THAT HAVE EMBARRASSED GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS ``17'' to ``16'' in lede; DELETES ``Illinois'' from
lede)  
(See also BUSH, DEMS-REACT) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee is to begin running this
30-second commercial, titled ``Really,'' in 16 states starting
Friday. It features some of the most embarrassing aspects of Vice
President Al Gore's career, including his raising money at a
Buddhist temple and his claim to have created the Internet. It is
being shown in Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine,
Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Cold Harbor Films
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The setting is a peach-colored kitchen, with a
small television atop a counter. On the television screen Vice
President Gore is seen speaking, though there is no sound, in the
White House briefing room on the day he said there was ``no
controlling legal authority'' over how he raised money in the 1996
campaign. The screen goes fuzzy and then shows Gore nodding to a
Buddhist monk, who is bowing at him. The screen shows monks in
saffron robes testifying under oath and then shows Gore, a near
smirk on his face, speaking at the Democratic National Convention.
It then shows him in a ``Larry King Live'' interview saying, ``I
took the initiative in creating the Internet.'' The camera returns
to the kitchen. Flashed on the screen is a Web site,
gorewillsayanything.com.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: A female narrator says: ``There's Al Gore,
reinventing himself on television again. Like I'm not going to
notice. Who's he going to be today? The Al Gore who raises campaign
money at a Buddhist temple? Or the one who promises campaign
finance reform? Really. Al Gore, claiming credit for things he
didn't even do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore: ``I took the initiative in creating the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman: ``Yeah, and I invented the remote control, too. Another
round of this, and I'll sell my television.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: The commercial, a compendium of some of Gore's most
embarrassing public moments, uses Gore's own words and pictures of
him to suggest that he has no credibility. The statement that Gore
``raises campaign money at a Buddhist temple'' is technically not
correct because he did not actually ask for money at the temple,
but that point has been lost. The larger question is whether it is
fair to link these events and cast them as Gore's ``reinventing''
himself. Earlier this year, Gore publicly acknowledged that he was
``an imperfect messenger'' on the subject of fixing the campaign
finance system, a point the commercial ignores. He has also said
that he thinks his comment about the Internet was the biggest
mistake of his campaign, although at the time his aides defended
the claim and had various leaders in the high-tech field vouch for
Gore's involvement in legislation that helped pave the way for the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: Perhaps the most striking aspect of the commercial is
the sarcastic tone of the narrator. Analysts say sarcasm is a
dangerous weapon in commercials because if no actual humor is
evident, sarcasm can come across as petty and malicious and turn
off swing voters. The tone may also detract from the message, which
seeks to exploit Gore's vulnerability on the matter of credibility.
The timing of this commercial _ unusually early and coinciding with
the slide of Gov. George W. Bush in the polls _ suggests a certain
desperation by Republicans and an implicit assumption that negative
advertising works. Whether it will prove to be a breakthrough
commercial of some sort remains to be seen, but it is certainly
laying the groundwork for harsher attacks to come, from both sides.

NO CONNECTION SEEN BETWEEN REDUCED LOGGING AND RAMPANT FOREST
FIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Mont.)   (CORRECTS quote in 8th graf) 
By TIMOTHY EGAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There appears to be no link between reduced logging on national
forests over the last decade and the wildfires now raging through
much of the West, a report by a bipartisan research group for
Congress has found.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, heavy logging from earlier years may have
contributed more to the conditions that have made Western forests
ripe for big fires, because more flammable small trees and heavy
brush are often left in the forest after the larger stands of
timber have been taken out, said the report, by the Congressional
Research Service, which does policy analysis for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, leading Republicans in the West, as well as
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, have said that logging reductions
under the Clinton administration have been a contributing cause of
fires that have burned more than 6 million acres this year. Logging
in national forests has been reduced by more than 75 percent since
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Oregon earlier this month, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the Republican presidential nominee, said Clinton
administration policies that restrict logging ``made the forests
more dangerous to fire,'' although he did not blame the fires on
the president.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the years with the most fires over the last two
decades were those in which logging was at record high levels, the
report states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timber harvesting removes the relatively large diameter wood
that can be converted into wood products, but leaves behind the
small material, especially twigs and needles,'' wrote Ross W.
Gorte, author of the report. ``The concentration of these `fine
fuels' on the forest floor increases the rate of spread of
wildfires.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was done at the request of Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,
but it was conducted by the agency that conducts policy analysis
for all of Congress. Some Western Republicans who have linked
Clinton forest policies to the fires say the report is not
conclusive enough to determine future policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It presents a mixed picture,'' said Gov. Marc Racicot, R-Mont.
``This year is the lowest ever for timber harvesting and it could
be the worst fire year in decades.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Next week, the Clinton administration plans to release its
recommendations on how to manage more than 40 million acres which
are considered to be at extreme risk of major wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the congressional report
would not help the argument of either side of a growing political
debate over the fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fires are being used by both the timber industry and
environmentalists,'' said Babbitt. ``One side says increase
logging, the other side says no logging, even thinning. Neither
position is the accurate way to address forest health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said the commercial logging program on national forests
will not play a significant role in the plan presented next week.
The plan will try to restore forest health through controlled burns
and some thinning, and attempt to get people who live in
high-fire-risk forested areas to clear the hazards near their
homes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional report looked at logging and fires for each of
the last twenty years. The two highest years for logging _ 1987 and
1988 _ were two of the highest years for acres burned on national
forest lands. The report does not address this year, when logging
has been at a historic low, and the fires are at near-record highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assertion has been that we're getting more acres burned as
we have reduced the timber harvesting levels,'' said Gorte, author
of the report, in an interview. ``In fact, for the most part, we
were getting fewer acres burned.''
</P>
<P>
   The fires have been at the heart of a clamorous political debate
in the West. On Tuesday, on the day that Vice President Al Gore,
the Democratic presidential nominee, made a campaign stop in
Oregon, a number of groups which favor higher logging took out
full-page ads in the state that blamed the fires on the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say no to Al Gore's big burn,'' was the headline in a
full-page ad which ran Tuesday in the Oregonian, the biggest paper
in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., has been highly critical of Clinton's
timber policies, saying forest neglect and mismanagement have
contributed to the fires. Thursday, after the congressional report
was released, Smith continued to criticize the administration,
though he softened his tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at things on a short term basis, we could concede
some of the points made in this report,'' said Joe Sheffo, a
spokesman for Smith. ``But the fact is we have a cumulative
problem. And the Clinton administration has known about it for
years.''

<P>
   (Phoenix) - One of the myths smashed in the recent foster-care
tug-of-war over Phoenix juvenile AIDS patient Stephanie Ray is the
idea that AIDS means imminent death.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidly emerging medical fact is that acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, though ultimately deadly, is a chronic disease
that, given proper medication and vigilance, can last for decades.
</P>
<P>
   A life, especially a young life, can be planned.
</P>
<P>
   This change in outlook is most visible at Phoenix's only
juvenile AIDS clinic, the Bill Holt Pediatric Infectious Disease
Clinic at Phoenix Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a hospice for the dying, but a place where a longer
life is increasingly presumed.
</P>
<P>
   When clinic patient Onyx Teasley was born a decade ago with
rapid-onset AIDS, his life expectancy was only two to four years.
</P>
<P>
   But now at age 10, Onyx is doing well.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of 60 Valley children, including 14-year-old
Stephanie, treated for HIV or AIDS at the hospital's clinic.
</P>
<P>
   They are in the fortunate first wave of AIDS children who have
lived to see a better medical day. Ten of the 60 kids are older
than 10 and are thriving, thanks to effective medication and
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of the children treated at the HIV clinic since
it opened in 1995 were infected at birth.
</P>
<P>
   Although AIDS infection at birth is a growing nightmare around
the world, U.S. medical care has reduced the chances of an AIDS
mother in this country passing the disease to her child to about 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the first five years of the 1990s, more than 800 American
children annually were diagnosed with AIDS. But last year, only 93
children younger than 13 were discovered. Many states have reduced
the incidence to zero.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, however, had as many new AIDS children last year as
larger states such as Texas and California. Among the reasons
health experts give for the high incidence in Arizona are:
relatively greater high-risk sexual activity, failure to routinely
check pregnant women for HIV or AIDS, patients with the disease
immigrating from Mexico, and better efforts to identify those with
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the 13 AIDS-infected children reported in Arizona
last year is only a fraction of what was fearfully predicted a
decade ago, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 13 new cases mean 13 Arizona families thrown into a
living horror, and not everyone survives: Four juvenile funerals
were held this year among the Phoenix clinic's patients.
</P>
<P>
   For the increasing numbers of survivors, lives must be planned
in a society that still treats the disease like a medieval plague.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we try to help enroll (the HIV clinic patients) in
school, we've had Valley schools tell us that they don't see why
they need to go to school; they're dying, aren't they?'' said Dr.
Jan Piatt, medical director of the clinic. ``No, they're not. And
we need a whole philosophy change. These kids need structure and
discipline and an education.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Onyx Teasley was one of 812 children in the United
States newly diagnosed with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his classes, Onyx has a teacher of his own at
Longview Elementary School. This is so he can avoid the normal
germs and viruses of large classrooms, which his fragile immune
system cannot handle. There is every expectation that, in the years
ahead, medical progress will strengthen him so he can lead a more
normal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to live to be 100,'' said Onyx, when asked what he
wants to do with his life.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most difficult challenges is in meeting new kids.
Each time, he must explain his complicated medical condition, not
an easy thing for a 10-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   A normal life is still quite far from what most children at the
HIV clinic experience. Complicated family arrangements and frequent
personal and financial crises are the norm, according to Shawn Cox,
a social worker at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Messy family situations are not unusual, she said. Most families
are not as visible as that of Stephanie Ray, who has defied a
Wisconsin court order to live with a foster family, choosing
instead to remain with relatives in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Families often break up from the strain of the disease, Cox
says. Fathers often aren't around. Caregivers wear out. Most of the
time, the principal caregivers are mothers who themselves have AIDS
and who sometimes die leaving an unplanned family situation.
</P>
<P>
   These mothers often lack the energy and money to care both for
themselves and their child, so they neglect themselves. The daily
struggle, getting here and there, trying to find the rent or
mortgage money, reacting to a bad-sounding cough in the night,
overwhelm many people's ability to plan ahead or think straight.
</P>
<P>
   Some children with AIDS must go to foster care, where some
caregivers may not have the right training or patience to deal with
the disease or the children properly, Cox says.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of foster care, of death, of the truth, or an inability to
understand how to ask for medical care, medical experts say, keeps
some parents from even seeking proper care for their children.
These children are the most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The number of untreated children is unknown. But as the disease
makes its shift from killer to chronic condition, the horror
aspects that strike paralyzing fear into people may fade.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Children's Hospital clinic will soon help conduct a
long-term study of young people with AIDS, following them from
birth to age 24. The study will seek an understanding of the
effects of puberty on the course of the disease, and an explanation
of why AIDS juveniles often do not grow to normal height.
Psychological differences will also be studied.
</P>
<P>
   From her own observations, Piatt finds that older children with
AIDS seem kinder than other children their age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it is an empathetic response made possible by their
own struggles,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Clarke-Steffen, who will direct the study at the clinic,
says the disease now is similar to where pediatric cancer was a
decade ago: no clear cure, but longer lives and lots of hope for a
down-range cure.
</P>
<P>
   In other ways, she says AIDS resembles cystic fibrosis and
diabetes, in that it requires strict regimens and is characterized
by recurrent episodes of serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his overall health, Onyx had 40 sick days last year,
often missing school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with the virulence of the virus, the training of
the people doing the treatment, how good an advocate a parent is,
and close attention to changes in the child - and plain luck,''
Clarke-Steffen said.
</P>
<P>
   A child's will to live is an important factor, too, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke-Steffen also credits the advocacy of parents. Planning,
finding the right research programs, medications and clinical help
make all the difference. The fight is now moving into the schools
as the happy few survivors try to live their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system isn't prepared for us to live as long as we have
lived,'' said Onyx's mother, Melissa Teasley. She now talks to her
son about finishing high school and going on to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do this,'' she said.

JOHN C.A. WATKINS, NEWSPAPER PUBLISHER, DIES AT 87 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, R.I., Ohio, Md., Idaho, Ore., Wash.)   (CORRECTS newspaper name in 3rd graf)  
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John C.A. Watkins, the longest-serving publisher of The
Providence Journal, died Wednesday in Newport Hospital in Rhode
Island. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, a decorated World War II fighter pilot, was publisher
of The Journal for 25 years, from 1954 to 1979, and retired as
chairman of The Providence Journal Co. in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He led the paper's transformation from a 40,000-circulation
daily overshadowed by its afternoon rival, The Evening Bulletin, to
a respected regional newspaper whose circulation peaked at more
than 218,000.
</P>
<P>
   He also pushed the company to expand into other areas, acquiring
two radio stations and a cable television system. In addition to
shepherding the business side of The Providence Journal, he was
known for dispatching page proofs to editors with grammatical
errors or misused words circled in red, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, on Oct. 12, 1912, and
started in journalism in 1934 as a reporter at The Dayton Herald
and Journal in Ohio. A year later he moved to The Sun in Baltimore,
where his reporting assignments included riding aboard Pan American
Airways' Yankee Clipper on the first trans-Atlantic passenger
flight in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins inherited a love of aviation from his father, a military
pilot, and he left The Sun in June 1941 and joined the Army Air
Force. He served as the operations officer for the 325th Fighter
Squadron in the Mediterranean, flying 49 combat missions in P-40
and P-47 fighter planes and surviving at least one crash landing
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   After three of his five brothers were killed in the war, he was
ordered out of combat. His decorations included the Distinguished
Flying Cross and the Air Medal.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins left the military in 1945 as a lieutenant colonel and
joined The Providence Journal as assistant to the publisher. He was
named assistant publisher in 1950, then associate publisher in
1953. A year later, at age 41, he was named publisher.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, he was named Journal Co. president, a post he retained
until 1974. He then became chairman and chief executive. In 1983,
he left the chief executive job, and stepped down as chairman two
years later.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure as publisher, The Journal won a Pulitzer Prize
for investigative reporting in 1974 for a story detailing President
Nixon's small tax payments.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins married Helen Danforth in 1943 and the couple had four
children before divorcing in 1959. In 1960, he married June
Watkins, a former actress, who died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins is survived by two sons, Fanchon M. Burnham of
Washington and Stephen D. of San Francisco; a daughter, Jane P.
Watkins of Ketchum, Idaho; a stepdaughter, Izetta Smith of
Portland, Ore.; and five grandchildren.

DAY AFTER HER FATHER'S OUTBURST, DOKIC COOLLY ADVANCES
</HEADLINE>
  By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Six security guards linked arms and fell into a
phalanx around Jelena Dokic, protecting the Australian teen-ager
against the rush of two Australian television crews and a dozen
international journalists who had just witnessed her crisp 6-1, 6-4
dismissal of Miriam Oremans on Court 4.
</P>
<P>
   Even when a cameraman stumbled to the cement, steamrolled by the
secret service-like escort, Dokic kept walking briskly, her steel
blue eyes staring ahead. They were a one-way mirror only, damming
the tears that fell one day before.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, 17-year-old Dokic watched as her father and coach,
Damir, became enraged once again in public, verbally abusing tennis
officials and staff for the fourth time at a tournament in the last
two years. She cried as security guards removed her stocky, bearded
father off the grounds in a disturbing scene that resulted in his
ejection from the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Although Damir Dokic said Wednesday he would come to the grounds
despite his ban, he did not attempt to enter Thursday, according to
tournament officials. Jelena arrived at the National Tennis Center
alone Thursday morning for practice, and was driven back to her
Manhattan hotel so she could have lunch and receive last-minute
instructions from her father.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother and younger brother did not come to New York, so she
had no family to support during her afternoon match. Yet Dokic
appeared stronger without father, as has been the case following
his pattern of wild public confrontations. She did not flinch, but
efficiently pounded her ground strokes with deep and severe angles,
frustrating Oremans.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes after winning, she used a phone in the players'
lobby to reach her father. ``I tried to call, but I couldn't get
through,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she related her feelings to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely feel relieved,'' Dokic said. ``I think getting
through matches, to be able to play the same way that I do no
matter what happens, it just makes me feel really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Dokic, who advanced to play Francesca Schiavone, a qualifier
from Italy, in the third round, denied that her father's scene and
subsequent absence affected her. Ranked No. 43 in the world and
playing a woman ranked No. 93, Dokic drew a side court with one
small grandstand in the back of the grounds. Although some
cameramen and journalists lined the open side of the court the
entire match, Dokic did not seem to notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't seem to distract me,'' she said. ``That's what the
match today showed. I was there the whole time. It looks like an
easy score line, but every point, I sort of concentrated on what I
had to do and I was there on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Oremans, from the Netherlands, was not surprised that Dokic was
so focused. ``I remember last year in Birmingham, after he had that
incident, she was the same, the next match, focused, her mind on
the game,'' Oremans said. ``I give all the credit to her. It's very
difficult to deal with a father like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Birmingham, England, Damir Dokic was ejected after
shouting during her match, and then picked up by the police when
they found him lying in the road. The next week, at Wimbledon,
Dokic upset Martina Hingis in the first round and advanced to the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   This year at Wimbledon, Damir was ejected after his daughter's
second-round victory. Unaffected, she won three straight matches en
route to her semifinal loss to Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Dokic said Thursday that she would not search for another coach
in the meantime. Coaches from the Saddlebrook Resort in Tampa,
Fla., where she trains (and where her father, mother, Liliana, and
brother, Savo, have purchased a house) were available for her
Thursday, but she did not use them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dokic and her father discussed how she had to attack
Oremans' backhand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think eventually it's something you've got to deal with,''
she said. ``You've got to be able to play yourself. There's nobody
out there that can play for you. I know what I have to work on and
I know what I have to do. It's obviously hard not having anybody
there, but I guess it's something I'm going to have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Dokic said she was grateful for the support she has received
from other players Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Pierce, whose father and former coach, Jim, received a
lifetime ban from the Women's Tennis Association Tour in 1993,
following Pierce's allegations of physical and mental abuse, said
she would be more than willing to counsel Dokic.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did I deal with my situation?'' said Pierce, 25. ``I kind
of forgot about it, you know, it's been just a long time. I kind of
put it behind me. I have no regrets of my past. You know, I think
that's part of me, and that's part of what got me to where I am
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport was saddened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' she said. ``This has happened a number of
times. It's probably time that he is reprimanded. You can't really
treat people like that. We've worked so hard to get such positive
story lines in women's tennis. Hopefully, it's just a little side
note and people will forget about it and she'll be able to go on
and play. I think she has it pretty rough.''

Olympians wowed by Tomjanovich
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   LAHAINA, Hawaii _ It began in a room that was as laid-back as
the swaying palm trees lining the beach, as loose as a hula
dancer's hips. But it smoked and it smoldered and it grew into
something as large and powerful and fiery as the volcanoes that
formed these islands.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a speech so much as a testimonial. Not politically
motivated but emotionally generated by the feelings and memories
that still churn inside the grown-up kid from Hamtramck, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only get one chance to make a first impression,'' Rudy
Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   And Rudy T hit nothing but net in his opening remarks to Dream
Team 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won them over right there,'' said Rockets assistant coach
Mike Wells. ``When he finished talking, I think they would have run
through the wall for him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a tricky circumstance, this Dream Team coaching gig. On
the surface, the most difficult decision would seem to be whether
to hit a driver or 3-wood off the tee in the daily round of
post-practice golf at a tropical resort.
</P>
<P>
   But for the entire experience to be more meaningful, truly
memorable, there has to be a deeper motivation than simply
slam-dunking on another Angolan en route to the gold medal and more
sneaker endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor, of course, to represent your country in
anything at any time,'' Tomjanovich said. ``And as a professional,
you have a responsibility to do a job to the best of your ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in our case, I think there is an added burden. As a team
of the best players from the best league in the world, we represent
the game itself. We are basketball. The rest of the world looks to
us as a standard, and it's up to us to keep the bar high.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the initial reaction of the outside world is to label
this bunch as Dream Team Lite. No Magic, Bird and Jordan, now
retired, and no Shaq, Kobe or Tim Duncan, all of whom took a pass
on Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   But Rudy T will not let them feel less than worthy or capable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most important part of the message Rudy gave
them,'' said Quinn Buckner, former NCAA champ, former NBA champ,
Olympic gold medalist at Montreal in 1976 and now a vice president
of USA Basketball. ``From the older guys on the team like Steve
Smith and Gary Payton and Alonzo Mourning to the younger guys like
Ray Allen and Shareef Abdur-Rahim, he let them know it was his
privilege to be their coach and their privilege to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, coach (Bob) Knight could get us going with some
of the things he said at Indiana. But I never heard anything like
Rudy. I haven't played competitively in 15 years, and I was ready
to put on a uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me goose bumps on my arms,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave us respect and a challenge to show the world,'' Payton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll swim to Australia for him,'' Kevin Garnett said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the U.S. team practically did the backstroke in
a 99-70 win over Canada in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Rudy T's intention to play the role of the Gipper or
deliver an address like Lincoln at Gettysburg. He simply began
talking, and it all started to come together in bits and pieces,
from his distant past to beliefs he clings to today. It was a
personal acknowledgment of his past and his present and all of the
factors _ hard work, talent, luck _ that have brought him to this
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still the guy who grew up in Hamtramck and probably would
have worked in a factory all my life if it weren't for this game,''
he said. ``I can remember watching TV as a kid and seeing those
guys standing on the podium at the Olympics, getting gold medals
and hearing the national anthem playing and dreaming that it could
be me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm living that dream. I know plenty of other players,
other coaches who work as hard as I do and haven't been given the
things I have, the championships, the recognition.
</P>

   ``Now I'm the coach of the U.S. Olympic team. Am I the most
deserving guy? I don't know. But I have the chance, and I want to
do it the best way I can for my country.''

<P>
   Some in the room never had met Tomjanovich, so they were
unfamiliar with his croaking voice and thought maybe it always
cracked like that. Then they saw him pause and search for words,
heard them catch in the back of his throat. This was coming from
deep inside.

<P>
   ``You know, it's too bad we have a salary cap in the NBA,'' said
Rockets trainer Keith Jones. ``Because after them being around Rudy
and seeing what he's about, I think we could take 10 of these guys
back to play with us in Houston. Heck, I've got six of them in my
pocket now, and we've only been here a week.''

AS JET FALTERS,   PILOT   STEERS   TOWARD OCEAN   AND BAILS OUT
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A jet fighter that conked out on a routine training mission was
ditched into the ocean off Atlantic City Thursday afternoon by a
pilot who ejected safely. The pilot, whose name was not immediately
released, parachuted into rough seas and was picked up by a state
police boat as crowds of beachgoers, lifeguards and Boardwalk
strollers watched the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Military authorities said Thursday night that the pilot,
realizing that his faltering jet could not reach its base west of
Atlantic City and that he would have to bail out, headed back out
to sea to avoid a crash on land that might have taken a heavy toll
in life and property.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot was praised by his superiors at a news conference
Thursday night. ``He wanted to reduce the risk to people,'' said
Lt. Col. Mike Cosby, operations group commander of the 177th
Fighter Wing of the New Jersey Air National Guard. ``To his credit,
his decision was based on avoiding collateral damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Cosby and other officials said the jet, an $18 million F-16C
Falcon interceptor that carried no armaments, had taken off with
three other fighters for training exercises over the Atlantic. On
the way back to base at Atlantic City International Airport, in
Pomona, he said, the jet's oil pressure dropped and the engine
began to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Four miles from base, he said, the pilot turned around and
headed seaward. He barely made it. Passing over the Boardwalk and
beaches of Atlantic City, the plane lost power. The plane was about
2,000 feet up and traveling at 140 knots, the colonel said, when
the pilot blew his canopy off and ejected.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning drama for hundreds of spectators on the
beaches, jetties and Boardwalk. They told of jets thundering
overhead, of sudden flames from the tail of one aircraft and of a
flier bailing out and floating down into Absecon Inlet at the north
end of Atlantic City, while his plane plunged into the sea a mile
and a half offshore at 3:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, who inflated a raft, was in the water 10 to 15
minutes, bobbing in five-foot swells, before a state police patrol
boat from Atlantic City drew up and Troopers Thomas Sost, John
Schreiner and Dean Rocap pulled him in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sitting there in his raft, smiling from here to here,''
Trooper Sost recalled. ``It was not what we expected to see.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, who was said to have 12 years of flying experience in
F-16 jets, was not seriously injured, officials said, but was taken
to the Atlantic City Medical Center and treated for trauma and
bruises.

VANDERMADE SOLID IN FRESHMAN DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC may have defeated Penn State convincingly, but
there's still suspense regarding a couple of starting positions as
the Trojans take a week off before next week's game against
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman left guard Lenny Vandermade made an impressive debut,
and could push senior Trevor Roberts, who sat out the opener with a
sprained foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trevor will be in a fist fight to get that job back,'' USC
coach Paul Hackett said. ``We've got a battle going on there.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is questionable for the Colorado game, but expects to
play. Hackett said a player will not lose his job to injury but
added that Vandermade has a chance to be a four-year starter.
Vandermade is also the Trojans' back-up center.
</P>
<P>
   The other tight race is at cornerback, where Darrell Rideaux and
Chris Cash remain neck-and-neck for the starting spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so close,'' Hackett said. ``Darrell was a little bit
ahead with experience, so he started the first game, but that could
go either way.''
</P>
<P>
   On punt returns, the Trojans will keep alternating Kareem Kelly
and Kris Richard but also begin working Frank Strong and Kevin
Arbet into the mix when Kelly and Richard need a break.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting mad: A remarkable streak came to an end Thursday, when
the Trojans had their first fights during a practice. Offensive
tackle Brent McCaffrey got into a scuffle with defensive end Sultan
Abdul-Malik, followed by another incident between tight end Doyal
Butler and linebacker Chris Prosser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we want to play a game,'' Hackett said. ``If I had a
choice, we'd play a game and not have a bye.''
</P>
<P>
   Fumble control: While there have been nothing but accolades for
tailback Sultan McCullough's 128-yard performance against Penn
State, Hackett said he was ``concerned'' over a fumble in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had one fumble and one ball that came out on the ground,''
Hackett said. ``I'm of the opinion it's a three-way battle (at
tailback) and is going to be until there is a clear-cut guy.
McCullough has an edge, no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuire returns: Offensive lineman Joe McGuire returned to
practice after missing a day with a strained back, an injury he
suffered in a summer all-star game. ``It's a little sore but I'm
OK,'' McGuire said.
</P>
<P>
   Play of the day: USC's reserves scrimmaged at the end of
practice, with the highlight an 80-yard touchdown pass from
quarterback Matt Cassel of Chatsworth High to wide receiver Sandy
Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital visit: The Trojans will visit patients at several
hospitals today at the USC Health Sciences Campus, including the
USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital, Women's and
Children's Hospital and USC University Hospital.

 LIEBERMAN'S SPEECHES DIVIDE U.S. JEWS  &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senator Joseph Lieberman's folksy mix of campaign rhetoric and
religious speech has revealed a widening rift between secularists
and observant believers in the American Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   The split came to the surface this week when the two national
leaders of the Anti-Defamation League asked the Orthodox Jewish
candidate for vice-president to tone down his stump speech about
God, faith and the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel G. Freedman, the author of ``Jew vs. Jew _ The Struggle
for the Soul of American Jewry,'' said the debate illustrates a
``complex mix of emotions about Lieberman _ feelings of Jewish
pride and the gnashing of teeth about him being too religious.''
</P>
<P>
   In Freedman's view, Lieberman's candidacy shows how the center
of the American Jewish community is shifting away from
secular/cultural Jews and ``towards more religious observance, not
just among the Orthodox, but also among the Reform and Conservative
movements.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other observers note that the American Jewish community
is being pulled into &LR;  two extreme directions.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread intermarriage is causing many Jews to lose touch with
their ethnic and religious heritage _ the ``Seinfeld and schmear''
camp.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many other Jews are reconnecting with
traditional practices such as eating kosher food, joining
synagogues, observing the Sabbath and exploring various forms of
Jewish mysticism.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the three main branches of organized Judaism (the
Orthodox, Reform and Conservative movements) have major
disagreements over homosexuality, the ordination of women and
whether to recognize the offspring of mixed marriages as Jewish
children.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, it's not surprising that the Jewish
response to Lieberman's pious campaign rhetoric has been all over
the map.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, in a campaign appearance in one of Detroit's
largest black churches, Lieberman said Americans must ``reaffirm
our faith and renew the dedication of our nation and ourselves to
God and God's purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Those remarks by the first Jewish vice-presidential candidate in
the nation's history prompted a quick and surprisingly strong
response from the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish group dedicated
to fighting anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   It called such ``overt expressions'' of religious belief on the
campaign trial ``inappropriate and even unsettling.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Doug Kahn, executive director of the Jewish Community
Relations Council in San Francisco, said he has heard similar
concerns this week from other Bay Area Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling by many that it would be better to turn down
the religious volume by several notches,'' Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn said many Jews fear that Lieberman's call could be ``taken
up by those who want to dismantle the wall of separation between
church and state _ even though Sen. Lieberman himself does not want
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a concern that it could make our work harder when
trying to deal with issues like prayer in public schools,'' Kahn
said. ``It muddies the waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedman disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religious language has always been a part of our political
discourse,'' he said. ``It's a long way from a candidate speaking
religious language to the state imposing religion on people.''
</P>
<P>
   By talking about their faith, Freedman said, centrist Democrats
like Lieberman are showing that ``religious language is not the
property of the Religious Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Some see another lesson behind the diverse Jewish reaction to
Lieberman's unapologetic discussion of his Orthodox Jewish faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Jews made the bet that to be accepted they couldn't
be too Jewish,'' said Rabbi Alan Lew, the spiritual leader of
Congregation Beth Sholom in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's galling to these people to see that the Jew who is
finally nominated to national office wasn't someone who'd given up
his Judaism,'' he said. ``That threatens people who feel
uncomfortable about being Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lew is not impressed with the level of the
religious rhetoric coming from all the major candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using their religion to condemn and distance
themselves from President Clinton sexual indiscretions, Lew would
like to hear the candidates discuss ``how their religious practice
gives them a sense of connection and responsibility toward
others.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What upsets me is that Lieberman and Gore don't sound that
much different from the way the Religious Right talks about God,''
said Lew. ``Let's talk about homeless people dying in the
streets.''

BILL TO STUDY RACIAL PROFILING AMONG LEGISLATION SENT TO
GOV.  DAVIS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS and LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ After a last minute compromise with Gov. Gray
Davis, the Legislature voted Wednesday to insert California into
the emotionally charged national debate over racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The bill orders legislative analysts to study statistics
voluntarily being collected by some 70 law enforcement agencies
around the state on the ethnicity of persons they detain.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise bill caps a fight between Davis and more liberal
Senate Democrats over determining how widespread is the practice of
police officers and sheriff deputies detaining persons solely
because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling was just one of hundreds of bills lawmakers
zipped through as they raced toward a midnight deadline to complete
their work for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot like college. You have a whole semester but you do
your best work right before finals,'' said Sen. Don Perata,
D-Oakland. ``That's what we're doing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other bills sent to the Democratic governor were
measures to decriminalize abandoning newborns in some cases, spend
$30 million to help clear the way to build two new runways at San
Francisco International Airport, and provide $500 million in aid to
cities and counties which can be used to improve local services
like libraries and recreational programs.
</P>
<P>
   The racial profiling bill was a good example of the frenetic
activity of the final day of the legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   Killed once this week by liberal Senate Democrats, the bill
resurfaced late Wednesday night and was sent to Davis at 8 p.m.
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals in the Legislature had wanted to order all law
enforcement agencies to compile statistics on the persons they
stop. Davis didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Among the jurisdictions collecting data are Alameda County,
Solano County, Hayward, Fremont, Oakland, San Francisco, San Jose
and the California Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill hope the legislative study will show how
often _ if at all _ members of minority groups are being stopped
simply because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, including Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Los Angeles, said the
bill contained no ``meaningful police accountability'' and failed
to expand data collection.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also requires California's police officers and sheriffs
deputies to take ``cultural diversity'' training. And it requires
peace officers take a refresher course.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end of the road but a significant step
forward,'' Murray said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also made California one of the first states to allow
mothers to anonymously abandon newborn babies at hospital emergency
rooms without fear of criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, by Senate GOP Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga,
was approved unanimously, and brought together usual adversaries
such as Planned Parenthood and the National Right to Life Committee
in its support.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a small subsection of our population that leaves kids
to die. This bill is intended to give those mothers another
option,'' Brulte said. Under the bill, mothers _ or someone else
who has legal rights to the child _ could turn in the baby to a
hospital emergency room within 72 hours of birth and would be
immune from criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The child would be given any necessary medical treatment and
then would be turned over to a child welfare agency. The mother or
other legal guardian could return to the agency within 14 days with
positive identification and reclaim the baby.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief proponents of the bill is Debi Faris, a mother
of three from Yucaipa (San Bernardino County), who started the
Garden of Angels in 1996 after hearing on the radio about a baby
boy found on the side the road. She took charge of burying the boy
and two others who were also at the coroner's office awaiting
cremation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also approved a measure spending $30 million to help
buy 19,000 acres of salt ponds in the South Bay owned by the
Cargill Salt Co.
</P>
<P>
   The land purchase is intended to be the environmental mitigation
for filling 1,000 acres of the bay to build two new runways at San
Francisco International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Purchase of the property is estimated at $30 million, with the
federal government kicking in half. Restoring the salt flats to
wetlands is estimated to cost at least another $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling has received mounting national attention this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Seven states, including Rhode Island, have required law
enforcement agencies to collect information on traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, President Clinton ordered federal law officers to
collect data on traffic stops to see if racial profiling occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's bill is supported by Davis who has also pledged $5
million in state grants to police and sheriff departments that want
to gather data on persons they stop.
</P>
<P>
   The governor vetoed a bill last year that would have ordered all
state law enforcement agencies to collect data on traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said it was ``questionable'' whether the
information would halt the practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature also approved another racial profiling bill,
this one on student suspensions. It includes data collection.
</P>
<P>
   The bill _ SB 444 by Sen. Richard Alarcon, D-Los Angeles _
requires school districts to break down suspensions and expulsions
by age, race and gender.
</P>
<P>
   Districts are required to report to their school boards when and
for what reason a student is suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the state's 1,054 school districts now collect
data on the ethnicity of suspended students, said Alarcon. They
are: Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   One bill sent to Davis would give cities, counties and special
districts $212 million they can spend on what they wish.
</P>
<P>
   The money was approved earlier this year in the state budget but
lawmakers struggled for the last two months over how to distribute
it.
</P>
<P>
   A second bill -- by Senate President John Burton, D-San
Francisco -- offers future fiscal relief by capping the amount of
local property tax revenue raked off by the state.
</P>
<P>
   By 2004, the bill would leave $300 million that would have gone
to the state with cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
   The then cash-strapped state began taking $3.4 billion in local
property taxes in 1992 during the height of the recession.
</P>
<P>
   Because the assessed value of local property has increased since
1992, so has the state's take. This year, the state grabs slightly
more than $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's bill would stop the annual increase in the amount of
property tax money the state takes from locals. The cap would be
phased in one-third each year for three years, beginning in the
state's fiscal year beginning July 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The first year cities and counties would receive approximately
$100 milion in new money, $200 million the next year and $300
million the third year.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This limp? Ah, it's nothing.
</P>
<P>
   I was strolling quickly along Market Street, the sidewalk was
hot, and I blew out one of my Firestone-tread  &UR; huaraches  &LR; (Mexican
sandals).
</P>
<P>
   I went down, rolled twice, fortunately crashing into a homeless
guy's cardboard shack. Hope he's got non-homeowner's insurance.
</P>
<P>
   My attorneys contacted Firestone, which is blaming the huarache
maker, and also claiming that my bunions were dangerously
underinflated.
</P>
<P>
   They say excessive speed contributed to the blowout, and I
thanked them profusely.
</P>
<P>
   VIDEO VIGILANTES Snag Serial Squatter.
</P>
<P>
   That's your tabloid headline of the day. Gotta sell papers.
</P>
<P>
   But a true and heartwarming tale it is, of neighborhood
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Juri Commons is a tiny park near Guerrero and 26th. It is
well-used and often abused. One major problem was the Midnight
Pooper.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, in the children's playground area, was a fresh
pile of human stuff. A group of neighborhood folks who try to keep
an eye on the park reported the problem to police.
</P>
<P>
   But the cops could never catch the perp with his pants down.
</P>
<P>
   This went on for about five months, same bad news every morning.
Three child-care groups stopped coming to the Commons.
</P>
<P>
   You should know that these neighborhood activists are not
anti-homeless. They worked hard to get a J.C. Decaux sidewalk potty
installed nearby for the street people. But the park was being
fouled.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one neighbor set up a hidden camera, and six nights in
a row captured on video a man pooping on the pavement and peeing in
the kids' sandbox.
</P>
<P>
   The video was delivered to the police, who immediately made an
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Now the kids are back. Tell me this isn't a movie crying out to
be made.
</P>
<P>
   SANDBOXES, by the way, are passe.
</P>
<P>
   People and cats mistake them for rest rooms. Wine bottles and
needles go there to die.
</P>
<P>
   It's sad, but playground rubber mats are safer and cleaner than
sandboxes.
</P>
<P>
   But it ruins an old joke. This doesn't work: ``I didn't make it
through kindergarten. I flunked rubber mat.''
</P>
<P>
   GAY BOWLERS outed!
</P>
<P>
   I've got tabloid fever, so sue me. (Readers Sue Sensationalistic
Scribe!)
</P>
<P>
   Japantown Bowl is going out of business, and among those being
tossed out of the alleys and into the streets are the city's gay
bowlers.
</P>
<P>
   Six different gay men's leagues bowled at Japantown. I checked
it out last Friday, the final night for the Friday Community Trios
league. Serious bowling. These guys rolled four perfect games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Bowling has the best team names. This league includes the Slo-mo
Homos, Bitch Magnets, Los Reynitos (Little Queens) and Sodomy
Mucho. Come on, folks, it's all in fun!
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, now the boys will have to lug their balls all the way to
Serramonte.
</P>
<P>
   And another bit of the city's character fades away.
</P>
<P>
   JERRY GARCIA impounded!
</P>
<P>
   The city hauled off an anonymously placed statue of the late
leader of the Grateful Dead because the city's art bureaucracy had
been end-arounded.
</P>
<P>
   That was galling to Garcia fans, but (sigh) laws are laws.
</P>
<P>
   So how come the city hasn't confiscated the massive
double-escalator still-life art installation at Hallidie Plaza?
Surely the Arts Commission didn't OK that eyesore.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S UGLY, the local trial where as many as 14 people involved
in public-housing voucher bribes have plea-bargained and could
testify against a high-ranking Housing Authority official.
</P>
<P>
   With all that singing, the trial should be held at the Opera
House.
</P>
<P>
   And which is uglier? The alleged deeds of the ringleader, or the
fact that everyone else will skate off easy after snitching?
</P>
<P>
   A key witness, who casually admits she shook down poor and
desperate people for voucher bribes, brags that she is Willie
Brown's goddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Willie the Godfather. That has a chilling ring to it.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN IRISH ice are tinkling:
</P>
<P>
   Frank McCourt (``Angela's Ashes,'' `` 'Tis'') dropped by the
Buchanan Grill in the Marina. Frank's little brother Michael tends
bar there.
</P>
<P>
   Michael can tell a story or two, too, and folks are always
asking him when  &UR; his  &LR; book is coming out. Michael's reply:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday. And it will expose this nonsense Frank wrote about

a courtroom in Manhattan designated for so-called voluntary
placements into the foster-care system. These children represent
about 10 percent of the children who enter foster care every year.
Many are teen-agers, either delinquents or emotionally troubled
children in need of mental health services. A look at such

Lieberman's remarks cast the issue in terms of separation of church

wasn't looking at me, but I felt the accusation. What kind of

I had never participated in the kitty culture of Grizabella, Old
Deuteronomy and the Rum Tum Tugger? Until a few months ago, when
its closing was first announced, I had never seen ``Cats.'' So sue
me. My defense? A bad one. Call it pride in avoidance, or elitism
selectively applied. Certain popular phenomena so saturate our
culture that for the ordinary purposes of staying current in a
useful, rudimentary way it isn't necessary to see them. I can
whistle ``Memory,'' the treacly anthem of ``Cats'' (under duress),

Maine has always lured artists, among them Winslow Homer, Martin

here and never outlast the topic or the topography. But a weekend

explain why Civil War buffs are so ardent, why veterans of more
recent wars come here as if to communion and why historians,
novelists and filmmakers can't leave Gettysburg alone. By Charles

PENTAGON LIKELY TO POSTPONE NEXT MISSILE DEFENSE TEST UNTIL
JANUARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS ``be'' to 4th graf)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon will probably postpone the next test
of a national missile defense system until January, administration
officials said Thursday. Any decision to deploy the anti-missile
shield now seems certain to pass out of President Clinton's hands
and to his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had previously said Clinton would
decide this summer on deploying a $60 billion anti-missile system
that would be ready by 2005. To meet that schedule, the Pentagon
has been under heavy pressure for two years to conduct enough
flights to show Clinton and his advisers whether the system was
technologically feasible.
</P>
<P>
   But now officials are signaling that Clinton merely plans to
decide whether to move ahead with the program's initial
development. The change follows a string of events that include
test failures, opposition from Russia as well as European allies
and a legal dispute over how far the system could proceed before
violating an important arms control treaty.
</P>
<P>
   To keep that option of initial development open for Clinton, the
Pentagon has requested bids for initial construction of a radar
site in Alaska, setting Sept. 7 as the deadline for technical and
cost proposals from contractors. The first contracts would have to
be awarded by December to permit building to begin next spring and
to have a working system in place by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The more politically volatile decision of whether to field the
system _ and break the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 _
would be left to the next administration, whether that of Al Gore
or George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of this political evolution, senior military officers,
including the program's executive officer, Maj. Gen. Willie Nance
of the Army, have argued that there is now no reason to rush more
tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Nance is not going to conduct a test unless he's fully
confident that everything is fully ready for the test,'' said Lt.
Col. Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is awaiting a recommendation from Defense Secretary
William S. Cohen on the project, and the issue could come to a head
as early as next week. Among the issues that Cohen is weighing are
the costs of building the system, the building schedule and the
need for more tests.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Cohen delayed his recommendation, primarily because
of a dispute between the Pentagon and the State Department over how
far work on the limited missile shield could proceed before the
United States would be required to give notice that it was
withdrawing from the ABM Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has vigorously opposed changing the treaty to allow the
United States to field even a limited defense, fearing that it
would be prelude to a larger system that would undermine Moscow's
long-range nuclear force.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen told the Senate Armed Services Committee in July that
administration lawyers had reached a consensus that building the
radar station on Shemya Island at the western edge of the Aleutians
could continue until 2002 before the United States would be in
violation.
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers at the State Department and National Security
Council oppose that interpretation, arguing that it is unilateral
and sure to anger the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats doubt that the decision from Cohen or the White
House would come next week, saying that the administration would
want to avoid a confrontation over missile defense during a United
Nations gathering of world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen suggested in August that the next test of the system could
slip from October or November, to December. But military officials
said today that date would probably fall into January.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon technical experts are still analyzing why a high-speed
interceptor that was supposed to destroy a dummy warhead on July 7
failed to separate from its booster rocket. Officials have
attributed the cause to an error in the rocket's ``databus'' that
transmits electrical signals to the warhead.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the test range at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall
Islands is closed for much of December, and associates say Nance is
inclined to give his staff a breather after their breakneck pace
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials insist that the testing program has enough
flexibility built in to absorb the delays. But the Defense
Department's top testing official, Phil Coyle, warned top Pentagon
officials in an August 11 report that the system could not reach
its 2005 goal because testing is behind schedule and will not
include realistic decoy targets for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A more aggressive testing program will be necessary to achieve
an effective capability by 2005 or for even several years
thereafter,'' Coyle said in an analysis that was first reported
this week by Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, said Coyle ``is
supposed to be an independent voice, but that does not change our
goal. If directed to do so we're shooting for 2005.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials have warned that the United States could
face a threat from some countries, including North Korea, by that
date.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, though, some Pentagon officials are questioning the
schedule in light of test failures and delays in building a new
booster rocket for the missile interceptors. '
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always admitted that this was a high-risk program, and
part of being high risk is the deployment date,'' the Pentagon's
chief spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said in August. ``We will try our
best, we have been trying our best, and we may meet the deployment
date.''

NORTHRIDGE'S LORIER IS OFF TO QUICK START AT LINEBACKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ben Lorier said Cal State Northridge football
coaches told him to do two things: Play hard and play fast.
</P>
<P>
   He did both. And the freshman earned a starting spot in the
Matadors linebacking corps for the season opener against Air Force
on Saturday in Colorado Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Lorier was listed as a backup to Pieter Keus at weakside
linebacker when fall camp started. It took only a couple of weeks
for him to move into the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock to me,'' Lorier said. ``I didn't think they
were going to redshirt me but I didn't think I was going to get
!ital!that!off! much playing time. I guess it was meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorier, who is 6-foot, 210 pounds, had an outstanding high
school career. He helped Westlake High beat San Luis Obispo to win
the Southern Section Division IV Championship last year, blocking a
field goal attempt late in the title game.
</P>
<P>
   And, apparently, he's made a good transition to college
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very productive,'' linebackers coach Terrance Johnson
said. ``He has a natural instinct for the ball. He's done some good
things. He may be out of position (sometimes) but he'll find a way
back to where he's supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorier might feel some pressure: His first game as a starter
will be against a Division I team and before a crowd that could
reach 52,480.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest game ever was the Southern Section game in high
school,'' Lorier said. ``That was only 8,000 (fans) or so. This is
(52,000). It's a lot bigger than I'm used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who played linebacker for the University of Colorado
from 1986-90, said he'll tell stories about playing in front of big
crowds to ease any anxiety Lorier might have.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't worried that the young player will be overcome by
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finds the ball, diagnoses the play and gets involved,''
Johnson said. ``You can't coach that. He's going to be tested. I
don't think he's seen the speed that will be displayed Saturday,
but once he gets used to it, he'll be fine. As he gets over the awe
he'll be fine. Hopefully, he'll be able to get some sleep Friday
night.''
</P>
<P>
   If he gets any sleep, he'll probably be dreaming of Air Force's
option.
</P>
<P>
   Turn that dial: This will be the first season fans won't be able
to listen to Matadors football games on the radio. CSUN couldn't
raise the $12,000 needed for the KCSN broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Once Matadors coach Jeff Kearin learned the money wasn't raised
through normal channels, he thought about trying to raise it
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were going to have it, I was going to have to raise the
$12,000,'' Kearin said. ``But I had to fight other battles. I'm
sick about it, but that's life.''

ANDERSON'S AVERAGE ON THE UPSWING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Asking the Anaheim Angels' Garret Anderson to take a
pitch might be like asking Darin Erstad to take a nap, or like
asking Mo Vaughn to lay down a bunt. They might do it, but not
without a grimace and a grumble.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's approach at the plate is what makes him the hitter he
is - which can be both good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   The good: Anderson has a career-high 31 homers and his 89 RBI
are second on the team only to Vaughn's 100. Anderson needs four
more RBI to establish a new career high.
</P>
<P>
   The bad: His on-base percentage (.295) is among the worst in the
majors. He's among the league leaders in hitting into double plays
and has walked only 21 times all season. He was a .300 lifetime
hitter going into this season, but is hitting .270 entering
tonight's game against the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia and hitting coach Mickey Hatcher
rave about Anderson's tools, his quick hands and pretty stroke.
They know Anderson could be a better hitter if he had more
discipline at the plate, but they don't want to change him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work within the strengths of a hitter and utilize them the
best you can,'' Scioscia said. ``With Garret, as he matures as a
hitter he'll understand how to be aggressive but selective within
the strike zone. I think you'll see him become the total offensive
package. Right now, his strength is he puts the ball in play
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of June, Anderson was hitting .241 and admitted he
was ``embarrassed'' by his average. But he didn't change much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a checklist of things that I go through to make sure I
have the right approach,'' he said. ``I keep it simple. There are
not a lot of adjustments to make. I take bits and pieces of what
people say, but I know what I've done in the past and what I did to
get here. I know what works for me.''
</P>
<P>
   His approach has worked since. He hit .337 in July and .295 in
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has been more disciplined and has gotten more
counts in his favor,'' Scioscia said. ``It's why his average is
creeping up to the range is should be. But if you look at Garret as
a player that has to get on base and set the table, you're asking
him to do something he hasn't been real comfortable with in his
career. These things take a little time. But in the long run we're
all very happy with where Garret is now and with the numbers he's
putting up.''
</P>
<P>
   Players needed: Despite the fact rosters may be expanded to as
many as 40 players beginning today, the Angels will add only four
players for a total of 29.
</P>
<P>
   Infielder Justin Baughman and relievers Bryan Ward and Ben Weber
were called up from Triple-A Edmonton and catcher Matt Walbeck was
activated from the disabled list. All four will join the team
today.

EDITORIAL: COVERING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 1:
</P>
<P>
   Both political parties launched advertising blitzes this week
pledging that their candidates would help the elderly pay for
costly prescription drugs more effectively. Vice President Al Gore
has put forward a detailed plan for a Medicare drug benefit. Gov.
George W. Bush is scrambling to produce a plan of his own to be
unveiled next week.
</P>
<P>
   The need for a prescription drug benefit is undeniable. A third
of Medicare's 40 million beneficiaries have no drug coverage at
all, even though drug costs are soaring and drugs are now essential
to managing chronic illnesses. At the same time, drug coverage for
the elderly through other health plans is becoming more limited.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore plan would pay for all drug costs of elderly people
with incomes below about $12,000 a year for an individual or
$14,000 a year for couples. Those with higher incomes who choose to
participate would pay monthly premiums that would start at $25 and
increase over time to $44. In return, Medicare would pay for half
the cost of their prescriptions up to $5,000 a year. Once a
beneficiary had paid $4,000 out of pocket in a year, the government
would pay all remaining costs. The program is estimated to cost
$253 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said generally that he wants a drug benefit to be part
of an overall Medicare reform. Ideally, Congress should both
modernize Medicare _ by increasing competition, improving quality
and controlling costs _ and create a long-overdue drug benefit. But
given voter demand, it seems more likely that Congress will first
pass a drug benefit and leave restructuring for later.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how to design a drug benefit that will provide
affordable coverage and will not interfere with future Medicare
reforms. Bush says he will offer full drug coverage now to the
low-income elderly. He also says he will ``build on'' proposals in
Congress that rely on private insurers to offer prescription drug
coverage, with government subsidizing the costs. But many private
insurers have rejected this approach as unworkable because they say
they will not be able to sell policies at rates that retirees can
afford. The private-market model also means that benefits would
vary, and insurers would be able to pull out of any market they
thought unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   Any new drug benefit will carry a substantial price tag. The
House Republican bill that passed in June and relies on private
insurers would cost the federal government more than $150 billion
over 10 years. Bush has not proposed spending any new money. His
aides say that savings from other Medicare cuts could cover the
tab, an unlikely proposition that Bush will need to document.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seems to be leaning toward a private-market model for
Medicare drug coverage. He will have to explain how his plan would
keep premiums down, induce insurer participation and guarantee the
elderly benefits that cannot be withdrawn. Gore's proposal will
spend substantial money on a new public program. It will be
interesting to see how Bush hopes to achieve the same outcome with
less government involvement and less money.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 1:
</P>
<P>
   They have refused to surrender their beloved pound sterling for
a newfangled Continental currency, but the British are about to
cede some control over their venerable stock exchange. Swedish and
German concerns are vying to be a partner with the London Stock
Exchange. It is the latest sign that for all Britain's
stiff-upper-lip talk of sovereignty, further economic integration
in Europe is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the companies they list, traditional stock exchanges
are under a great deal of pressure to expand globally. It makes
sense for truly multinational companies to be traded around the
clock on truly multinational exchanges with greater liquidity and
lower transaction costs. If the old financial centers fail to
provide this, new electronic trading systems are eager to fill the
gap.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this reality, the 200-year-old London Stock Exchange
announced in May that it would merge with the Deutsche Boerse in
Frankfurt. The merged entity, to be called iX for ``international
exchange,'' would then create a partnership with the U.S. Nasdaq
market as well as the Madrid and Milan exchanges. Earlier in the
year the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam stock exchanges announced a
union of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The union of the Frankfurt and London exchanges was carefully
presented as a ``merger of equals,'' so as not to ruffle
nationalist feathers. But from the outset, because of the deal's
terms, there was much grousing in London financial circles about a
German takeover of the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Swedes. OM Gruppen AB, a company that owns the
Stockholm stock exchange and sells trading technology around the
world, made a hostile cash-and-stock bid worth $1.12 billion this
week for the London Stock Exchange. OM Gruppen, which is also
developing a pan-European electronic trading network with Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, is representative of Scandinavia's new
tech-savvy, entrepreneurial corporate culture. Priced like a tech
stock, OM Gruppen has a market value three times that of the London
Stock Exchange, even though the Stockholm exchange is about
one-seventh as large.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear who will prevail in the bidding war. What is
clear is that Europe's stock exchanges will continue to
consolidate. The European Union has created a single market, and
its 11 core ``euro zone'' nations now share a single central bank.
A pan-European stock exchange cannot be far behind.

LONG BEACH STATE'S GOODWILL AMBASSADOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For at least a few minutes Thursday, I forget about such warm
sporting subjects as the status of the Sydney Olympic torch, Tiger
Woods, Dennis Miller's mindless cant, Davey Johnson's future,
Isaiah Rider's past, Oscar De La Hoya's loyalty, UCLA, Cory Paus,
the NFL, Damir Dokic and Gary Payton's big mouth.
</P>
<P>
   I decide to stroll around the most uplifting, most lively, most
colorful, most inclusive and most intellectually stimulating place
in Long Beach with one its greatest goodwill ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, means walking the Long Beach State campus with
the school's president, Dr. Robert ``Fightin' Bob'' Maxson, which
means watching the energetic man go through an exhausting ritual of
high fives and hand shakes with a gaggle of smiling students.
</P>
<P>
   When I went to college, I never saw its president, much less
said hello to him. I didn't even know the bloke's name.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Maxson knows everyone on campus - from the janitors to the
professors to the secretaries to the fast-food workers to seemingly
every student - and there is no doubt he is the person responsible
for the feel-good atmosphere that pervades Long Beach State these
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Disneyland is the happiest place on earth, then Long Beach
State is the second happiest,'' says Wayne Stickney-Smith, a campus
leader, to a beaming Maxson as we stand in the upper tier of the
Student Union area that is teeming with noontime activity.
</P>
<P>
   Maxson is beginning his seventh year at Long Beach State, and he
has instilled a sense of provincial pride among the student - ``Go
Beach'' signs and banners are everywhere - that was notably lacking
before his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``How're you doing, Tayyiba?'' Maxson asks Tayyiba Haneef, the
6-foot-6 volleyball star who suffered a pulled stomach muscle
during a recent practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hurting right now, but I'll know later when I meet
with the trainer if I'll be able to play,'' replies Haneef, whose
team opens its season tonight against St. Mary's at the Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Maxson spots Rudy Williams, the basketball player who's had
recent surgery on both legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, no more shin splint problems,'' says Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have a giant season,'' predicts Maxson.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the women's volleyball coach, Brian Gimmillaro makes
an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people hurt and that bothers me,'' says
Gimmillaro, who has reinstalled the Blonde Bombshell from Colorado,
Brittany Hochevar, as his setter and moved the capable Keri
Nishimoto to the back row. ``But once we get healthy we're going to
be pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Maxson smiles broadly.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Gimmillaro is one of his favorites, not only because
Gimmillaro's teams win so consistently but also because he and
Gimmillaro share a similar passion - a devotion for Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later, the basketball transfer from UCLA, Travis
Reed, expected to be the 49ers' starting center this season, pumps
Maxson's ever-moving right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to help lift our program to a higher level - into
the NCAA playoffs,'' says Reed with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Maxson nods approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I proudest of since I've come here?'' says Maxson,
echoing a reporter's question. ``Well, I guess what I'm proudest of
is the way so many students feel so good about attending Long Beach
State. They really seem to be enjoying themselves here, and that
makes me feel very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxson spots one of Dave Snow's top players, shortstop Bobby
Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a young man who recently played on the U.S. National
team, and batted over .300 against the top amateur teams in the
world,'' says Maxson. ``He's going to be a first-round draft pick
next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Maxson continues his non-stop interaction with the students,
and savors every moment of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``First week back to school is always special for me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend also will be special for Bob Maxson and his wife
Sylvia. Their daughter, Kim, a Las Vegas attorney, is getting
married Sunday in Corona Del Mar to Ric (cq) Rushton, a former race
driver now in private business.
</P>
<P>
   As Bob Maxson surveys his domain, he says softly, ``I couldn't
ask for things to be better than they are for me at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for the school he commands, a school he
has upgraded dramatically during his bright tenure. ...
</P>
<P>
   --One of my most hallowed theories in life is that human beings
don't change, especially ones with sociopathic traits with lengthy
histories of bad behavior.
</P>
<P>
   So, natch, I don't envision the Lakers' acquisition of Isaiah
``J.R.'' Rider, excommunicated from Portland, Minnesota and
Atlanta, as being a move that will turn out favorably for the team.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Rider is an extraordinary athlete with explosive
offensive skills, but he's also been an extraordinary pain in the
posterior throughout his basketball career who's been habitually
tardy for practices and feuded with teammates, coaches and fans.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt that Rider can play.
</P>
<P>
   Also no doubt he won't last long with the Lakers. . .
</P>
<P>
   --Phil Jackson's hand prints were all over the Rider
transaction. If Jerry West still were around, his wouldn't have
been. . .
</P>
<P>
   --Are Laker execs like Mitch Kupchak serious when they say there
isn't any downside to having Rider on the roster? Obviously, those
who recite such rubbish never have toiled in a work place alongside
a combustible personality and endured the constant tension of such
a harrowing experience. . .
</P>
<P>
   --Dennis Miller is such a bust he's not even worth mentioning
any longer. The poor guy has become the Carlos Perez of Monday
Night Football. . .
</P>
<P>
   --But Will His Groovy Mug One Day Wind Up On Mt. Rushmore? As I
interviewed Pat McCormick the other day, I asked the four-gold
medal- winning Olympic diving champion of the 1950s and Seal Beach
resident if she knew local policeman Ravishing Rick ``The Macho
Cop'' Paap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Paap is a sacred part of Seal Beach history,'' she
retorted, honest to goodness, cross my heart and hope to die - or,
even worse, force you to watch one of Paap's campy puppet acts - if
I'm lying.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the fiftysomething, aspiring actor, aspiring bon
vivant, aspiring millionaire, aspiring retiree still is hosting the
wildly popular ``Talk of the Town'' show on the Seal Beach cable
outlet.
</P>
<P>
   While Paap's gig hasn't exactly had a widespread impact - I
originally thought Paap was destined to be the next Ed Sullivan -
it still has proved to be quite entertaining, as next Thursday
night's 7 o'clock show figures to be featuring such former boxing
luminaries as Scrap Iron Johnson, Joey Orbillo, Carlos Palomino and
Armando Muniz. . .
</P>
<P>
   --I'm biased, certainly, but an athletic fanatic would be
depriving himself scandalously if he didn't regularly punch up Joe
McDonnell's LA Sports 2000 (www.lasports2000.com) on the Internet,
a madcap mixture of national sporting articles and the Big Nasty's
unique fulminations.

EDITORIAL: RETURN OF THE WHITE HOUSE TURNSTILE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 1:
</P>
<P>
   Well after the 1996 fund-raising scandals brought charges that
President Clinton had effectively ``sold'' the Lincoln Bedroom for
campaign contributions, big donors continued to gain easy access to
the White House in return for their donations. The famous White
House turnstile was alive and well at least through last year, when
a generous donor named David Chang, who subsequently pleaded guilty
to channeling illegal contributions to Sen. Robert Torricelli of
New Jersey, was granted a number of visits with Clinton, in both
formal and informal settings.
</P>
<P>
   As outlined in The Times this week by Tim Golden and David
Kocieniewski, Chang and his employees gave more than 100
contributions totaling $325,000 to various candidates of both
parties. Although no specific favors from the White House were
reported, Chang was able to meet with National Security Council
officials and attend various functions with the president,
including two state dinners and a ``movie night.'' He also had
pizza with Clinton at a hotel in Seoul in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Chang appears not to have won support from the administration
for his main effort, which was to get repayment of what he said he
was owed by North Korea for grain shipments. But Chang apparently
tried to use the perception that he was close to the president and
other politicians to secure various business deals. The White House
should come forward to explain who arranged for his inappropriate
access.
</P>
<P>
   The case raises questions about the judgment of Torricelli and
of Clinton's chief fund-raiser, Terry McAuliffe. The Justice
Department is reportedly investigating whether the senator
accounted properly for Chang's donations. Torricelli's office says
he was a victim of Chang's maneuvers, not a collaborator in them.
McAuliffe says he had no fund-raising ties to Chang but was simply
hired by him in 1998 to help him try to buy a life insurance
company in South Korea. Both Torricelli and McAuliffe should have
been more cautious in their choice of political or business
associates. With unregulated campaign donations, everybody gets
tainted, and the entire process is diminished as a result.

<P>
   When a company's products turn out to have hurt people, or
worse, that slavering sound you hear is of a thousand lawyers
licking their lips. Shareholders, meanwhile, hold their breath.
</P>
<P>
   So it was in the past two weeks with Ford's and
Bridgestone/Firestone's recall of 6.5 million tires, and with
Mitsubishi's separate recall in Japan of 620,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
   Punishment of some sort will presumably be meted out. The
question is whether it will be meted out to the right people _
meaning, in the way likeliest to deter future miscreants. Given how
the system currently works, that looks unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear whether, in any of these companies, crimes
were committed or by whom. Corporate-liability cases are often very
complicated. In particular instances it may be hard to say whether
the harm was pure happenstance, or caused by innocent mistakes,
culpable negligence or, in the worst cases, deliberate
recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   But what is clear is that, even in those worst cases, it is
typically shareholders who are punished rather than individual
wrongdoers. This is not merely unjust, it provides little incentive
for better behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Companies don't make decisions, people do. At Mitsubishi, repair
reports were suppressed for two decades. Ford had apparently known
about problems with Firestone's tires since 1998, but failed to
act.
</P>
<P>
   Any decisions to suppress information or take no remedial
action, if they occurred, would have been choices made by managers,
not by assembly-line workers, let alone shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet class-action civil suits are directed at companies and their
shareholders, who can afford billion-dollar damages, rather than at
the individuals concerned, who may be party to the suit but whose
liability is generally met by their employers.
</P>
<P>
   This approach may have the advantage of compensating victims _
overcompensating them, as a rule _ but its drawback is that it is
only a weak deterrent to similar acts by others.
</P>
<P>
   Episodes of irresponsible corporate conduct tend to occur when
employees are not offered the right balance of risk and reward. If
their only fear is of internal reprimand, it will be in their
interests to engage in deception and cover-ups, and not to blow the
whistle on others.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the balance would be tipped so that people have
stronger motives to make the right decisions. The current system
relies too much on firms to police themselves. And the worst
penalty a firm can mete out to a wrongdoer is the sack.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty lies in finding ways of removing the cloak of
corporate responsibility from individuals. Laws on corporate crime
often make the accountability of individuals insufficiently clear.
</P>
<P>
   America's environmental statutes are a telling exception: they
do clearly assign criminal liability to top managers, and with good
results.
</P>
<P>
   The country's regime for trading sulphur emissions has done much
to reduce acid rain, achieving 100 percent compliance with the
rules because firms' bosses risk lengthy prison-sentences if they
violate them. That kind of clarity is helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Governments should seek other opportunities to increase the
accountability of individuals. In addition, prosecutors ought to be
encouraged to pursue high-profile cases. Since wrongdoers typically
worry most about being caught, they need to be persuaded that they
run a risk of being found out and punished.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors tend to pursue firms rather than individuals because
they are easier targets. But, as the civil lawsuits over tobacco
have shown in America, tenacious investigation can put names to
specific decisions. Where those decisions violated the law,
appropriate penalties should follow.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders must, of course, expect to take ordinary commercial
risks _ but that does not include the risk of being punished for
criminal behavior of which they were unaware.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say they should be freed of all responsibility in
this regard: shareholders do need some incentive to ensure that
their employees are working within the law.
</P>
<P>
   But if a better balance can be struck between, on the one hand,
financial losses imposed on shareholders and, on the other,
criminal penalties imposed on individual malefactors, the
corporate-liability regime would serve society more effectively. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The country's regime for trading sulphur emissions has done much
to reduce acid rain, achieving 100 percent compliance with the
rules because firms' bosses risk lengthy prison-sentences if they
violate them. That kind of clarity is helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Governments should seek other opportunities to increase the
accountability of individuals. In addition, prosecutors ought to be
encouraged to pursue high-profile cases. Since wrongdoers typically
worry most about being caught, they need to be persuaded that they
run a risk of being found out and punished.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors tend to pursue firms rather than individuals because
they are easier targets. But, as the civil lawsuits over tobacco
have shown in America, tenacious investigation can put names to
specific decisions. Where those decisions violated the law,
appropriate penalties should follow.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders must, of course, expect to take ordinary commercial
risks _ but that does not include the risk of being punished for
criminal behavior of which they were unaware.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say they should be freed of all responsibility in
this regard: shareholders do need some incentive to ensure that
their employees are working within the law.
</P>
<P>
   But if a better balance can be struck between, on the one hand,
financial losses imposed on shareholders and, on the other,
criminal penalties imposed on individual malefactors, the
corporate-liability regime would serve society more effectively. &QL;

   A new threat looms over Asia: the threat of diplomatic
chin-wagging.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's foreign minister was in Beijing this week, waving his
finger at recent incursions into Japanese-claimed waters, and also
to set up a visit to Tokyo by China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji.
Both, along with the rest of Asia and America, were watching
closely the talks in Pyongyang between North and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, visits Japan,
before himself (ahead of a visit to India, which has just waved off
Japan's prime minister) greeting Kim Jong Il, North Korea's once
reclusive boss.
</P>
<P>
   In a region with an already awkward balance between America,
China, Japan and Russia, the thaw between the Koreas has set
everyone scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, an easing of tensions along East Asia's last Cold-War
frontier ought to benefit all. In practice, bad habits and new
forces at work on old rivalries mean tricky times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A reconciliation that led eventually to reunification between
the Koreas would be welcome. It would also be hugely unsettling,
obliging America to review its region-stabilizing troop commitments
in South Korea and Japan, and rekindling old rivalries among China,
Japan and Russia for influence in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   So too would a sudden North Korean collapse _ not to be ruled
out in a place propped up only by Stalinist stilts and foreign aid.
Before then, however, there is the problem of how to deal with a
two-handed North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   As always, North Korea has one hand out for cash: it wants huge
sums from South Korea for letting divided families meet and still
more from America for curbing the North's missile sales (to add to
what it has made from freezing its output of plutonium and merely
opening talks with the South and Japan).
</P>
<P>
   But in extending its other, diplomatic, hand to America, China,
Russia and others, the North is already seeking to play these
neighbors-cum-rivals off against each other. And East Asia is
fertile ground for disruptive diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Western Europe's, the region's old animosities never died
during the Cold War; they rankled on beneath the ice. When the old
Soviet Union was everyone's enemy, most countries, including
eventually China, clustered around America for protection.
</P>
<P>
   East Asia's two natural rivals, China and Japan, managed to curb
their hostility, but they never resolved it.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions break through intermittently, over disputed islands and
sea boundaries, but also in the competition for influence around
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, seeing China flex its military muscle in the South China
Sea and over Taiwan, Japan has strengthened its security alliance
with America and is exploring cooperation in regional missile
defenses, in the process grating on China's old grievances about
both countries.
</P>
<P>
   The safe management of this uneasy balance among Asia's bigger
powers will be that much harder in the coming months, not just
because North Korea is now trying little-power games of its own,
but also because several countries are distracted by politics at
home.
</P>
<P>
   In Putin, Russia has, for the first time in years, a leader who
can walk unaided down an aircraft's steps. But, even if he were not
struggling to repair his image after the Kursk affair, Russia is
too chaotic for him to have much influence abroad _ or the power to
make the concessions needed, for example, to clinch the peace
treaty with Japan promised by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, meanwhile, may have the world's second-biggest economy,
but its prime minister could barely scrape together a cabinet after
the general election in June, and scandal or political reforms may
yet break the long-running rule of his Liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   While Russia and Japan are mostly sidelined, China's internal
struggles could yet be a danger to the neighbors. Its president,
Jiang Zemin, is battling to preserve his influence before he
retires, at the next Communist Party congress in 2002, and needs
support from China's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Pandering to the generals, he demanded earlier this year that
Taiwan should open talks on unification or else, thereby
dangerously raising nationalist expectations in China that cannot
now easily be met without resort to force.
</P>
<P>
   America is about to elect its new president. Among his first big
decisions will be whether or not to build new national missile
defenses for America and regional ones for Asia _ both touchy
issues in China, which fears the undermining of its nuclear
deterrent and America's interference in any future conflict with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   And, even without the thaw between the Koreas, he would be
looking hard at whether he really needed 100,000 troops in harm's
way to keep East Asia's peace.
</P>
<P>
   America has a keen interest in a stable East Asia.
Understandably, however, it is also keen to see others pull their
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has agreed to help America a bit more _ though not yet
enough _ in a crisis. Australia helped in Southeast Asia by
spearheading the force sent to East Timor. Several countries,
including Japan and India, will soon be jointly rehearsing their
navies in ways to combat piracy.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the really difficult problems, such as
coping with the ambitions of a rising China, or discouraging
missile launches by North Korea, everyone still backs off and
leaves it to America.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months the region will be resplendent with
ceremonial red carpets but, despite the growing dangers, not much
is likely to be achieved. Keep your fingers crossed. &QL;

<P>
   These are cracking good times in the hostage business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, according to an insurance company that tries to keep
count, the numbers taken captive increased by 6 percent over 1998,
and it has been like that for several years: kidnappings for ransom
are up by 70 percent over eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Most are in Latin America, but the numbers have risen sharply in
former Soviet states too. The remarkable deal just concluded in the
Philippines helps to explain why.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Muammar Qaddafi, trying these days to shake off Libya's
pariah status and ingratiate himself abroad, seems to have bought
the release of several western hostages held by a band of Islamist
bandits on the Philippine island of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
   Though some remain captive, including an American snatched on
Aug. 29, one batch of liberated westerners passed through Libya
this week to thank the colonel for his role in their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Whether with his own money or other people's, he paid, it seems,
$1 million per western head _ above the going rate for the group's
Asian hostages, nine of whom had earlier been released for roughly
$5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Many had been held since April. Others _ curious journalists, a
group of evangelists _ had been snatched on visits to the
kidnappers and their prey. A German journalist was freed after his
employers had paid a ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers, evidently, have learned two lessons: holding a
few hostages keeps the army away; grabbing more keeps the money
rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   It is a principle that seems to apply elsewhere too. A month ago
in India a notorious Tamil bandit snatched a hugely popular film
star, sparking riots among his outraged fans. This week 51
prisoners, all cronies of the bandit, were due to be released in an
effort to please him. Only India's Supreme Court is resisting such
dubious deal-making.
</P>
<P>
   All over the world the habit has caught on. The ragtag West Side
Boys who seized 11 British soldiers and one of their own
compatriots in Sierra Leone last week want the release of their
leader, ``Brigadier Bomb Blast.'' They are no doubt inspired by the
snatching _ with impunity, if not reward _ of hundreds of U.N.
troops by rebels in May.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear whether George Speight's recent kidnapping
of Fiji's prime minister and much of its cabinet will be judged a
success or a failure for Speight personally, but it has certainly
inspired an attempted coup in the Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Afghan gunmen diverted a plane from Kabul to
London, copying hijackers who had escaped scot-free after taking a
plane from India to Afghanistan a few weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In some poor, gun-ridden parts of the world, selling the freedom
of foreigners or rich locals is a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, it is known as ``miraculous fishing,'' as rebels
block roads and hook out victims. In the delta region of Nigeria,
oil workers are snatched in return for money _ even for jobs. In
Yemen, villages win public works for releasing unwary tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Kidnapping has many causes: inequalities of wealth, availability
of guns, rebel armies looking for funds, underpaid police. But the
main reason for the boom is simple: the rewards.
</P>
<P>
   For the hostages, of course, freedom is worth any amount of
money. But as the Philippine government points out, that money buys
more guns and bombs _ and more hostages. Reports from Jolo suggest
that the rebels have already bought new weapons and a speedboat.
</P>
<P>
   The way to reduce kidnapping is to show that it does not pay.
Ideally, that means capturing the kidnappers and punishing them.
But it may also mean making it illegal to pay a ransom, as it is in
Italy and some other countries.
</P>
<P>
   For victims and their friends and families, the temptation is
always to shell out. But thereby the practice continues.
</P>
<P>
   The hard rule is best: don't pay ransoms. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Who could have guessed it? America is into the tenth
year of the longest economic boom in its history. The country is
minting millionaires so fast that psychologists have discovered a
whole new mental disorder _ ``affluenza'' _ that results from
having huge piles of cash dumped on your head.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Al Gore, Tennessee princeling and ultimate Washington
insider, has revived his fortunes not just with a kiss, but by dint
of one of the most antiquated ideas in the political lexicon: the
class struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago it looked as if nothing could help the hapless vice
president. He boasted about his long-standing interest in the new
economy _ and a slip of the tongue transformed him into the man who
invented the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He embarked on a ``Prosperity and Progress Tour'' accompanied by
the spectacularly prosperous Robert Rubin _ and his poll numbers
continued to sag.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no sooner had he reinvented himself as a class-warrior than
Americans discovered that they loved him after all.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's decision to declare class war caused heart attacks among
leading Democrats. President Bill Clinton had built his political
career on exactly the opposite premise: that the best way to win
votes is to embrace business rather than bash it.
</P>
<P>
   The New Democrats, who have made the intellectual running in the
party for a decade, urged Gore (who was surely one of them) to move
further in the same direction: forget about all those waitresses
and truckers that they sing about relentlessly in Nashville and
embrace consumer choice and wired workers.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore desperately needed a way to connect with a restive
Democratic base (and to slow Ralph Nader's advance in key states
like California).
</P>
<P>
   And a group of Democratic pollsters, including Stanley Greenberg
and Ruy Teixeira, argued forcefully that the real swing voters in
this election are not suburban professionals but the 55 percent of
the population who belong to the white working class.
</P>
<P>
   So a man whose earliest experience of this ``forgotten
majority'' was ringing for room service in Washington's Fairfax
Hotel became a champion of the people against the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Populism a la Gore has gone down better than anybody expected.
It has endowed him with an independent identity after years in
Clinton's shadow. It has provided his schizophrenic campaign with a
theme. And it has allowed him to tap into his family's political
roots in Tennessee populism, putting a little zing into his
normally dull speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's post-convention bounce has not only held up remarkably
well across the country, with the candidates neck-and-neck in the
polls. It has held up well in blue-collar states such as Michigan,
Minnesota and New Jersey, where Bush had long enjoyed an edge.
</P>
<P>
   Populism is a high-stakes strategy, of course. It risks
associating the Democrats with the ancient canard that big
government in Washington can solve all America's problems. It also
risks identifying them with the losers in a society obsessed with
winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to lead a nation by dividing it,'' says an
increasingly worried George W. Bush. ``That's the rhetoric of the
past; that's class warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, a man whose career has been more or less made for him
by his father's friends, is hardly the best advertisement for the
idea that class has no place in modern America.
</P>
<P>
   And his vice-presidential choice, Dick Cheney, a genuine product
of the meritocracy, is compromised by the fact that he not only
received a $13.6 million golden handshake from his old employer,
Halliburton, but also voted for a $9.5 million payoff for one of
the most disastrous bosses of recent years, Procter &AMP; Gamble's Durk
Jager.
</P>
<P>
   Gore picks his targets carefully, hammering away at the evils of
big oil, big tobacco and big health-care conglomerates. This week,
for example, he went to Florida to criticize the ``exorbitant''
cost of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   He is also well-protected from the charge that he is a
root-and-branch enemy of business. He spent the past eight years in
the White House without making any noticeable attempt to
nationalize the means of production, and his crusade against ``big
oil'' has not prevented him from having large family holdings in
Occidental. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   His party has also taken the precaution of dumping the one group
that has always doomed populist campaigns in the past: the
underclass.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush senior squashed Michael Dukakis by accusing him of
caring more about criminals and freeloaders than about hard-working
families. But Bill Clinton's decision to embrace mass incarceration
and welfare reform means that the only idle freeloaders that matter
in this election are retired chief executives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reason why Gore's campaign has caught fire, however,
is that he has succeeded in articulating the fury that almost all
Americans, gold-collar as well as blue, feel about their treatment
at the hands of big companies.
</P>
<P>
   Who doesn't hate America's HMOs, for example? Dealing with Aetna
U.S. Healthcare is like dealing with a particularly incompetent
branch of the old Soviet bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   If you move from one sort of coverage to another within the
company, you are brutally told that your coverage has been
terminated; and if you try to rectify the situation, you are
confronted with weeks' worth of tedious and confusing paperwork,
with bills mounting up and doctors yapping at your heels.
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs are only the tip of a horrific iceberg. Cancellations
and delays are now as routine a part of air travel as overcrowding
and stale pretzels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 50 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 925) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The staff in chain stores cannot perform even the most basic
mental operations: try visiting a CVS Pharmacy in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   And telephoning an American company is a guarantee of an
automated nightmare of options, starting with the most improbable
and long-winded, and culminating in an endless wait to talk to a
human being. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,100) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Most people know in their heart of hearts that Gore cannot do
anything to solve these irritations. They know that the Democratic
Party is just as deeply in hock to special interests as the
Republican. They know that Washington cannot just mandate better
service.
</P>
<P>
   But when Gore pledges to spend every day as president working
for ordinary people against insensitive monstrosities like Aetna,
they cannot help but feel a surge of foolish enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   That surge may well be enough to carry him into the White
House. &QL;

`NOT NOW' TIME FOR SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If last season was ``Now Time,'' according to the
Seahawks marketeers, what is this season?
</P>
<P>
   Irrefutably, it's ... not now time.
</P>
<P>
   No one around the Seahawks will agree directly with that. But
outside of the professionally trained optimism of the players, no
one is arguing much, either.
</P>
<P>
   Now time was then; this is a step back.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mike Holmgren has dropped enough chubby hints about
diminished expectations that he will be vulnerable to the claim
that he is creating early cover. Almost certainly, by the time the
2000 season is reflected upon, the Seahawks coach/GM/premier won't
be accused of overselling his product.
</P>
<P>
   Already he has said the Seahawks are going to take a big hit
against the salary cap ($10 million to players not on the roster)
this season instead of spreading the damage. He's also called it a
teaching year for the welter of young players, some of whom should
be on the second unit instead of the first, and still more who
should be on the practice squad instead of the second unit.
</P>
<P>
   But he is professionally obliged to avoid the truth. He knows
that football coaches who tell the truth this time of year
typically are soon selling life insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to surprise some people who think were not going
to do so well,'' is how he put it this week. He failed to identify
who these people were, nor did he say specifically what the
accusations were. But if he can find one of them who said the
Seahawks will go 2-14, he will be on safe ground.
</P>
<P>
   That is how football coaches dodge reality. If he works at it
diligently, it can get him to the White House as occupant well
before he will return as Super Bowl-winning guest.
</P>
<P>
   Probably few if any Seahawks fans will be perturbed by the oral
soft-shoe, because they operate comfortably in an atmosphere of
diminished expectations. After all, this is a team that in its
first quarter century has won four postseason games, none since
1984.
</P>
<P>
   Even Holmgren's considerable rsum as well as the AFC West
Division championship last season cannot quickly alter the
perception that if there is an upturned iron rake somewhere in an
overgrown yard, inevitably the Seahawks will step on it.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, last year's rake was discovered Nov. 28, when
Tampa Bay, despite just 156 yards of total offense, throttled the
Seahawks 16-3 in the Kingdome. That defeat turned an 8-2 seasonal
start into a NASDAQ-style header that finished with six losses in
seven games, including a 20-17 home playoff loss to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins, the season-opening opponent Sunday, proceeded to
lose their next game 62-7 to Jacksonville. That indicated either
the Seahawks had administered to Miami a horrific beating the
previous week, or the Dolphins and Seahawks might have been two of
the worst playoff teams since the installation of the face mask.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay loss was the start of something bad. The Bucs'
formidable defense created a template used by the Seahawks
remaining opponents: Stick eight defenders between the tackles and
dare quarterback Jon Kitna to win going deep.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't. Not with a sore toe, a busted-up running back and a
deep threat who couldn't get out of the way of his pouting lower
lip. Even if the three biggest parts of the Seahawks offense were
to recover, continued success was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``That game shook our confidence,'' Holmgren said. ``It stunned
Jon a little, like a fighter who gets hit hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Holmgren admitted to blunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a coaching error that game,'' he said. ``I kept trying
to play it the way I wanted to. I should have played the game to
win 9-6. Instead, I kept throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   Five interceptions and a Kitna fumble later, the early season
NFL darlings were exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The off-season brought few fig leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks lost eight starters, and this week replaced the
veteran kicker and the veteran backup quarterback with rookies.
Those two departures, along with most of the others, were for
reasons of salary cap constraints, meaning their replacements are
almost exclusively young and cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The unit where help was most needed, the offensive line,
suffered a big off-season injury and a stupid rookie holdout.
Tackle Chris McIntosh demonstrated in mini-camps that he didnt know
a pass block from a block party, but instead skipped an entire
preseason of desperately needed instruction to gain virtually
nothing in his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he take himself almost out of the 2000 picture,
McIntosh figures to diminish the effectiveness of the brightest
off-season addition, rookie running back Shaun Alexander. The
eventual replacement for Ricky Watters will fend largely for
himself behind yet another patchwork line.
</P>
<P>
   At least Holmgren will be able to rely on two able coordinators
that he didnt have a year ago, Gil Haskell on offense and Steve
Sidwell on defense. That should cut down on the indecision and
tentativeness that plagued the Seahawks sideline.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing they can do can fix the travail of playing a
first-place schedule with a second-rate team. At least they can
make a little local history together _ playing the first big-time
football games in the perpetual whitecap of Seattle's
post-Thanksgiving outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   If it is to be a bad season, there is virtue in playing it on a
lake bottom.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Al Gore planted that kiss full on Tipper at the
Democratic Convention, he may have given almost as much pleasure to
the current First Lady as the (maybe) next one.
</P>
<P>
   This random act of passion helped give the vice president such a
lift in the opinion polls that the George Bush campaign has
abandoned any lingering thoughts of putting up a serious fight in
New York state.
</P>
<P>
   If, as now seems likely, Gore carries the state by a mile on
Nov. 7, many supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton believe there is
no way she can lose the Senate election on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Are they right? Certainly, things have mostly gone Mrs.
Clinton's way during recent weeks. She has maintained a frenetic
program of public appearances around the state, while her
Republican rival, Rick Lazio, has taken a more traditional relaxed
approach to campaigning during August _ or perhaps has simply
failed to get his act together.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lazio received a welcome boost when the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) decided not to proceed with
insider-trading charges, he spent much of August looking as if he
had something to hide by failing to make public his tax returns,
despite frequent requests from the Clinton campaign. (When he at
last produced them, all seemed to be in order.)
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Convention did nothing for Lazio, who put in a
brief appearance but declined an opportunity to speak _ apparently
for fear of being too closely associated with Bush, who has high
negative ratings in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton, who has been struggling with New York's
crucial Jewish voters, was cheered by Gore's vice-presidential
choice of Joseph Lieberman. Her platitudinous speech to the
Democratic Convention was well received by delegates, and her
Hollywood friends donated a fortune to campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Gore's amorous performance. Bill Schneider, one of
America's leading pollsters, reckons that Gore's likely triumph in
New York will give Mrs. Clinton a decisive winning edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was 1998 or 2002, Hillary wouldn't win, because of all
her negatives. But in a presidential year, there is a higher
turnout in New York City and amongst minorities. With Gore well
ahead, that should give her victory by a couple of hundred thousand
votes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   After all, in New York, registered Democrats exceed Republicans
by around 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many Americans, New Yorkers like Mrs. Clinton's husband,
and gave him his third-biggest margin of victory in the 1996
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious parallels with 1964, when Lyndon Johnson won
New York by a landslide and Bobby Kennedy, another famous
carpetbagger, was elected on his coattails.
</P>
<P>
   Other pollsters take a very different lesson from 1964. Then,
Johnson carried the state by 2.5 million votes, whereas Kennedy's
margin of victory was only 719,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thinks Gore will win by anything close to 2 million; more
likely 1 million at most. On the other hand, as in 1964, voters are
likely to differentiate between the president and the carpetbagger.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Zogby, who has regularly polled New York
voters, ``The Senate race stands on its own. It is all about
Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, Zogby's latest poll has Gore over 20 percentage
points ahead in the state, and Mrs. Clinton up by only two points _
well within margins of statistical error.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, New York simultaneously elected Clinton and sent a

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Al Gore planted that kiss full on Tipper at the
Democratic Convention, he may have given almost as much pleasure to
the current First Lady as the (maybe) next one.
</P>
<P>
   This random act of passion helped give the vice president such a
lift in the opinion polls that the George Bush campaign has
abandoned any lingering thoughts of putting up a serious fight in
New York state.
</P>
<P>
   If, as now seems likely, Gore carries the state by a mile on
Nov. 7, many supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton believe there is
no way she can lose the Senate election on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Are they right? Certainly, things have mostly gone Mrs.
Clinton's way during recent weeks. She has maintained a frenetic
program of public appearances around the state, while her
Republican rival, Rick Lazio, has taken a more traditional relaxed
approach to campaigning during August _ or perhaps has simply
failed to get his act together.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lazio received a welcome boost when the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) decided not to proceed with
insider-trading charges, he spent much of August looking as if he
had something to hide by failing to make public his tax returns,
despite frequent requests from the Clinton campaign. (When he at
last produced them, all seemed to be in order.)
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Convention did nothing for Lazio, who put in a
brief appearance but declined an opportunity to speak _ apparently
for fear of being too closely associated with Bush, who has high
negative ratings in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton, who has been struggling with New York's
crucial Jewish voters, was cheered by Gore's vice-presidential
choice of Joseph Lieberman. Her platitudinous speech to the
Democratic Convention was well received by delegates, and her
Hollywood friends donated a fortune to campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Gore's amorous performance. Bill Schneider, one of
America's leading pollsters, reckons that Gore's likely triumph in
New York will give Mrs. Clinton a decisive winning edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was 1998 or 2002, Hillary wouldn't win, because of all
her negatives. But in a presidential year, there is a higher
turnout in New York City and amongst minorities. With Gore well
ahead, that should give her victory by a couple of hundred thousand
votes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   After all, in New York, registered Democrats exceed Republicans
by around 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many Americans, New Yorkers like Mrs. Clinton's husband,
and gave him his third-biggest margin of victory in the 1996
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious parallels with 1964, when Lyndon Johnson won
New York by a landslide and Bobby Kennedy, another famous
carpetbagger, was elected on his coattails.
</P>
<P>
   Other pollsters take a very different lesson from 1964. Then,
Johnson carried the state by 2.5 million votes, whereas Kennedy's
margin of victory was only 719,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thinks Gore will win by anything close to 2 million; more
likely 1 million at most. On the other hand, as in 1964, voters are
likely to differentiate between the president and the carpetbagger.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Zogby, who has regularly polled New York
voters, ``The Senate race stands on its own. It is all about
Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, Zogby's latest poll has Gore over 20 percentage
points ahead in the state, and Mrs. Clinton up by only two points _
well within margins of statistical error.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, New York simultaneously elected Clinton and sent a
Republican, Alfonse D'Amato, to the Senate; though admittedly,
unlike Lazio, he was an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Some Lazio supporters think that the Bush campaign's abandonment
of the state may even increase their man's chances. There will be
few presidential campaign ads or appearances in New York, leaving
the airwaves and journalists free for the Senate race. &QL;

   WAKEFIELD FARM, MANICALAND, ZIMBABWE _ It was a rollicking
party. Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, arrived in one of his
helicopters. Cows were slaughtered, beer gushed, crowds danced and
ululated, and television cameras recorded the joyful event for
posterity.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the resettlement of 51 black families on
Wakefield ``A,'' a large commercial farm, bought by the government
from willing sellers two years ago. The aim was to build a class of
successful, independent black farmers in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   The government promised the new smallholders seeds, fertilizer
and all the help necessary to get them started. It then forgot
about them. The farmers, most of whom knew little or nothing of
farming, got no advice, support or equipment.
</P>
<P>
   A local white commercial farmer, Andrew Dawson, stepped in. He
offered to plough his new neighbors' fields with his tractor and
supply them with fertilizer. When their crops were ready, he said,
they could repay him, interest-free, in maize.
</P>
<P>
   Although his offer was taken up by 12 farmers, only one or two
are likely to be able to repay the debt. Most of the 51 plots have
produced little or no crop, and the land is now largely derelict.
</P>
<P>
   Wild grasses have reclaimed what were once prime tobacco fields.
Many of the resettlers have drifted away.
</P>
<P>
   This is the land-reform program that Mugabe is now seeking to
accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that land reform is necessary in Zimbabwe.
Commercial farmers continually suggest practical ways in which it
might be carried out. Foreign donors offer to finance orderly
reform. The farms that were redistributed in the early 1980s turned
many peasants into successful smallholders.
</P>
<P>
   But, at that time, the beneficiaries were selected carefully and
received material support. Now, they are chosen not for their
farming skills but for their loyalty to the ruling party, ZANU-PF.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's motives are political, not economic. Incomes have
fallen by a third under his rule, and he feared that the voters
would show their displeasure by rejecting ZANU at the parliamentary
election in June. So he decided to inflame the land issue.
</P>
<P>
   In thunderous speeches, he urged his people to reclaim the soil
that white colonialists stole from them a century ago, reminding
them that whites, despite being less than 1 percent of the
population, still own about 70 percent of the best farmland.
</P>
<P>
   He organized a series of ``spontaneous'' invasions of
white-owned properties, selecting farmers who were known to support
the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).
</P>
<P>
   The 10,000-14,000 invaders _ veterans of the country's wars and
assorted bruisers _ prevented the opposition from campaigning in
much of the countryside. Paid and transported by the secret
services, they moved from farm to farm, beating suspected MDC
supporters, burning their huts and occasionally killing them.
</P>
<P>
   After the election, Mugabe wanted to reward his foot soldiers
and punish his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, the government announced that over 3,000 farms, up
from a previous target of 804, would be seized without compensation
and distributed among the landless. This represents more than half
the country's commercial farmland.
</P>
<P>
   The government insisted that the farms selected would be largely
idle, belonging to absentee landlords, or else adjacent to crowded
communal land. The full list has not yet been released, but the
1,500 or so addresses published so far include many thriving
exporters. Once again, farmers who actively support the MDC appear
to have been singled out.
</P>
<P>
   The beneficiaries of land reform are supposed to be the needy.
But Obert Mpofu, the governor of Matabeleland North, a province
where the opposition won all seven seats in June, has openly
admitted that only ZANU supporters will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred handover ceremonies have taken place since the
election, some of them consisting of war veterans picking
bottle-tops out of a hat to decide who will receive which plot.
</P>
<P>
   The government promises to provide the new farmers with
infrastructure and support. Maybe it will, but its record suggests
it will not.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's stated aim is to resettle 500,000 families _ about a
sixth of the population _ before the rains start in November. In
other words, he hopes to achieve in two months more than he has in
20 years, and to do it without donor support and despite the
government's near-bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme imperils the whole economy. Dawson, for example, has
heard that the government may soon seize his farm. If it does, his
300 black employees and their 1,500 dependents face destitution.
</P>
<P>
   All over the country multitudes of farm workers are to be
displaced to make way for smaller numbers of ZANU loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   Banks hesitate to lend to farmers whose collateral could be
confiscated tomorrow. Newly-resettled farmers also lack secure
title to their land, and have even less chance of raising capital
to develop it.
</P>
<P>
   Output is shrinking, and with it the industries that supply, or
buy from, farmers: fertilizer wholesalers, bakeries, tractor-repair
shops and so on. Probably more than half of Zimbabwean industry
depends on agriculture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The country's nature reserves are threatened, too. Chunks of the
Save Valley conservancy have been earmarked for resettlement,
although the area is unsuitable for farming. An influx of veterans
with a taste for game has depleted wildlife stocks and scared off
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   To make snares, the poachers tear down the wire fences that keep
wild animals away from cattle farms. This threatens beef exports:
European Union rules bar mixing cattle with beasts that may have
foot-and-mouth disease.
</P>
<P>
   The government devalued the Zimbabwe dollar by 24 percent in
August, and promises further devaluation, hoping to boost exports
and so raise sorely-needed hard currency.
</P>
<P>
   But shortages of imports, such as fuel, have yet to ease.
Motorists queue for hours for gasoline; housewives battle for
paraffin for their stoves.
</P>
<P>
   The government's foreign debts go unpaid and its domestic ones
are met by printing money. Cash machines in Harare spill out wads
of notes with consecutive serial numbers. Hyperinflation looms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 175-WORD TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Clear thinkers within the ruling party have tried to warn Mugabe
of the consequences of his actions. He refuses to listen. The main
hope seems to be that incompetence will slow the execution of his
policies. &QL;

<P>
   WAKEFIELD FARM, MANICALAND, ZIMBABWE _ It was a rollicking
party. Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, arrived in one of his
helicopters. Cows were slaughtered, beer gushed, crowds danced and
ululated, and television cameras recorded the joyful event for
posterity.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the resettlement of 51 black families on
Wakefield ``A,'' a large commercial farm, bought by the government
from willing sellers two years ago. The aim was to build a class of
successful, independent black farmers in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   The government promised the new smallholders seeds, fertilizer
and all the help necessary to get them started. It then forgot
about them. The farmers, most of whom knew little or nothing of
farming, got no advice, support or equipment.
</P>
<P>
   A local white commercial farmer, Andrew Dawson, stepped in. He
offered to plough his new neighbors' fields with his tractor and
supply them with fertilizer. When their crops were ready, he said,
they could repay him, interest-free, in maize.
</P>
<P>
   Although his offer was taken up by 12 farmers, only one or two
are likely to be able to repay the debt. Most of the 51 plots have
produced little or no crop, and the land is now largely derelict.
</P>
<P>
   Wild grasses have reclaimed what were once prime tobacco fields.
Many of the resettlers have drifted away.
</P>
<P>
   This is the land-reform program that Mugabe is now seeking to
accelerate.

   MUSCAT _ Not so very long ago, Oman's borders were sealed to the
outside world and Muscat's gates clanged shut at sunset. Everything
began to change in 1970, when Sultan Qaboos, then aged 30,
overthrew his medieval-minded father, unlocked the gates and
ushered in a brave new world.
</P>
<P>
   Using money from oil, which started to flow only in 1967, he
built roads, schools and hospitals. He gave boats to fishermen,
houses to nearly everyone, and introduced some of the strictest
environmental laws in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, it is as if a giant hand had opened a box of Lego,
pulling out toy houses and forts, park benches and squares of
grass, and telephone booths and bus shelters built like
mini-castles.
</P>
<P>
   The sultan is even moving his country, very gradually, towards a
slightly more democratic system. On Sept. 14 Omanis will, for the
fourth time, be electing their main consultative council, a body
that was set up in 1991 to advise the ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Women can both vote and stand for election. It would be foolish,
says the sultan, to waste half the country's talents.
</P>
<P>
   More traditionally, the sultan takes pride in his annual
meet-the-people sessions, when he sets up camps in the countryside
for a month or so to listen to people's grievances. ``Respect (for
the sultan) is a duty, and his command must be obeyed,'' says
Article 41 of the basic law.
</P>
<P>
   People complain of the increasingly high cost of living _ the
difficulty, for instance, of affording four wives _ but annual
income per Omani is more than $10,000. There is no income tax, and
private business is heavily subsidized by a government that wants
to diversify away from oil. Health and education are free.
</P>
<P>
   Life is considerably less comfortable, naturally, for the
immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, on whom the Omanis depend.
</P>
<P>
   In line with other Gulf states, Oman's stated policy is to
replace its expatriate workers _ estimated at 400,000 in a
population of 2 million _ with its own citizens. And, indeed,
Omanis can now be found working in hotels, though not sweeping the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Oman overturns some of the stereotypical images of an oil-rich
desert country. It produces only about 900,000 barrels a day _
one-third of Britain's production _ though the wealth of Omani
merchants is legendary.
</P>
<P>
   Its past empires, which took in bits of Africa and India, have
given the country a racially mixed population. Its mountain ranges
and monsoon climate in the south make it look and feel different.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's influence remains strong, in the visible shape of road
cones and parking tickets, and less visibly in weapons and
advisers. Westerners have to be peeled away by their fingertips at
the end of their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Omanis seem to have a genuine affection for their short,
fatherly ruler, who in his dress and appearance looks much like all
those ancestors who have been running the country since 1749. He
went to Sandhurst, a military academy in Britain, and also studied
local government there.
</P>
<P>
   He is held in particularly high esteem by Oman's women, who can
now be found working in most professions and at most levels. One
Omani woman, paying him the highest compliment she could, suggested
that he understood women because ``he's half a woman himself.''
</P>
<P>
   His distaste for married life means he has no heir. He has,
however, laid down a law for finding a successor after his death.
</P>
<P>
   The male members of the royal family have three days to meet and
agree on the next sultan, who must be a male descendant of the
ruling family. If they fail, the defense ministry will open an
envelope in which Qaboos has written his choice _ which must, of
course, be accepted. &QL;

   TRIPOLI _ Securing the release of six hostages _ French, German
and South African _ from their Philippine kidnappers has won
Colonel Muammar Qaddafi more western praise than any single act in
his 31-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   At a handover ceremony in Tripoli on Tuesday, European ministers
trotted on to the podium to heap thanks on the Libyan leader and
his charitable foundation. Two of the hostages wore Qaddafi
T-shirts. Libyans, South Africans and Europeans hugged and kissed.
</P>
<P>
   Libya had come in from the cold. But the ceremony itself invites
questions about whether the Great Leader has indeed changed.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the backdrop. The ceremony was held in the
Azizia barracks, a concrete fortress in the heart of Tripoli
fortified with tanks, lookout posts and beds of nails.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the podium lay the ruined shell of Colonel Qaddafi's
military headquarters, bombed by the United States in 1986 and left
untouched except for the sculpture of a green fist crushing an
American aircraft. People were taken on guided tours to the spot
where the colonel's adopted daughter, Hana, was killed by an
American missile.
</P>
<P>
   This was hardly the theatre of reconciliation. Then there was
the treatment of the international press, invited and lodged at
state expense.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of waiting for the hostages, the handover should
have been a crowning moment. But Libya botched it. On arrival in
the barracks, the security forces herded the press pack into a
hall, locked the door, drew the curtains and posted guards with
machine guns at the exits.
</P>
<P>
   Grateful governments may prefer not to remember that the reason
for Libya's clout with the Abu Sayyaf hostage-takers is its

Libyan officials did little to disguise the fact that the
Philippine rebels were trained in their country.

<P>
   Seif al Islam, Colonel Qaddafi's 26-year-old son who keeps
Bengal tigers as pets, staged a press conference in which he
reiterated Libya's support for the Muslim struggle for autonomy in
the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as president of the Qaddafi Foundation, the front for
Libya's mediation in the Philippines, he insisted that Libya itself
had not paid a ransom. All the money, he said, had come from
foreign individuals and, he paused, ``institutions.''

<P>
   It had seemed as if he might have said ``governments.'' Had his
charitable foundation served as a conduit for governments wanting

Colonel Qaddafi over the hostages smacks of its readiness to do
other business with him as well.

<P>
   Obstacles remain, but step by step the rehabilitation is going

giving his assurance that the trial ``would not be used to
undermine the Libyan regime.''
</P>
<P>
   In France, a court is due on Sept. 8 to examine Libyan
responsibility for a French airliner brought down by a bomb over
Chad in 1989. Diplomats expect sanctions to be lifted _ they are

   In North Africa's most totalitarian state, diplomats no longer
talk of human rights. They talk of contracts.

spend. Its telephone system is North Africa's most archaic. And
even its four-star hotels have power cuts.

<P>
   Britain is one of the hopefuls. Although no contracts have yet
been signed, British Airways was the first airline back in Libya
after the embargo was lifted last year, and British Aerospace is
said to have begun training programs for Libyans.

   TRIPOLI _ Securing the release of six hostages _ French, German
and South African _ from their Philippine kidnappers has won
Colonel Muammar Qaddafi more western praise than any single act in
his 31-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   At a handover ceremony in Tripoli on Tuesday, European ministers
trotted on to the podium to heap thanks on the Libyan leader and
his charitable foundation. Two of the hostages wore Qaddafi
T-shirts. Libyans, South Africans and Europeans hugged and kissed.
</P>
<P>
   Libya had come in from the cold. But the ceremony itself invites
questions about whether the Great Leader has indeed changed.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the backdrop. The ceremony was held in the
Azizia barracks, a concrete fortress in the heart of Tripoli
fortified with tanks, lookout posts and beds of nails.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the podium lay the ruined shell of Colonel Qaddafi's
military headquarters, bombed by the United States in 1986 and left
untouched except for the sculpture of a green fist crushing an
American aircraft. People were taken on guided tours to the spot
where the colonel's adopted daughter, Hana, was killed by an
American missile.
</P>
<P>
   This was hardly the theatre of reconciliation. Then there was
the treatment of the international press, invited and lodged at
state expense.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of waiting for the hostages, the handover should
have been a crowning moment. But Libya botched it. On arrival in
the barracks, the security forces herded the press pack into a
hall, locked the door, drew the curtains and posted guards with
machine guns at the exits.
</P>
<P>
   Grateful governments may prefer not to remember that the reason
for Libya's clout with the Abu Sayyaf hostage-takers is its
reputation as the bankroller of revolutionary movements worldwide.
Libyan officials did little to disguise the fact that the
Philippine rebels were trained in their country.

   VANCOUVER _ Air Canada's pilots should have known that their
threat of a Labor Day strike was a non-starter. It was never going
to win support from the travelling public, seething at the rotten
service provided lately by Canada's dominant carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the government going to sit back: it stood ready to use
back-to-work legislation to prevent the country (the world's
second-largest and heavily dependent on air travel) being brought
to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   So there was relief, but no surprise, on Aug. 28, when the
pilots and management reached a tentative agreement. But everyone
knows the deal will not solve the biggest problem facing Canada's
airline business: lack of competition.
</P>
<P>
   In the shakeout that followed deregulation in the 1980s, the
industry has become highly concentrated. Last December, Air Canada
emerged as the big winner when it absorbed its main (and bankrupt)
rival, Canadian Airlines International (CAI), and gained
near-monopoly dominance.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Canada family, which includes various regional carriers
as well as CAI, sells about 80 percent of domestic airline tickets
and takes in about 90 percent of ticket revenues. Of the top 200
domestic routes, over half have no carrier other than Air Canada or
one of its subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, then, that the airline stands accused of corporate
arrogance and customer neglect. Since spring, travellers have
complained widely about cancelled or delayed flights, long check-in
delays, lost baggage, overbooking and high prices.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study commissioned by the provincial government of
British Columbia, which is worried for its tourism industry, found
that Air Canada has reduced the number of domestic flights by a
quarter during the past year, and has boosted average fares, mostly
by cutting discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Air Canada's boss, Robert Milton, recently conceded that the
airline had done ``an unacceptable job'' at a time of buoyant
profits. He has promised to hire 2,000 new employees to improve
customer service over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   To some, this situation cries out for draconian measures to
inject more competition. Not so says the federal government, which
hopes that more modest measures will do.
</P>
<P>
   Of its conditions for approving the merger with CAI, the biggest
was that Air Canada should sell one of its subsidiaries, Canadian
Regional Airlines, which has 56 aircraft. But this sale failed to
spark interest from potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The government also gave some new powers to the Canadian
Transportation Agency to monitor prices and address complaints.
Although analysts doubt this will have much effect, it has at least
encouraged smaller operators to nibble at Air Canada's toes.
</P>
<P>
   Fastest off the mark is WestJet, a Calgary-based discount
carrier that has added flights to three eastern cities and is
buying up aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Three charter carriers (Canada 3000, Air Transat and Royal) have
announced new scheduled services, and two newcomers (CanJet and
RootsAir) are gearing up.
</P>
<P>
   These developments will perk up competition between big cities,
but they are hardly enough to shake Air Canada's dominance.
</P>
<P>
   WestJet, the charter carriers and other small fry together
account for less than a quarter of seat capacity. Even if they all
follow through on expansion plans, their combined fleet will grow
only from 75 to 137 aircraft by 2005, compared with Air Canada's
projected fleet of 462.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, the federal transport minister, David Collenette,
has given warning that, if his government fails to encourage enough
competition, he will consider inviting foreign airlines _ which are
currently barred from owning more than 25 percent of a Canadian
airline _ to compete freely on Canadian routes.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, that idea was unthinkable. Now, more and more
disgruntled travellers, politicians included, think its time has
come. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Neon road signs, neatly trimmed road shoulders,
pothole-free asphalt _ the Rublevo-Uspenskoe Shossee _ known as the
Rublevka _ to the northwest of Moscow, is by far the best country
road in all Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It was along this route that Russia's rulers whizzed in their
limousines on Aug. 27 to inspect a spectacular fire at the
country's tallest building, the Moscow television tower.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the two bits of infrastructure is telling.
The Rublevka, which leads to the most exclusive residential
district in Russia, is absurdly splendid and maintained to
comically high standards.
</P>
<P>
   Armies of workers make sure that not a flake of snow sullies its
surface in winter. Traffic regulations are pedantically enforced
for ordinary drivers _ who are barred from using it altogether on
Friday afternoons, so that the nobs can get home quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Ostankino TV tower, built in 1967, was the opposite: shabby

   But that could change if investment conditions were better. The

   MOSCOW _ Neon road signs, neatly trimmed road shoulders,
pothole-free asphalt _ the Rublevo-Uspenskoe Shossee _ known as the
Rublevka _ to the northwest of Moscow, is by far the best country
road in all Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It was along this route that Russia's rulers whizzed in their
limousines on Aug. 27 to inspect a spectacular fire at the
country's tallest building, the Moscow television tower.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the two bits of infrastructure is telling.
The Rublevka, which leads to the most exclusive residential
district in Russia, is absurdly splendid and maintained to
comically high standards.
</P>
<P>
   Armies of workers make sure that not a flake of snow sullies its
surface in winter. Traffic regulations are pedantically enforced
for ordinary drivers _ who are barred from using it altogether on
Friday afternoons, so that the nobs can get home quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Ostankino TV tower, built in 1967, was the opposite: shabby

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Hearts that beat out of time usually need a shock to
get them into a better rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   One of Medtronic's niftiest new products is an implantable
cardiac defibrillator that is not only forceful enough to jolt the
organ into productive beating but, thanks to its powerful computer
chip, smart enough to tell how the heart has gone wrong, and to
deliver the right signal to alter its course.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same could be said of Medtronic's boss, Bill George.
</P>
<P>
   When he joined the Minneapolis-based firm in 1989, it was a $1
billion company with most of its sales in pacemakers. Today it is
worth $63 billion, and its $5 billion in sales worldwide come from
a variety of cardiovascular devices, neurological stimulators,
drug-delivery systems and spinal implants.
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic is widely seen as the most innovative and market-savvy
firm in the $160 billion-a-year medical-device industry, and George
as one of the best strategists in health care.
</P>
<P>
   Although George talks with impressive ease about
``supraventricular tachycardia,'' he did not train as a doctor, but
as an engineer and manager. He joined Medtronic as chief operating
officer after stints at Litton Industries and at Honeywell, where
he was head of research and development for solid-state
electronics.
</P>
<P>
   With George in charge, Medtronic came in for reconstructive
surgery. Lead times for devices were reduced from four years to 18
months. George's policy is that 70 percent of revenue should come
from products launched in the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   The devices are getting smaller and more sophisticated. But in
order to make the grade they have to cost less to manufacture than
their predecessors did.
</P>
<P>
   George reckons that his background in other technologies has
stood him in good stead at Medtronic; in many ways, the device
industry is ``more like Silicon Valley than New Jersey.'' where
America's pharmaceutical giants are clustered.
</P>
<P>
   Developing even the most complex device needs only a third of
the money and half the time required by a fancy new drug. Unlike
most drugs, whose formulation remains virtually unchanged in their
long years of patent protection, Medtronic's devices go through a
quick succession of incremental improvements, much like the various
incarnations of Microsoft Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Key to Medtronic's technical success, says George, is iterative
innovation, where the company's engineers sit down time and again
with doctors to see how a device can be improved. Indeed, it is
doctors who usually come up with the ideas in the first place,
helping Medtronic spot potentially lucrative unmet medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   These sorts of pressures, long faced by medical-device
companies, are now also confronted by firms in industries such as
pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. How to stay creative while your
firm is ballooning through consolidation is a pressing issue for
pharmaceutical executives.
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic, which has spent $9 billion acquiring companies with
top-flight research and strong sales in the past two years, tries
to keep its research and development units small in order to avoid
swamping their bright sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic has long had to wrangle with Medicare, America's
government-sponsored health insurance, to get it to cover the use
of new devices, and to persuade short-term-oriented managed-care
companies that expensive devices can yield long-term savings.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, drug firms are struggling to come to grips with cost
containment and demanding purchasers. But Medtronic's success shows
that it is possible to sustain a profitable business in the face of
such obstacles, so long as you have a good eye for new
applications, good research and forceful marketing.
</P>
<P>
   George now has his eye on higher hurdles. Perhaps the biggest
challenge facing health care is to cope with a rise in chronic
disease in ways that satisfy increasingly demanding patients
without bankrupting national health care systems.
</P>
<P>
   Making devices for such chronic conditions as heart failure and
Parkinson's disease, Medtronic has an obvious interest in finding
better ways of managing long-term disease, and making money in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Key to success, in George's view, is enabling patients to take
more control of their own health. To do so, they need better
information and here, George has turned to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Medtronic signed a $100 million deal with
Healtheon/Web MD to provide material about chronic disease and the
firm's technologies to those who visit the Web site. This alliance
allows Medtronic to reach out beyond doctors to patients, just as
drug firms have succeeded with direct-to-consumer advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But George has even grander plans than this. Some of the firm's
newest devices are essentially ``black boxes'' for the body, which
continuously monitor functions such as the heart's electrical
activity, and record this information on a chip that can then be
read by special equipment at a clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic is now developing technologies that could send such
data, via radio signals and the Internet, to doctors, allowing
monitoring from afar and even the reprogramming of the device
without having to reopen the patient.
</P>
<P>
   George would like to see all this in place before 2010. He will
be long gone by then: he plans to step down next year, having
completed what he believes to be the optimal life cycle of a chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Faulkner, a medical-devices analyst at Chase H&AMP;Q, an
investment bank, wonders how Medtronic will do without George,
since he casts a long shadow for even the most able successor.
</P>
<P>
   But no doubt he will be monitoring Medtronic from afar, if not
delivering a few more shocks to its system. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Hearts that beat out of time usually need a shock to
get them into a better rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   One of Medtronic's niftiest new products is an implantable
cardiac defibrillator that is not only forceful enough to jolt the
organ into productive beating but, thanks to its powerful computer
chip, smart enough to tell how the heart has gone wrong, and to
deliver the right signal to alter its course.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same could be said of Medtronic's boss, Bill George.
</P>
<P>
   When he joined the Minneapolis-based firm in 1989, it was a $1
billion company with most of its sales in pacemakers. Today it is
worth $63 billion, and its $5 billion in sales worldwide come from
a variety of cardiovascular devices, neurological stimulators,
drug-delivery systems and spinal implants.
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic is widely seen as the most innovative and market-savvy
firm in the $160 billion-a-year medical-device industry, and George
as one of the best strategists in health care.
</P>
<P>
   Although George talks with impressive ease about
``supraventricular tachycardia,'' he did not train as a doctor, but
as an engineer and manager. He joined Medtronic as chief operating
officer after stints at Litton Industries and at Honeywell, where
he was head of research and development for solid-state
electronics.
</P>
<P>
   With George in charge, Medtronic came in for reconstructive
surgery. Lead times for devices were reduced from four years to 18
months. George's policy is that 70 percent of revenue should come
from products launched in the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   The devices are getting smaller and more sophisticated. But in
order to make the grade they have to cost less to manufacture than
their predecessors did.
</P>
<P>
   George reckons that his background in other technologies has
stood him in good stead at Medtronic; in many ways, the device
industry is ``more like Silicon Valley than New Jersey.'' where
America's pharmaceutical giants are clustered.
</P>
<P>
   Developing even the most complex device needs only a third of
the money and half the time required by a fancy new drug. Unlike
most drugs, whose formulation remains virtually unchanged in their
long years of patent protection, Medtronic's devices go through a
quick succession of incremental improvements, much like the various
incarnations of Microsoft Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Key to Medtronic's technical success, says George, is iterative
innovation, where the company's engineers sit down time and again
with doctors to see how a device can be improved. Indeed, it is
doctors who usually come up with the ideas in the first place,
helping Medtronic spot potentially lucrative unmet medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   These sorts of pressures, long faced by medical-device
companies, are now also confronted by firms in industries such as
pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. How to stay creative while your
firm is ballooning through consolidation is a pressing issue for
pharmaceutical executives.
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic, which has spent $9 billion acquiring companies with
top-flight research and strong sales in the past two years, tries
to keep its research and development units small in order to avoid
swamping their bright sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic has long had to wrangle with Medicare, America's
government-sponsored health insurance, to get it to cover the use
of new devices, and to persuade short-term-oriented managed-care
companies that expensive devices can yield long-term savings.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, drug firms are struggling to come to grips with cost
containment and demanding purchasers. But Medtronic's success shows
that it is possible to sustain a profitable business in the face of
such obstacles, so long as you have a good eye for new
applications, good research and forceful marketing.
</P>
<P>
   George now has his eye on higher hurdles. Perhaps the biggest
challenge facing health care is to cope with a rise in chronic
disease in ways that satisfy increasingly demanding patients
without bankrupting national health care systems.
</P>
<P>
   Making devices for such chronic conditions as heart failure and
Parkinson's disease, Medtronic has an obvious interest in finding
better ways of managing long-term disease, and making money in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Key to success, in George's view, is enabling patients to take
more control of their own health. To do so, they need better
information and here, George has turned to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Medtronic signed a $100 million deal with
Healtheon/Web MD to provide material about chronic disease and the
firm's technologies to those who visit the Web site. This alliance
allows Medtronic to reach out beyond doctors to patients, just as
drug firms have succeeded with direct-to-consumer advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But George has even grander plans than this. Some of the firm's
newest devices are essentially ``black boxes'' for the body, which
continuously monitor functions such as the heart's electrical
activity, and record this information on a chip that can then be
read by special equipment at a clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic is now developing technologies that could send such
data, via radio signals and the Internet, to doctors, allowing
monitoring from afar and even the reprogramming of the device
without having to reopen the patient.
</P>
<P>
   George would like to see all this in place before 2010. He will
be long gone by then: he plans to step down next year, having
completed what he believes to be the optimal life cycle of a chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Faulkner, a medical-devices analyst at Chase H&AMP;Q, an
investment bank, wonders how Medtronic will do without George,
since he casts a long shadow for even the most able successor.
</P>
<P>
   But no doubt he will be monitoring Medtronic from afar, if not
delivering a few more shocks to its system. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Is bigger really better? That it is has been a
seemingly immutable truth for American motorists since the finned
dinosaurs of the 1950s roamed the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a period after the oil shocks of the 1970s when small
briefly did look beautiful, the spirit of the 1959 Cadillac
Eldorado convertible has been reincarnated in the massive (and
massively gas-guzzling) Cadillac Escalade and similar so-called
sport-utility vehicles (SUVs).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many analysts believe the success of SUVs has been a
populist reaction against America's restrictive fuel-economy laws,
which force manufacturers to sell small, efficient passenger cars,
but permit them to get away with ever larger light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   At present, an American vehicle-maker's range of passenger cars
must deliver, on average, 27.5 miles per American gallon (8.6
litres/100km), while SUVs, pick-ups and other trucks squeak by at a
mere 20.7 mpg.
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least, the political will has not been there to make
these rules fairer. But this year's unexpectedly steep rise in
American gas prices has created a new mood of conservation _ and
this time consumers, rather than legislators, are taking the lead.
</P>
<P>
   In response Ford, for one, has announced plans to boost the
fuel-economy of its SUVs by 25 percent between now and 2005. On
average, that would save 1,700 gallons of fuel over the life of a
vehicle, and even in America, where gas remains reasonably cheap,
that adds up to a saving of several thousand dollars. But achieving
this goal will not be easy for Ford or, indeed, for anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   There are several obvious ways to improve fuel-efficiency, but
improved aerodynamics is probably the easiest and most
cost-effective. Reduce wind resistance and you can reduce fuel
consumption by several percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   With SUVs, that may mean reducing ``ride height'' (the distance
between the underside of the vehicle and the road). The challenge
is to do this without limiting a vehicle's ``off-roadability.''
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen's new Audi All-Road SUV offers an innovative
solution: a system that brings the vehicle nearly 5cm nearer to the
ground at highway speeds by lowering the suspension pneumatically
as the vehicle travels faster.
</P>
<P>
   Better engines are another route to fuel-efficiency. General
Motors's ``displacement-on-demand'' system is one approach. It
works by shutting one or more cylinders off when their power is not
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Saab, a Swedish firm, has a different idea. Its Variable
Compression Engine can alter its compression ratio (the volume in a
cylinder when the piston is up compared with the volume when it is
down) from 14-1 to 8-1, depending on the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   This allows the vehicle to run at maximum torque all the time,
and could thus reduce fuel consumption by up to 30 percent,
according to Peter Augustsson, the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the engine is optimized, however, the gearbox can still
be a source of inefficiency. The automatic gearboxes so popular in
America are an important source of energy losses. They rely on a
fluid, rather than a mechanical clutch, to transmit the engine's
torque to the wheels, and this is inefficient.
</P>
<P>
   However, new six-speed gearboxes should help, by matching the
engine's speed more closely to the vehicle's road speed. And
automatically shifted ``manual'' transmissions, in which the
process of de-clutching and changing gear is done
electromechanically, will eliminate the inefficiencies of current
automatic gearboxes without the tedium of using a gear stick.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to reduce fuel consumption is to reduce weight.
According to a series of studies by AutoPacific, a market-research
firm, American motorists are reluctant to trade size and
performance for the better fuel-economy they seem to desire.
</P>
<P>
   But while size matters, mass, apparently, does not. And trimming
excess weight can have a dramatic effect: every 100lb (about 45kg)
removed from a Ford Focus, for example, improves its fuel-economy
by a full mile a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that lightweight materials will be used much more
in the light trucks and passenger cars of the not-very-distant
future than they are in those of today.
</P>
<P>
   Plastics and composites are already the materials of choice for
interior panels. Magnesium cross-members and steering-wheel columns
are increasingly common, as are aluminium engines and suspension
components.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen has already put two aluminium-intensive vehicles
(admittedly not SUVs) into production: the luxury Audi A8, and the
mass market Audi A2.
</P>
<P>
   And Honda's new Insight sedan car is made largely of aluminium
and composites. The Insight also uses another weapon in the
fuel-efficiency armory. It is a hybrid, powered by both a small
internal combustion engine and a battery-driven electric motor.
</P>
<P>
   During acceleration, the electric motor acts as an ``electric
supercharger,'' providing extra power to supplement that generated
by the gas engine. During braking, it becomes a generator,
recapturing energy normally lost as frictional heat.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not yet clear that hybrids make economic sense.
Although they use less fuel than conventional vehicles, they cost
more to manufacture; Toyota, which currently makes a hybrid sedan
car called the Prius, is estimated to lose $20,000 on every one it
sells.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ford intends to introduce a hybrid version of its
new Escape SUV in 2003. Whereas the basic, four-cylinder version of
the SUV gets 23 mpg, the Escape HEV (hybrid-electric vehicle)
should average 40.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, meanwhile, intends to release hybrid-electric
versions of its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra by 2003. Its
engineers forecast at least a 15 percent increase in mileage.
</P>
<P>
   And DaimlerChrysler's American Dodge division has an HEV version
of its Durango SUV in development, although it says that it will
not launch it unless the American Congress enacts a proposed tax
credit for fuel-efficient vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But if the whole SUV-phenomenon really is caused by an anomaly
in the law, perhaps it is that which needs correcting in the first
place. &QL;

   When a company's products turn out to have hurt people, or
worse, that slavering sound you hear is of a thousand lawyers
licking their lips. Shareholders, meanwhile, hold their breath. So
it was in the past two weeks with Ford's and
Bridgestone/Firestone's recall of 6.5 million tires, and with
Mitsubishi's separate recall in Japan of 620,000 cars. Punishment
of some sort will presumably be meted out. The question is whether
it will be meted out to the right people. Given how the system
currently works, that looks unlikely. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Who could have guessed it? America is into the tenth
year of the longest economic boom in its history. The country is
minting millionaires so fast that psychologists have discovered a
whole new mental disorder _ ``affluenza'' _ that results from
having huge piles of cash dumped on your head. And yet Al Gore,

   NEW YORK _ When Al Gore planted that kiss full on Tipper at the
Democratic Convention, he may have given almost as much pleasure to
the current first lady as the (maybe) next one. This random act of
passion helped give the vice president such a lift in the opinion
polls that the George Bush campaign has abandoned any lingering
thoughts of putting up a serious fight in New York state. If, as
now seems likely, Gore carries the state by a mile on Nov. 7, many
supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton believe there is no way she
can lose the Senate election on the same day. Are they right? &QL;

   WAKEFIELD FARM, ZIMBABWE _ It was a rollicking party. Robert
Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, arrived in one of his helicopters.
Cows were slaughtered, beer gushed, crowds danced, and TV cameras
recorded the joyful event for posterity. The occasion was the
resettlement of 51 black families on Wakefield ``A,'' a large
commercial farm, bought by the government from willing sellers two
years ago. The aim was to build a class of successful, independent
black farmers in Zimbabwe. The government promised the new
smallholders seeds, fertilizer, and all the help necessary to get
them started. It then forgot about them. Wild grasses have since
reclaimed what were once prime tobacco fields. This is the
land-reform program that Mugabe is now seeking to accelerate _
despite its disastrous toll on the country. &QL;

   MUSCAT _ Not so very long ago, Oman's borders were sealed to the
outside world and Muscat's gates clanged shut at sunset. Everything
began to change in 1970, when Sultan Qaboos, then aged 30,
overthrew his medieval-minded father, unlocked the gates, and
ushered in a brave new world. The sultan has even moved his
country, very gradually, towards a slightly more democratic system.
Women can both vote and stand for election. It would be foolish,
says the sultan, to waste half the country's talents. &QL;

   TRIPOLI _ Securing the release of six hostages _ French, German

Colonel Muammar Qaddafi more western praise than any single act in
his 31-year reign. Libya had come in from the cold. Europe's
readiness to do business with Qaddafi over the hostages smacks of
its readiness to do other business with him as well. In North
Africa's most totalitarian state, diplomats no longer talk of human
rights. They talk of contracts. The opportunities are vast. Libya
has a ten-year backlog of infrastructure to upgrade and annual oil
revenues of $10 billion to spend. It's no wonder outsiders were so
anxious this week to kiss the ring of Qaddafi. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ The fire-ravaged Ostankino TV tower in Moscow was
shabby and badly run. Its managers plastered it with lucrative
extra antennae, but did not bother to update its fire-safely
systems, which proved dismally inadequate. As such, it is very much
a microcosm of the dire state of Russia's entire infrastructure.
The country invests very little compared with other emerging
economies, including post-communist ones. As a result, it is
falling behind, and apart. &QL;

Much the same could be said of Medtronic's boss, Bill George.
Thanks to George, Minneapolis-based Medtronic is widely seen as the
most innovative and market-savvy firm in the $160 billion-a-year
medical-device industry, and George as one of the best strategists

   (UNDATED) _ Currently, an American vehicle-maker's range of
passenger cars must deliver, on average, 27.5 miles per American
gallon of gas, while SUVs, pick-ups and other trucks squeak by at a
mere 20.7 mpg. But his year's unexpectedly steep rise in American
gas prices has created a new mood of conservation _ and this time
consumers, rather than legislators, are taking the lead. In
response Ford, for one, has announced plans to boost the
fuel-economy of its SUVs by 25 percent between now and 2005. On
average, that would save 1,700 gallons of fuel over the life of the
vehicle. But achieving this goal will not be easy for Ford or,
indeed, for anyone else. &QL;

   When a company's products turn out to have hurt people, or
worse, that slavering sound you hear is of a thousand lawyers
licking their lips. Shareholders, meanwhile, hold their breath. So
it was in the past two weeks with Ford's and
Bridgestone/Firestone's recall of 6.5 million tires, and with
Mitsubishi's separate recall in Japan of 620,000 cars. Punishment
of some sort will presumably be meted out. The question is whether
it will be meted out to the right people. Given how the system
currently works, that looks unlikely. &QL;

<P>
   These are cracking good times in the hostage business. In 1999,
according to an insurance company that tries to keep count, the
numbers taken captive increased by 6 percent over 1998, and it has
been like that for several years: kidnappings for ransom are up by
70 percent over eight years. The kidnappers, evidentally, have
learned two lessons: holding a few hostages keeps the army away;
grabbing more keeps the money rolling in. &QL;

   A new threat looms over Asia: the threat of diplomatic

America, China, Japan and Russia, the thaw between the Koreas has
set everyone scrambling. In theory, an easing of tensions along
East Asia's last Cold-War frontier ought to benefit all. In
reality, bad habits and new forces at work on old rivalries mean
tricky times ahead. &QL;

`THE MOST AMAZING THING HAPPENED' 

</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day in June, Rebecca Latimer, deciding she wanted to die,
stopped eating.
</P>
<P>
   At first she drank fruit juice and then switched only to water,
except for a couple of sips of sherry for farewell toasts with
friends. It took Rebecca 52 days to achieve a dignified, voluntary
ending.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca was 94. She said she didn't want to die from a disease,
and although she was still relatively healthy the machine was
starting to struggle. Two small strokes hit her earlier this year,
and while her quick mind barely missed a beat, the strokes left her
rocky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any number of things could happen to me now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The greater calamity was her fading eyesight. Rebecca was an
author, best known for the book published when she was 91 called,
``You're Not Old Until You're Ninety ... Best to be Prepared,
However.''
</P>
<P>
   She not only wrote books, she wrote letters and people wrote
back to her. She read voraciously and loved the printed word.
Without that pleasure she didn't want to continue and, given her
age, thought it only a matter of time until her body called it
quits.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a fit when they hear what I'm doing,'' she said.
But she explained it was her decision. ``I have a contract with
myself. I don't want to change my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Her decision was in keeping with how Rebecca had lived the last
part of her life.
</P>
<P>
   The first 60 years Rebecca lived by others' rules. She grew up
at a time when an educated woman was considered a marriage
liability and so had never gone to college. After marrying her
diplomat husband, Fred, she enjoyed the status and travel
privileges of his state department job. But she felt hampered in
her own growth. That was the story of her book, how at age 60 she
began to educate and liberate herself.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca's life finally belonged to her. That she wanted to
control it now was in keeping with this new strong-willed Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
   I interviewed her when her book came out, and we decided to
become friends. We'd regularly meet for tea and cookies at her
yellow house in Sonoma, where the typical Rebecca beginning would
be, ``The most amazing thing happened.'' Or, ``Let me tell you
something.''
</P>
<P>
   It could apply to someone she had just met, for she was always
collecting friends, or connected with a favorite memory, like the
time she was stranded in an ice storm on the North Sea.
</P>
<P>
   I came back from vacation to discover that Rebecca had taken to
her bed. By then it had been 10 days, and I phoned her, surprised
to hear the same chirpy voice, this time explaining she had begun
to fast.
</P>
<P>
   I'd never seen Rebecca in bed. Normally she was dressed in jeans
and sport shoes and had a scarf or combs in her hair. I was used to
the spry Rebecca. This one grew as fragile as one of her tea cups.
But she never stopped looking like Rebecca. Or talking like her,
even when her voice became a raspy, labored whisper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very weird, but it's interesting,'' she said about
dying. ``I'm not hungry and I'm not in pain. I just lie here and
people come and tell me how wonderful I am. I didn't expect to
enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   After she made her decision she called together family and
friends. She had enough money to hire round-the-clock help for what
she thought might be, at most, a six-week process. She didn't need
special medical attention, and toward the end hospice came in to
supplement her care-givers.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother had gone blind, and Rebecca, who had macular
degeneration, feared total loss of sight. She'd cared for her
adored husband, Fred, for years until he died two years ago in a
nursing home following a series of strokes. She didn't want that
for herself. Nor did her sons, Doug and John. But they also were
distraught about losing her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me to wait another two months,'' said Rebecca. ``But
then if I did it would be my birthday and then they'd say wait
until Thanksgiving and then Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son John said, ``Our biggest concern was that she wasn't
doing this out of depression. But she was very logical about it and
she had the willpower to do it. For my mother this was the
practical way to go. It was a polite suicide. She didn't jump off a
bridge and shock everyone. We all knew what she was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug needed convincing by his father. Days after Rebecca
announced her decision, Doug was in his Redwood City office when he
suddenly thought of his late father. It wasn't a vision, because
Doug doesn't think in terms of visions. He said, ``My logical mind
doesn't allow for a sentient consciousness after death.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was his father's face, he said, and while he didn't hear
a voice, three words popped into his mind. They were, ``Send her
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca loved telling that story, not only because it comforted
her son but validated her choice. ``When I heard that, I knew I was
doing the right thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of her visitors tried to talk her out of it. ``They say
things like I should wait for God to take me, that I have a job to
do that won't get done and I'll have to come back and redo it. I'm
very polite. I listen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca's doctor visited. Rebecca said, ``Can you believe it, a
doctor who makes house calls? I think she wanted to make sure I was
of sound mind and knew what I was doing. We had a wonderful talk
and she told me I was the sanest person she knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Above Rebecca's bed hung a ``Do Not Resuscitate'' sign and two
maps of Turkey, her favorite of all the countries in which she and
Fred lived.
</P>
<P>
   On a table was the book ``Light on Aging and Dying,'' written by
Helen Nearing, who with her husband, Scott, wrote books about
simple living. Scott Nearing stopped eating when he was 100 years
old. Now Rebecca was following his path, and for those who still
needed convincing, Rebecca offered copies of a quote by Helen
Nearing in which she supported her husband's death.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca believed in a power, although she wasn't sure if she
called it God. As much as she read of philosophy, she said, ``No
one really knows what happens after, do they?''
</P>
<P>
   I asked her what she thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the part with the white light and the tunnel may be
true, because so many people who come close to death speak of it.
After that, I think you are given something to do. I think we come
back. I'd like to come back on another planet. Wouldn't that be
interesting?''
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca became impatient. It was taking too long. ``I think I've
taught people enough now about dying,'' she told me one day. Her
friend Jean said, ``She is not clinging to life. Life is clinging
to her.''
</P>
<P>
   She slept a lot. She didn't want to listen to music. She said,
``Music makes me emotional and I don't want to become emotional.''
But she had a tape of an Australian friend's poetry which she
played over and over.
</P>
<P>
   She had so many visitors her caregiver needed an appointment
book. Sark, the writer and a new friend, came, as did a
Congregational church leader who was not her minister but someone
she liked trading ideas with. Her friend Lois was there when a male
caller was announced and Rebecca rallied. ``Quick. Get my brush.
Make me presentable.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked her what she thought of when she was alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of how it will be. I'm told it will be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure who told her it would be nice, but it apparently
was. Rebecca didn't sleep the last night but held hands with her
sons and friend Lois. She also talked and argued with people only
she could see, ``someone over my left shoulder,'' said Lois.
</P>
<P>
   That next morning she told her son John, ``I'm going,'' and in
the early afternoon she became unconscious, breathed hard for a
while, paused, smiled and left.
</P>
<P>
   But the most amazing thing happened. After Rebecca died, her son
Doug joined Lois on the back patio. A dragonfly fluttered around
both their heads. Then there were several dragonflies. Lois says
there were more than a dozen. When the mortuary came for Rebecca's
body the dragonflies left.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca always said, ``If Fred can come back, I can.''

<P>
   The Americans With Disabilities Act was passed in 1990 to ensure
that people with physical disabilities have reasonable access to
public places.
</P>
<P>
   The law mandates special parking spaces, wheelchair ramps and
doors that can be opened by a person in a wheelchair. While the law
was designed for people with disabilities, some of its provisions
have been beneficial for other groups, too. The curb cuts and wider
store aisles have been a boon to parents with baby carriages and
strollers.
</P>
<P>
   But how good is compliance? According to the May-June issue of
Public Health Nursing, it's been erratic.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers at the University of New Mexico examined local
shopping malls _ including those built after the law was passed _
they found a large number of violations. Some malls lacked proper
wheelchair ramps, while others had ramps that couldn't be used
because there were no curb cuts.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one item on which all malls scored 100 percent _
every mall surveyed had accessible pay phones.

   Rise above the crowd or sink beneath it. Leave other skaters
breathing your dust and out-slalom skiers. Get the upper hand on
your cat's litter box. Stand out, be different. The gear and
gadgets you see here are one of a kind, and your ticket to
coolness. Each item will add a dimension to your world that you can
get nowhere else, and chances are you'll be the only one on your
block who has one. And believe us, that counts for something.
</P>
<P>
   LIGHTHEADED
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, you've conquered your fear of heights and
you're ready to celebrate. You're not ready for skydiving and hang
gliding's just not your thing. Airplanes are, well, boring and with
those big balloons, who knows where you'll end up? Climbing a tall
ladder's no fun, so what's left? Why, your own personal, one-man
Parabounce balloon, of course. Tethered to the ground, over water
or even indoors, this 22-foot-diameter, polyurethane-coated nylon
sky chair inflates with helium in about 45 minutes and deflates in
15 minutes. It packs down small enough to fit inside your car
trunk, so you can carry it wherever you want. Parabounce will lift
you up to 100 feet so you can float quietly or, when that gets old,
try the flip chair for 360 degree somersaults. Or just wave to the
neighbors as they sulk with envy. Parabounce comes in yellow for
$20,000 from Hammacher Schlemmer.
</P>
<P>
   TOW 'N' GO
</P>
<P>
   Get me down, you say. You're a water person. No problem. We've
got the gear to give you a one-of-a-kind thrill over, on, or under
aqua pura. Waterskiing is a blast except when your towboat pilot
doesn't show because he's recovering from last night's party.
That's where Solo comes in _ a three-cylinder, 70-hp jet personal
water craft that offers self-service waterskiing and wakeboarding.
All controls, including turning, accelerating, stopping and horn,
are in the tow handle. Solo pulls you at a price tag of $6995.
</P>
<P>
   FLOATING ON AIR
</P>
<P>
   No thirst for that type of adrenaline rush? Maybe you like your
water sports on the mellow side, say, tubing down a quiet river,
fishing or just sightseeing on a calm lake or stream. Pow-R-Tube
with Pow-R-Pack, a motorized inner tube, is just the ticket.
Imagine the looks on downstream tubers' faces as you wave to them
tubing upstream. The system uses a 30-pound thrust Minn Kota
electric motor with five forward and three reverse speeds. You
steer with your feet. Deflated, the unit takes up less space than a
set of golf clubs. The tube will float $580 out of your checkbook,
with the Pow-R-Pack costing an additional $339.
</P>
<P>
   BUBBLE MACHINE
</P>
<P>
   Now that you've seen what's on the water, check out what's under
it with BOB (Breathing Observation Bubble). This underwater scooter
dispenses with conventional scuba gear. Sit comfortably, breathe
normally and smile at the fishes from inside your air-filled, clear
acrylic dome. BOB uses a ballast weight, an air tank and a
battery-powered 40-pound thrust electric motor for cruising at
speeds up to 2.5 knots. A steering wheel and instrument console
complete the $12,000 package. The scooter will dive to 40 feet and
allow you to be submerged for about 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   FOR GOODNESS' SKATES
</P>
<P>
   Inline skating may be all the rage, but Motosk8s will have every
other skater eating your dust as you smoke by 'em at an effortless
25 mph. The secret is a 22.5cc 1.5-horsepower 8-pound two-stroke
engine that's built right into one skate. The 15-ounce fuel tank
will keep you going for over an hour, and if you run out of gas,
you can skate conventionally to the nearest full-service filling
station and have the gas jockey fill you up. Don't forget to tell
him to wipe the windshield and check your air. If gas prices go any
higher you may find yourself surrounded by econo-minded
Motosk8ters, in which case consider springing for the hop-up kit
(bigger carburator, exhaust and more) to maintain your advantage
with a 35-mph top end. Motosk8s cost $549.
</P>
<P>
   MAGNIFICENT SEVEN
</P>
<P>
   What could be more cozy than a bicycle built for two? How about
a tricycle built for seven? Here's the perfect exercise machine for
large families, Sierra Club corporate board meetings or for taking
the whole neighborhood for a ride. Hand-built in the Netherlands,
this trike uses a heptagon-shaped base so that all riders face each
other. The frame mounts three motorcycle wheels set up like a
tricycle. Everybody grabs onto the circular handlebar. Seven sets
of pedals connect to the chain-drive system. The captain sits at
the rear, looks out for traffic and controls the steering and disc
brake while yelling at the galley slaves to pedal harder. An
exclusive Hammacher Schlemmer offering, the steel tube-constructed
trike sports an automotive paint finish and sells for 16 grand.
Shipping is $200 extra unless, of course, you ride it home. This is
one machine guaranteed to stop for any hitchhiker.
</P>
<P>
   CAT'S MEOW
</P>
<P>
   This automatic self-cleaning litter box is the next best thing
to your cat learning to flush the toilet. When your cat exits the
box, an electric eye signals the sifting comb, which sifts the
length of the box, harvests the ``crop'' and deposits it into an
airtight holding cartridge. The Littermaid cat box is available for
about $200 at all major pet stores and mass retailers.

   DOE PREDICTS A DARK FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy (DOE) says the way electric utilities
currently generate and distribute power could lead to massive
blackouts. A report by scientists at its Sandia National
Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., urges utilities to investigate
using a ''distributed power grid.'' The idea is to add hundreds of
traditional and nontraditional generation and storage devices _
including wind turbines, solar collectors and other generators _ to
the national electric power distribution network. ''Less reliance
on large-scale power plants would give the grid a more stable
foundation,'' says a lab spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   VALUE OF DNA MAP IN DOUBT
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from several research centers say the much heralded
''working draft'' of the human genome has limited value.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiled in June as a description of the biochemical code for
humans, it is acknowledged to have errors. More significant, only
85 percent of the DNA code has been assembled in the correct order.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing the job will take about two years. Locating all the
genes and describing their functions could take two decades.
</P>
<P>
   SEATBELTS INFLATE IN CRASHES
</P>
<P>
   Airbags work best when you sit crash-dummy straight. Trouble is,
people slouch. Behold the BF Goodrich inflatable seatbelt.
</P>
<P>
   ''During a significant crash, the system rapidly inflates a
bladder that runs the length of the belt,'' says a company
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Working with the existing airbag system, the belt inflates in
the first 10 milliseconds of a crash. Airbags deploy after 25 to 30
milliseconds. In the fraction of a second before airbag deployment,
the belt pushes the occupant into the proper seating position.
Thus, the force of the airbag is better tolerated and the bag
itself offers more protection, especially for kids. The belt's
cushioning also distributes the force of restraint across the body.
</P>
<P>
   SmartBelts will be available in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   SPY GEAR IN THE FACTORY
</P>
<P>
   Technology that was first developed for American spies will help
Ford Motor Co. track inventory and race parts to the right spot on
the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   California-based WhereNet Corp.'s stamp-size devices transmit
ultralow power signals that are so weak they normally disappear in
ambient electromagnetic noise. It's a clever way for one spy to
discreetly find another spy.
</P>
<P>
   In Ford plants, the WhereNet Material Call System receiver grid
listens for signals that let the person searching for parts know
when they are within 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   WhereNet devices may soon appear outside the workplace. The
company says an amusement park may loan parents devices that will
help them track wayward kids.
</P>
<P>
   NARROW TRACKS CUT DATA COSTS
</P>
<P>
   An improved production process makes it possible to construct
silicon recording heads that lay down three times as much data on
magnetic media.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of machining heads, Alditech processes batches of heads
on a single silicon wafer, using a method similar to making
integrated circuits.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a head that can read and write on narrower tracks.
A digital cassette that holds 30 GB of data can now store 100 GB,
according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Alditech (www.alditech. com) estimates media storage costs will
fall from dollars to pennies.
</P>
<P>
   TRAINING WINGS TAKE OFF
</P>
<P>
   Future Air Force and Navy pilots are getting new training wings.
The T-6A, a military version of Raytheon's Beech/Pilatus PC-9 Mk
II, will replace the aging fleets of Air Force T-37s and Navy
T-34s. The first fully aerobatic aircraft was accepted during a
ceremony at Randolph Air Force Base in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Built on an all-aluminum frame, the T-6A has a maximum takeoff
weight of 6,500 pounds. The high thrust-to-weight ratio makes for
fast climbs. It can reach 18,000 feet in less than 6 minutes. It
has a 31,000-foot ceiling and true airspeed in excess of 270 mph.
</P>
<P>
   BETTER NIGHT VISION
</P>
<P>
   The elite 75th Ranger Regiment has completed field testing the
next generation of night sights to be used on Army and Marine Corps
M-16s.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing less than 3 pounds, the rugged thermal targeting sights
will also be able to identify targets in bad daylight weather.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, the developer of the sights, says the same technology
can be incorporated into night vision aids for drivers and,
someday, helmet sights.
</P>
<P>
   Having the Ranger's stamp of approval, Sanders hopes to begin
production in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   THREE HULLS ARE BETTER THAN ONE
</P>
<P>
   The first of what may become a new class of fighting ships, the
trimaran warship, has been launched at Vosper Thornycroft's
Southampton, England, shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring the length of a football field, the research vessel
Triton is the world's biggest seagoing trimaran.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hull design _ a thin center hull and two outriggers _
was inspired by ocean racing yachts. It allows more open deck space
and is inherently faster and more stable than monohull designs.
</P>
<P>
   The British Defense Evaluation and Research Agency says it will
evaluate the design for its future surface combatant, a ship
intended to replace Type 22 and Type 23 frigates.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Builders of Seattle's Kingdome said it was strong enough to last
a millennium. Just a day shy of its 24th birthday, that prediction
came crashing to the ground. In a scant 16.8 seconds the world's
largest thin-shell concrete dome dissolved into a cloud of dust and
debris. Although explosives got credit for erasing the obsolete
sports arena, it was the relentless tug of gravity that actually
did most of the work, explains Mark Loizeaux. The president of
Controlled Demolition Inc. (CDI) of Phoenix, Md., he is a leading
authority on reducing massive structures, and the brains behind the
big bang in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge in demolishing the Kingdome wasn't size, but
geometry. A quarter of a century ago, structural engineer Jack
Christiansen designed the Kingdome to take full advantage of the
inherent stability and strength of the arch. The Romans used it to
build their aqueducts, parts of which are still standing. Running
arches around a circle produces a dome, which is stronger still. It
is simple, strong technology, and a big headache when it's time to
take things apart.
</P>
<P>
   You knock down a building like you tackle a person: You go for
the legs. In buildings, the legs are the columns that hold the
floors and roof in place. This simple formula couldn't be applied
to the Kingdome because it had no legs to kick out. The roof was a
clear arching span suspended atop exterior columns. A massive steel
tensioning ring, 2262 feet long, 2 feet thick and 24 feet wide,
encircled the base of the dome roof at the top of the 40 exterior
columns. It held the arches in place against each other, under
nearly 9 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting the ring _ easy work for explosives _ would obviously
drop the roof in one fell swoop. It was also out of the question.
The resulting vibrations from the force of the concrete hitting the
ground could shake nearby buildings to the point of inflicting
serious damage. A more elegant solution was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Two-Step
</P>
<P>
   Working with Rich Riggs and his concrete demolition experts from
Aman Environmental Construction Inc., of Oakland, Calif., the
Kingdome doom-makers decided to bring down the roof in two stages.
Using concrete fragments from the demolished concrete ramps and
bleacher stands, they created vibration-dampening berms that would
act as an impact cushion. ''We didn't know how much it would reduce
the vibration because there was really nothing to compare this
to,'' Riggs says. In the end they decided 12,000 cubic yards of
concrete should cushion the fall of the 70 million-cubic-foot dome.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-January, the overall plan of attack was in place. Crews
began punching in for two 10-hour shifts, seven days a week.
Working around, above and below each other, they tore out 10,000
seats, 5,000 bleachers, miles of roof insulation and wall panels,
and anything else that moved. Explosives experts followed, drilling
nearly 5,500 holes, half of them in the roof's 40 ribs.
</P>
<P>
   One more critical decision remained. And it could be made only
after a live explosive's test. In late February, CDI did a small
blast on a column to determine the best match between explosives
and structure. Some 4,450 pounds of explosives were carefully
portioned among the 5,500 holes, which were then two-way wired to
blasting caps for redundancy.
</P>
<P>
   Time To Pray
</P>
<P>
   Success would be a matter of timing. ''We wanted to force one
portion of the structure to move while still holding the other,''
Loizeaux says . To do this, the Kingdome would be almost instantly
cut into six pie-shaped sections. Choreographing this catastrophic
ballet required the creation of imperceptible pauses within what
would appear to be one explosion. The $9 million demolition job
would require 400 primary detonation delays and 600 secondary
delays.
</P>
<P>
   By 8:30 am March 26, the Kingdome was wired to blow. It is
traditional to demolish buildings on Sunday mornings, as fewer
people are bustling about. At CDI it is also a tradition to pause
for a moment to pray. Then, at 8:32 am, licensed blaster Thom Doud
pushed the button.
</P>
<P>
   The first sequence of explosions took out three of the six roof
pie slices, pulling the structure inward. The second phase of
explosions followed, as key points on the roof ribs and the columns
detonated. After 20 weeks of work, the rest was up to Mother
Nature. As the roof fell, the tensioning ring that had for so long
held up the arches was being used to pull down the exterior
columns.
</P>
<P>
   Before the blast, CDI predicted it would take 17.6 seconds to
drop the dome, leaving rubble as high as 70 ft. standing afterward.
The dome cooperated, falling slightly faster, in 16.8 seconds, and
leaving nothing taller than 25 ft. Even better, 99 percent of the
debris landed within the blast circle. There were only five windows
damaged in nearby buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Loizeaux was exhilarated, but not entirely surprised. ''We don't
blow things up,'' he says. ''We let things fall.''

   PHANTOM FLUSH
</P>
<P>
   Q. Every day, our toilet makes sounds as if it were being
flushed, when no one is near it. What could be causing this to
happen? Is there something we can do to fix it, or do we need to
call a plumber?
</P>
<P>
   _ JUDY BUTLER, TALBOTT, IND.
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a common problem, although it can be quite unnerving
if you hear it for the first time in the middle of the night. You
might think you have an uninvited guest in the house.
</P>
<P>
   The flushing sound is not an actual flush. It's water refilling
the toilet tank. Possibly, there is a flush valve in your toilet
allowing a small amount of water to drain from the tank. You don't
hear the water flowing through the valve into the bowl, but after
several hours, the tank's water level drops to a point where the
water fill valve is actuated, and the tank is refilled with water.
</P>
<P>
   The leak could be the result of improper alignment of the
flapper on the flush valve seat, a slight crack or deterioration of
the flapper or possibly a dirt buildup on the valve seat. If you
are handy, you won't need a plumber to correct the problem. This is
a typical do-it-yourself job. Shut off the water valve to the
toilet, flush the toilet, then empty the water remaining in the
tank. Replace the flapper, and clean the valve seat. The job should
take less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   WHOLE-HOUSE FAN
</P>
<P>
   Q. Since our home is surrounded by trees that shade the house
and keep it cool, we are interested in using a whole-house fan
rather than having central air conditioning. Please advise us on
how this system works and where it can be purchased. _ ALVIN
SYDNOR, BOOTHWYN, PA.
</P>
<P>
   A. Although a whole-house fan is used for cooling, it does not
actually cool the indoor air. Instead, it replaces the hot indoor
air with fresh air from the outdoors. Even when the outside
temperature is the same as the indoor temperature, cooling is
achieved because air movement helps cool the body by evaporating
perspiration. Air that's moving can feel as much as 10 degrees
cooler than air of the same temperature that is still. Of course, a
whole-house fan is most effective after sunset when it can draw in
cooler night air.
</P>
<P>
   The fan is generally installed in the ceiling beneath the attic
or in an opening cut in the gable end. When activated, the fan
creates a negative pressure that causes warm indoor air to be
pulled into the attic. Cool outside air is drawn in through one or
more open windows.
</P>
<P>
   When the fan is ceiling mounted, it causes the attic space to
become pressurized, and this causes the hot air to be pushed out of
ventilating louvers such as gable or soffit vents. When the fan is
gable mounted, it pulls the air out of the attic. In either case,
it's critical that one or more windows be kept open, not only for
cooling but for safety reasons. Unless adequate makeup air is
supplied, the negative pressure created in the house can pull in
exhaust gases from combustion appliances, such as a gas-fired water
heater. This is obviously dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Gable-mounted fans have hinged louvers facing the outside that
are normally closed when the fan is off and open when the fan is
activated. This can cause condensation problems in the attic during
the winter because the louvers, which are closed for months at a
time, restrict airflow for ventilation. In order to prevent the
attic from being inadequately ventilated during the winter, the
hinged louvers should be held at a fixed open position. I have seen
a number of delaminated roof decks during my inspections that were
caused, in part, by this.
</P>
<P>
   Whole-house fans can be purchased at home centers. They often
come with a manual On/Off switch. However, the fan is more
convenient to operate if this switch is replaced with a timer
switch.
</P>
<P>
   PORCELAIN STAINS
</P>
<P>
   Q. The high mineral content of the water where I live stains
porcelain surfaces, such as the entrance to a toilet trap. These
dark stains are very difficult to remove, even with bleach. What
else can be used to remove them? _ CAROLE MADISON, HOLLYWOOD, FL.
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a common problem in areas where there is a high
mineral content in the water. Fortunately, the dark crust formed by
these minerals can be removed using cleaners that are formulated
specifically for removing mineral stains. These cleaners are sold
at supermarkets and hardware stores. An effective product for
removing these stains is Sani-Flush. One application is usually
enough to remove normal amounts of mineral deposits. Heavy deposits
may require more than one application.
</P>
<P>
   CLEANING VINYL SIDING
</P>
<P>
   Q. The vinyl siding on our garage has mildew on it that is very
difficult to remove. I've tried a specialty cleaner, and I've also
used chlorine bleach. Neither worked. What can I do? MRS. RICHARD
FAYFAR, AURORA, ILL.
</P>
<P>
   A. According to the Vinyl Siding Institute (VSI), you can clean
mold and mildew from vinyl siding using Fantastic, Windex or a
solution of 30 percent vinegar and 70 percent water. The institute
does not recommend using aggressive or highly abrasive cleaners
because they can damage the siding's surface.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on vinyl siding, visit VSI's Web site at
www.vinylsiding.org. Click on the Information Center bar on the
left of the screen, then go to Publications. From there, click on
Cleaning Vinyl Siding. The cleaning chart that is available online
is arranged alphabetically, from Bubble Gum to Top Soil. Fifteen
common stains are covered, and you'll find that, in most cases,
common household cleaners remove them.

 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every day, knowledge that is essential to a business walks out
the door. Employees leave, customers come and go _ and valuable
information leaves with them. This drain costs a company time,
money and market share.
</P>
<P>
   The best way for a company to prevent this loss is to develop a
knowledge management (KM) program. When done right, it can help a
business understand its customers better, bring products to market
faster and run its operations more smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   What makes a successful KM program? Here are tips from
leading-edge companies.
</P>
<P>
   DEFINE THE PROGRAM'S VALUE PROPOSITION
</P>
<P>
   A company must be explicit about what it wants to achieve as a
result of its KM program. Most KM efforts are driven by one of
three objectives: increased customer intimacy, faster time to
market or operational excellence.
</P>
<P>
   In the high-tech industry, for example, time to market is often
the main focus of a KM program. However, a company that doesn't
launch many new products _ like Chevron _ will focus its KM efforts
on operational excellence.
</P>
<P>
   CHOOSE A PROCESS
</P>
<P>
   Most KM efforts fall into one of three categories:
</P>
<P>
   _ Self-directed. The company provides the database technology,
and employees use it to find the information they need. These
databases depend on user initiative. They are a good, low-cost
system for capturing the explicit knowledge of the organization,
but they can't capture the tacit knowledge in employees' heads.
</P>
<P>
   _ Knowledge networks. Consulting companies have experimented
widely with knowledge networks. Index Consulting, for example, the
firm that championed re-engineering, tried to capture the knowledge
learned on various re-engineering projects to make it easier to
tackle the next project that came along. Typically, employees are
happy to use the networks for information, but less excited about
putting in the time required to keep them updated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Facilitated transfer. In addition to the previous components,
this approach designates specific individuals who integrate best
practices or encourage knowledge transfer throughout the
organization. Facilitators assist with implementation by linking
best practices to business problems. They also show others how to
participate in knowledge sharing and transfer.
</P>
<P>
   ENLIST THE RIGHT PEOPLE
</P>
<P>
   Facilitators usually come from inside the organization: They may
be internal consultants, change agents, team leaders or
benchmarking coordinators. One suggestion: To keep balance in the
recruiting process, recruit individuals from every discipline and
geographical location.
</P>
<P>
   MAKE SURE THE TECHNOLOGY SUPPORTS THE DATA
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of software programs to facilitate the IT part
of the knowledge management equation. Raytheon wanted a program
that would be useful to a broad cross section of people, says Bill
Baker, Raytheon's ``benchmarking/knowledge transfer champion,'' so
it decided on a Lotus Notes application.
</P>
<P>
   Team members from all over the company act as knowledge editors
in the system, adding key words and reworking the material to make
it more searchable.
</P>
<P>
   The Lotus Notes Knowledgebase is accessible through Raytheon's
intranet. Employees can search through a benchmarking library and
the best practice Knowledgebase as well as submit best practices.
</P>
<P>
   INVEST IN TRAINING KNOWLEDGE WORKERS
</P>
<P>
   Employees need a system for getting information to flow. For
instance, newspapers provide information management skills to
reporters so they're not constantly reinventing the wheel with
every story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newspeople traffic in information every day, producing
knowledge products on time, on deadline and without missing a beat.
It's a team effort,'' says Amy Zuckerman, a consultant and author.
Employees need to be trained to practice KM in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   In the corporate world, according to Zuckerman, ``the investment
in technology is there, but often the people skills are
shortchanged, because management thinks that knowledge management
is all about the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS ON STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   At Chevron, the central theme of the corporate KM strategy is
``connections.'' Jeff Stemke, an internal consultant, refers to
himself as ``an evangelist for KM.'' The practice focuses on four
variations on the connections theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``We connect people to the explicit knowledge we have _ for
example, on the intranet,'' he says. ``We connect people to others
who can solve problems with a yellow pages/expertise locator. We
connect people to communities of practice to share what they know,
to learn from each other and to develop new knowledge. Finally, we
look for ways to connect our knowledge and people into our
processes, products and services.''

<P>
   It's a marketer's dream: doing research on the Web and getting
instant information about the marketplace. But it doesn't work in
every situation.
</P>
<P>
   In the digitized future, every company may utilize some form of
so-called customer-management software, which collects and analyzes
large amounts of data about and from customers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile plenty of marketers have a more modest ambition: using
the Web to measure customer satisfaction and gather customer
feedback. Can it be done?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer: in most cases, yes. All that is needed is a
large enough number of e-mail addresses or a heavily trafficked Web
site. Create a survey and send it out or post it.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to hire one of the many vendors specializing
in electronic surveying, some of which have already assembled
sizable panels of ready respondents.

   These purveyors are naturally quick to point out the advantages
of online research. It's cheaper, they say, and quicker. Large
mailings and huge banks of phone operators aren't necessary. It's
less intrusive and more convenient for respondents, two factors
that tend to boost response rates. It encourages franker answers to
open-ended questions _ and it's easier for researchers to know what
to do with those comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just pop that information in an e-mail to the appropriate
manager,'' says Charles Colby, president of Rockbridge Associates
in Great Falls, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Colby and others acknowledge that non-Web companies have
been slow to utilize online surveying. That's partly a legacy of
the past: Switching to any new survey method produces a different
response pattern, so new data aren't directly comparable to data
from previous years. But it also reflects uncertainty about how
representative online polling can be.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people, after all, don't use the Internet much, either
because it doesn't interest them or because they don't have access
to it. Minorities, households with lower incomes, rural residents
and older people are all less likely to log on than the typical
middle-class white American.
</P>
<P>
   Online surveyors often discount the effects of this bias,
arguing that they can correct for it with various statistical
tools. Others aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who claim you can use statistical
weighting techniques to make up for the bias,'' says Howard
Fienberg, a research analyst at the Washington, D.C.-based
Statistical Assessment Service. ``But without those people being a
part of it, you can't just tinker with the numbers so effectively.
At some point in the future we might be able to do that ... but at
some point in the future all those people might be on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   While using the Web for general surveys may be problematic, it's
a great tool for gathering information about specific groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a lot of people come to us for is specialty research,''
says Janet Westergaard, founder of Esearch.com., an online research
company based in Rolling Hills, Calif. ``The beauty of this online
stuff is we can send out a qualifying questionnaire to thousands or
tens of thousands and find this very specific subject in a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Research client Eli Lilly, for example, found the Web valuable
in tracking down people with obscure ailments for which the company
is developing treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Esearch and Lieberman Research (which runs
Opinionsite.com) get fast results because they don't do random
surveys; instead, they have ready groups of respondents. These are
people who have already given detailed demographic information to
the company and have said they are willing to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most research companies have to offer participants an
incentive, and incentives may eventually drive up the cost. Just as
people have become less enchanted with phone surveys _ some
research companies report that responses to phone surveys are down
40 percent _ so they may become less inclined to answer questions
online.

 &HT;    EDS: RESENDING TO CORRECT BYLINE
 &HT;    Electricity brought life to the great Northwest
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONNEVILLE DAM, Ore. _ After 10 days on the road with the North
Fayetteville Moyes in their new land yacht, we are appoaching
Portland and Delta back to Atlanta. I'm still waiting on Alex to
cook his specialty lamb chops, the main reason I agreed to this
adventure in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Unless I dozed through the film and got my facts mixed up,
Bonneville is the first super-dam Franklin Roosevelt decided to
build when he moved into the White House. The Columbia River,
bigger than the Savannah, the Chattahoochee and the Altamaha rolled
into one, has been spinning Bonneville's turbines since the middle
1930s. It generates enough electricity to run a half-million homes.
</P>
<P>
   When rural electrification came to the rural Georgia of my
youth, our way of life was forever changed _ for the better. REA
ended the era of kerosene lamps and outdoor toilets. Washers and
dryers in the house eventually replaced backyard washpots and
clotheslines. Butter and milk could be kept fresh in a Frigidaire
rather than lowered into a water well. After REA, you could go to
Edward Travis' hardware store in Fayetteville, and for a few
dollars buy an electric fan to cool hot nights.
</P>
<P>
   Rural electrification began to tie the nation together as it
never had been before. Radios were no longer dependent on expensive
batteries prone to go dead. The most isolated dirt-road, back-swamp
family, with a little imagination, got news and entertainment just
like folks in New York and Chicago, or London. REA made such an
impact on the rural South that Terry Kay wrote a book about it:
``The Year the Lights Came On.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the HMS Moye followed the Lewis and Clark Trail into the
deserts and mountains of the American Northwest, I thought the
South had been the leading beneficiary of rural electrification. I
was wrong. Out there, electricity isn't a luxury. It's life.
</P>
<P>
   In a dry summer like this one I'm satisfied to sprinkle the lawn
and keep the garden reasonably moist. In the states we visited _
Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Idaho, Washington, Oregon _ a hunk of the
earth bigger than Europe _ they have to irrigate everything that
grows. Without Roosevelt's dams, Lewis and Clark might as well have
stayed home. Except for scenery, much of the Western United States
would be worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Moye says he bought a motor home so he could have a
ground's-eye view of the America he spent all those years flying
over when he was piloting for Eastern Air Lines. There's a lot you
can see but much you can't grasp at 20,000 or 30,000 feet. What
struck me was the size and diversity of this country geographically
and otherwise. We're so different it's a wonder we aren't a dozen
countries rather than one nation under God.
</P>
<P>
   I was happy when most Westerners seemed to understand our
Southern drawls. I didn't try to order grits, and didn't make a
fuss when the restaurant in Washington served sliced light bread
and called it biscuits. The country ham was for sissies but the
beef jerky wasn't bad, although expensive at $5.75 for a bag the
size of a modest serving of fried pigskins.
</P>
<P>
   The closest anyone came to making mirth over our Southern way of
talking was a friendly comic in Utah. ``You folks ain't from
England, are you?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   We felt better after a tour conductor in Toppenish, Wash., who
seemed to be right well educated, ``clumb'' a hill and stepped
across a ``crick.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the old saw about New York, the American Northwest is a
great place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there. I think it
could be a hard life.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what the Democrats say, everyone in this country isn't
prosperous. In Wyoming, for example, you hardly ever see a Mercedes
or a Lexus. A lot of old Chevies and Ford pickups are on the road,
and practically no late-model SUVs, unless a tourist is at the
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho is mostly potatoes and runaway truck ramps. I don't think
I'd have the nerve to drive a tractor or a combine on those
mountaintop wheat fields in Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   The people have pride. When Toppenish industry went bust a few
years ago, the townfolk got together and created a tourist
industry. Several dozen murals on store and warehouse walls tell
the history of the town and the pioneers who settled it. Now
Toppenish is prospering.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians who mouth cliches at conventions in Philadelphia
and Los Angeles are right about one thing. America is a great
country. I have some advice for anyone hankering for Switzerland
and the Alps, Norwegian fjords, Australia's Outback or the sands of
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   There's an easier way. Just get friendly with the Moyes, or some
other well-off neighbors who can afford a Conestoga wagon with all
the comforts of home. As Chevrolet used to say, it's a great way to
see the USA. The bathroom is always handy, and you can drink the
water.

THE PLAYBOOK PUZZLE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brian Billick has made the Baltimore Ravens' playbook Y2K
compliant.
</P>
<P>
   The first playbook was a spiral notebook created by former
Cleveland Browns coach Paul Brown, so it is somewhat fitting that
it's the Ravens, the direct descendants of those Browns teams of
the 1950s, who have moved the playbook into the computer age.
</P>
<P>
   While every team still has a thick notebook filled with hundreds
of pages of diagrams, lists, and explanations of every imaginable
act on a football field, Billick has also equipped his coaches with
laptop computers and what is known as Power Point learning.
</P>
<P>
   It is something he used in Minnesota as well, where he created
one of the league's most explosive offenses before taking over as
the Ravens' coach a year ago. His belief is simple. While the plays
his team will run are still drawn in the traditional playbook for
his players to learn, the laptop gives him and his assistants many
new ways to reinforce the lessons at a time when the youth of
America knows much more about Gameboys than libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is the ``open your playbook to Page 127'' speech, replaced
by a scene like this one, which occurred last week in Baltimore. In
the middle of a lecture on the importance of each player just doing
their job on a play and not worrying about other things around
them, Billick leaned over, pushed a button on his computer and up
on a screen at the front of the team's meeting room was not a
diagram of X's and O's but rather Harrison Ford in ``The Fugitive''
reaching the end of a long tunnel with Tommy Lee Jones pursuing
him.
</P>
<P>
   Ford turned and screamed ``I didn't kill my wife!'' Jones, the
cop in hot pursuit, replied, ``I don't care. I'm just doing my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Billick's coaching point on the play was simple. ``I don't care
what you're thinking. Just do your job.'' You wouldn't find that in
Paul Brown's playbook. Or in Bill Belichick's, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   These days systems of offense and defense are so complex and
time consuming to learn that any way to speed up the learning curve
is used, including computer disks that Billick can give quarterback
Tony Banks to put in his home computer. On them might be every
Steeler defense in third-and-long situations, with video showing
what they do.
</P>
<P>
   Or, while other teams are still diagramming plays on an overhead
projector, the Ravens' coaches are using Power Point to move those
X's and O's around on the screen. Or, better still, instead of
having the players study the diagrams in their playbook, they can
watch the actual play running on their computer screen as they
study, reinforcing the lessons in the playbook with the thing kids
born in the 1970s seem to understand best _ moving pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the dawning of the computer age of coaching doesn't
change the difficulty of learning a new system, especially when it
is layered over the top of several others already memorized.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In New England, Drew Bledsoe has had four offensive coordinators
and four offenses to learn during his career. Banks is learning his
seventh in eight years, dating back to his days in junior college.
</P>
<P>
   That is a lot of rote memory, a lot of hours spent studying
playbooks and learning terminology that is often merely another way
to say what you've already said in a different language.
</P>
<P>
   That's why when Mike Heimerdinger went from Denver to Tennessee
this offseason to coordinate the Titans' offense, he left his old
terminology behind and adopted what was used last year by Les
Steckel, who's now running the Falcons' offense in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier for one guy to learn a new language than for
43 guys to learn a new language,'' Heimerdinger reasoned. ``All
offensive plays are fundamentally the same. If you're running a
dive, you're running a dive. It's how you communicate what you're
doing to the team that's the difficulty. So I just learned what
they already knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all coaches are quite so willing to alter their approach.
Retired coach Nick Nicolau plyed his trade for a lifetime in the
NFL, working as an offensive assistant on some of the league's best
teams in Denver and Buffalo. While in Denver, he learned that some
languages must be learned even if they are deader than Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Every team in football at the time numbered their holes from
left to right, with the numbers increasing as you go. Every team
but one. Every one but Dan Reeves's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was confusing to players who came in from another system or
for coaches who were used to doing it the other way every where
they'd been,'' Nicolau said. ``So I went to Dan one day and asked
him why we numbered our holes from right to left instead of left to
right. He said because that's the way they did it in Dallas (when
Reeves played and coached under Tom Landry in the 1960s and 1970s).
I knew who the boss was, so when a player would ask me why we did
it that way after that, I'd just tell him where Dan's office was.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the plays NFL teams run are basically the same, their
variants are not. How the play is communicated from the playbook to
the quarterback's head to the team's ears is perhaps the most
daunting challenge. For Bledsoe, that has led to some interesting
exchanges in the huddle this summer when new coordinator Charlie
Weis has called for one play and it has come out of Bledsoe's mouth
in Ernie Zampese speak or Larry Kennan language.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the terminology we're using in Charlie's system is
like Ray Perkins's (his first coordinator's) system and a lot of
Ernie's was like Larry's,'' Bledsoe said. ``It's not as complicated
learning a new system as you might think because a lot of the
things we do are similar. It's like learning a new language. When
you're studying French there's a long period where you're
translating everything in your mind to English and then speaking it
back in French, but at some point it clicks over and you're
thinking in French. That happens faster in football.''
</P>
<P>
   Faster but not always fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Ernie's offense every play called was designed to work
against any defense you faced,'' Bledsoe said. ``We didn't do a
whole bunch of formations and personnel groupings because there
were a lot of options within every play if it was run right.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Charlie's system we use a lot more groups, formations and
motion, and the terminology is different. In Ernie's system, the
formations had names and the pass routes had numbers. In Charlie's
the formations have numbers and the routes have names. It can be
confusing at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a few times at first when I called a formation
by its old name or a route by its old number. Once I went back to
some terminology from four years ago. You do that, you get some
funny looks in the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the guys who had been there like Max (Lane), Briz
(departed Vincent Brisby) and Troy (Brown) laughed. They knew what
I was saying. But the younger guys were totally baffled.
Fortunately I realized it pretty quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, the transition came pretty quickly for me with Charlie
because a lot of it was similar to what we did with Perkins and
(Bill) Parcells, when Charlie was here before.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... here before.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Weis was here before, he wasn't running the offense as he
is today. The system then was basically Perkins's. Now it is
Weis's, a variation of what he's learned over the years from
Perkins, Parcells, and even the defensive coaches he's known like
Belichick, Al Groh and Romeo Crennel. Together that knowledge has
produced a thick playbook, but not one as staggering as Walsh's
tome in San Francisco during his days as the league's guru of
offensive football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really there are only about five systems of offense out
there,'' Weis said. ``And there's no original system any more.
There's the Ron Erhardt-Ray Perkins system and it's gone to other
places as coaches moved. They use the same terminology in
Jacksonville and Cleveland. Miami has a lot of it because Chan
(Gailey, the new offensive coordinator) got it from Ron.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Walsh's system, although I don't know if it was really
his or LaVell Edwards's (the longtime coach at Brigham Young
University where Walsh disciple Mike Holmgren cut his offensive
teeth). They call that the West Coast offense, but why call it West
Coast? Their verbiage is all over the league. Is Green Bay on the
West Coast?
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there's Ernie Zampese's system, which is really Don
Coryell's, which was really Sid Gilman's. That's in St. Louis,
Dallas, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest difficulty when a new system is going in is how
you call the formation, how you get them lined up and how you tell
them when to motion. A lot of times the way to do it is to adopt
the terminology that was already there, like Mike did in Tennessee.
After you put your foundation in you can use whatever terminology
you want.''
</P>
<P>
   To Weis, the most difficult part for a player like Bledsoe is
not the changing playbooks and the terminology, but rather the
changing faces instructing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have talked a lot here about all the different systems
Drew has had to learn, but what causes a bigger problem is changing
who coaches you every year, especially at quarterback,'' Weis said.
``A quarterback coach has to be the quarterback's confidante. He
can't be afraid to tell him when he's screwing up. You have to be
able to do it matter of factly, but the guy has to understand what
you wanted him to do first. Fortunately for us, a veteran like
Bledsoe knows what's going on when you tell him the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, Weis was able to install his system and its
terminology in a more complex way than he would have with a rookie
quarterback or an inexperienced one like Tampa's Shaun King, who
has started for less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is you can have a playbook a foot thick,'' Weis
said. ``You can have your system, whatever it is. But it better fit
what your quarterback can do because if you're asking him to do
things he can't do, forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Weis would sit down with Vinny Testaverde when
he was with the Jets and go over the playbook and what was going to
be taken from it for the upcoming game. After several days of
practice, they would revisit those plays on Thursday or Friday, and
Weis would listen to Testaverde's viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Vinny didn't like a play, whether I liked it or not, we'd
throw it out,'' Weis said. ``Me, (quarterback coach Dan) Henning,
and Vinny would sit and talk about the plan and rather than be
hardheaded about it because it was my idea, if the quarterback
wasn't confident in it, we'd throw it out.''
</P>
<P>
   In Weis's system, though, there is less to throw out than with
many other NFL teams. Weis is more a believer in matchups than
trickery, as is head coch Bill Belichick. He believes more in
formations and player groupings than the full proofness of any play
in his playbook, a marked departure from a place like San
Francisco, where they might have 55-100 plays on a list for any
game and 400 or more in a playbook that looked like Volume A of the
Encyclopedia Brittanica.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Weis's looks more like Volume V. There's still
plenty there, it's just a little thinner and easier to carry, both
by hand and in your mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco could call 400 plays,'' Weis said. ``I have a
different philosophy. I think you can cut down on the plays and get
different looks from your formations and who's in them. It's easier
for the players to learn. It's easier for the quarterback to learn.
You get different looks without changing his reads. You don't need
an open-ended number of plays.''
</P>
<P>
   What you do need, Weis said, is a number of plays designed for
the young quarterback as well as for a veteran guy like Bledsoe or
Testaverde. Because Bledsoe has played seven years in the NFL and
every minute as a starter, Weis understood which playbook to hand
him when they first began to work in spring minicamps. He gave him
the thicker one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a volume of plays for the inexperienced guy and for
the experienced guy,'' Weis said. ``When Vinny went down, you
couldn't ask Ray Lucas to do the same things we'd ask of Vinny. The
more experienced a guy you have running your offense, the more
mental pressure you can put on him.''
</P>
<P>
   A former high school teacher, Weis understands, as Billick does,
that rote learning of a playbook is not the way an offense is
learned. The playbook ultimately must be translated into a system
the player understands and doesn't question.
</P>
<P>
   Such learning takes time but with ``most of our offense''
installed, Weis is confident that when he sends it out to face the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers Sunday, he can call anything and be confident
Bledsoe and his teammates will understand what is being asked.
Although once in a while, even Weis might relay his message to
Bledsoe in an old language.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Drew, coming to this offense is like someone who learned
Spanish, then forgot it, and now is relearning it,'' Weis said.
``He's familiar with a lot of it already from when we were here
before. He just needed a refresher course, but every now and then I
signal him a play using (hand) signals from the olden days. He gets
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without a laptop computer to assist him.

STOP SIGNS FOR PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- Lawyer Milloy describes his 2000 Patriots
this way: ``We have some guys who have been playing together for a
while, we have a little bit of wiseness _ is that a word? _ a
little bit of youth.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``together'' (the core): Drew Bledsoe, Terry Glenn, Troy
Brown, Milloy, Ty Law, Ted Johnson, Tedy Bruschi, Chad Eaton,
Willie McGinest, Chris Slade.
</P>
<P>
   The wise(ness) _ Otis Smith, 34, Henry Thomas, 35, Bruce
Armstrong, 35, Chris Calloway 32, John Friesz, 33.
</P>
<P>
   The youth: Six rookies, seven rookie free agents, four
second-year players. And Milloy should have included a fourth
category _ break-out players. Guys like Tebucky Jones, Jason
Andersen, Tony Simmons, Chris Floyd, Rod Rutledge, Kato Serwanga,
and Greg Spires all need to play big roles for the Patriots to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   This is new coach Bill Belichick's roster. The rest is up to
him.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots appear to have bought into Belichick's ways and
schemes. That was never a problem for the defense; many players
have played for Belichick. In fact, among projected starters, only
free safety Jones and defensive tackle Brandon Mitchell have not
played for Belichick either in New England in '96 or in Cleveland
prior to that.
</P>
<P>
   There are concerns at running back, offensive line, and tight
end, and Belichick needs a return to prominence by quarterback Drew
Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this team is going to show a lot of heart and I think
it's going to be a team that's going to be very physical all over
the field,'' said Law. ``We're not going to get pushed around by
anyone. I think we showed that against Tampa Bay in the preseason
because you can't get any more physical than that team and they had
to be wondering what we were doing with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Charlie Weis appears more creative than
the previous regime as evidenced by Michael Bishop's possible role
on third and goal and in red-zone situations. Weis also has more of
his receivers in motion and also believes in running the football
out of the shotgun, which he was quite successful with in New York
with Curtis Martin and Leon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots started their training camp with seven offensive
linemen on the sideline with knee injuries. Slowly some of them are
making their way back, but some may not retain their starting
roles. A silver lining is that Belichick and assistant head
coach/offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia have found young
linemen who are making progress on a weekly basis _ namely rookie
right tackle Greg Robinson-Randall, guard/center Andersen, and
second-year guard/tackle Derrick Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The versatility we show on the offensive line could be our
strength,'' said Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line that starts against Tampa Bay Sunday may not
resemble the one by midseason, when rookie Adrian Klemm and last
year's starting guard, Todd Rucci, return from injuries.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Armstrong (left tackle), Andersen (left guard), Damien
Woody (center), Max Lane (right guard), and Robinson-Randall (right
tackle) appear to be the starters. Woody and Andersen may still
have to swap spots when Bledsoe goes into the shotgun. Poor play at
any spot could put veteran tackle Grant Williams, who was signed to
a two-year, $2.1 million deal but missed most of camp after knee
surgery, into the starting lineup. In an area of the field where
there must be some stability, this can't be completely settling to
Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do what's best for the team,'' said Belichick. ``What's
worked in our favor is the versatility and flexibility, and whether
we'll be able to utilize it with our first group and with our
backups. I'm not really sure at this point whether that will be our
strength. I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   If he's not, Bledsoe can't be sure.
</P>
<P>
   The running back spot is also a work in progress. The hope is
still that rookie J.R. Redmond could eventually win the job, but
for now he'll back up Kevin Faulk and play in third-down situations
as well as return kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little by little I'm starting to feel more comfortable,'' said
Redmond. ``I think with the injury, that set me back and I'm
starting to show the things that I know I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulk broke a 58-yard run in a 31-21 loss to Tampa Bay last week
and has been very steady. The third-round pick out of LSU hasn't
been told he's No. 1, but that's obvious following the release of
Raymont Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can do it,'' said Faulk, who must now dispell the
notion that a short guy can't carry the full load. ``Now I have to
convince everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   An offensive line, a running game, and a tight end will be of
utmost importance in helping Bledsoe restore his confidence. There
are signs he lost it last season in the second half. An MVP
candidate in the first half of last season (6-2), Bledsoe went 2-6
the rest of the way and spent most of his time flat on his back as
the protection around him broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe is capable of leading a team to the Super Bowl. In 1996,
the Patriots started 0-2 as the offense struggled. But Bledsoe and
his running game got cranked up, and the team finished 11-5 and
lost to the Packers in the Super Bowl. He may not be mobile, but if
protected, Bledsoe can deliver the football as well as any
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   It is a new year with a new coach and a new system. The
expectation is that the Patriots will struggle early and get
better. That is the trait of the old Parcells teams that Belichick
was long a part of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people have to be patient because it's a new system
we're getting used to and we don't have all of our people in place
yet,'' said wide receiver Glenn. ``Charlie has a great offense and
once we start showing everything, I think people will think a
little differently. Right now it's preseason and we're not showing
everything. We're still trying to get our offensive line in order
and trying to see who's gonna start at running back. I think we
have the people in place that could make this work. I know the
players are excited about it and pretty soon the fans will see.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, of course, is vital to the offense. He'll be on the field
with Troy Brown, which the coaches hope will prevent Glenn from
being double-teamed.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Patriots don't have the pieces of the '96 team.
Ben Coates was in the prime of his career, ditto Curtis Martin and
Armstrong. And the younger veterans like Dave Wohlabaugh, Rucci and
Lane meshed well with old-timer William Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   The concern on defense is the injury bug that continues to bite
middle linebacker Ted Johnson, who missed serious time (17 games
the last two years) with tears in both biceps tendons. In this
camp, Johnson hasn't gotten on the field because of a hamstring
injury. He's a vital part of the Patriots' run-stopping mechanism.
Also, Jones will make his first start at free safety while the
right corner spot is reclamation project Antonio Langham's to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Many expect the Patriots to have a ``great'' defense and think
it will carry the offense. But beware. The Patriots have had a very
good defense the past three years under Pete Carroll. In fact, the
Patriots allowed 902 points the past three years, fifth lowest in
the NFL. Belichick's Jets defense allowed the second fewest points
_ 862. The defense, then, can't be that much better, so it will
have to be the offense that becomes the difference maker.

THERE'S A SENSE BELICHICK MAY HAVE ANSWERS FOR PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The National Football League is a
conservative establishment, but in recent years some of the
league's best defensive coaches have taken advice from the late
radical activist Abbie Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman titled his autobiography, ``Steal This Book.'' Those
coaches took his advice one step further. They stole Bill
Belichick's playbook.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is regularly paid the highest compliment a tactician
can be paid. Other coaches lift his game plans. They don't borrow
something here and a play or two there. They look at what he's just
done to an opponent and they try to do the same thing. They know
nobody in the league understands defensive football better than
Bill Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a football genius,'' insists Roman Phifer, the linebacker
who played for him last year with the New York Jets, using a word
often connected to the Patriots' new coach when the subject is
defensive football. ``He's like a whiz kid of football. I can
picture him watching film to all hours of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Titans played the Indianpolis Colts in last season's
playoffs, Tennessee defensive coordinator Gregg Williams watched
film until all hours of the night. It was film of the Colts' two
razor-thin victories over the Jets. Williams studied how Belichick
had attacked Peyton Manning, the Colts' phenomenal young
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Jets did not win those games, they played the best
offense in the AFC close, losing, 16-13 and 13-6. They baffled and
bewildered Manning, taking away his receivers and forcing him to
eat the ball or throw it away. When he handed it to star running
back Edgerrin James, there were few holes to run through.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that, Williams watched and analyzed and watched and
analyzed. Then he did the simple thing. He copied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Belichick was not afraid to challenge them,'' Williams
said after the Titans beat Indianapolis, 19-16, by holding Manning
to a dismal 19 of 42 for 227 yards and no touchdowns. ``The big
thing we felt was that 85 percent of their offense was built around
playing against zone coverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people aren't as fast as we are and are afraid to play
man coverage on them. Belichick did and it worked. Once our guys
understood that they were zone-concept pass routes and they didn't
have a lot of options against man-to-man, it was an easy sell.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy because the proof was already on the screen. There
were the lowly Jets limiting Manning to an average of 208 passing
yards in those two games. He threw as many interceptions (one) as
touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belichick certainly gave us a lot of trouble,'' Manning
conceded. ``He'll really test your patience and your discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick ran that same kind of mind-breaking defense in New
England in 1996, and he has brought it back this year with some new
wrinkles and a familiar face running it. His own.
</P>
<P>
   Although Belichick is now the head coach, he is also the
defensive coordinator. He calls the plays and installs the game
plan and the system, which isn't yet fully in place and won't be
any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 55 plays of blitzes alone,'' Belichick said of his
two-gap system that centers around quick, strong linemen filling
two gaps to free the linebackers to make plays by flowing freely to
the ball against the run while his pass defense attempts to
disguise its weaknesses while breaking down the opponent's.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a learning curve there,'' Belichick added. ``I'd say
we have a grasp of about 75 percent of what the system is but we're
going to have to go through half a season to a season worth of
regular-season games before we have it down. That's true for our
players and it's probably about the same rate with our coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of one, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about him,'' says Jets cornerback Aaron
Glenn. ``He's by far the best coach I've ever had in my career. I
don't think I'll ever get another coach that can call plays and
defenses like that. He puts guys into position to make plays. He
knows what it takes to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   What Belichick knows, or at least what he learns through study,
is an offense's weak point and how to dismantle it. He studies an
opposing team and then tries to unravel it, deciding from week to
week which of his players will be pivotal against a particular foe.
</P>
<P>
   This changes constantly, as does his approach. While almost
always on the attack, his defenses come from so many different
fronts and formations that the quarterbacks who face him grow weary
trying to guess what is coming next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave up a long time ago trying to figure out whether I'm
going to get zoned or manned or blitzed (by a Belichick-coached
defense),'' said future Hall of Famer Dan Marino, the recently
retired Dolphins quarterback. ``Bill Belichick changes it every
single week.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he does, because every week the environment changes. With
a new opponent comes a new set of problems. In some ways, it is
that constant effort to match and outmaneuver his alter egos on
offense that has kept Belichick's mind focused on a boy's game well
into his manhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is always changing,'' Belichick explained. ``There
are always new trends, new ways to attack each other. I've always
loved the competition against great coaches. I enjoy coaching
against good (offensive) coaches like Bill Walsh and Tom Landry and
all those guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant challenge on both sides of the ball. That's
the way it will always be. You keep moving those 11 guys around. It
won't get stale because of the number of people involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's system attempts to move those people from angles the
opposition is unprepared for. It is based on speed and power, with
the former probably more important than the latter. It is a system
he has been installing since his arrival last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Belichick said, he will name a defensive
coordinator. ``Right now nobody on the staff knows it as well as I
do,'' he said. ``That will change at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Until it does, Bill Belichick will handle both the Patriots'
business and his team's defense with an assist from guys like
recently signed cornerback Otis Smith, the ex-Patriot and Jet who
learned this defense under Belichick and said, ``I know it as well
as he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing that, Belichick smiled, saying, ``Otis knows it pretty
well. Otis knows things we'll do that we haven't done here yet. I
can tell him things that will trigger other things for him in his
mind because he's seen the situation and done them. Players like
Otis and Bobby Hamilton and Pepper (Johnson) know this system so
they give us someone who can talk to the players about what we're
asking them to do. That way they get it not just from a coach but
from someone who's done this.''
</P>
<P>
   Done it and knows it works, even if those who haven't yet
experienced it aren't quite as sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things as a group we can adjust to pretty
easily but there are other things we aren't able to do yet,''
Belichick said of his defense. ``There are some things we can't ask
them to do yet. You can't learn to divide until you learn to
multiply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volume of offenses in this league are quite extensive.
With seven weeks trying to get your system down, it isn't enough
time to do that and see all the ways teams will attack you.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game of matchups, so a player might be a big factor
(on defense) one week and not in another game. Some weeks there are
one or two central players. Other times it shifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Belichick's genius is his ability to recognize those
people and alert them to what to expect. He is legendary for
telling players what will happen and what they must do to counter
it, and then having it unfold just as he said it would.
</P>
<P>
   It is a vision one of his first bosses in the NFL, ex-Detroit
Lions coach Rick Forzano, says is a gift. Whatever it is, Bill
Belichick is bringing it to New England inside a large spiral
notebook.
</P>
<P>
   The answers to his defense _ and perhaps the Patriots' short-
term future _ are inside those covers. Inside those covers and
inside the mind of the coach.
</P>
<P>
   One person who can vouch for its effectiveness is Drew Bledsoe,
who has had some of the worst games of his career against
Belichick's defenses in New York. One was last year, when he went a
dismal 15 for 36 and was sacked three times and threw three
interceptions in a 24-17 loss. It was a typically long day for
Bledsoe against someone he's had trouble matching up against.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Belichick has the best game plans we face all year,''
Bledsoe said after that defeat. ``They double the right receivers
and they jump the right routes.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Belichick's defenses know what they're doing and
they know what you're doing, but you have no idea what they're
doing and because of it pretty soon you don't know what you're
doing, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know how they're going to line up,'' lamented
Buffalo Bills quarterback Doug Flutie. ``Are they going to be in a
five-linebacker set with two defensive backs? What are they going
to do? They make you do your homework.''
</P>
<P>
   They do that because they know somewhere Bill Belichick is doing
his. By the time he's done, nobody knows what he's going to do but
the people closest to him know this: Do what he says and things
will work out most of the time . . . which in some ways is the
definition of genius.

CALLS FOR CHANGE ARE BARELY AUDIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the elements conspired in his favor, as if someone tossed
him the drawing board from the sideline, slapped him on the back,
and told him to plot the X's and O's of his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than 15 years later, Bob Avellini, the former Bears
quarterback, can close his eyes and picture where everyone was on
the field that day, that moment in the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfect,'' he thought. ``This is just perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   The speedy, sure-handed Willie Gault was the Chicago receiver _
at least the intended receiver. The Seattle defensive back was
Kenny Easley. Between the two, Avellini spotted some 10 yards of
daylight, pure Gault running room, enough space almost to imagine a
billboard with the word ``Audible!'' scripted across the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``The noisiest stadium in the NFL _ absolutely the noisiest,''
recalled Avellini, noting the trick it is to check off on a play
amid the deafening thunder of a crazed vox populi. ``But even with
all that noise, everyone got the audible. We were going with a
quick out, a hitch, and everyone was lined up perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had to shift. No one had to move . . .''
</P>
<P>
   But someone did. Avellini won't say who erred, other than to
emphasize it was not Gault. In a flash, the golden egg of
opportunity turned rotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what happens,'' recalled Avellini. ``The guy shifts,
gives the play away, and, boom! Easley steps up, picks it off, and
takes it back for a touchdown. And all because one guy moves.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to trace the root of the audible or compute its
rate of success. Former Patriots coach Ron Erhardt said he would,
``Put a bet on a guy like Sid Gillman,'' and other pass-oriented
coaches such as Don Coryell as being the check-off's founding
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to ring the cash register,'' Gillman often said
through the years, ``you have to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The crown prince of the audible may have been Joe Namath, who
led the Jets' 16-7 upset win over the Colts in Super Bowl III with
a ``check-with-me'' offense. Broadway Joe would follow his charges
to scrimmage, assess the Colt defense, and implement the play based
on his quick read of the Baltimore line and backfield.
</P>
<P>
   But as the game has evolved, especially through the '90s,
on-field ad libs have gone the way of drop kicks and leather
helmets. The audible isn't extinct, but it has dropped deeper into
the background as the game has introduced technical gadgetry,
tightened the clock, and larger, more play-specific coaching staffs
have sought to control both sides of the line every time the ball
is snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you exactly how much they're doing it today,''
said ex-Patriots quarterback Steve Grogan. ``But I can tell you,
the offenses I was part of for 16 years, we didn't audibilize much.
Most coaches I played for thought it really put the offensive
linemen at a disadvantage, created more room for error, and overall
you were better to run the play just as you called it in the
huddle.''
</P>
<P>
   And much has changed since Grogan last stood under center in
1990, including the sideline-to-quarterback headsets that
streamline the play-calling process, and the 40-second play clock
that begins ticking once the ball is spotted. The headset typically
keeps the offensive coordinator wired directly to the QB's brain,
until only 15 seconds remain on the play clock or the ball is
snapped. The clock hurries the pace. Both can diminish, if not
negate, a quarterback's instinct to freelance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious you don't have the same time frame today that you
used to have,'' said Grogan. ``You take your time getting in the
huddle, calling the play, moving to the ball . . . then factor in
the read, audibilizing, snap the ball . . . guys just don't react
that fast. If 10 guys do it right, wonderful. But if one guy does
it wrong, boy, you've got some finger-pointing going on come
Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowd noise also can render the audible useless, especially for
the visiting team on any given Sunday. As the game grew through the
latter decades of the 20th century, so, too, did the arenas. More
people. More noise. As the decibels increase, the greater the
chance for someone on the offense, especially the wideouts and
tight ends, to be left out of the loop when the quarterback
switches to Plan B. A hand signal can help, but a gesture to
implement a new play also can serve as an alert to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea of audibles makes for great, great movies,''
said Avellini, who now runs his own real estate business in
Chicago, his office not even a Sammy Sosa shot from Wrigley Field.
``But that's good theater, not reality. Coaches thrive on control.
They love it. They want their plays run. And it's not always
because they're calling a great game. They just figure they know
more. So if you're going with the audible, let me tell you, it
better go for a first down _ it better go for a touchdown. Because
if it doesn't, and it blows up in your face, that's probably gonna
be the last game you've played for the year. That's how it worked
with (Mike) Ditka.''
</P>

   There are quarterbacks with latitude. Brett Favre has the cache
(read: security) to stride confidently to the line and check off as
desired. Here in New England, Drew Bledsoe has the kind of wiggle
room that someone like Michael Bishop might not be afforded.
Seniority has its privileges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think on this team, with Drew at quarterback, I think it's
part of our team, and I think he can handle it,'' said Patriots
coach Bill Belichick. ``But if it becomes a situation that I don't
feel that way, I won't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick remembers the days of his youth, watching the great
Johnny Unitas make it up as he went along with the Colts. Weeb
Ewbank, former coach of the Colts (with Unitas) and Jets (with
Namath), typically let his quarterbacks be their own eyes and ears.
Don Shula trusted Dan Marino to wing it when he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it's cyclical,'' offered Belichick. ``Anytime there
is a team that has success, there is usually a tendency for other
teams to copy those types of plays. I remember in the '80s when Joe
Gibbs was at Washington, they never audibled _ never. And I talked
to (ex-Skins QB) Joe Theismann about it subsequently, and I can
remember Joe saying that they could be calling off-tackle to the
right, and there could be eight guys standing in that hole, and
they were running that play. They would never audible, and you knew
that. And they won a lot of football games running it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The great Steeler teams that won four Super Bowls (1975, '76,
'79, '80) had Terry Bradshaw in charge, perhaps the most animated
when it came to the audible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ridiculous,'' said Avellini. ``Everyone from California to New
England could figure it out with Bradshaw. He might as well have
said, `Hey, everybody, I'm calling an audible! Here it comes!' It
didn't take long for defenses to figure that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanticize it as you will, said Avellini, but there was never
much art to the audible. Most often, it was used to direct a play
left that originally was designed to go right. Or like that day in
Seattle, with Gault left unguarded, it could be used as a slight
improvisation, a quick hitch designed for a 10-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   Some things look great on a blackboard, said Avellini, but a
play's mettle often collapses on the gridiron. The audible often
hurts more than helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is professional football,'' said Avellini. ``It is a job
for everyone out there, and you'd like to think that everyone is
smart and studies the playbook, and knows what's up all the time _
but it's not the case. A lot of times, it's as simple as a guy
going offside, or someone forgets the count you're going on. Most
audibles are screwed up, one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The last one Avellini remembers was headed south in the arms of
Kenny Easley. He's not certain, but he thinks it's the last game he
ever played for Mike Ditka's Chicago Bears.

ESPN REPORTER WORKS TO GIVE VIEWERS MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Solomon Wilcots knows he has limited time on camera as a
sideline reporter during ESPN's Sunday night NFL telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The former Cincinnati Bengals defensive back also knows that the
impact of a coaching change on a team's playbook often is more
complicated than that of a star player simply going to another
team.
</P>
<P>
   How, then, does Wilcots give viewers an explanation of things
most haven't seen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Quickly and to the point,'' Wilcots said. ``There are three
important questions whenever a change occurs in either the head
coaching job or offensive and defensive coordinators. Do the
players buy into the system? Do the coaches have a reputable
reputation and proven success? Is there a potential to make big
plays?''
</P>
<P>
   Not every situation is the same. Wilcots explained that Bill
Belichick, for example, coached in New England during the Bill
Parcells era, and, as a result, the players are familiar with his
style and system. ``The learning curve is not as steep,'' Wilcots
said. ``There may be a few new wrinkles but no real problems.''
</P>
<P>
   To give a tangible example, Wilcots cited Dana Stubblefield, the
high-priced defensive lineman with the Washington Redskins. When
Stubblefield played with the San Francisco 49ers, he not only made
the All-Pro team but was named the NFL's Defensive Player of the
Year. His performance dropped off considerably during his first two
years with the 'Skins.
</P>
<P>
   ``In San Francisco, Stubblefield was able to penetrate and get
up the field,'' Wilcots said. ``But in Washington he was asked to
control the line of scrimmage. He was less agggressive and
performing poorly on the field. It was not entirely his fault. The
system precluded him from utilizing his skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilcots also pointed out the difference in Cris Carter. When the
wide receiver played for the Philadelphia Eagles, he was considered
no better than average. He was traded to Minnesota, which then
hired Jerry Burns as its offensive coordinator. Burns had worked
under Joe Gibbs in Washington and won the 1992 Super Bowl by using
three wide receivers. Burns implemented that system in Minnesota,
and now Carter is on his way to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the system that enabled Carter to use his skills to
operate in the middle of the field as opposed to the sidelines,''
Wilcots said. ``It was a great marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilcots and CBS's Armen Keteyian are two of the best sideline
reporters working today. They know the game and are able to explain
quickly, simply, and clearly, the result of production meetings
where producers and on-air talent map out their game strategies.
</P>
<P>
   When ABC hired comedian Dennis Miller as an analyst on ``Monday
Night Football'' games, the network was taking its chances by
entertaining rather than informing. Humor is fine, but in the end
viewers want to watch a game and come away with a deeper
understanding of what transpired.

TELESTRATOR CONTINUES TO BE QUITE A DRAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the new gizmos used over the years to help explain plays
on the football field, there's nothing more endearing than the
telestrator, television's equivalent of locker room chalkboards.
</P>
<P>
   Developed in the late 1970s and glorified by John Madden in the
'80s, the telestrator has survived because it enables analysts to
break down a play. It takes all the guess work out of the equation.
It answers the question why.
</P>
<P>
   That's when it is working. Charlie Jones, the legendary
play-by-play man, tells the story of telestrators being ``the most
skittish'' pieces of equipment ever designed. Back in the '70s,
when Jones called AFC games for NBC, the telestrator ``might have
worked half of the time,'' Jones said. ``It was one of those things
where, two hours before kickoff, some harried engineer was working
on it with a look on his face suggesting, `I don't know if it's
going to work today.' If it worked, it was great. But if it didn't,
we just talked.''
</P>
<P>
   The telestrator has come a long way. The original design was a
``piece of junk,'' said Frank Trizano, a former CBS engineer.
Network technicians had tinkered with enabling viewers to feel as
if they were in the locker room, but it wasn't until Len Reiffel
came up with a better design that ``telestrator'' became a
household word.
</P>
<P>
   Reiffel was the deputy director of the Apollo lunar-landing
program until he started Telestrator Systems in 1976. The CBS
``chalkboard,'' as it was called then, was perfect for Madden. The
former Oakland Raiders coach used a stylus pencil with an
electronic eraser to circle key players on the frozen screen just
before the ball was snapped. He then traced offensive and defensive
routes to show how the play had materialized. The replay would
illustrate his description of the dynamics of the play. The camera
shot was from high above the 50-yard line in order to provide a
panoramic view.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure the instrument worked during the 1982 Super Bowl,
Reiffel stood behind Madden in the booth.
</P>
<P>
   The technology evolved over the years; CBS has the latest
version for use by Phil Simms this season, and, by all accounts,
it's fairly easy to operate. It has to be. Simms is not known for
his computer literacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not brain surgery,'' said Mark Wolff, CBS's lead NFL
producer.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology enables Simms to use his fingers on a
touch-screen to point to players or spots on the field to diagram
what happened. ``It's a real good teaching tool,'' Wolff said. ``We
could probably use it on every play. But we will probably limit it
to glaring mistakes or successes on offense and defense. Phil will
be able to answer the question why did something happen with more
than just words.''
</P>
<P>
   During games, Wolff sits in a nearby production truck and is in
constant communication with Simms and play-by-play man Greg Gumbel.
Simms can ask for the ``all 22 coaches look,'' which tells Wolff
that he wants the camera angle from above the play. From his touch
screen in the booth, Simms then can draw circles, boxes, arrows _
all in different colors. Simms also can move players around the
field to show where they should have been on a busted play.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, of course, is overuse. Like any toy, telestrators
can be addictive at the expense of other tools and talent.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Gaudelli, ESPN's senior coordinating NFL producer, said
that the key is not to miss the snap of the next play. ``Joe
Theismann could probably draw forever on the thing,'' Gaudelli
said. ``But we try to do it during the most appropriate time. It's
a juggling act. We try not to force it. It's like a painter's
brush. You can't talk about a beautiful painting unless you know
how to paint.''

O'BRIEN HAS GREAT EXPECTATIONS FOR BC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a gap, you know.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston College football team was not good enough to compete
with Big East champion Virginia Tech last year in any meaningful
way, and the 62-28 score against Colorado in the Insight.com Bowl
speaks quite eloquently for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad matchup for us,'' says coach Tom O'Brien. ``We would have
had a much better chance against Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was an 8-4 year for the Eagles, and by any reasonable
measure of success for this school, at this point in time, 1999 was
a very good year. But lots of schools have a good year every now
and then. That's not enough, not in football, where the price you
pay is high in every way. If you're going to invest the huge gobs
of money and the great chunks of time, not to mention the blood and
sweat (tears optional), in this enterprise, you need more than an
occasional year on the plus side. A quality coach such as Tom
O'Brien is not hired just to make sure a team shows up every
Saturday to fulfill its scheduling obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can get to the point where we expect to win seven
or eight games a year,'' outlines O'Brien. ``Then we can have a
special year every now and then where we win the conference
championship and beat Notre Dame. If you do that, then you would
have a chance to go for everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be the kind of school, like a Florida
State, where you can expect to win nine or 10 every year. But we
can get to the point where a down year is 6-5.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Year 4 of the Tom O'Brien regime. What took place in the
wake of a pair of 4-7 seasons was uplifting but hardly definitive.
The 8-4 season and an appearance in a second-tier bowl was a step
in the right direction, nothing more. The early schedule was
cupcakey, and the team was loaded with talent and experience on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was last year. BC opens its season Saturday down in
Morgantown, W.Va., where the Mountaineers enjoy one of the great
home-field advantages in the nation. O'Brien is very wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a feel for this year's team yet,'' he says. ``I
will say I haven't seen a lot of leadership manifested. Right now
all the experience is on the offensive side of the ball. That's
good for the fans. They love 43-42. But any coach would tell you
that if he had a choice about where his experience would be, he'd
want it on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   If you care even a teeny-weeny bit about college football, then
Boston College is your local horse. For the past three decades, or
ever since Jesuit soulmate Holy Cross decided big-time football
wasn't worth the fuss, BC has carried the torch for all of New
England. The Eagles are our link with the Bowl Alliance and Lee
Corso. If it weren't for BC, the likes of Penn State, Air Force,
Texas, Texas A&AMP;M, Stanford, Clemson, North Carolina, California,
Tennessee, Southern Cal, Ohio State, Michigan, and, of course,
Notre Dame would never have come any closer to us than the
Meadowlands. And don't forget that, thanks to BC's membership in
the Big East, Miami, Syracuse, and Virginia Tech _ Michael Vick
comes to town Sept. 30 _ are visitors to the Heights every other
year.
</P>
<P>
   It's been BC or nothing for the region's college football fans,
although now Connecticut has dealt itself in. Wait till the folks
in Storrs find out just how hard football is, compared with
basketball, in which two stars and three role players get you into
the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the right man to steer the ship through big-time college
football's treacherous waters is very difficult. BC is not an
obvious end-of-the-rainbow job for a properly ambitious coach.
Anyone taking the BC job is being asked to fight some quality
opponents with one hand tied at least gently behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a much larger task than I thought it was when I came
here,'' O'Brien declares. ``There were some serious problems with
the football program.''
</P>
<P>
   There still are. Start with the delicate matter of facilities
once you get past the stadium itself, which, in its renovative
state, is perfectly acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every other way, we probably have the worst facilities in
the entire Big East,'' O'Brien maintains. ``In areas such as
meeting rooms, locker rooms, strength and training area, and
practice fields, we are way behind.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a facility being discussed, but there's no need to
commission the champagne just yet. There will be many long
negotiations with the city and, yes, the neighbors, before a spade
ever meets dirt.
</P>
<P>
   He's not whining. He's just answering questions. Anyway, a good
Naval Academy grad and Marine captain does not whine. He copes.
</P>
<P>
   So who is this guy? Well, on the personality scale he's no Jack
Bicknell but he's no Tom Coughlin, either. Is it possible to be a
compassionate disciplinarian?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a disciplinarian, yes, but I'm not going to ask
the kids to shave their heads or do any ridiculous things,'' he
says. ``I believe in accountability, both on and off the field.
I've been part of some very stressful disciplinary situations in
both the Naval Academy and the Marine Corps, and some of the things
I've seen have been good and some have been bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He wonders if people understand the enormity of the task for any
coach at BC's level. ``I know we're headed in the right
direction,'' he says. ``I liked last year's freshman class, and
this one is even better. But it takes time to build. We need to get
to the point where a freshman plays because he is really, really
good, not because he is needed to fill out the two-deep. A program
needs continuity with the right staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A, according to O'Brien: Virginia Tech, last year's
national runnerup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what (coach) Frank Beamer's record was in his
first six years there?'' he says, reaching for the book. ``Are you
ready? 2-9, 3-8, 6-4-1, 6-5, 5-6, 2-8-1. He didn't really turn the
corner until his seventh year.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, we get the message. Presumably, BC athletic director Gene
DeFilippo does, too.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing on Tom O'Brien's mind is the subject of rivalry.
He says BC is in desperate need of one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Notre Dame,'' he says. ``BC cares deeply about Notre
Dame, but Notre Dame doesn't care about BC. Maybe they will if we
beat them a few more times, but right now their rival is USC. We
need a real end-of-the-year game with a big rival. You look at our
league and the only possibility, I guess, is Syracuse. Ohio
State-Michigan, Auburn-Alabama, Cal-Stanford, or in-state rivalries
such as Clemson-South Carolina or Virginia-Virginia Tech, those
games are huge. We don't have that, and we need it. Those games are
great for college football.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, BC had just such a game for more than five decades.
But that was when Holy Cross was in another mind-set. With all due
respect to the folks at Storrs, serious college football in New
England begins and ends where it has for the past 30 years _ in
Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.

PRESEASON A USELESS CAKEWALK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've said it before and we'll say it again. Preseason college
football games serve no purpose and help no one. As examples, we
point to the mismatches we saw last weekend with Kansas State
rolling over Iowa, USC trouncing Penn State, and Florida State
beating up BYU.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't even mention the cancellation of the Virginia
Tech-Georgia Tech game because of a lightning storm that hit the
Blacksburg, Va., area at kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable event at that game was that lightning struck
ESPN analyst Lee Corso's car in the parking lot behind the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, playing games in August _ unless it's the last day
_ is too early to start a college football season. Rarely are these
competitive because the primary team in each game is basically
given a list of opponents from which to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely will a coach choose a team he feels can beat him.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, these games are being phased out in the next couple
of years. If you are going to play an extra game, play it at the
end of the season in a playoff format, rather than in August.
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to note that one of the main reasons many
people oppose a college football playoff system is because it would
mean too many games for the student-athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, we see the potential for, say, a team from the SEC or Big
12 to play a preseason game, such as Kansas State did last week,
play an 11-game regular-season schedule, play in the Big 12 title
game, and play in a bowl game. That sounds like a 14-game schedule,
which would be in line with the number of games the last two teams
would have to play with a 16-team playoff system.
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise that Georgia Tech didn't agree to a December
makeup of its game against Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets wanted the August game as a warm-up for the
season. But a December game is a different matter and could be
costly in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech, which is adjusting to life without quarterback Joe
Hamilton, could be a 6-5 team at the end of the regular season.
That would make them bowl eligible. Playing _ and losing to Va.
Tech _ would make them 6-6 and not eligible for a bowl, since NCAA
rules state a team must win six games and be above .500 to play in
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A kick in the teeth
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's the difference between the elite teams and the
not-so-elite teams. Florida State opened its season with a solid
29-3 win over BYU last week and Seminole coach Bobby Bowden is
moaning over the lack of a running game (FSU rushed for a net 57
yards on 36 carries) and the lack of consistency from quarterback
Chris Weinke, who was 32 of 50 for 318 yards and two touchdowns.
``Unless we run better,'' said Bowden, ``we might not make a bowl
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thing Bowden should be worried about is his kicking
game. With Sebastian Janikowski gone, the Seminoles don't have a
proven kicker. Heir apparent Brent Cimorelli is on the shelf with a
pulled hamstring and walk-on Matt Munyon had a rough start with a
pair of missed field goals and a missed extra point. The lack of a
consistent kicking game could haunt the Seminoles down the road.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For love of the game
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some guys just love to play college football. Check out Nebraska
punter Dan Hadenfeldt, who was granted a sixth year of eligibility
by the NCAA. Hadenfeldt won't play Saturday against San Jose State
because he played in the Hula Bowl last season _ he assumed his
college career was done. For that sin, the NCAA said he had to sit
out one game. But since Nebraska probably won't be forced to punt
Saturday, it doesn't appear to be too stiff a penalty . . . The
Pac-10, which earned some respect with USC's rout of Penn State in
the Kickoff Classic Sunday, can get even more back if UCLA can play
a competitive game against Alabama Saturday at the Rose Bowl . . .
It will be Alabama's first appearance in the Rose Bowl in 54 years
. . . Alabama is reportedly bringing 25,000 fans to Pasadena . . .
One of the question marks at Texas was inexperience at wide
receiver. The Longhorn ranks got thinner when sophomore tight end
Bo Scaife went down for the season with a knee injury . . .
Speaking of Texas, insiders say sophomore QB Chris Simms is likely
to be the starter in next week's opener against Louisiana-Lafayette
over Major Applewhite, but that a rotation between the two is very
much in the works . . . Things don't look good at Wake Forest. The
Deacons have only five starters returning, the fewest of any
Division 1A team . . . When Virginia Tech travels to East Carolina
next week for a Thursday night game, a reunion will take place. One
of East Carolina's wide receivers is Marcellus Harris, who also
happened to be the starting QB in Hampton Roads, Va., when Michael
Vick was a freshman. Vick's high school coach Tommy Reamon knew
about Vick and went up to Harris in the middle of the season and
informed Harris he would be at wide receiver the next week. Two
weeks later, Vick to Harris combined for a couple of TD passes . .
. When BYU plays at Virginia Saturday, one thing seems certain.
Both teams will score. BYU holds the NCAA record for longest
consecutive games scoring (313), while Virginia holds the ACC
record for consecutive games scored (188) . . . Oklahoma coach
Bobby Stoops has been at Norman only for a season, but already OU
officials are trying to make sure Stoops stays around. They have
recommended to the Board of Regents that Stoops be offered a
contract extension through 2005 with a boost in play and a
million-dollar annuity . . . Here's a trivia question. Name the
college football team with the most victories in the 1990s? It's
Marshall, which piled up 114 wins and has a current winning streak
of 31 games . . . Their success is drawing students through
television. ``I saw Marshall play football on TV and it looked like
fun to be in the stands,'' said freshman Bruce Kish, who came to
Huntington, W.Va., from Carteret, N.J. ``I never knew about
Marshall until I saw them play on ESPN.'' Sounds like a nice way to
choose a college . . . With last week's loss to USC, Penn State
coach Joe Paterno still needs seven wins to surpass Alabama's Bear
Bryant as the winningest 1A coach in history. With the Lions
playing last week, this could be one of those 6-5 seasons in State
College. Let's see how the Lions do against Toledo Saturday. Toledo
could be this year's version of Marshall, a sleeper pick in the MAC
. . . The loss to USC dropped Penn State out of the polls for the
first time since 1992 . . . Look for Indiana to use talented QB
Antwaan Randle El at a variety of positions during the year as
Hoosier coach Cam Cameron looks for ways to juice up the IU offense
. . . Michigan QB Drew Henson is responding quicker to treatment
for his broken foot than expected and could be back in a couple of
weeks.

HE USUALLY MAKES THE WEISS CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ In 1994, he coached Ben Coates. Result: 96
catches, the NFL record for a tight end. In 1995, he coached Curtis
Martin. Result: 1,487 rushing yards, the Patriots' record. In 1996,
he coached Terry Glenn: Result: 90 receptions, an NFL rookie
record.
</P>
<P>
   A few years have gone by, and Charlie Weis is now running the
offense in New England.
</P>
<P>
   If there's magic in Weis's handling of players, the Patriots
want stardust sprinkled over Drew Bledsoe in the 2000 season.
Weis's offense certainly is somewhat familiar to Bledsoe, because
parts of it derive from the playbook of Ray Perkins, the
coordinator during part of Weis's time as a positional coach. But
over the past couple of seasons, which he spent as offensive
coordinator for the New York Jets, Weis has added a few things,
including a bevy of trick plays to be used if the offense sputters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the things are the same as the old offense, though the
terminology has changed and things have been added,'' said Bledsoe.
``But it's an offense I'm comfortable in. Because Charlie was here
before, there's a comfort level with what he's trying to do. I
understand. It's not like starting completely over in a completely
different system.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a welcome change for the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Two seasons ago, when Ernie Zampese became coordinator, Bledsoe
had to learn a radically different offense. Zampese's system relies
on timed passing routes that require the quarterback to throw the
ball when his receiver is making his break. At first, Bledsoe liked
the system, but by the second half of the season his protection had
broken down, his running game was nonexistent, and it was left to
him to do it all on his own. The quarterback was swallowed up.
</P>
<P>
   Weis wants his quarterback to be more comfortable than that. Not
the type of coordinator who pushes his philosophy, Weis simply
presents his plays and how he wants them run. When he got his four
quarterbacks together in the offseason, he asked each to point out
plays in the playbook that they thought they'd prefer to run. In a
quarterback camp, Weis had each call his own plays while running
the offense. Each quarterback, naturally, gravitated to plays he
felt most comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't force a player to do something he can't do or
doesn't want to do. It won't work,'' said Weis. ``The player has to
be comfortable with the call. If you make a QB do what he can't do,
you might have a fumble or an interception or a turnover that could
mean the difference between winning and losing a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Weis was part of the offensive coaching staff in 1996, when the
Patriots made it to the Super Bowl. Balance was the key to that
offense. Glenn was superb, Coates caught 62 passes, and Shawn
Jefferson (50 receptions) opened up space for the passing game by
taking cornerbacks and safeties downfield. Martin ran well (1,152
yards) and caught a lot of passes (46) out of the backfield, with
Sam Gash smash-mouthing opponents (until he was hurt) and the line
was blocking well. What a thing.
</P>
<P>
   The '98 Jets, with Weis in his first season as offensive
corrdinator, achieved the same balance with Vinny Testaverde,
Martin, Keyshawn Johnson, Wayne Chrebet, and a decent tight end,
Kyle Brady.
</P>
<P>
   Weis remembers Thursday and Friday sessions in which he and
quarterbacks coach Dan Henning would go over the game plan with
Testaverde, who would have the option of throwing out certain
plays. ``We'd throw out 10-15 plays a week,'' said Weis. ``If Vinny
didn't feel comfortable with it, it was gone, because if you run
it, something bad always happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Weis understands that he can call the most creative plays in the
world, but if each unit within the offense isn't taking care of
business, it all will break down. If the quarterback, in
particular, doesn't believe in the play, it won't be executed
properly. That might have contributed to Bledsoe's ineffectiveness
during the second half of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Suiting plays to your quarterback isn't a new idea. Most
coordinators attempt to make their quarterback comfortable. And
Weis contends that as a quarterback gets more comfortable within a
system, his repertoire grows. Once a quarterback is comfortable
with 12 plays, and there's positive feedback, he will want new
challenges, perhaps taking on plays that he once shied away from.
Obviously, Bledsoe never will run the option like Michael Bishop
does, but he may, in time, feel better about rolling out and
throwing on the run.
</P>
<P>
   That confidence also grows as the quarterback comes to believe
he can drop back to pass and not get hammered every time. Weis
understands this. He knows Testaverde went through that confidence
struggle early in his career, in Cleveland and Tampa Bay, and it
gave him a mind-set he had to overcome when he arrived in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But once his line kept him protected, Testaverde showed all of
the things he does so well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things Weis said when he took the offensive
coordinator's job in Foxborough was, ``Vinny had come from a
situation where he had been exposed a lot and hit a lot. It's
important that we don't allow that to happen this year to Drew.''
</P>
<P>
   Weis knew full well that it had happened to Bledsoe last season.
What he saw _ though he didn't say it _ was a quarterback who had
almost come to accept that on most occasions he would be getting
hit, either after he threw the ball, while he was throwing, or
before he could get rid of the ball. Weis understood how much that
can change the performance level of a quarterback, even one like
Bledsoe, who had reached Pro Bowls and had thrown for an ungodly
number of yards for someone his age.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of offensive philosophy, Bledsoe is back to a more
stable environment. That has to be a mental boost. Then again, it
could be negated if the Patriots continue their experiment of
yanking Bledsoe for Bishop in goal-line situations. Quarterbacks
want to score points.
</P>
<P>
   But Weis understands this. Which is why Bledsoe will be the one
running the offense, even in tough spots. And only if he shows he
can't get the ball into the end zone will you see Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is about winning the game,'' said Weis.
``Whatever allows us to win the game the best way, we'll do it.''

 &HT;    Live so you'll never have to see the disappointment in your
daddy's eyes
 &HT;    By Phil Latham

<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ I was born at high noon 46 years ago, back in
the days when the opening day of dove season began at high noon on
the Friday of Labor Day weekend. The day, as I understand it, my
birthday was Friday.
</P>
<P>
   So my father was pacing, pacing, pacing outside the labor room
and I'm thinking it was every bit as much because he was worried
that he was going to miss the first day of hunting as it was
worried about my delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Because, as the story goes, shortly after my birth he began
pacing, pacing, pacing again until my mother said, ``Go on and go
hunting. You're driving me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   He went.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if he got his limit but I would be surprised if he
didn't. My father was the best shot I've ever known, just like he
was the best poker player I've ever known. If you're lucky like I
was, your dad was the best at doing something that you've ever
known. This is true though there may be a million better shots and
poker players. It doesn't matter, he'll always be the best to me.
</P>
<P>
   It was 10 birthdays later that my father took me on my first
dove hunt. As the only gun I'd ever shot was a .22-caliber rifle, I
was scared to death when he handed me the .410-gauge shotgun. A
.410 is the smallest shotgun I know of, but it still made a big
noise and it banged against my shoulder, unlike the rifle.
</P>
<P>
   It was a single shot that you had to break open every time you
shot it, remove the old shell and stick another one in. There was
only one chance to shoot at a fast-flying dove. If you missed you
might as well watch the beauty of the dove's flight. Trying to
reload that quickly was useless.
</P>
<P>
   I missed frequently. In fact, I missed always. I'm told doves
can fly up to 60 miles per hour and I can shoot at about half that
speed. I shot an entire box of shells and I'm not sure I even
frightened any doves.
</P>
<P>
   Before sitting me down beneath a tree in a lonely spot in the
maize field, my father had told me that I could only shoot a dove
in flight. It was bad sportsmanship and not like a man to shoot a
dove sitting on a fence or in a tree. Requiring that the birds were
flying, my father said, gave them an even chance.
</P>
<P>
   With me behind the gun, their chances were a heck of a lot
better than even. I sat shooting and missing, thinking about
everyone else coming back at the end of the day with bags full of
game, talking about wonderful shots. I would be coming back with a
bag full of spent shotgun shells.
</P>
<P>
   That's when it happened. A big, fat dove landed in the tree
right above me, sitting on a branch so close it felt as if I could
touch him. Maybe he'd been told by the other doves that this was a
safe zone.
</P>
<P>
   I squirmed and he didn't move. I moved my shotgun and he didn't
move. Then I began thinking about bagging him. I couldn't miss,
could I? And who would ever know I hadn't made the world's best
shot? That dove would taste as good as any other.
</P>
<P>
   So, against my father's explicit instructions, I lifted my gun
and shot. When the smoke cleared, I could see I had gotten my first
dove.
</P>
<P>
   Or had I? As close as I was I still had, unbelieveably, not
gotten a clean kill. Truth to tell, the bird was little more than
winged. When I tried to pick him up, he jumped like a rabbit,
scaring me half to death.
</P>
<P>
   He jumped and I jumped. We hopped all around that field until it
became clear to me I was going to have to shoot the bird again, if
nothing else to put the poor thing out of its misery.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to make sure I didn't miss, I got four or five feet
away, pulled the hammer back and pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   It was a clean kill, that's for sure _ and I do mean clean.
There wasn't a trace of anything left of that bird, not bones or
feathers. It was as if I vaporized it.
</P>
<P>
   My father always had an uncanny knack of coming upon me at the
exact moment I was doing something wrong. He was standing behind me
when I shot the bird the second time and asked me what I was doing.
</P>
<P>
   I had to explain the entire event not only to him, but all the
other adults. The disappointment in his eyes felt like a life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But, as fathers do, he didn't let one error in judgment keep him
from taking me along. He never lost the faith that I would do right
merely because I had once done wrong. On successive birthdays when
my father took me hunting I remembered the rules. I always was a
lousy shot, but I never took the easy way out again.

 &HT;    Dwelling on the Civil War
 &HT;    By Jim Minter

<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Fergit, Hell!''
</P>
<P>
   Would you believe it? We're in the third century since the late
unpleasantness with our northern neighbors, and ain't nobody
fergittin' nothin'. And nobody is forgiving anything.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago those bumper stickers on pickup trucks were kind
of amusing. They complemented gun racks and went well with a
package of Red Man chewing tobacco on the dash. I thought about
getting one myself, especially after Georgia football slipped from
the championship class and stickers heckling Florida Gators had to
be peeled off or covered up.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed. If you are stocking up on Vienna sausages
and sardines in anticipation of a deer-hunting weekend with redneck
friends, pseudo or otherwise, check to see that your bumpers are
clean. Only things like ``I Brake for Animals'' and ``Save The
Trees'' are permissible. Despite something called the First
Amendment, the wrong kind of bumper sticker can cause a lot of
trouble. This from The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa aluminum has a plant in the small town of Badin, N.C. Like
many large companies, Alcoa is facing a discrimination lawsuit by
black employees. Until a few months ago race relations at the plant
were looking up. Although the work force is 3-to-1 majority white,
Allen Williams, who is black, was elected head of the union.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after taking office Mr. Williams took a pencil-and-paper
stroll through the plant's parking lot. He jotted down license
plate numbers of employee vehicles bearing Confederate flag
stickers. Then he cross-referenced the plates with union records,
which include tag numbers. After identifying the offenders, he sent
their names to the attorney representing black employees in the
discrimination suit.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa's management quickly banned all vehicles bearing
Confederate flag bumper or windshield stickers from the company
parking lot. Also banned were vehicles with special license plates
issued by the state to sons of Confederate veterans whose ancestors
fought on the wrong side a hundred and thirty-something years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, when Mr. Williams was elected president of the
union, racial harmony at the plant was thought to be at an all-time
high. Now it's at an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees have kept their stickers and park elsewhere.
Protesters gather every day to fly Confederate flags at the plant's
entrance. Some white union members have started a move to oust
Williams from the presidency. What they have at the plant is a
first-class mess.
</P>
<P>
   Reading between the lines, I had guessed that Gov. Roy Barnes
and other leaders, black and white, were quietly working out an
amicable solution to Georgia's flag problem. Now I'm not sure if
they'll be successful.
</P>
<P>
   Driving through rural South Georgia earlier this summer I saw
Confederate flags sprouting like crab grass after a summer rain.
They're on lawns, on trucks, on tractors, on cars, on houses, on
barns. The Stars and Bars are being flown by people who five years
ago had no idea what the state flag looked like, or even knew we
had a flag. Expect some very nervous legislators to show up in
Atlanta next January.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard it said that the flag controversy has set racial
relations back 10 years. That may be a conservative estimate. Even
people willing to change the flag ask the question: ``What's
next?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure exactly how the discussion about removing Tom
Watson's statue from the Capitol lawn got started. I don't imagine
the timing was welcomed by those hopeful of avoiding a nasty flag
fight like the one they had in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   After Tom Watson, who, or what, is next? The three most famous,
or infamous, Confederates are carved into Stone Mountain: Jefferson
Davis, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. One presided over the
Confederacy; the other two fought under the Stars and Bars. Do we
sandblast?
</P>
<P>
   With what we now know about the author of the Declaration of
Independence, should we tear down the Jefferson Memorial in
Washington? Andrew Jackson's army happily chased Seminole Indians
from their homes in Florida. His picture on the $10 bill must be
offensive to Native Americans. The newspaper you are reading has
some embarrassing racist moments in its history. Under today's
rules there's not much from the past that can't be construed to
offend somebody.
</P>
<P>
   A bit of water has gone over the proverbial dam since 1864. At
some point we have to have closure. A little forgiving is required
as well as forgetting.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Williams mucked an opportunity to cement racial harmony when
he got into tag identification of his fellow employees after they
had elected him president of their majority-white union. Alcoa's
banning employee vehicles from the company lot because of bumper
stickers was constitutionally suspect and bound to boomerang.
</P>
<P>
   The way we're going, we might as well go ahead and issue bumper
stickers to everybody. White folks can have one that says ``Fergit,
Hell.'' Black folks can have one that says ``Fergive, Hell!'' And
we can all use the same parking lot.

 &HT;    They built it, and we came
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The final week of the Dragons regular season
found folks in a celebratory mood _ and, after a record-breaking
season, thinking about the possibilities for downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the Arcade?'' businessman Sandy Mendelson demanded
Tuesday night, working at a booth selling raffle tickets for the
Mary Beall Get Well Fund that he spearheaded. ``They need to open
it up. It would make a great little antiques mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown is alive with the scurrying of backhoes and the
pounding of metal as RiverScape and the new performing arts center
take shape. But the ballpark still seems like the cornerstone of
downtown's renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   `` 'Build it and they will come,' `` said Mendelson, president
of Mendelson's Liquidation Outlet near the stadium. ``They built
this place and people came. The same thing could happen for the
Arcade.''
</P>
<P>
   Build it and they will come. Tony Capizzi only wishes it had
been that easy: The Vision. The Voices. The Ghosts. And presto
change-o! The Field of Dreams.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, it happened the hard way: The Vision. The Voice _
mainly Tony's, at first, cheerleading that we could make it happen.
And the ghosts of failed downtown dreams: ``Tony, you're a crazy
dreamer. A spendthrift. A menace to our kids' playgrounds and our
neighborhood police officers.''
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, thanks to Capizzi and a host of others it happened,
and now, we can't help feeling we had our own Field of Dreams this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   It was what they told us it would be, and maybe a little more.
</P>
<P>
   There's the air of relaxed happiness, of an oversized
neighborhood block party.
</P>
<P>
   There's the parking lot guy who smiles his forgiveness if you're
short a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   There's the way you can ``borrow'' empty seats without being
hunted down like the FBI's Ten Most Wanted, or ruffling any
feathers if the real owner shows up. There's the friendly,
volunteer workers who never serve you an attitude with your hot dog
and beer.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't come in over budget, unlike the Bengals' new Paul
Brown stadium. The Bengals recently threw an intimate open house
for 130,000 fans that prompted one friend to quip, ``At least they
brought it in for less than the cost of the space shuttle.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not do-or-die baseball, it's entertainment in its purest
form. Where else in town can you find corporate executives,
8-year-olds, women who never watch any other sporting event (you
know who you are) and true baseball fans come together for the
sheer joy of rooting on a bunch of underpaid, unspoiled ball
players? It's easy to get lawn seats and join the blanket crowd,
it's easy to park, and, quicker than you can say ``Crazy Cam'' _ or
make a goofy face _ your kid can get his mug on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   They built it, and we came _ 574,000 of us before Thursday's
game, the final game of the regular season. The energy of the place
night in and night out quiets all those Doubting Thomases who
predicted, ``Minor league baseball will never fly downtown.'' Well,
balls fly out of that park nearly every week, much to the delight
of the knothole gang on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   I ran into Capizzi at a game the other night, wearing a Dragons
polo shirt and a grin that made him look about 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you ever get tired of coming here?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   Stupid question. Tony Capizzi never got tired of coming to the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did we, Tony. Neither did we.

 &HT;    Classroom woes call for a return to strict rules, accountability
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After two atomic bombs forced Japan to accept unconditional
surrender on Aug. 15, 1945, one of the highest priorities of
American forces was educational reforms for Japanese schools.
</P>
<P>
   American and Allied leaders knew they had to dismantle Japan's
militaristic education system. By early 1946, American educators,
in the form of the United States Education Mission to Japan,
recommended sweeping reforms that were adopted in their entirety
throughout Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms included extended compulsory attendance,
coeducation, support for teacher initiatives and local control by
elected school boards.
</P>
<P>
   Also included among the reforms were new requirements that
Japan's teachers receive their teacher education within Japan's
reorganized four-year university system. Anyone who successfully
completed professional training in a four-year university could
apply for certification as a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the American educational reforms were changed
after Allied occupation forces left Japan in 1952, most of the
American-imposed reforms stayed in place and were responsible for
Japan's meteoric postwar rise to international economic power.
</P>
<P>
   Now Japanese school children routinely wipe the floor with
American school children whenever or however scholastic achievement
is compared.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, U.S. school children score near the bottom on
scholastic achievement when compared to most developed nations.
</P>
<P>
   Americans who attempt to defend the dismal academic showing of
the U.S. school system frequently say that Japan's system may
produce results for Japanese children, but it will not work for
American children.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't say is that Japan's school system is the
American school system before it got watered down and dumbed down
with a series of ``reforms'' that took discipline and respect away
from teachers and accountability away from students.
</P>
<P>
   Starting back in the 1960s when the country was split on the
Vietnam War and other issues, a line of thought emerged on college
campuses that competition was bad. It was a tactic used by
militaristic and authoritarian oppressors to humiliate the masses,
or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   This anti-establishment line held that it was important to
respect people as individuals, for who they were, not what the
establishment wanted them to attain. Besides, establishment
oppressors were employing dehumanizing standards just so they could
exploit workers for profits and power.
</P>
<P>
   This genesis of the touchy-feely movement quickly spread across
college campuses and throughout much of the nation's educational
community.
</P>
<P>
   Many college courses dropped grades altogether. Students passed
or failed based on fuzzy subjective judgments. Most students
passed. A failing grade would hurt the student's self esteem.
What's more, no one is qualified to judge another human being.
</P>
<P>
   Once the walls of academia had been breached, anti-establishment
insurgents rushed in with new math, less homework, holistic
grading, social promotions, open classes, whole language reading
instruction, less discipline, more counselors and an endless
procession of ``progressive'' reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Now the two major presidential candidates promise to reform
public education. That's good, of course, if it means increased
learning for America's school children.
</P>
<P>
   The most promising reforms are a step back in time to when
academic standards were high, measurements were precise, students
were held accountable and teachers had the respect of their
students and the community.
</P>
<P>
   It will take more than money, Internet connections and small
class sizes to reform what has been deformed for three decades.

 &HT;    Summer movie slump gives way to promising fall season
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ ``At my signal, unleash hell.''
</P>
<P>
   With those words, ``Gladiator's'' Russell Crowe launched the
2000 summer movie season.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe's command proved oddly prophetic for studios and audiences
alike. After Ridley Scott's thrilling historical epic, which earned
$181 million, summer's sizzle quickly fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   Summer 2000 was mediocre at best, lacking the sort of
blockbusters that draw big audiences to movie theaters, whetting
their appetites for repeat viewings and additional cinematic fare.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing to compare with last year's ``Star Wars''
prequel, ``Austin Powers'' sequel and out-of-nowhere sensations
``The Blair Witch Project ``and ``The Sixth Sense.'' Nor were there
any date-night romantic comedies such as Julia Roberts'
back-to-back hits, ``Notting Hill'' and ``The Runaway Bride.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, summer 2000 revenues will likely finish 4.6
percent, or $200 million, below last year's record $3 billion
box-office take, according to industry figures. Paul Dergarabedian,
president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks movie attendance,
was quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying that would be the
second best summer in terms of revenue, but higher ticket prices
mean attendance probably was off by at least 10 percent. Hollywood
makes at least 40 percent of its annual receipts between May and
August.
</P>
<P>
   September doesn't look to be a gold-medal month at the box
office. Most studios are avoiding competition with the Summer
Olympic Games in Sydney, which kick off Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Summer 2000's top movie contenders were strong out of the gate
but most tended to fade quickly. Only ``Gladiator,'' ``Mission:
Impossible 2'' and ``Hollow Man'' managed to hold on to the No. 1
spot at the box office for more than one week.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the big earners, such as ``Mission: Impossible 2'' ($212
million), ``The Perfect Storm'' ($175.6 million) and ``Dinosaur''
($133 million), met with mixed response from critics and audiences
alike. Given their budgets, hits such as ``Dinosaur,'' which is
reported to have cost around $140 million, might still be viewed as
financial failures.
</P>
<P>
   Summer was littered with critical and commercial
disappointments, from underachievers such as ``The Patriot'' ($110
million) and ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' ($87 million) to outright duds
such as ``Battlefield Earth ``($21 million) and ``Titan A.E.'' ($22
million).
</P>
<P>
   The most successful trend was comedies by black filmmakers or
featuring black stars.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy scored his biggest opening ever with ``Nutty
Professor 2: The Klumps,'' which has made $110 million to date,
prompting talk of another sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lawrence enjoyed similar success under similarly heavy
makeup with ``Big Momma's House,'' which cooked up $115 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scary Movie'' was summer's only surprise hit. The teen horror
spoof, directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans and starring his brothers
Shawn and Marlon, crept up on industry analysts to reap an
astonishing $148.5 million. A sequel begins production this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee's documentary ``The Original Kings of Comedy,''
featuring a quartet of black stand-up comics, opened with an
impressive $11 million on only 847 screens and is now up to $21.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   High-toned horror was also a hit with audiences, as evidenced by
sizable late-summer takes for ``What Lies Beneath'' ($130.9
million), ``Hollow Man'' ($66.6 million and counting) and ``The
Cell'' ($33.7 million in two weeks). But ``Bless the Child'' ($18
million) didn't fare nearly as well.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Lee's documentary, these films all
received widely mixed to mostly negative reviews. Most dropped
precipitously at the box office after their opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day traditionally is one of the year's lowest
movie-attendence weekends. As such, this weekend's only wide
release is ``Highlander: Endgame'' _ the fourth and supposedly
final entry in the long-running series about immortal Scottish
warriors. The film was not pre-screened for critics, which
typically indicates that it's a bomb. On Sept. 15, the same day as
the Sydney Olympics' opening ceremony, the only wide-release
offering is ``Bait,'' an action comedy starring Jamie Foxx, who no
doubt hopes to repeat Murphy and Lawrence's success.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving Wednesday is ``Turn It Up,'' a drama about a gifted
musician struggling to escape the streets, starring hip-hop stars
Pras Michel and Ja Rule. Following next Friday are ``The Way of the
Gun,'' a bullet-riddled caper-gone-awry story starring Ryan
Phillipe and Benicio Del Toro; ``The Watcher,'' in which burned-out
FBI agent James Spader faces sadistic serial killer Keanu Reeves;
and ``Nurse Betty,'' a comic fantasy in which delusional soap opera
fan Renee Zellweger stalks heartthrob Greg Kinnear while being
pursued by bickering hit men Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock.
</P>
<P>
   None of the four brings much in the way of buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Things pick up dramatically on Sept. 29 with the wide release of
``Jerry Maguire'' writer-director Cameron Crowe's ``Almost
Famous,'' a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age story about a
15-year-old music fan who lands an assignment from Rolling Stone
magazine to interview the up-and-coming band Stillwater. The film
is being touted as a likely Oscar contender and stars Billy Crudup,
Jason Lee, Frances McDormand and Kate Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Also opening Sept. 29 is ``Remember the Titans,'' a fact-based
sports drama set in 1971 Virginia, where high-school football
tradition is put to the test when an all-black school and an
all-white school are forced to integrate. There is talk of an
Academy Award nomination for Denzel Washington, who stars as the
determined head coach.
</P>
<P>
   October looks to be a mixed bag of tricks and treats, with a
seasonal emphasis on supernatural themes. Among the timely
offerings are ``Lost Souls ``(Oct. 13), ``Bedazzled ``(Oct. 20),
``Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 ``(Oct. 27) and ``The Little
Vampire'' (Oct. 27).
</P>
<P>
   But beware _ ``Lost Souls,'' an occult thriller starring Winona
Ryder and Ben Chaplin, has been shelved for more than a year.
``Bedazzled,'' a remake of the 1967 British comedy with Brendan
Fraser as a poor sap who sells his soul to shapely devil Elizabeth
Hurley, was pushed back from summer. So, too, was Nora Ephron's
``Lucky Numbers'' (Oct. 27), a bad-buzz magnet in which John
Travolta and Lisa Kudrow attempt to rig the state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   October's more promising releases include ``Dr. T &AMP; the Women''
(Oct. 6), ``Meet the Parents ``(Oct. 6), ``The Contender'' (Oct.
13) and ``Pay It Forward'' (Oct. 20).
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. T &AMP; the Women'' is an ensemble comedy from Robert Altman
starring Richard Gere as a frantically overworked gynecologist,
with Helen Hunt, Farrah Fawcett, Laura Dern, Liv Tyler, Tara Reid,
Kate Hudson and Shelley Long as the women in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet the Parents'' is a comedy from ``Austin Powers'' director
Jay Roach starring Ben Stiller as a groom-to-be who has a
disastrous first meeting with his girlfriend's family _ most
notably her intimidating father, played by Robert De Niro.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Contender'' is a political thriller starring Joan Allen as
a senator chosen to be the first woman to hold the office of vice
president. Jeff Bridges co-stars as the president, with Gary Oldman
as a powerful adversary who will stop at nothing to discredit
Bridges' nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pay It Forward'' stars Kevin Spacey as a social-studies
teacher who gives an assignment to his junior high school class to
think of an idea to make the world a better place and then put it
into action. Haley Joel Osment is the student whose plan for
``paying forward'' favors sets in motion an unprecedented wave of
human kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the phenomenon doesn't extend to Hollywood,
otherwise the studios would never subject us to ``Digimon: The
Movie'' (Oct. 6), the ``Saturday Night Live'' spin-off ``The Ladies
Man ``(Oct. 13) or a Sylvester Stallone remake of the classic
British gangster thriller ``Get Carter''(Oct. 13).
</P>
<P>
   Summer's slide might continue until early November.

 &HT;    Ford, Harley create super truck
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In an era when Ford has paired off with everyone from
upscale jewelers such as Cartier (Lincoln Town Car) to outdoorsmen
(Eddie Bauer Explorer), what's surprising about Dearborn's decision
to market a Harley-Davidson pickup?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. Unless it's the fact Ford has shown remarkable
restraint with its Harley-Davidson F-150. It's a Supercab (four
doors, seating for five) that does stand out in any crowd, though,
thanks to its aggressive front end, chrome side pipes and
monochromatic black finish accentuated by Harley-Davidson orange
pinstriping.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we're talking niche market here _ Ford plans only to build
up to 7,000 _ but this is also an era when people go to extremes to
individualize their personal transportation. Check the aftermarket
ads in any buff publication. So why not let the manufacturer save
you the trouble?
</P>
<P>
   Ford's base price is $32,305 (the test truck totaled $33,205),
but the appeal is strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd pay this much for a pickup truck,'' says
Joe Figueroa of Hapeville, Ga., who opted for one. ``I figure it's
an investment of sorts, and I don't drive it except on weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-wheeler enthusiasts were impressed. ``Man, it's cool,'' said
Dwayne Humphreys, a service technician at Earl Small's
Harley-Davidson in Marietta. ``And it's good as far as room and
getting in and out of the back and hauling things.''
</P>
<P>
   It does retain its utility, assuming owners can bring themselves
to sully its pristine showroom appearance. Dings and scratches
might provoke shudders, but underneath that rakish appearance is a
work-truck suspension. And if that 360-horsepower V-8 engine with
440 pounds-feet of torque isn't muscle enough, consider what
Figueroa plans for his baby: ``I may do something (different with
the powertrain) ... see if motor sports comes out with a
supercharger or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The cabin is about as good as it gets for pickups, with embossed
leather captain's chairs, power accessories, CD player and a ``spun
metal'' instrument panel. The rear seats _ still strange to talk
about rear seats in a pickup, isn't it? _ are good for three, and
the half-size rear doors facilitate carrying things when people
aren't occupying them.
</P>
<P>
   The ride isn't cushy because of the super-duty suspension and
those 20-inch tires, but it's superior to that of most older
pickups now on the road. The handling is good, and drivers soon
realize that the Harley-Davidson isn't going to rock 'n' roll in
corners as might be expected.
</P>
<P>
   It has benefited from the use of some components developed for
the Ford Special Vehicles Team (SVT) Lightning pickup, a
straight-ahead performance truck.
</P>
<P>
   This really is only the beginning. Coming soon to a dealer near
you to do battle with the Harley-Davidson Ford are the Cadillac
Escalade sport-utility truck and the Lincoln Blackwood pickup.

completely in the dark about them. Sunday schools are arguably one
of the most formative experiences in a youngster's life. And most
parents haven't a clue what goes on inside those classrooms.

   COXNET HEALTHY LIVING 0829 -- The standard of beauty in many
cultures has become smooth and essentially hairless. Oh, we'll
tolerate some hair, but only on the right places: heads, for
example, or Tom Selleck's chest. Otherwise, there are many ways to
remove it, from waxing to lasers to photo-epilation. (Saur, Grand

   SUMMER-FILMS _ Dave Larsen's summer movie review and look ahead
to fall: ``At my signal, unleash hell.'' With those words,
Gladiator's Russell Crowe launched the 2000 summer movie season.
Crowe's command proved oddly prophetic for studios and audiences
alike. After Ridley Scott's thrilling historical epic, which earned
$181 million, summer's sizzle quickly fizzled. (Larsen, Dayton

   COMIC-GUY _ Paul Jenkins' world is a four-color kaleidoscope of
super-powered beings and costumed heroics where he's quickly
becoming royalty. The Lawrenceville resident is one of the comic
book industry's most in-demand writers and the titles he scribes
are heavyweights. ``Peter Parker: Spider-Man.'' ``The Hulk.''
``Witchblade.'' All top selling illustrated tomes. He writes four
books a month plus an array of special projects. Yet the British

often-unforgiving industry. (Fernandez, Atlanta

(''In the Company of Men'') worked for the first time with someone

ability to see what worked and what didn't more clearly than he
could when directing his own scripts. The end result: an intriguing

   TV-CHILDSTARS _ ``Child Stars: Their Story,'' which airs Sept. 4
on A&AMP;E. I've always wondered why any parent would let their child
go into show business. Sure, the potential for huge paydays is
tempting. But is the price that must be paid for that possible
fortune worth it? Child stars, for instance, are often robbed of a
normal childhood. Growing up is hard enough. Imagine having to do
it in front of millions of people watching your every move or
snickering about every goofy-looking pimple you get. The pressure
to perform is also insanely intense. Many adult actors can't even
take the heat and often resort to drugs and alcohol to cope. Just
think what it's like for a kid to overhear a producer angrily
talking about low ratings and possible cancellation. And in a
business where rejection is the norm, just what kind of toll does
that take on a child's psyche? (Thompson, Palm Beach Post).

Red Centre, after the red sand that ripples under the hot wind. We

his traveling reptile exhibit. He has survived several poisonous
bites as well as an agonizing struggle with multiple myeloma, a
bone marrow cancer. And so, when the 46-year-old McLaurin was
diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus a few months ago, he was
well prepared to die. He had lived a full life, he told himself. An
ex-Marine who had kicked a debilitating drinking habit after 20
years, he had been married and divorced twice, had two teenage
children, and had worked as a Peace Corps volunteer in Tunisia. ``I
wondered if ... it was time for me to die ... to chronicle that in
writing, straightforward and honestly,'' he says, ``and I was
willing to do that.'' (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) EDs:

 &HT;    Ford, Harley create super truck
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In an era when Ford has paired off with everyone from
upscale jewelers such as Cartier (Lincoln Town Car) to outdoorsmen
(Eddie Bauer Explorer), what's surprising about Dearborn's decision
to market a Harley-Davidson pickup?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. Unless it's the fact Ford has shown remarkable
restraint with its Harley-Davidson F-150. It's a Supercab (four
doors, seating for five) that does stand out in any crowd, though,
thanks to its aggressive front end, chrome side pipes and
monochromatic black finish accentuated by Harley-Davidson orange
pinstriping.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we're talking niche market here _ Ford plans only to build
up to 7,000 _ but this is also an era when people go to extremes to
individualize their personal transportation. Check the aftermarket
ads in any buff publication. So why not let the manufacturer save
you the trouble?
</P>
<P>
   Ford's base price is $32,305 (the test truck totaled $33,205),
but the appeal is strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd pay this much for a pickup truck,'' says
Joe Figueroa of Hapeville, Ga., who opted for one. ``I figure it's
an investment of sorts, and I don't drive it except on weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-wheeler enthusiasts were impressed. ``Man, it's cool,'' said
Dwayne Humphreys, a service technician at Earl Small's
Harley-Davidson in Marietta. ``And it's good as far as room and
getting in and out of the back and hauling things.''
</P>
<P>
   It does retain its utility, assuming owners can bring themselves
to sully its pristine showroom appearance. Dings and scratches
might provoke shudders, but underneath that rakish appearance is a
work-truck suspension. And if that 360-horsepower V-8 engine with
440 pounds-feet of torque isn't muscle enough, consider what
Figueroa plans for his baby: ``I may do something (different with
the powertrain) ... see if motor sports comes out with a
supercharger or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The cabin is about as good as it gets for pickups, with embossed
leather captain's chairs, power accessories, CD player and a ``spun
metal'' instrument panel. The rear seats _ still strange to talk
about rear seats in a pickup, isn't it? _ are good for three, and
the half-size rear doors facilitate carrying things when people
aren't occupying them.
</P>
<P>
   The ride isn't cushy because of the super-duty suspension and
those 20-inch tires, but it's superior to that of most older
pickups now on the road. The handling is good, and drivers soon
realize that the Harley-Davidson isn't going to rock 'n' roll in
corners as might be expected.
</P>
<P>
   It has benefited from the use of some components developed for
the Ford Special Vehicles Team (SVT) Lightning pickup, a
straight-ahead performance truck.
</P>
<P>
   This really is only the beginning. Coming soon to a dealer near
you to do battle with the Harley-Davidson Ford are the Cadillac
Escalade sport-utility truck and the Lincoln Blackwood pickup.

 &HT;    Making a bad finish worse
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some queries gleaned from the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a polyurethaned wood bookshelf unit in my family room
that I'd like to reface. When it was built, the plywood was used as
the ``outside'' wood, and it looks like, well, polyurethaned
plywood.
</P>
<P>
   I'm wondering if, since this is urethaned, I could use some
paper-backed white oak veneer on top of it, to make the appearance
more uniform. Paper-backed mainly because this is almost entirely
vertical surfaces, and because the polyurethane would be almost
impossible to strip completely without more work than it's worth.
Or am I better off just living with the plywood?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've never done anything like this, nor would I. I hesitate
to say it would be a disaster, since I've no personal experience,
but the common rule of thumb in woodworking is not to use any kind
of finish as a glue surface.
</P>
<P>
   I assume the writer is talking about fir plywood, and if that's
the case one can scarcely blame him for wanting to cover it up. Of
course it would be best to strip the finish off. Then he could do
anything with it. If he applies veneer over the varnish and it
deteriorates, he's got a terrible mess on his hands. I'd try
painting over the varnish rather than applying veneer on it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm thinking about ordering some wood by mail for a project,
but I'm totally stumped how I'm supposed to figure out how much I
need. If I start with a cut list, I can figure out how many board
feet I need. That's easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, most mail-order places ship random lengths and widths, so
there's no good way to know what pieces I'll be able to get out of
what boards. Not to mention that if I order anything less than
select, I've got to deal with an unknown amount of waste to get the
clear cuttings I need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there some rule of thumb I can use? Or should I just resign
myself to ordering a lot more than I need so I can pick through it
to get what I want and stock the rest for future projects?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ordering wood sight unseen for a particular project is a
chancy thing. One can call the suppliers and ask how far they will
go in handpicking the wood for you. If they can only pick out the
board feet you want and adhere to minimum lengths, there's little
to do but order more than you need.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine why one would need to mail-order unsized
wood unless one has no means of hauling it. If that's the case, it
might be more satisfactory to rent a truck, go to the wood lot and
pick out your stock yourself.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ While some of the American educational reforms
were changed after Allied occupation forces left Japan in 1952,
most of the American-imposed reforms stayed in place and were
responsible for Japan's meteoric postwar rise to international
economic power. Now Japanese school children routinely wipe the

achievement is compared. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED

   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ I was born at high noon 46
years ago, back in the days when the opening day of dove season
began at high noon on the Friday of Labor Day weekend. The day, as
I understand it, my birthday was Friday. So my father was pacing,
pacing, pacing outside the labor room and I'm thinking it was every

hosannahing around the country as if they were caught up in a Great

   SUMMER-FILMS _ Dave Larsen's summer movie review and look ahead
to fall: ``At my signal, unleash hell.'' With those words,
Gladiator's Russell Crowe launched the 2000 summer movie season.
Crowe's command proved oddly prophetic for studios and audiences
alike. After Ridley Scott's thrilling historical epic, which earned
$181 million, summer's sizzle quickly fizzled. (Larsen, Dayton

   COMIC-GUY _ Paul Jenkins' world is a four-color kaleidoscope of
super-powered beings and costumed heroics where he's quickly
becoming royalty. The Lawrenceville resident is one of the comic
book industry's most in-demand writers and the titles he scribes
are heavyweights. ``Peter Parker: Spider-Man.'' ``The Hulk.''
``Witchblade.'' All top selling illustrated tomes. He writes four
books a month plus an array of special projects. Yet the British

   TV-CHILDSTARS _ ``Child Stars: Their Story,'' which airs Sept. 4
on A&AMP;E. I've always wondered why any parent would let their child
go into show business. Sure, the potential for huge paydays is
tempting. But is the price that must be paid for that possible
fortune worth it? Child stars, for instance, are often robbed of a
normal childhood. Growing up is hard enough. Imagine having to do
it in front of millions of people watching your every move or
snickering about every goofy-looking pimple you get. The pressure
to perform is also insanely intense. Many adult actors can't even
take the heat and often resort to drugs and alcohol to cope. Just
think what it's like for a kid to overhear a producer angrily
talking about low ratings and possible cancellation. And in a
business where rejection is the norm, just what kind of toll does
that take on a child's psyche? (Thompson, Palm Beach Post).

bites as well as an agonizing struggle with multiple myeloma, a
bone marrow cancer. And so, when the 46-year-old McLaurin was
diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus a few months ago, he was
well prepared to die. He had lived a full life, he told himself. An
ex-Marine who had kicked a debilitating drinking habit after 20
years, he had been married and divorced twice, had two teenage
children, and had worked as a Peace Corps volunteer in Tunisia. ``I

willing to do that.'' (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) EDs:

 &HT;    Making a bad finish worse
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some queries gleaned from the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a polyurethaned wood bookshelf unit in my family room
that I'd like to reface. When it was built, the plywood was used as
the ``outside'' wood, and it looks like, well, polyurethaned
plywood.
</P>
<P>
   I'm wondering if, since this is urethaned, I could use some
paper-backed white oak veneer on top of it, to make the appearance
more uniform. Paper-backed mainly because this is almost entirely
vertical surfaces, and because the polyurethane would be almost
impossible to strip completely without more work than it's worth.
Or am I better off just living with the plywood?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've never done anything like this, nor would I. I hesitate
to say it would be a disaster, since I've no personal experience,
but the common rule of thumb in woodworking is not to use any kind
of finish as a glue surface.
</P>
<P>
   I assume the writer is talking about fir plywood, and if that's
the case one can scarcely blame him for wanting to cover it up. Of
course it would be best to strip the finish off. Then he could do
anything with it. If he applies veneer over the varnish and it
deteriorates, he's got a terrible mess on his hands. I'd try
painting over the varnish rather than applying veneer on it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm thinking about ordering some wood by mail for a project,
but I'm totally stumped how I'm supposed to figure out how much I
need. If I start with a cut list, I can figure out how many board
feet I need. That's easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, most mail-order places ship random lengths and widths, so
there's no good way to know what pieces I'll be able to get out of
what boards. Not to mention that if I order anything less than
select, I've got to deal with an unknown amount of waste to get the
clear cuttings I need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there some rule of thumb I can use? Or should I just resign
myself to ordering a lot more than I need so I can pick through it
to get what I want and stock the rest for future projects?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ordering wood sight unseen for a particular project is a
chancy thing. One can call the suppliers and ask how far they will
go in handpicking the wood for you. If they can only pick out the
board feet you want and adhere to minimum lengths, there's little
to do but order more than you need.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine why one would need to mail-order unsized
wood unless one has no means of hauling it. If that's the case, it
might be more satisfactory to rent a truck, go to the wood lot and
pick out your stock yourself.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Who'll win the debate about the
debates?
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Who wins the presidential election may well be
decided by who wins the presidential debates.
</P>
<P>
   But right now, more important than that, is the debate about the
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's people, with every reason to believe their candidate
is a great debater, want it to be the classic one-on-one kind, with
candidates on a stage, standing behind podiums and facing questions
from a panel of the press.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's people, with no reason to believe their man is
a great debater, want it to be the Larry King kind, a sit-down,
talk-it-over roundtable discourse with King likely doing as much of
the talking as anybody.
</P>
<P>
   The difference could be the difference in the election.
</P>
<P>
   A classic format -- the Kennedy-Nixon debate is a memorable
example -- generally favors the more knowledgeable candidate and
the better debater. Gore handily beat Jack Kemp in the vice
presidential debates, one-on-one, four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The roundtable format makes it easier to deflect questions,
especially with a moderator such as King, a convivial interviewer
who prides himself on not being a go-for-the-jugular journalist.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the kind of debate Bush won in South Carolina
against John McCain and Alan Keyes -- Keyes giving an additional
advantage to Bush by distracting the audience from McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The roundtable, no doubt, would dull Gore's edge. But either
way, Bush has good reason to go into the debates semi-terrified
that he'll be run through the wringer and hung out to dry, having
seen it happen to his daddy in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton slaughtered Big Bush. No great disgrace in that.
Clinton was made for debating, with his spectacular memory and
dazzling ability to express himself in precise sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Big Bush was just the opposite. He was unmade by debating.
</P>
<P>
   When he came off the stage, supposedly he shook his head and
said, ``The guy's programmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Better, perhaps, had he said that from the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a killer line can be a deciding factor. Everybody
remembers Lloyd Bentsen, vice presidential running mate for Michael
Dukakis, telling Dan Quayle, ``You're no Jack Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan had a great line of his own in debating Jimmy
Carter: ``There you go again, Mr. President.''
</P>
<P>
   But expectations also play a role, and here's where Gov. Bush
could have the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   For example, most everybody had predicted Carter would demolish
Reagan, and the very fact that the debate turned out close to a
draw was a setback for the incumbent president.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that sometimes the guy who was expected to lose wins it
by simply holding his own.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, with his total recall of tedious facts, statistics and
policy details, could easily come across stiff as a fence post and
dull as ditch water; such is his nature.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush, with his down-home, good-ol'-boy, ``Aw, shucks''
style, could come out ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In political debates, the winner isn't necessarily the one who
speaks the best, says the most in the shortest time and has the
greatest command of the facts.
</P>
<P>
   All of that, of course, is important -- but not nearly as
important as which candidate the people like the best when the
debate is over.

<P>
   The Red Sox team that enters September 1 game behind the
Cleveland Indians in the American League wild-card race bears scant
resemblance to the team that took the field against the Seattle
Mariners in Safeco Field on Opening Day, April 4.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley was the first baseman, Gary Gaetti the designated
hitter, John Valentin the third baseman. Jeff Frye was on the
bench. Brian Rose was in the starting rotation. So was Jeff
Fassero.
</P>
<P>
   Rico Brogna, Mike Lansing, Rolando Arrojo, Bernard Gilkey, and
Dante Bichette all wore other uniforms. Lou Merloni was in Japan.
Hipolito Pichardo was in Florida, on rehab assignment. Tomo Ohka
was in Pawtucket. Morgan Burkhart was more myth than reality, Izzy
Alcantara an unknown. Bret Saberhagen updates were still
optimistic. The payroll was closer to $75 million than $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   The team that finished last season 26 games above .500 and won a
second consecutive wild-card spot was 16 games above .500 entering
last September. At this time a year ago, the Sox were 7 1/2 games
behind the Yankees in the AL East, but led the wild-card race by
two games over Oakland and five over Toronto, the only other teams
in contention.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Sons of Jimy Williams begin the final push
eight games over .500, five games behind the Yankees, and as one of
four teams chasing the Indians in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   In the next 31 days, a period ending with a Sunday afternoon
game in Florida against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, the Sox will play
32 times.
</P>
<P>
   They will play the Indians, the team they have met in the
postseason in each of the last two years, eight times in 10 days,
including back-to-back doubleheaders in Fenway Park Sept. 20-21.
</P>
<P>
   They will have two days off. Two other scheduled offdays had to
be sacrificed as makeup dates for rainouts.
</P>
<P>
   They will play a rare home-and-home set with the Yankees in a
span of four days _ three games at Fenway (Sept. 8-10) followed by
a makeup date in Yankee Stadium on the 11th. Beginning with
Friday's game against the Mariners, who lead the AL West, 13 of
Boston's next 14 games and 18 of 23 will be against teams in
postseason contention: the M's, the A's, the Yankees, and the
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows? The Tigers, who started out losing 23 of their
first 32 games but clawed back to the break-even point this week,
may be in the thick of things by the time the Sox visit Comerica
Park for four games beginning Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox play 16 of their next 23 games at Fenway Park, where
they are 35-28. But they are on the road for the season's final
week against the White Sox, who have the best record in the league,
and the Devil Rays, for whom there could be no sweeter revenge for
this week's brawling than knocking the Sox out of the playoff
picture.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have not played well against teams with winning
records. They hold a series edge on only the Yankees _ five wins to
four losses. Otherwise, it's 4-5 against the Angels and White Sox;
.500 against the Indians (2-2), A's (4-4), and Mariners (3-3); and
4-8 against the Blue Jays, the one division rival they won't see
the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   How will this all shake out? You'd have to be another Richard
Hatch to know.
</P>
<P>
   But we'll try handicapping the field, ranking the teams from
least likely to most likely to advance to the postseason. Three
division winners, one wild-card entry, four also-rans.
</P>
<P>
   8. Anaheim _ The Angels' leading winner is their setup man,
Shigetoshi Hasegawa, who has eight W's. Their winningest starter,
Jarrod Washburn, has won seven, but he's on the disabled list and
probably won't be back before the end of the season. They play 20
of their next 26 games on the road. But they have four guys with 30
or more home runs, the first AL team to accomplish that feat
(though the Blue Jays are about to join them), an MVP type in Darin
Erstad, and a terrific first-year manager in Mike Scioscia. They
also have Mo, though the ankle he injured last year is starting to
act up. They've made a gallant run, but it's about that time when
the wheels start falling off.
</P>
<P>
   7. Toronto _ The Sox are lucky they don't have to see the Blue
Jays again, given the way they were slapped around this season.
Toronto has done a remarkable job surviving the loss of slugging
outfielder Raul Mondesi, who had elbow surgery and is lost for the
season. Dave Martinez, who is on his fourth team this season, is
hitting .398 for the Blue Jays, and the team already has tied a
club record with 221 home runs, led by Carlos Delgado, who is
making a serious bid to become the first player since Yaz in '67 to
win the Triple Crown. But New Hampshire's Chris Carpenter stumbled
badly in his return to the starting rotation; another young
starter, Kelvim Escobar, has been shuffled to the pen; and 19-game
winner David Wells (14-2 after a B-J loss) had to come out of his
last start after just five innings, a red flag. Martinez and Mickey
Morandini have been outstanding stretch pickups, giving the Jays a
veteran presence they lacked, but unless the kids grow up
overnight, the pitching comes up just a little short.
</P>
<P>
   6. Oakland _ The A's have lost 16 of their last 24 games,
blowing a great chance to overtake the Mariners in the West. Matt
Stairs, the A's player most likely to come back as a Coors beer man
after he retires, has been unable to shake a season-long slump.
Jason Giambi, the team's best hitter, is playing with an injured
left shoulder. Closer Jason Isringhausen, an All-Star at the break,
was a horror show in August (14 hits, 8 walks, an 8.10 ERA in 10
IP). They lead the league in errors. Third baseman Olmedo Saenz,
who is hitting .440 against the Sox, has been shut down by
hamstring problems. They spend the next week on the road against
the Blue Jays and Sox, then catch a break from the schedule, with
seven games left against the D-Rays and four with the Orioles. But
the team with a payroll of just $32 million doesn't have quite
enough bullets to play with the big boys.
</P>
<P>
   5. Cleveland _ The Indians' season turned around when manager
Charlie Manuel ordered them to remove the Ping-Pong table from the
clubhouse. Since putting the paddles away July 2, they've been 17-5
at home, 29-21 overall. ``I think they gave it to charity or
something,'' said reliever Paul Shuey, the reigning Ping-Pong
champ. In the absence of table tennis, Kenny Lofton is setting the
table again. Which is a good thing, because Lofton is batting .311
when the Indians win, just .213 when they lose. David Segui has
made a huge contribution since coming over from Texas, Manny
Ramirez is back to putting up monster numbers after recovering from
his hamstring woes, and GM John Hart has picked up some needed
pitching to compensate for the hellacious run of injuries that has
claimed two key starters, Jaret Wright and Charles Nagy. But the
Indians will lose out to the Sox for the same reasons they always
do: They can't beat Pedro Martinez (0-8, including playoffs), they
don't have an established No. 1 starter (Bartolo Colon is close,
but Chuck Finley is 3-5 with a 6.54 ERA and hasn't pitched seven
innings in a game since July 14), and their bullpen (Bob Wickman,
Shuey, Steve Karsay) is vulnerable. The best team that won't make
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   4. Boston _ The defining moment of last season came in
September, when the Red Sox had a 12-game, 13-day trip through
Seattle, Oakland, New York, and Cleveland. Martinez won the day
after they'd lost the trip opener to the Mariners on a
controversial call. He won the series opener in New York, setting
the stage for a Sox sweep with the greatest game he's ever pitched,
a 17-K (the last five batters in succession) one-hitter on the
biggest stage of all. He struck out 14 Indians in the trip's
finale, a gritty 13-inning win in which a sore-elbowed Rod Beck
somehow lasted three innings and Jason Varitek and Trot Nixon sent
everybody home with home runs. Martinez starts this month coming
off another one-hitter. His presence guarantees that there will be
light in even the darkest hours. Prediction: Ramon Martinez,
freshly restored to the rotation beginning Saturday afternoon, will
match the grit that Saberhagen has shown the last two years. The
Sox hit just 18 home runs in August; Bichette has to help. The
couple days off last week did wonders for Nomar Garciaparra, even
as his streak of 15 months hitting .300 or better came to an end
(he hit .293 in August). Carl Everett is swinging the way he did
the first half of the season. Dan Duquette has emptied the Trust's
pockets in an all-out effort to keep playing in October. He'll
worry about the $25 million-plus he has tied up in Valentin,
Lansing, Bichette, and Jose Offerman next season.

   3. Seattle _ ``We've been playing bad,'' shortstop Alex
Rodriguez said, ``but we haven't played awful.'' It's a fine line.
The Mariners have lost 14 of their last 17. The ex-Sox pitchers at
the top of the Seattle rotation, Aaron Sele and Jamie Moyer, have
made 11 straight starts without a win. Still, they've probably
weathered their one bad stretch of the season, and should have
enough to hold off the A's. The nucleus of Edgar Martinez, A-Rod,
John Olerud, Jay Buhner, Dan Wilson, and Rickey Henderson has the
experience to hold off Oakland. Besides, the M's didn't play 19
innings against the Sox that night in Seattle to blow it now.
</P>
<P>
   2. Chicago _ Some thought the White Sox would shrink at the
first sight of the Indians making a charge. They stumbled briefly
but came out of August with a winning record (15-13). ``As young as
this team is,'' manager Jerry Manuel said recently, ``I feel good
about what's going on.'' Frank Thomas is having an MVP year, but
the Big Hurt isn't the only big bat. Shortstop Jose Valentin, whose
errors may kill the White Sox in October, leads the club in hitting
since the break with a .340 average. Charles Johnson, imported from
Baltimore, is a big pickup behind the plate. Magglio Ordonez, Paul
Konerko, Ray Durham, Carlos Lee, and Herbert Perry are among the
players who form the heart of this young, committed team, led by
Manuel, odds-on favorite to be named manager of the year. And the
pitching (James Baldwin, Mike Sirotka, Jim Parque) has held up.

<P>
   1. New York _ You know the details. Glenallen Hill comes over
and decides he's Gehrig. The Rocket is back to being the Rocket.
Andy Pettitte ran off seven wins in a row. David Justice and Jose
Canseco were picked up as if they were sale items at Wal-Mart.
Chuck Knoblauch is out with a sore elbow, but there are veteran
fill-ins Luis Sojo and Jose Vizcaino. And no Yankee team blows a
five-game lead in September. Not to the Red Sox.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent decades, retailers have sounded a consistent theme:
``Bigger is better.'' Superstores and category killers have
proliferated, elbowing out the small mom-and-pop stores that were
once retailing's mainstays.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the average grocery store is more than 50 percent larger
than it was in the 1980s. And the average Wal-Mart is more than 30
percent larger.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, though, the pendulum seems to be swinging back. In the
past year, many of the largest U.S. retailers, including Wal-Mart,
Home Depot, Service Merchandise, Sears and OfficeMax, have begun
experimenting with small-store formats. Rather than operating the
small stores as individual outlets, though, the companies are
managing all the stores in an area as a closely knit network.
</P>
<P>
   Dollar General, a Wal-Mart competitor, exemplifies the network
strategy. It matches Wal-Mart's prices but competes against the
average 92,000-square-foot Wal-Mart with a swarm of conveniently
located, 6,000-square-foot stores.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has 4,200 stores from Pennsylvania to Texas,
is highly profitable and growing fast. Six hundred new stores are
opening every year.
</P>
<P>
   Its success has even spawned a copycat competitor, Family
Dollar, with more than 3,000 stores of its own.
</P>
<P>
   LESS IS MORE
</P>
<P>
   Small stores have always offered some important advantages. By
distributing small outlets throughout an area, a retailer can
guarantee that one of them will almost always be closer to a given
shopper than a behemoth store at the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, small stores make it easier for customers to get
from their cars to the stores and, once inside, to find the
products they're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, though, those advantages were overwhelmed by the
two key advantages held by big stores: broader product selection
and lower operating costs. Now, retailers are finding that tightly
linked networks of small stores can enjoy the same scale
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to product selection, for example, retailers are
finding that what customers really value is a broad choice of
product categories, not an endless array of products within a
category.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, research indicates many big retailers are now being
penalized for carrying too many different brands of the same
product.
</P>
<P>
   A study done in the early 1990s by Kurt Salmon Associates found
that more than half of the dry-goods items in grocery stores sell
less than one unit per week, and studies by the Food Marketing
Institute indicate that most grocers have too much variety.
</P>
<P>
   Once a threshold of variety is reached, total category sales
barely budge by including more. By offering many categories but
just one or two brands within each, small stores such as Dollar
General can offset the size advantage held by the megastores.
</P>
<P>
   Another novel way to increase variety in a small store is to use
electronic kiosks. The idea is to have enough actual items in the
store to inform customers about the range of product
characteristics and quality but to supply a kiosk linked to an
electronic catalog or Web site that provides access to the full
product line.
</P>
<P>
   CompUSA and Circuit City already use such kiosks, and the Gap
and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. are experimenting with them.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to costs, retailers are finding that once small
stores are managed as networks, they become as cheap to operate as
big stores.
</P>
<P>
   Take logistics costs: By consolidating orders, a network of
small stores located near one another can take advantage of
full-truckload deliveries rather than incur the higher cost of
partial-truckload deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Networked stores can also reduce their personnel and inventory
costs. It was assumed that big stores needed less inventory and
fewer workers to adjust to surges in demand. One large store, it
was thought, may need 30 workers, but 20 small stores serving the
same market may need two workers each.
</P>
<P>
   But, again, the big store's advantage diminishes once the little
stores are managed centrally and served by a single warehouse and
personnel pool. It costs little to shift products or workers
between stores that are only a few miles apart.
</P>
<P>
   VIRTUAL EMPLOYEES
</P>
<P>
   Technology can also play a role in reducing personnel
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon Bank, for example, uses interactive video screens to
enable many different branches to share a single employee. The
representative that a customer ``sees'' to open a new account is in
a centralized facility hundreds of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Operating small-store networks is very different from running
large stores. To keep total personnel costs down, for example,
small-store employees typically have to be trained to perform many
different tasks.
</P>
<P>
   A store manager at Dollar General runs the cash register, stocks
the shelves, and makes decisions about personnel and inventory. In
contrast, big-store employees tend to have much more specialized
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Because of such differences, a retailer can't simply graft a
chain of little stores onto an infrastructure designed to support
big ones. It has to rethink its system from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   But as bricks-and-mortar retailers struggle to meet the threat
posed by stores on the Internet, such rethinking may be just what's
needed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Biogen was founded in 1978, it had a simple,
research-centered business model: Its scientists would use
biotechnology to discover compounds that might be used to create
new drugs, and then it would license those compounds to big
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   It had no need to build a manufacturing or distribution
infrastructure because it didn't intend to actually produce drugs.
</P>
<P>
   That business model was turned upside down in 1994 when the
company received preliminary FDA approval to market Avonex, a
breakthrough drug that could slow the progression of multiple
sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen suddenly had to find a way to get a product to customers
quickly and dependably while building an efficient delivery system
for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   The company embraced an entirely new way to organize and manage
production and distribution _ a way that renders obsolete many of
the old assumptions underlying supply chain management.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen could have licensed its new drug to a pharmaceutical
company, but it rejected that option. Avonex's market potential was
simply too big for Biogen to give up control.
</P>
<P>
   It could have tried to build a complete supply chain of its own,
but that wasn't feasible. It had neither the time nor the money to
put the necessary assets in place.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting the conventional options, the company set off on a
path of innovation: It would work with a network of partners to get
its new product to market. It would become a virtual manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The first step was to determine which tasks it would perform and
which it would outsource. Biogen took a hard look at the four core
tasks of drug production _ bulk manufacturing, formulation,
packaging, and warehousing and distribution _ and determined that
it could handle the bulk manufacturing at its existing facility in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Since it had already been producing smaller quantities of the
drug for use in clinical testing, it was confident it had the
skills necessary for manufacturing on a larger scale.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else, however, it decided to contract out.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing its partners, it looked for organizations that were
big enough to accommodate rapid growth but small enough to give the
Biogen account top priority.
</P>
<P>
   For formulation, which consisted of freeze-drying the drug and
storing it at low temperatures, it chose Ben Venue Laboratories, a
contract manufacturer in Ohio that had served several large
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Packaging Coordinators, a small but innovative company near
Philadelphia, was given the job of packaging.
</P>
<P>
   And for warehousing and distribution, Biogen chose to partner
with Amgen, which had a new distribution center in Louisville, Ky.
Amgen had built too much capacity, so it was willing to give Biogen
an attractive deal on a large, refrigerated space close to an
airport and UPS shipping facility.
</P>
<P>
   Biogen kept tight control over managing the network. It
stationed some of its people at partners' sites, offered their
staffs training and supervision, and installed new computer systems
to manage the flow of shared information.
</P>
<P>
   It also set tough standards for the performance of the network,
establishing world-class objectives for execution and quality, and
insisting on a goal of fulfilling every order without delay.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hamm, a member of the launch team and now Biogen's vice
president of operations, stressed that ``the worst thing that could
happen'' would be to run out of the product. A shortage would not
only hurt the patients who relied on the drug, it would also
undermine Biogen's profits. Because Avonex carried a high price _
$1,000 for a month's supply _ the cost of carrying inventory was
tiny relative to the cost of a lost sale.
</P>
<P>
   As the company waited for final FDA approval of Avonex, it
worked with its partners to develop four detailed contingency plans
for getting the drug to patients as quickly as possible. The plans
were broken down into 15-minute increments. Team members wore
beepers, rented hotel rooms, reserved rental cars and lined up
airplane reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 11 a.m. on Friday, May 17, 1996, Biogen received FDA
approval. The virtual organization worked seamlessly.
</P>
<P>
   The first shipments of Avonex reached pharmacy shelves within 35
hours _ a new record for the pharmaceutical industry _ and the drug
was ready for dispensing by Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Within six months, Avonex had displaced Betaseron, a multiple
sclerosis drug introduced three years earlier, as the market
leader, garnering more than 60 percent of new prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The full value of the production and distribution network became
apparent over time: Between 1996 and 1999, the drug's production
volume increased fivefold, and the virtual organization scaled up
flawlessly to accommodate the growth.
</P>
<P>
   Avonex has never gone out of stock, and there have been no
serious customer service problems or product recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The outsourcing of key operational elements has enabled Biogen
to achieve a competitive cost structure despite its limited
production experience and small scale.
</P>
<P>
   It has also helped the company keep its fixed assets low, even
when production volume increased dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The required capital investment was modest relative to the size
of the business, and much of the investment risk could be shared
with partners.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when companies everywhere are being challenged to reduce
their fixed assets and increase their flexibility, Biogen's story
offers valuable lessons to nearly all executives about how to
manage the crucial back end to deliver the front-end promise.

   Last fall, Gage J. Fellows gamely tried to expand 1159.com, a
``best'' Web site about Denver nightclubs, into a national online
travel and entertainment guide. To hire advertising sales
representatives, he turned to a local recruiting agency and bought
newspaper and radio advertisements. Applicants applied, all right,
but most lacked basic computer skills.
</P>
<P>
   Fellows' luck improved with a trial posting on Hotjobs.com, one
of the Internet's largest job boards, with 197,000 listings. In
three days, 1159.com received 100 resumes from better-qualified
applicants. ``People who use Hotjobs have computer skills and
understand the product,'' Fellows said.
</P>
<P>
   With renewed confidence, he agreed to a two-month, $1,800
contract with Hotjobs and posted 30 job openings in six cities.
Now, Fellows is buried by an avalanche of 5,000 resumes.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has mushroomed with e-cruiting sites like
Monster.com, Hotjobs.com and Headhunter.net and pushed Web hiring
into the mainstream by spending millions of dollars on high-profile
1999 Super Bowl commercials aimed at people who might be restless
in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Millions responded, posting their resumes without cost. By
letting job seekers freely search the sites by category and
location, the sites allow them to forward their information to
listed employers with a mouse click, accelerating the traditional
job-hunting process.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites update their postings hourly and offer candidates
e-mail notices about openings that match their criteria. To forge
long-term relationships with consumers, Hotjobs lets job seekers
block some viewers (like a current employer) from reviewing their
resumes. Monster sends registered members newsletters with
career-management tips. E-cruiting traffic peaks, yes, on Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The balance of power has shifted,'' said Richard Johnson, the
chief executive of Hotjobs.com in Boston, whose quirky marketing
taps into worker discontent and belittles corporate loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, it's not about the job but the job seeker,'' said
Jeffrey C. Taylor, the founder and chief executive of largest site,
Boston-based Monster.com, which is owned by leading
recruitment-advertising agency TMP Worldwide Inc. Monster's
advertisement suggests the dream career need not be a dream
deferred.
</P>
<P>
   Job hunters with less technical acumen are now posting their
resumes in far greater numbers. Their influence is starting to
broaden the sorts of career-management tools available online, like
salary surveys and certification tests, which still cater to the
Net's early adopters: technology professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be tricky finding a site that has a lot of positions
for the noncomputer geeks,'' said Christine Tetrault, the human
resources director for a software company in Virginia, who found
her job at Careerpath.com. The site is built on newspaper
classified advertisements and is owned by eight newspaper
companies, including The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy and quick and I saved a fortune in stationery and
stamps,'' she said in an e-mail message. ``I also liked the ease
involved in setting search parameters and checking out what comes
up instead of getting all cramped and grimy leaning over the
classifieds.''
</P>
<P>
   The sites earn their meal tickets from employers, who pay for a
range of services, and advertising sponsors. Job lists come from
corporate offices, media buyers and temporary agencies like
Manpower and Kelly Services. (An exception is Hotjobs, which
refuses to list recruitment-agency openings.)
</P>
<P>
   The sites also allow managers and commission-based recruiters to
tally how often their listings are searched. Some include
matchmaking software that pairs resumes with appropriate job
descriptions. Most charge employers for access to peruse a site's
database of resumes. Top executives, still mostly loyal to
headhunters to fill high-level slots, often use job sites to
monitor their in-house recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   The Web sites' resume databases are all that's needed to fill
job openings for some employers, who expressed dissatisfaction with
recruiters who often expect 33 percent commissions and offer
ill-suited prospects.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sites that offer job listings for the
technologically savvy like Techies.com and Dice.com, a crop of job
sites specialized by industry, region and even subjects is
emerging.
</P>
<P>
   Sites for bankers, pharmacists and truck drivers are cited at
Interbiznet.com, the publisher of a Mill Valley, Calif., online
recruiting newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs at summer camps, casinos and the site for the Feminist
Career Center are listed in Career Crossroads, a directory
published by MMC Group of Kendall Park, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Craigslist.org, a San Francisco bulletin board where residents
post employment and housing ads, was ranked the ``most efficient''
job recruiting site nationwide in a recent survey of 50 recruiters
by Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Another twist comes from Flipdog.com, which searches and
extracts job postings each week on corporate Web sites and lists
them without charge. The site has 505,735 openings, 25 percent more
than Monster, some as obscure as a $7-an-hour Zamboni driver needed
to groom a Michigan ice rink. ``We're building a site and service
that lets people fit in wherever they come from,'' said Brett C.
Walker, the vice president for marketing at the company, based in
Provo, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Late to the party are old-line executive search companies like
Korn Ferry International and Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, which have set
up Futurestep.com and Leadersonline.com, respectively. Analysts
predict that, as with other Net latecomers, established recruiters
will ultimately eclipse Internet-only start-ups, and that local
commission-based recruiters will be the ones most pinched by the
Web's lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the first specialty job sites that failed to draw enough
visitors are already disappearing and being absorbed in general
sites like Monster, which has 3.3 million resumes and most of the
Fortune 500 companies as clients.
</P>
<P>
   But even though e-cruiting revenue is expected to increase
fourfold by 2003, to $2.3 billion from $600 million last year, it
still is expected to make up just 1 percent of recruiting revenue
globally, according to Forrester Research.

 By DIRK JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   EARLVILLE, Ill. _ When it was finally time to trade his old John
Deere tractor for a newer model, Steve Lake, a 55-year-old farmer,
went shopping on the Internet. To find just the used model he
wanted _ a front-wheel-drive machine with 130 horsepower _ he would
have needed to flip through farm magazines and newspapers from all
over the Midwest. But trolling on his computer, Lake took only 30
minutes to discover a dealership in Lowden, Iowa, offering just
what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There it was on the screen,'' said Lake, who stands 6-foot-2
in work boots. ``It was just what I was after.''
</P>
<P>
   With a digital camera, Lake photographed the 1976 tractor he
wanted to trade and sent it by e-mail to the dealership. The dealer
wanted $63,000 for the newer tractor, which had 1,500 hours of use.
The farmer expected $16,000 for his machine, which had racked up
6,000 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Confident that a bargain could be struck, Lake drove to Iowa,
haggled a bit, then returned to the farm. After a few e-mail
messages back and forth, the farmer and the dealer reached a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers are stuck out here in the middle of nowhere,'' Lake
said. ``But the computer gives us knowledge from the rest of the
world, and knowledge is power.''
</P>
<P>
   Mace Thornton, a spokesman for the American Farm Bureau
Federation, says the agricultural business appears to be poised for
a transformation through computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many Web sites have been introduced in the last six months,
it's hard to keep up with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, farmers are using computers mainly to shop for the best
deals on machinery and supplies, especially chemicals to kill bugs
and weeds. To a lesser extent, some farmers are exploring the
Internet to find the best prices for their crops. Web sites in
California and Wisconsin, among other places, allow farmers to sell
produce and meat directly to consumers, yielding a better price at
both ends because the middleman has been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of David Furry, the manager at Strackbein's
Inc., the Iowa dealership where Lake found his tractor, the pace of
e-commerce in agriculture lags behind computer use in other
industries because most farmers are over 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``People of a certain age are less comfortable doing business on
the computer _ they still want to kick the tires,'' Furry said.
``It's a different story for younger men, the ones who are taking
over for their dads.''
</P>
<P>
   One big problem for computer-savvy farmers is the low quality of
telephone service in many rural areas, which slows transmission on
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out here on 6 miles of copper lines, so there's a lot of
</P>
<P>
   noise in there,'' Lake said, referring to the frequent losses of
computer connections. ``And when you hit the keys for a search, you
might as well go get a cup of coffee while it searches, because
it's going to take a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake, a fifth-generation farmer whose 1,400 acres are planted
with corn and soybeans _ ``a cow-chow factory,'' he calls it _ has
had a computer since 1988. (He also uses it to stay tethered to the
world outside, reading major newspapers online and scanning
restaurant reviews and museum exhibitions in Chicago, 75 miles
away.)
</P>
<P>
   Before the computer, Lake said, finding and buying used
machinery was a tedious chore that often ended unsatisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd just gone to my local dealer, I wouldn't have found
what I was looking for,'' he said. ``So the dealer would have tried
to push me to buy something that he had but that I didn't really
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the Web sites could use some improving, Lake
said, noting that some lack important details.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't have a picture, it just doesn't reach out and
grab you,'' he said. ``And you'd like to know about the history of
the machine.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lake's case, he wanted to be certain that the tractor had not
been used on a big hog operation, which could make the inside of
the cab stink, and that the previous owner was not a cigarette
smoker, which could do the same.
</P>
<P>
   But he found precisely what he had envisioned. The newer John
Deere tractor, painted green just like the older model, has run
like a champ over the past few months during planting season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just flip a button on the dash,'' Lake marveled, ``and it
goes into front-wheel drive.''
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't hurt that the cab is equipped with a stereo.
</P>

WITH BICHETTE, DUQUETTE ADDS PUNCH TO LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his unrelenting _ and yet unfulfilled _ quest to add
consistent punch to the Red Sox' lackluster lineup, general manager
Dan Duquette Thursday tried again, this time picking up Dante
Bichette, one of the most productive hitters in baseball for much
of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox gave up two minor league pitchers, including top
prospect Chris Reitsma, to acquire Bichette from the Cincinnati
Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are mortgaging part of our future, obviously,'' Duquette
said in a conference call with reporters. ``We traded these young
players in an effort to win the pennant and make the playoffs this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   A right fielder who batted cleanup for the Reds, Bichette, 36,
was hitting .295 with 16 home runs and 76 RBIs. Only one Boson
player this year has knocked in more runs, Carl Everett (98).
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a veteran, proven RBI man,'' Duquette said. ``We have
been looking for a veteran presence to help our lineup, and we hope
that Dante will add that presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy, have they have been looking. Ed Sprague, Sean Berry, and
Rico Brogna come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox also picked up outfielder Midre Cummings Thursday from
Minnesota in exchange for minor league shortstop Hector De Los
Santos. Cummings, 28, who played in 67 games for the Sox in 1998,
is the league's leading pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette, like Brogna, said all the right things in the
conference call with Duquette, even citing Ted Williams as his
all-time favorite player. If that weren't enough, Bichette fell in
love in Fenway's shadow. ``I met my wife (Marianna) there, at the
Gold's Gym right behind the Green Monster,'' he said. ``So I have a
lot of luck there. Hopefully, it will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bichette said he was so hungry to play at Fenway that when he
took the call from Reds general manager Jim Bowden about the trade,
he said to himself, ``Please let it be Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bichette's luck doesn't hold, the Sox could be in trouble.
The team ranks 12th of 14 teams in the league in runs scored, with
only Minnesota and Tampa Bay ranking lower. They managed just one
run in a 3-1 loss Wednesday night to the Devil Rays. And they face
the prospect of losing Brian Daubach, their only consistent power
threat other than Everett and Nomar Garciaparra, for an indefinite
period.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach underwent tests Thursday to determine the severity of an
elbow injury he suffered in Tuesday's bench-clearing brawl with the
Devil Rays in St. Petersburg. Results were not available Thursday
night. The Sox initially listed the injury as a hyperextended left
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Scott Hatteberg said he was not encouraged by how
Daubach looked Wednesday. ``I'm not a medical guy,'' Hatteberg
said, ``but his arm didn't look very good.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Bichette and Cummings will come as a blow to
several players, whose at-bats could be seriously affected by the
newcomers. In addition, the Sox are likely to recall minor league
sluggers Izzy Alcantara and Morgan Burkhart now that Sept. 1 has
arrived and the team can expand its 25-player roster to 40 players.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on Daubach's condition, the team also may also call up
first baseman Dernell Stenson from Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Sox players who may see their playing time diminished
by the new hitters are first baseman Brogna and outfielders Darren
Lewis and Bernard Gilkey.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette, who averaged more than 28 home runs a year in seven
seasons with Colorado before he was traded to the Reds last
October, has 1,100 hits since 1995, more than anyone in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   He also drove in at least 117 runs each year with the Rockies,
whose batters benefit from hitter-friendly Coors Field. Mike
Lansing, for example, had 27 extra-base hits, including 11 home
runs, in 365 at-bats for the Rockies this year. In 95 at-bats for
the Sox, he has two extra-base hits.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette, who broke into the majors with Milwaukee in 1991, hit
.366 at Fenway in two years with the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't played here in a long time, but I remember when I
wasn't quite an accomplished hitter _ I was a young hitter coming
up _ I always felt very strong here,'' he said. ``It's a great
hitter's park.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston also picked up the final year of Bichette's contract,
which is next year. His salary is $6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any sign of concern about Bichette, it's that he has
hit only three home runs since the All-Star break and only one
since July 23. He also has grounded into 18 double plays, which
ranks second in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Reitsma, 22, was a combined 10-6 with a 3.03 ERA in 25 starts
this year for Double A Trenton and Single A Sarasota. The Sox chose
him in the second round of the June 1996 free agent draft, and he
was evolving into one of the team's best young righthanded
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox also traded John Curtice. The lefthander, 20, went 4-10
with a 6.49 ERA for Sarasota while recovering from a shoulder
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings leads the AL with 11 pinch hits and 10 pinch-hit RBIs.
He is 11 for 33 (.333) as a pinch hitter. Overall, he is hitting
.276 with four homers and 22 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he will be a good complement to our club,
especially at this time of year,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   De Los Santos, 20, hit .295 with one homer and 11 RBIs in 46
games for Boston's rookie team in the Gulf Coast League.

CLEMENT: THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This was the little French guy's fantasy. He would
put on his burglar's accessories _ red bandana, very dark
wraparound shades, sneakers. And he would creep past 15,000 or so
onlookers, sneak into Andre's room, and steal one of the star's
most prized possessions: his place in the US Open. Slick. Very
slick lifting.
</P>
<P>
   Then, says the diminutive French felon named Arnaud Clement,
platoons of gorgeous women would descend on him. They would smother
him in kisses, hailing one of the greatest thefts since Havlicek
stole the ball. He would make the heisting hall of fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fantasy,'' Arnaud the thief says, grinning broadly,
``but some of it happened. You saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of it _ one of the grandest larcenies ever committed at
Flushing Meadow _ was seen up close by Andre Agassi, who lost, 6-3,
6-2, 6-4, in his own throne room of 1999, Ashe Stadium. Agassi had
also won the US title a few yards away in Armstrong Stadium, when
that was the coronation amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   But Agassi, accorded the monarch's No. 1 seed at this, the last
major of the 2000 campaign, will not see the third round. Clement,
a so-so 22-year-old, a welterweight of 5 feet 8 inches, 140 pounds,
with a No. 39 ranking, has snatched his place.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever lovelies lurked among the assembled fans had been
screaming for Agassi, however. They departed forlornly, not blowing
as much as one kiss in Arnaud's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was for him, of course,'' Clement says. ``So many
people there. Andre is a great player, but he wasn't great today.
He did too many mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Clement stops talking and stands up. ``It is better this way,''
he says. He is cramping _ about 45 minutes too late to do Agassi
any good _ but continues, on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was unbelievable, my best victory,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi himself acknowledges the fantasizer was pretty fantastic
after Agassi had staked out an early 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never raised my level,'' says Agassi, who heard the thief
prowling for seven successive games (to 2-0 in the second) but
couldn't discourage or apprehend him. ``Give the guy credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. Clement _ the name means mild or lenient in French _
was neither with Agassi. He bounded everywhere, hounding Agassi's
best blasts and somehow redirecting them to his opponent's
frustration, sometimes with backhands down the line that the former
champ couldn't return. Clement was especially unclement with his
improved serve, which grew big on big points for 24 freebies: a
dozen each of aces and handcuffers.
</P>
<P>
   Male reputations aren't mattering much at this US Very Open.
Four days are gone, and with them the champ of 1997-98, Patrick
Rafter; the French Open champ, Gustavo Kuerten; and now Agassi, a
certain Hall of Famer with six majors in his safe. Never has the
tournament been so decimated so early.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi launched the season brilliantly, knocking off two
champions, Pete Sampras and Yevgeny Kafelnikov, to capture the
Australian Open. But his African adventure in Zimbabwe shortly
thereafter started a downturn. In the Davis Cup there, the United
States took a 3-2 victory in which Agassi won both singles. But he
staggered off the court after barely beating Byron Black, exhausted
and dehydrated. He hasn't been the same since, winning no titles
and losing in the second round at the French Open to Karol Kucera
and the semifinals of Wimbledon to Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   He made no excuses, but his mental state can't be great as his
mother and a sister battle cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was focused, but I never found my quality,'' Agassi says.
</P>
<P>
   Clement, a free spirit _ ``something of a clown,'' says a friend
_ was up for the occasion. He'd come within two points of beating
Agassi in the second round of the 1999 French Open, Andre's magnum
opus for that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't notice any strain in Agassi,'' Clement says. ``I was
thinking about what I had to do.'' This is what makes the game:
Nobody is safe from being robbed when two guys go at each other.
Clement's fantasy of a grand caper was going to materialize. Even
though he came in with a 20-20 season record, he had the stealth
and the light-fingered manner Thursday to clean out Andre's room in
only 103 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   As the burglar was leaving the scene of his crime, it seemed
Agassi might collar him. In a rousing farewell game that endured
for nine quivering minutes, Clement served his way to 40-15, but
four times Agassi fought off match point. Clement appeared frantic,
looking for the exit as the crowd roared for his blood.
</P>
<P>
   On the second match point, Clement banged an apparent ace, and
he rejoiced. Not so fast, said the umpire. The ball had touched the
tape. Let call. Agassi won the point. On the third match point,
Agassi socked a forehand winner. On the fourth, Clement served ``a
certain ace. The ball was on the line,'' he pleaded. Sorry. Fault
called. Agassi won that point. Deuce again.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody was yelling, urging Agassi to pounce on the miscreant.
But Clement had his hands on what he wanted. He ripped a forehand
to earn the fifth match point. Now or never, he thought.
``Aaaaaaagh!'' he groaned, throwing himself into the concluding
serve, his most powerful, at 119 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi swatted it into the net, and the thief escaped through a
window of opportunity. Safe at last, he removed the sneakers, the
shades, revealing jubilant blue eyes. He took off his bandana,
letting swatches of auburn hair hang to his shoulders. It wasn't a
fantasy. He felt like a man who had broken the bank at Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   For the ripped-off Agassi, it was too late to call 911.

 By BRAD LEMLEY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Rupert Sheldrake gazes at the TV monitor. The videotape he is
showing as part of a public lecture at Cambridge University
portends, in his view, the shattering of modern biology.
 &HT;    It also features a cute dog.
 &HT;    On the right side of the split screen, the dog's owner, Pam
Smart, is shown gadding about the English village of Ramsbottom. On
the left side, her terrier-cross, Jaytee, who has remained at home,
lies at the feet of Pam's mother, Muriel.
 &HT;    Beneath each of these slow-moving dramas, synchronized videotape
counters confirm that the cameras tracking Jaytee and Pam show
simultaneous activity.
 &HT;    Suddenly, a researcher accompanying Pam tells her it's time to
leave. As Pam exits to get a ride home, Jaytee rises and trots to a
window. The voice-over states that the dog waited patiently there
for 15 minutes until his mistress walked in through the door.
 &HT;    The implication: Though Pam was several miles away, Jaytee
sensed, somehow, the moment she formed the intent to return home.
 &HT;    In itself, the Austrian tape proves nothing _ it could be
coincidence or a hoax. Indeed, that's the judgment of Richard
Wiseman, a British psychology researcher.
 &HT;    Wiseman and two colleagues ran four owner-anticipation
experiments with Jaytee and Pam and, in the August 1998 issue of
the British Journal of Psychiatry, they concluded: ``In all four
experiments Jaytee failed to accurately detect when (Smart) set off
to return home.''
 &HT;    Sheldrake says Wiseman's team arbitrarily established a two-
minute waiting period as the criterion for owner anticipation and
ignored the dog's behavior after the return signal.
 &HT;    ``Wiseman's own data shows the dog spent most of its time at the
window when Pam was on her way home,'' he argues.
 &HT;    Sheldrake has produced more than 200 similar tapes and found
three dogs that anticipate their owners' return 80 percent of the
time.
 &HT;    Controversy follows Sheldrake at every turn, and little wonder.
The existence of telepathy is just a subset of Sheldrake's larger
premises _ that invisible, but nonetheless pervasive ``morphic
fields'' are responsible for both the shape and behavior of all
things, from atoms to zebras, organizing them much as a magnetic
field lines up iron filings.
 &HT;    Just as controversial is Sheldrake's hypothesis that these
fields broadcast across time and space, a phenomenon he calls
morphic resonance. Result: A carrot seed grows into the shape of a
carrot because it is directed by the cumulative morphic resonance
of all previous carrots.
 &HT;    A million blind African termites build a complex 10-foot-tall
nest because they are guided by the morphic resonance of previous
termites.
 &HT;    A newspaper crossword puzzle is easier to solve late in the day,
because the morphic resonance broadcast by thousands of successful
solvers facilitates the task.
 &HT;    A dog anticipates its owner's return because the bond they forge
through close association is what Sheldrake terms a ``social''
morphic field, which stretches, but does not break, when they are
apart.
 &HT;    Humans, Sheldrake says, retain only vestiges of morphic-
resonance telepathy, possibly because telephones and mass media
make the ability less necessary for survival. In animals, he
contends, it remains robust.
 &HT;    Sheldrake's theories certainly seem to resonate with the public.
His fifth and latest book, ``Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are
Coming Home and Other Unexplained Powers of Animals,'' is a best
seller, with 75,000 hardcover copies sold in the United States
alone.
 &HT;    Moreover, Sheldrake has impressive academic credentials. A
former research fellow of the Royal Society, he was director of
studies in biochemistry and cell biology at Clare College at
Cambridge University and a Frank Knox Fellow at Harvard.
 &HT;    But these days, he is unaffiliated with any university and is
viewed as a pariah by many of his peers.
 &HT;    ``Morphic resonance is rubbish,'' says Lewis Wolpert, professor
of biology as applied to medicine at University College London.
``It is unmitigated junk, and a great insult to people who do real
work in the field.''
 &HT;    In spite of such scorn, Sheldrake soldiers on. Here at
Cambridge's Union Society Hall he is showing his videotape and
speaking about his theories to 75 students and faculty members as
part of the society's guest speakers program. His presentation
brings hearty applause. If Sheldrake is deluded, he ushers more
people into his fanciful realm every day.
 &HT;    Sheldrake has pushed the hypothesis of morphic resonance for 20
years and claims that his motivation is a too-rare reverence for
science as a vehicle for addressing deep, difficult questions.
 &HT;    ``My way of thinking about science is that major unsolved
problems are the most interesting things to work on,'' he says. ``I
have noticed that many of my colleagues take the opposite view:
that major, unsolved problems need to be denied, because
recognizing them would show that science is radically incomplete.''
 &HT;    The first fields to captivate Sheldrake were the meadows around
his childhood home in the idyllic Midlands market town of
Newark-on-Trent, where he collected a vast personal menagerie of
creatures, from rabbits to insects.
 &HT;    His father, an herbalist who lectured on plant sources of drugs
at Nottingham University, encouraged the boy to study and learn
from his charges. At ``quite an early age'' Sheldrake determined to
become a biologist himself.
 &HT;    He was dismayed, then, upon entering the biochemistry department
at Cambridge University.
 &HT;    ``The first thing we did when we decided to study a plant or
animal was kill it, then grind it up to extract the DNA and
enzymes. It was the ultimate irony _ to become a biologist because
you love animals, then spend a career torturing and killing them.''
 &HT;    Moreover, the approach struck Sheldrake as incomplete. ``The
idea that the whole truth could be found via reductionism,
examining the smallest particles, has never been proved. It's an
article of faith.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, at Cambridge Sheldrake spent seven years exploring
the biochemical basis for plant shape. But Sheldrake says that
after years of intensive study, biochemistry didn't solve the
problem of why things have the basic shape they do.
 &HT;    Frustrated, Sheldrake resigned his Cambridge fellowship and
worked for six years at an international agricultural institute at
Hyderabad in southern India, improving legume crop yields for
Indian subsistence farmers. It was there that he met Bede
Griffiths, an English Benedictine monk who lived in a Christian
ashram, and to whom Sheldrake dedicated his book ``A New Science of
Life.''
 &HT;    After more than 20 years as an atheist, Sheldrake rediscovered
the Christianity of his youth through Griffiths. He remains to this
day a frankly religious scientist, even producing spiritual-themed
books such as ``Natural Grace,'' co-authored with renegade
Episcopal priest Matthew Fox. Also while in India, he met Jill
Purce, a vocal therapist whom he married in 1985.
 &HT;    Today, Sheldrake, Purce and their 10- and 12-year-old sons live
in a comfortable town house across the street from Hampstead Heath,
the largest tract of wild land in London.
 &HT;    ``When I first saw him, he was giving a talk about his
theories,'' Purce says. ``Critics go to his speeches and fly for
him, but he retains the most extraordinary equanimity and
graciousness.''
 &HT;    A frequent critique of Sheldrake's work is that the fields he
posits seem to be undetectable _ his research doesn't indicate what
morphic fields or resonance actually are.
 &HT;    Sheldrake responds that the phenomena may spring from the
so-called quantum nonlocality that so fretted Einstein, who termed
it ``spooky action at a distance.''
 &HT;    Confirmed by experiments by French physicist Alain Aspect in
1982 and independently corroborated many times since, the
phenomenon is indeed unsettling: Two photons or electrons emitted
by the same atom remain somehow linked, even miles apart (and,
theoretically, on opposite sides of the universe), such that
measuring the polar orientation of one immediately determines the
orientation of the other.
 &HT;    Physicist Hans-Peter Durr of the Max Planck Institute in Munich
has argued that Sheldrake's theories are among the first to
reconcile 20th-century breakthroughs in physics _ which emphasize
the primacy of fields and the indivisible nature of matter _ with
biology, which for the most part remains rooted in 19th-century
Newtonian concepts of particles and separateness.
 &HT;    To Sheldrake, science is all about asking the rights questions
and performing the right experiments.
 &HT;    ``Arthur Eddington, the physicist, said if you drag a net with a
two-inch mesh through the sea, you will conclude there is no such
thing as a fish that is shorter than two inches,'' Sheldrake says.
``The kind of questions you ask determine the kind of answers you
get. The first step is to begin asking the right questions.''

 By KAREN WRIGHT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Like doubting disciples, certain astronomers spend much of their
time looking for proof of an unseen hand at work in the cosmos.
 &HT;    In 1933, a Swiss astronomer named Fritz Zwicky proposed that
some otherworldly presence holds the visible world together;
without it, he said, galaxy clusters would fly apart.
 &HT;    Unlikely as it seems, Zwicky's hypothesis has grown more
convincing with time. Astrophysicists now know that Zwicky's
missing matter is fundamentally different from the ordinary matter
that makes up planets and people. It doesn't interact with light,
for example, either by radiating or blocking it. And it couldn't
have much interaction with everyday matter either, or its existence
would be far more obvious. It betrays its presence only by the
gravitational pull it exerts on the shapes and movements of
galaxies.
 &HT;    Today the missing matter is known as cold dark matter: ``cold''
because by subatomic standards it is sluggish, ``dark'' because it
cannot be detected with even the most sophisticated telescopes, and
``matter'' because it isn't energy, which is the only other option.
 &HT;    The latest studies of galaxy clusters and theories of
astrophysics predict that cold dark matter makes up more than 90
percent of all the matter there is.
 &HT;    Experts have come to believe that illuminating its properties
could help explain galaxy formation, unify the fundamental forces
of nature and maybe even determine the fate of the universe. It
might also reveal clues about the origin of the cosmos.
 &HT;    ``If they exist,'' says Stanford physicist Blas Cabrera, ``they
would be the oldest stable particles in the universe.'
 &HT;    The search for dark matter has Nobel prize written all over it.
So it's little wonder things got a little testy in February at an
international dark-matter symposium in Marina del Rey, Calif. There
two teams of researchers presented results from attempts to nab the
theoretical particles that are thought to constitute the bulk of
dark matter.
 &HT;    The experiments shared somewhat similar strategies for particle
detection; whether or not the missing matter was found depends on
whom you ask.
 &HT;    Dark matter by definition interacts only weakly with ordinary
matter, including the instruments designed to apprehend it. Because
of that, the detectors must be shielded from cosmic rays and other
incoming particles that would obscure the fainter signals from dark
matter.
 &HT;    As it happens, dirt and bedrock make good shields: A detector
located more than half a mile underground in a zinc mine in Japan
collared another type of dark-matter particle two years ago. But
the Japanese experiments showed that those particles, called
neutrinos, don't have nearly enough mass to account for all the
dark matter predicted either by the theories of physicists or the
observations of astronomers. So dark-matter enthusiasts trained
their hopes on finding more-massive particles.
 &HT;    According to their theories, the postulated WIMPs _ for ``weakly
interacting massive particles'' _ might be detected during rare
collisions with atoms, which would produce vibrations and bursts of
light and heat as the nucleus recoils.
 &HT;    Both groups reporting at the California conference looked for
evidence of nuclear recoils by using underground detectors. But
they differed in how they screened out extraneous signals that can
penetrate even to subterranean depths.
 &HT;    One team, working at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in
L'Aquila, Italy, studied seasonal variations in the number of
recoils observed in sodium iodide crystals to distinguish possible
WIMP collisions.
 &HT;    Unlike other particle streams, earthbound WIMP flows are
expected to vary between winter and summer because as Earth circles
the sun each year, it changes direction relative to the solar
system's rotation around the center of the galaxy.
 &HT;    If, as physicists believe, the entire Milky Way itself is
shrouded in a fixed and imperturbable cloud of WIMPs, then more
WIMPs should hit Earth when it is moving through the WIMP cloud in
the same direction as the rest of the solar system _ just as more
bugs hit the windshield when you step on the gas.
 &HT;    But when Earth's orbit runs counter to the solar system's, as it
does in winter, its speed through the WIMP cloud decreases, and so
should the number of WIMP collisions.
 &HT;    Rita Bernabei and her colleagues from the University of Rome and
the Chinese Academy in Beijing presented evidence that they had
indeed found seasonal modulations in recoil events.
 &HT;    The tens of thousands of recoils they documented over four years
peaked in the summer and fell off in the winter by a small
percentage, they say, and the modulation satisfied several other
criteria for identifying WIMP-induced events.
 &HT;    ``This definitely shrinks the probability of spurious effects,''
the group claims on its Web site.
 &HT;    But new results from the detector at Stanford University
challenged this conclusion. One of the most significant ``spurious
effects'' that might crop up in dark-matter detection comes from
neutrons _ ordinary subatomic particles that are generated by
cosmic rays.
 &HT;    The Stanford detector, which consists of silicon and germanium
disks, monitors the background of neutron-induced nuclear recoils
so they can be subtracted from the total signal.
 &HT;    ``If there were WIMPs at the rate suggested by the Italian
team's signal, then in our detector we would have seen about 20
events over the period of time we ran,'' says Cabrera, one of the
helmsmen of the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search, a collaboration that
includes 10 institutions. Instead, the Stanford detector recorded
only 13 recoils, he says, and all of them could be attributed to
neutrons.
 &HT;    The discrepancy provoked a lively debate at the California
symposium but no claims to have cornered truth. The properties of
cold dark matter are so poorly understood that any alleged WIMP
sightings are best considered exploratory rather than definitive.
 &HT;    The jury will stay out until any one lab's findings are
confirmed independently and repeatedly by others. But cosmologists
are greeting even these initial, contradictory results with eager
anticipation.
 &HT;    ``The important story is not that these two experiments disagree
but that a threshold has been crossed: We now have apparatuses with
enough sensitivity to detect WIMPs,'' says Michael Turner, a
cosmologist at the University of Chicago. That, he says, is a major
accomplishment in itself.
 &HT;    Both the Gran Sasso and the Stanford groups have plans to
stretch the limits of detection: The Italian team is more than
doubling the size of its crystal detector, and next year the
Stanford group will bury its detector 2,600 feet deeper, in a
defunct iron-ore mine in Minnesota.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, at least half a dozen additional dark-matter
detectors are ramping up around the globe. With so much activity,
Turner maintains, physicists are sure to capture some elusive,
elementary particle, whether predicted or not.
 &HT;    And when they do, they may discover the secrets of time and
space alike.
 &HT;    ``We've been struggling for 70 years and now we're closing in,''
Turner says. ``We may soon learn what holds the universe
together.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Like doubting disciples, certain astronomers spend much of their
time looking for proof of an unseen hand at work in the cosmos.
 &HT;    In 1933, a Swiss astronomer named Fritz Zwicky proposed that
some otherworldly presence holds the visible world together;
without it, he said, galaxy clusters would fly apart.
 &HT;    Unlikely as it seems, Zwicky's hypothesis has grown more
convincing with time. Astrophysicists now know that Zwicky's
missing matter is fundamentally different from the ordinary matter
that makes up planets and people. It doesn't interact with light,
for example, either by radiating or blocking it. And it couldn't
have much interaction with everyday matter either, or its existence
would be far more obvious. It betrays its presence only by the
gravitational pull it exerts on the shapes and movements of
galaxies.
 &HT;    Today the missing matter is known as cold dark matter: ``cold''
because by subatomic standards it is sluggish, ``dark'' because it
cannot be detected with even the most sophisticated telescopes, and
``matter'' because it isn't energy, which is the only other option.
 &HT;    The latest studies of galaxy clusters and theories of
astrophysics predict that cold dark matter makes up more than 90
percent of all the matter there is.
 &HT;    Experts have come to believe that illuminating its properties
could help explain galaxy formation, unify the fundamental forces
of nature and maybe even determine the fate of the universe. It
might also reveal clues about the origin of the cosmos.
 &HT;    ``If they exist,'' says Stanford physicist Blas Cabrera, ``they
would be the oldest stable particles in the universe.'
 &HT;    The search for dark matter has Nobel prize written all over it.
So it's little wonder things got a little testy in February at an
international dark-matter symposium in Marina del Rey, Calif. There
two teams of researchers presented results from attempts to nab the
theoretical particles that are thought to constitute the bulk of
dark matter.
 &HT;    The experiments shared somewhat similar strategies for particle
detection; whether or not the missing matter was found depends on
whom you ask.
 &HT;    Dark matter by definition interacts only weakly with ordinary
matter, including the instruments designed to apprehend it. Because
of that, the detectors must be shielded from cosmic rays and other
incoming particles that would obscure the fainter signals from dark
matter.
 &HT;    As it happens, dirt and bedrock make good shields: A detector
located more than half a mile underground in a zinc mine in Japan
collared another type of dark-matter particle two years ago. But
the Japanese experiments showed that those particles, called
neutrinos, don't have nearly enough mass to account for all the
dark matter predicted either by the theories of physicists or the
observations of astronomers. So dark-matter enthusiasts trained
their hopes on finding more-massive particles.

   SF-GARAGE-PRICES (San Francisco) _ Once upon a time in San
Francisco, a $1 million house meant mansion on a hill. Nowadays,
that $1 million property can be a garage. It's so hard to find
parking in the city that folks are having the land under their
houses excavated to build a garage and paying oodles for it _
$100,00, $200,000, even a million bucks. By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU.
</P>
<P>
   SF-HOME-PRICES (San Francisco) _ A limited supply of homes on
the market, along with sky-rocketing prices, has made San Francisco
the nation's least affordable city in which to buy a home,
according to a National Association of Home Builders survey
released this week. Only 5.9 percent of San Francisco households
with a median income of $74,900 can afford to buy the $510,000
median-priced home, according to the survey. By RICHARD PAOLI.

<P>
   CENTURY-OLD-LETTER (Galveston, Texas) _ Dated Sept. 14, 1900,
the letter from Charles Rodewald Byrne to his wife Frances in
Baltimore, began with a plaintive question: ``Darling, Darling,
Darling, Where am I to begin to tell you this sad, sad story?''
Byrne wrote the letter six days after a ferocious hurricane hit
Galveston, taking at least 6,000 lives and destroying 3,600 houses.
It was and remains the nation's greatest natural disaster. By JOHN

   BIGBUSRIDE (Undated) _ Winnipeg to Tierra del Fuego doesn't
exactly sound like a trip from heaven, and it sounds even worse
when put this way: six people on a double-decker bus with no

spend about nine months together, raising money for the

   FILM-ZELLWEGER (New York) _ The last time we talked to Renee
Zellweger, when she starred with Meryl Streep in ``One True
Thing,'' she had no new films planned, no real home to call her
own, a director boyfriend (Josh Pate) and an adored 10-year-old dog
named Dylan. In two years, Zellweger's world has turned
considerably. She's completed four pictures, including the latest,
``Nurse Betty.'' The fourth, ``Bridget Jones' Diary,'' due next
year, made her a favorite target of the British press, which felt a
Texas gal should not play the much-sought title role from the
English best seller. By LOUIS B. PARKS. (For release Sunday, Sept.

   FILM-OAXACA (San Francisco) _ The gender-equality situation must
be so dire in Mexico that when a haute-couture fashion rag like
Spanish Elle runs a sensational article on the sordid

community gets defensive, filing a defamation suit. By WESLEY
MORRIS.

<P>
   FBC-PAC-10 (San Francisco) _ The Pac-10 is fighting a losing
battle. Nobody seems to want to accept the notion that the league
always has been _ and always will be _ dumped on to varying
degrees. All that last season and the season before did was offer
up more morsels for the rest of the country to chew on in its
insistence that West Coast football is inferior. By MARK
FAINARU-WADA.
</P>
<P>
   ROSE-BOWL (San Francisco) _ With six different teams
representing the Pac-10 in the Rose Bowl in the last six seasons,
handicapping the league has essentially become a guessing game.
Take your pick and you're bound to be wrong. Stanford showed up in
Pasadena last January for the first time in 28 years. Two seasons
earlier, Washington State ended a 67-year absence from the big
parade, and three years before that, Oregon materialized after a
37-year hiatus. By MARK FAINARU-WADA.
</P>
<P>
   DAVIDON-SCULLING (San Francisco) _ The doctor is in. Or make
that back in. Ruth Davidon, a surgical resident at Stanford, was
one of America's best hopes for a medal in the women's single
sculls at Atlanta in 1996, but, hampered by a fractured rib, she
finished sixth. And shortly after, she took her oars out of the
water. It looked as if her long rowing career might well be at an
end. But elite athletes don't give up easily. By DWIGHT CHAPIN.

   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ According to a spokeswoman for
the New York Times, the paper has gotten ``a couple of letters and
a couple of phone calls'' of complaint about a Perry Ellis ad that
ran in the Times Magazine fall fashion issue. A couple of letters
and calls? Let me tell you about this erotic, sick ad. By STEPHANIE
SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   JERRY-LEWIS-TELETHON (San Francisco) _ Over the Labor Day
weekend, the ``Jerry's Kids'' Telethon, the nation's most visible
disability event, will again hold its talent show to showcase the
``plight'' of disabled children and raise money to cure muscular
dystrophy. Unknown to most of Lewis' benefactors, this event is not
a rallying point for the disabled community. Not even for one who,
like myself, has severe muscular dystrophy. By STEVEN TINGUS.
</P>
<P>
   PREGNANT (Albany, N.Y.) _ As I write this, I am eight months
pregnant. And I am obsessed with shoes. Don't laugh. Or go ahead,
laugh all you like, but to me this is Serious Business. Or at least
Business That's Serious To Me Right Now But in a Month or Less Will
All Seem Shamefully Ridiculous. When one is eight months pregnant
one loses all perspective of one's priorities. One loses all
perspective of one's feet. By AMY BIANCOLLI.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Agosto fue un mes de problemas para Rusia. Un evento
catastrofico siguio a otro. Primero, una mortifera explosion en un
tunel peatonal, en el centro de Moscu,, y luego el hundimiento en
el mar de Barents del submarino nuclear, portaestandarte de la
Flota Norte de Rusia, y la muerte de sus 118 marinos a bordo. Y,
para coronar todo eso, el incendio sin precedentes de la torre de
television Ostankino, en Moscu.
</P>
<P>
   Cada uno de esos dramaticos eventos tuvieron sus propias causas
y tendran sus propias consecuencias. Sin embargo, tomados de manera
conjunta, crearon una situacion de crisis en el pais. Su primera
expresion fue en la forma en que se informo a la sociedad rusa de
los acontecimientos. O, mejor dicho, en la falta de informacion al
pueblo, que cuestiono muchos de los comunicados oficiales y la
conducta de las autoridades.
</P>
<P>
   Cuando se registro el desastre en el mar de Barents, el pueblo
ruso fue mantenido en la oscuridad. Era dificil evitar la impresion
de que se estaba realizando un deliberado esfuerzo para ocultar los
hechos que rodearon la perdida del submarino. El pueblo ruso
concluyo que, al comienzo, el presidente Vladimir Putin no fue
totalmente informado del curso de los eventos.
</P>
<P>
   De manera inevitable esta falta de apertura, esta recaida en la
epoca previa al glasnost, dano gravemente las relaciones entre las
autoridades y el pueblo, que habian comenzado a cambiar de manera
positiva en los primeros meses de la presidencia de Putin.
</P>
<P>
   En una situacion en que se socavo el contacto entre las
autoridades y los medios de prensa, los periodistas cumplieron con
su deber, tratando de descubrir lo que realmente estaba ocurriendo.
Pero, en determinado punto, los medios de prensa sucumbieron a la
emocion, e inclusive a la difusion de rumores.
</P>
<P>
   Y, al acusar al gobierno ruso de no preocuparse por las vidas de
las victimas de las tragedias, algunos sectores de la prensa
actuaron de una forma que tendio a inflamar los animos.
</P>
<P>
   Es cierto que las autoridades rusas cometieron errores, algunos
de la peor clase, que resultan inaceptables en una sociedad
democratica. Es evidente que durante la tragedia registrada en el
mar de Barents, Putin tardo en actuar. Era la primea vez en su
carrera politica que enfrentaba una crisis tan grave. Tal vez su
falta de experiencia puede haber jugado un papel. Sin embargo,
mostro suficiente coraje y decision para asegurarse que la
situacion no se descontrolara. Tambien procedio de manera vigorosa
para corregir los errores cometidos.
</P>
<P>
   Es ahora muy importante aprender las lecciones correctas, y
encarar los problemas practicos generados por las emergencias de
agosto.
</P>
<P>
   Inclusive antes de estos dramaticos eventos, tuve que hablar en
varias ocasiones acerca de la importancia del glasnost, de ofrecer
al pueblo plena informacion, asi como de la obligaciones de los
medios de prensa con la sociedad.
</P>
<P>
   Ahora, quiero reiterar lo que dije previamente: para que el pais
salga de su perpetua crisis, para que el nuevo gobierno tenga exito
en su politica, es muy importante que fortalezca la democracia, que
preserve, defienda y respalde a una prensa libre. Una prensa libre,
independiente y responsable es en el interes no solo de la sociedad
rusa en su conjunto, sino tambien de las autoridades y del propio
presidente.
</P>
<P>
   Esa es la primera leccion que debemos aprender. Y aunque algunos
reporteros se dejaron llevar por las emociones y dejaron que estas
predominaran sobre los hechos objetivos, es errado acusar a los
medios de haber agravado la situacion de manera deliberada.
</P>
<P>
   Tambien debo decir que, a medida que transcurrieron los eventos,
algunos en la prensa occidental no realizaron una cobertura
imparcial y responsable. Aun mas, diria que algunos de los informes
me recordaron a los escritos durante la epoca de la guerra fria. Se
acuso a Rusia de no haber cambiado en los ultimos 15 anos. Eso no
es cierto. Tanto la conducta de la sociedad rusa, como de los
medios de prensa, refutan esas acusaciones.
</P>
<P>
   Creo que Putin se halla ahora firmemente en control de la
investigacion sobre las causas de recientes eventos y respaldo su
decision de hacerlo en el contexto de una politica que se basa en
el fortalecimiento del papel del estado, en el orden y en el
imperio de la ley, a fin de poner en marcha la economia rusa y
modernizar la infraestructura industrial y urbana.
</P>
<P>
   En dias recientes, se registraron acaloradas discusiones sobre
el estado actual de las fuerzas armadas rusas. Sin duda alguna,
Rusia necesita un ejercito moderno, capaz, agil. Se hablo mucho de
reformas a las fuerzas armadas en anos recientes, pero el regimen
de Yeltsin demostro que era incapaz de implementarlas. En mi
opinion, Putin no solo comprende la necesidad de reformar las
fuerzas armadas sino que ha elegido el metodo correcto para esta
tarea de vital importancia.
</P>
<P>
   Finalmente otra leccion. Una leccion para cada ruso. No debemos
permitir que la presion de las circunstancias nos abrume. Las
autoridades, los medios de prensa, y los ciudadanos, deben aprender
a comportarse con responsabilidad y dignidad.
</P>
<P>
   Estoy en desacuerdo con aquellos que proponen quitarle el apoyo
a Putin. En epocas de desgracias como las que padecemos ahora, el
pueblo de nuestro pais siempre ha mostrado solidaridad. Por lo
tanto, es el momento de unirnos, de asegurarnos que existe una
mejor comprension entre nosotros, y tratar de que el gobierno se
acerque al pueblo.
</P>
<P>
   En cuanto a los problemas subrayados de manera tan dolorosa en
este tragico agosto, solo pueden ser resueltos si avanzamos de
manera conjunta, para construir un pais normal en el cual las
instituciones democraticas funcionen de manera eficaz, y exista un
sistema de control popular, con una fuerte opinion publica y una
prensa libre. Rusia ha cambiado, y esta nueva Rusia puede y debe
lidiar con los desafios que encara en estos momentos.

&HT;     THE MOTHER OF ALL SHOES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As I write this, I am eight months pregnant. And
I am obsessed with shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh. Or go ahead, laugh all you like, but to me this is
Very Serious Business. Or at least Serious Business. Or at least
Business That's Serious To Me Right Now But in a Month or Less Will
All Seem Shamefully Ridiculous. When one is eight months pregnant
one loses all perspective of one's priorities. One loses all
perspective of one's feet.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to shoes. Pregnant women do not normally shop
for clothes _ not real clothes, not clothes designed for anyone
other than bulbous human beings _ for the simple reason that it's
too depressing. Not only does nothing fit, nothing looks like it
will ever fit again _ not that fashionable pleat _ her skirt, not
that cutesy-wootsy tank top, not those flattering wee capri pants
that face it, chickee, you couldn't get away with anyway. Shopping
for clothes is bad news for the expecting mom.
</P>
<P>
   But shoes. Shoes are something else.
</P>
<P>
   This pregnancy is, for the record, my third; my previous two
produced ebullient girls. My belly was (is) equally ebullient _ out
there, baby, greeting the world with robustness and elan. I am not
one of those women who can hide their pregnancies. There is no
doubt when I have a second life form inside me. I stick out. I pop
out. I joke about having ``projectile pregnancies.'' Close friends,
total strangers _ everyone tells me how large I am (duh), as though
I'd been laboring under the tragic misconception that I look like
Gwyneth Paltrow. You must be ready to go!, they say. You must be
carrying twins! Triplets, even! You're just ... so ... HUGE!
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, I am. I know that. My feet know that. And
because my feet know that, the one luxury I have allowed myself
during each and every pregnancy has been comfortable shoes. First
time out I bought Rockports; second time out (a winter pregnancy),
a pair of insanely comfy light-duty hikers from L.L. Bean. For this
third go-around I faced a bigger challenge: I am older. I am less
flexible. And I can no longer, not without grunting and oofing and
asking for help from my husband, tie my own laces.
</P>
<P>
   I resolved, therefore, to buy cozy summer shoes with no laces,
no Velcro straps, no snaps or buckles that would require me to lean
over and actually touch my toes. My first purchase was a pair of
flexible leather clogs that would go well with a dress. My second
was a pair of blue-suede Bass flip-flops that, I figured, I could
wear with shorts or even get away with at work. (Pregnant woman are
allowed to wear anything that fits right and feels good. That's the
law.)
</P>
<P>
   But the third. The third was the coup de maitre, my podiatric
expression of eternal hope and joy. Mark my words: I will never,
ever make a more satisfying footwear purchase for the rest of my
shoe-shopping career. These two bundles of leather and latex are
the apex, the apogee, the Everest's summit of the cobbler's art.
After this, it's all downhill.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: Laceless running shoes. Pull-on laceless running shoes.
I first spotted a woman wearing them at the Kids' Day on the Empire
State Plaza a few weeks back, and I pounced. WHERE DID YOU BUY
THOSE SHOES? I asked, only yelling a little. After a moment or two
of startled hesitation (Who is this loud pregnant woman accosting
me by the Swing Ride?), she told me: Supermarket of Shoes,
Crossgates Mall. They were made by Skechers. And I needed them.
Badly.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week later, I wore my new blue footgear into work
(reference ``The law'') and showed them off with pride. ``Look!
Look at my sneakers! Look!'' I demanded, realizing too late that I
hadn't used those particular words in that particular order since
my parents bought me Super Keds in seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   But it's OK: My elation in discovering this latest
sneako-technological breakthrough is unequivocal, unbound by social
expectations or the suspicion that I'm making a complete and utter
idiot of myself. Outwardly I realize that the product-development
gurus at Skechers (and Nike, which has also come out with laceless
shoes) did not design them with me mind, but secretly I'm convinced
that they did. They had to. For what but some grand karmic purpose
were these spiffy little foot-protectors released to the world at
the precise time I entered my late third trimester _ at the very
moment that I stopped being able to tie my own shoes?
</P>
<P>
   Don't answer that. I don't need to know what you think. I just
need to revel in the form-fitting comfort and funky design of my
brand-new Skechers. I need to prop up my feet and regard them with
peace and contentment and the quiet pride of a conquering shopper.
I need to feel happy about my shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But I need to sit while I do it, because I can't quite see them
when I stand.

&HT;     PERRY ELLIS' CRASS ADS HAVE NO STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ According to a spokeswoman for the New York
Times, the newspaper has gotten ``a couple of letters and a couple
of phone calls'' of complaint about a Perry Ellis ad that ran in
the Times Magazine fall fashion issue.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of letters and calls?
</P>
<P>
   Let me tell you about this ad.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many designer rag pitches these days, the four-page
Ellis spread offers a stylized photo-Rorschach test. Not enough to
merely grab eyeballs with color and lines, the two double-page
vignettes beg us to wonder, ``What is going on here?''
</P>
<P>
   Both ``stories'' are set in what appears to be a large shower or
possibly a public restroom. The vibrant green of the ceramic tiles
is repeated in generously applied eye shadow on both models.
</P>
<P>
   In the first ad an alarmingly pale woman, who looks young enough
to be a teen-ager, is slumped in a corner _ half-sitting,
half-lying. Her large, heavily rouged mouth hangs slack. Her
green-rimmed eyes stare lifelessly at the camera. She could be in a
drug-induced stupor, exhausted or dead.
</P>
<P>
   Straddling her, and grasping the belt of her houndstooth tweed
coat in his right hand, is a naked man. Or at least a man who has
no clothes on as far as we can see, which is just below his hipbone
and to the shoulder of his visible arm.
</P>
<P>
   His tanned, hairy legs are a stark contrast to the bloodless
white of the model's bare thighs. Her only other item of clothing:
black knee-high leather boots.
</P>
<P>
   In the second ad, a model equally pale, wearing the same makeup,
is flat on her back, staring _ again, lifelessly _ at the ceiling.
She wears a sleeveless black dress. Her arms lie on the floor above
her head, almost crossed at the wrists.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the naked man is in a semi-crouch, as if he is about
to lower himself onto the woman. His legs and hips are near her
head. His face, of which we see only a shadowy portion, looms above
her belly.
</P>
<P>
   The only copy on either photo is ``Perry Ellis.''
</P>
<P>
   Because I am 50 years old and came of age when millions of
American women were waking up to the very real, very dangerous
realities of female sexual objectification, I decided to show the
ads to two dozen other women. They range in age from 17 to 60.
</P>
<P>
   The most common reaction was, ``Oh, my God,'' accompanied by a
look of disbelief and pain.
</P>
<P>
   Some other responses:
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me want to vomit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's supposed to be erotic, it isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she dead? Is she a heroin addict? Has she been raped? Is
she about to be?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks like a clip from a snuff film.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I'm pretty lenient, but this is definitely
offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gross.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is scary. The woman is totally vulnerable, and there's
nothing gentle about the man. This totally degrades women.''
</P>
<P>
   The only positive comment came from an artist in her 20s, who
said, ``The model is very good at being vacant.''
</P>
<P>
   I checked out Perry Ellis' slick Web site to see if anyone is
taking credit for this ad campaign. No one is. (The site displayed
variations on the ads that ran in the Times Magazine, but not the
specific photos I have described here.)
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to add this column and the quotes of the women I
checked with to the handful of protests the Times received. I would
also like to ask any woman (or man) who's seen the ads and was
offended by them to complain to the Times or any publication that
runs them.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old who said, ``This totally degrades women,'' was
more than a decade from being born when I was sitting in feminist
consciousness-raising sessions.
</P>
<P>
   In those sessions, young women who'd been raised to accept
sexual discrimination and objectification as the female's lot
helped each other see the misogyny, exploitation and violence that
seeped out of all kinds of mainstream literature, art, film and
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   We learned, together, to listen to our gut, that deep, knowing
part of every woman and girl that says, ``This is not OK.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't care what Perry Ellis meant to convey with its latest ad
campaign. I don't care if some feted advertising genius insists
that it's ``cutting edge.'' I don't even care if it turns out that
the entire creative team responsible is female.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes being hipper-than-thou can blind a person to her own
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Perry Ellis' dead-chicks-on-green-tile is not OK. And it's
incumbent on those of us who recognize it to say so _ to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   As www.perryellis.com declares: ``After all, we're not just
helping consumers choose the clothes they wear. We're designing
lifestyles.''

antichronology is that chronology and time are only the surface
issues. The deeper issue is genealogy: whether there is a great
lineage of art, a natural progression of one art movement after
another leading up to the grand finale, abstraction. By Sarah
Boxer.

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Labor Day weekend, the ``Jerry's Kids''
Telethon, the nation's most visible disability event, will again
hold its talent show to showcase the ``plight'' of disabled
children and raise money to cure muscular dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to most of Lewis' benefactors, this event is not a
rallying point for the disabled community. Not even for one who,
like myself, has severe muscular dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   The net benefits of his fund-raising for medical research are
dwarfed by the overall damage done to the struggle for independence
and respect by people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The message behind Lewis' marketing is clear: You should feel
sorry for these kids.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis smiles awkwardly beside young and otherwise attractive
children whose natural beauty is interrupted by the heavy,
robotic-looking medical accessories that confine their little
bodies. The kids, perhaps for the first time ever, get social
recognition. Good for them, the viewer thinks. Jerry has given
their lives real meaning.
</P>
<P>
   For another year, disability is again horrific and demeaning in
the minds of everyday Americans. The telethon drives public
perception of physical limitations as pitiful.
</P>
<P>
   The message for disabled youth is even more damaging. They come
to perceive of themselves as charity cases in the literal sense.
This is devastating.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking of oneself as incomplete or, even worse, as broken,
serves no purpose but to internalize the inadequacy society
regularly ascribes to us.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the images of the telethon are in sharp contrast to the
real lives of people with disabilities who have reached
independence, raised families and gone on to hold jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Successful people with disabilities don't perceive of themselves
as inadequate or inferior. They recognize their disabilities as the
only reality they'll know. They reject the dichotomous comparison
with the able-bodied in which they always come up short.
</P>
<P>
   Although they certainly have greater physical challenges to
overcome, they discover authenticity in them, not embarrassment or
shame.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council on Disability notes that the public's
perception is overwhelmingly negative toward disability and issues
such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because people with disabilities aren't as active as they
should be due to a host of social and policy barriers to their
participation.
</P>
<P>
   The able-bodied can play a major role in seeing that today's
essential disability reforms are put into place so that inclusion
and independence are no longer a novelty.
</P>
<P>
   By lending their talents to support issues like access,
assistive technology or employment reforms, the able-bodied can
participate in a philanthropy that is free.
</P>
<P>
   This non-charity will unlock the door for millions who can't
wait to get out of institutions and backrooms so they can share in
America's prosperity. By supporting the Independent Living movement
directly, those unfamiliar with disability can tear down the walls.
</P>
<P>
   They can support the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
of 2000 (S 2341) to ensure that local kids with disabilities have
access to public education _ something they've only enjoyed since
1973.
</P>
<P>
   They can write their representative to Congress to oppose the
``ADA Notification Act'' (HR 3590), a bill that will dilute ADA
enforcement by essentially allowing businesses to wait until they
are sued before making facilities accessible.
</P>
<P>
   They can also voice their support for technology needs
assessment as part of the Individual Education Plans required by
local school districts. This way, students with disabilities can
get the technology they need to learn.
</P>
<P>
   These activities have a unified goal: giving people with
disabilities the tools they need to work and live on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Telethons have never empowered individual achievement among the
disabled. Not when a paraplegic man scaled El Capitan last year,
nor when John Hockenberry, who uses a wheelchair, rose to the ranks
of top national news reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The great achievements of people with disabilities throughout
history have been individual: Franklin Delano Roosevelt's long
tenure as president, James Joyce's quintessential modern novels or
the impressionist paintings of Monet and Van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for most Americans, disability still conjures images of
Jerry Lewis and his kids, rather than the real social obstacles
that prevent independence for the disabled. That the most visible
disability event in the nation has nothing to do with empowerment
is a sign of how far we have to go.

<P>
   This fall, college students in Massachusetts will be spending
time with the usual suspects from the summer of ``Survivor:'' Rich,
Kelly, Rudy, Susan and the 12 other visitors to a now-famous island
called Pulau Tiga.
</P>
<P>
   But the students won't be watching repeats of the hit TV show
for fun. It will be homework, part of a professor's quest to
explore the human mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' is a bonanza of material about how people interact
and make decisions in times of conflict, according to Tom Boone, a
professor of psychology at Assumption College in Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do it all with this little piece of video,'' he says.
``'Survivor' stresses the importance of social psychology. This was
not won by the physically fittest person. It was ultimately much
more of a social-psychological outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor,'' of course, was the summer's must-see pop culture
event. Show producers stranded 16 people on a tropical island south
of Vietnam where they faced a variety of physical obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   But the real challenges were mental. Each week the castaways
voted one of their own off the island until they were down to two.
Then a jury of seven chose the winner of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the castaways voted off their counterparts who were
lazy, annoying or ill-equipped to handle island life. But over
time, Boone says, other dynamics came into play.
</P>
<P>
   What goes on in their minds?
</P>
<P>
   Boone studies social dilemma theory, which examines why people
choose to cooperate with each other. ``It's really easy to explain
aggression: It gets you what you want,'' he says. ``It's hard to
explain cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone cites a rock concert or sporting event as an example.
``Inevitably, someone decides they want a better view, and they
stand up. The outcome for that individual is better, but the
problem is that if everyone does that, the collective outcome is
worse,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The job of social psychologists is to study what goes through
the minds of those who make decisions in such cases, Boone says.
</P>
<P>
   Why do some people always look out for number one, while others
are more generous to others?
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't always 100 percent rational. They adopt rules of
thumb that take complex matters and make them much more simple, and
then use these rules to guide their choices,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Boone helped create a card game called ``Trump'' to analyze how
people make decisions about cooperation. The game attempts to
replicate the questions raised in the classic ``Prisoner's
Dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hypothetical dilemma, Boone says, two prisoners are
interrogated separately and given a choice. If both confess, each
gets five years in prison. If both insist on their innocence,
they'll each get two years on minor charges. If one gives up the
other, the accuser will be released and the other will get 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   When a pair of subjects repeats the dilemma over and over again,
they each learn the other person's strategies and try to adapt by
playing along or rebelling.
</P>
<P>
   Similar dynamics were at work on ``Survivor,'' where some
castaways joined alliances while others kept their own counsel and
ultimately were voted out, Boone said.
</P>
<P>
   One contestant, a neurologist named Sean, initially chose a
strategy of voting people out in alphabetical order. But four
castaways used this to their advantage by secretly allying with the
oblivious Sean and overpowering the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Sean didn't realize is that by being pacifist, he allowed
the wolves into the fold,'' Boone says.
</P>
<P>
   The show also reveals how people use visual cues to decide
whether to trust others, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In general, race and sex are big factors in decision-making, but
``attractiveness is much bigger,'' he says. ``The people who are
cute and fuzzy have a much better life because people respond to
them better.''
</P>
<P>
   The politics of ``Survivor'' have fascinated other experts. Gene
Ondrusek, a San Diego psychologist who traveled to the island to
counsel the castaways, says colleagues are interested in using the
show as the basis for research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the sort of social psychological experiment that you
couldn't create in a clinical setting,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Crandall, an associate professor of psychology at the
University of Kansas, says anyone who studies ``Survivor'' must
realize that it is not truly a ``reality show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In every case, the people who are on these shows know they are
going to return to a life that is more normal. People in their
everyday social lives don't have that relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he says, ``they're still people and use the rules of
people to negotiate the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone says he will make sure that students think about the
staged nature of the show. But he added that television is an
excellent resource for the study of human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any social psychologist who's not hooked into popular culture
is missing the boat, in my opinion,'' he says.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Few people may have noticed, we've just passed the two-year
anniversary of the 1998 Russian default crisis. Maybe not an event
worth celebrating, but it is worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   With everything Russia has endured in the last few months, it is
tempting to think the country is again in crisis. The tragic loss
of the nuclear submarine Kursk exposed Russia's deteriorating
military and, in a larger sense, the country's weak infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the war in Chechnya may have slowed, but has
certainly not ended. Even the recent fire in the Ostankino TV
tower, the second tallest free-standing structure in the world,
seems to point to a country tottering on the brink of disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it is worth remembering that Russia actually is
improving, albeit at a snail's pace. The country may not exactly be
a poster child of economic reform, but it is slowly moving down the
path toward a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Since his election in March, Russian President Vladimir Putin
has pressed through a number of reforms that will help push the
country down the free-market path. He has reorganized Russia's
chaotic federal structure, a legacy of the Yeltsin years, and
tackled the country's confusing taxation system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of the Yeltsin reign has been positive,'' says David
Aserkoff, Russian analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston, based in
London. ``Now we have a president who is active and is willing and
able to deal with the problems that face Russia,'' he says.
Aserkoff sees improvement in a number of small areas, such as
regulatory issues, that may not make headlines but will lead to an
improving economic environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin has done more of the right things than the wrong
things,'' says Eswar Menon, manager of the Loomis Sayles Emerging
Market Fund. That may sound like faint praise, but Menon thinks
highly enough of Russia's recent performance that its securities
now constitute a sizeable 8 percent of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Russia's economic health is as strong now as it has
been in quite a while. The country posted 8.4 percent GDP growth in
the first quarter of this year and should post growth of around 5
percent for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Russia's markets have been on a tear for the past
year. The benchmark Moscow Times Index is up 264 percent since it
began a rally last September. While the markets were lackluster for
the first half of 2000, the rally seems to have returned, with the
index up 50 percent since late June.
</P>
<P>
   That has translated into impressive gains for one of the
pure-Russia plays available to U.S. investors. The open-end
Lexington Troika Dialog Russia Fund is up 98 percent over the past
12 months and has risen 31 percent this year. It carries an expense
ratio of 3.09 percent and requires an initial investment of $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   However, the closed-end Templeton Russia Fund (TRF on the NYSE)
is up 27.78 percent over the past year, but is down 14 percent this
year and trades at a 14.42 percent premium to net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, the market rally is connected to one thing
and one thing only: the price of oil. Whether one thinks Russia is
on the path toward a market economy and democracy, or that Putin
represents a slip back into authoritarianism, the strength of
Russia's economy and the rise in its stock markets are quite simply
rooted in the rise of oil prices the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Russia's default in 1998, oil sold for around $12
a barrel. Now it is going for around $30. That may cause a lot of
griping among SUV drivers in the U.S., but it has been a blessing
for Russia, since oil is still the country's largest export.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Russia, then, is to seize the opportunity that
the revenue from high oil prices provides to put in place the
framework for a market system. If the country can't do that, it
risks a repeat of the crisis of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, more and more analysts are predicting that oil
prices are not going to go down over the next few months. That
gives the country more time to get its act together _ and is good
news for the Russian market in the near term.

   1. BELA KAROLYI: U.S. GYMNASTICS SAVIOR? by David Plotz
</P>
<P>
   NBC specializes in adulterating hard-core Olympic sports into
treacly mush, so when the U.S. women's gymnastics team competes in
Sydney, Australia, next month, the network will undoubtedly torture
viewers with endless images of Bela Karolyi bearhugging his
teensy-weensy acolytes.
</P>
<P>
   These Karolyi squeezes _ at once heartwarming and creepy _ have
become the money shot of the Summer Olympics. In 1984, Mary Lou
Retton became America's darling when Karolyi leapt a barrier to
snuggle her. In 1996, Karolyi assured the immortality of the
``Magnificent Seven'' women's team when he told Kerri Strug to
vault on a gimpy leg, then scooped her up and carried her to the
podium to collect her gold medal.

   2. WHAT DO ORTHODOX JEWS THINK ABOUT ABORTION AND WHY? by Judith

</P>
<P>
   Many of us have heard the Jewish joke about the rabbi who is
asked to settle a dispute. After listening to one side's argument,
the rabbi declares, ``You're right!'' After listening the other
side's argument, the rabbi nods and says, ``You're right, too.''
His wife, who is listening, declares, exasperated, ``Rabbi, this is
absurd! They can't both be right!'' The rabbi sighs and replies
sadly, ``You're also right!''
</P>

   3. A `CLUMP OF CELLS' AND THE VOICE OF REASON, by Michael
Kinsley
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the new rules for government-funded stem-cell
research are right that the rules are irrational. The rules forbid
government-funded researchers to extract stem cells from human
embryos, but they allow those researchers _ on alternate Tuesdays
when the wind is from the northeast and at least three members of
five different review boards have dreamed of a fish _ to use stem
cells extracted by others.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of stem-cell research believe that ``a microscopic
clump of cells'' (The New York Times' description of an embryo at
the stage when stem cells are removed) has the same moral claims as
a fully formed human being.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents believe that a clump of cells has no serious moral
claim compared with people who ``feel want, taste grief, need
friends'' (Shakespeare's description of a human being).

   After the ridicule he endured in George W. Bush's speech at the
Republican convention, Al Gore dropped the phrase ``risky scheme''
from his lexicon. To repeat it after that would have been to
embrace self-parody. But since then, the question has been: What
line would replace it?

side's argument, the rabbi nods and says, ``You're right, too.''
His wife, who is listening, declares, exasperated, ``Rabbi, this is
absurd! They can't both be right!'' The rabbi sighs and replies
sadly, ``You're also right!''

   3. A `CLUMP OF CELLS' AND THE VOICE OF REASON, by Michael
Kinsley
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the new rules for government-funded stem-cell
research are right that the rules are irrational. The rules forbid
government-funded researchers to extract stem cells from human
embryos, but they allow those researchers _ on alternate Tuesdays
when the wind is from the northeast and at least three members of
five different review boards have dreamed of a fish _ to use stem
cells extracted by others.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of stem-cell research believe that ``a microscopic
clump of cells'' (The New York Times' description of an embryo at
the stage when stem cells are removed) has the same moral claims as
a fully formed human being.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents believe that a clump of cells has no serious moral
claim compared with people who ``feel want, taste grief, need
friends'' (Shakespeare's description of a human being).

   4. GORE'S NEW LINE, by Jacob Wiesberg
</P>
<P>
   After the ridicule he endured in George W. Bush's speech at the
Republican convention, Al Gore dropped the phrase ``risky scheme''
from his lexicon. To repeat it after that would have been to
embrace self-parody. But since then, the question has been: What
line would replace it?

EFFORTS LAUNCHED TO AID, EDUCATE AFGHAN WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As American schoolgirls and college women go back
to classes this fall, nearly all their counterparts halfway around
the world in Afghanistan are staying home, their education
forbidden by the ruling Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan women's plight outrages Jesse Mostipak, who started
her sophomore year at Brandeis University this week. She has joined
a national ``back to school'' campaign for Afghan girls in hopes of
raising money for underground schools and increasing international
pressure on the fundamentalist Islamic government to lift
repressive gender-based rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I learned about how the Taliban treats women, I couldn't
believe something like this was going on today,'' said Mostipak,
18, whose family lives in Buffalo. ``It's humiliating and
degrading.''
</P>
<P>
   The Feminist Majority Foundation is looking for thousands of
people who share Mostipak's views, launching an adopt-a-school
project, a scholarship program, and a new petition drive urging the
US government to increase efforts on behalf of Afghan women.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is hoping that US schools will donate money for
the underground schools for girls _ $60 buys supplies for 300
students, $36 pays a teacher's monthly salary _ and that US
colleges and universities will set up scholarships for Afghan women
that include tuition and room and board.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, has
prevented almost all girls and women from attending schools or
working in jobs and requires that all women wear a veil, called the
burqa, that covers the face and body. In scattered Muslim schools,
young girls attend segregated classes, and in some isolated
villages the local power broker has allowed girls to attend school.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Taliban in New York cited the religious
schools and said the Feminist Majority was engaging in propaganda.
``They are playing politics,'' said Noorullah Zadran. ``They have
not visited Afghanistan for 40 years. And what about the collection
of the money? They raised $16 million in California through Jay
Leno's wife, and not one cent has gone to Afghan schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a joke,'' said Julie Bernstein, a spokeswoman for
Feminist Majority, who said the organization has raised $140,000
over the past two years toward Afghan school projects. ``And the
few girls allowed to attend school are 7 or 8 years old, and
they're only learning to memorize the Koran.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, which grew out of fundamentalist Islamic
universities in Afghanistan and Pakistan, forbids girls and women
to learn a variety of subjects based on its interpretation of the
Koran, an interpretation that nearly all Islamic scholars disavow.
Of Afghanistan's 25 million people, 12.5 million are women, and of
that 5.3 million are girls under age 14.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said Thursday that past campaigns by
the Feminist Majority for Afghan women have produced as much or
more mail than any other foreign policy issue has. The group
delivered several boxes last week to the State Department that
contained 211,000 petitions, demanding more US pressure on the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted tht
while ``all international pressure is useful to keep the Taliban's
feet to the fire,'' international charities and diplomats were
often in disagreement about how to impose that pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some do not think it's wise to get into direct confrontations
with the Taliban because it could force them to show how pure they
can be in following Islam,'' the US official said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has been among the
fiercest critics of the Taliban's treatment of women, calling it
``medieval.'' US aid for Afghan citizens has increased to $110
million, up from $70 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Eleanor Smeal, president of Feminist Majority, said it was
nowhere near enough. ``There is a massive need for aid,'' she said.
Leading the Afghan project is Mavis Leno, the wife of the talk show
host.
</P>
<P>
   Smeal said her organization almost entirely focuses on US
issues, including abortion rights and domestic violence, but it
decided to take on the Afghan project because the ``magnitude of
the problem is so great. This is the worst example of misogyny ever
in recorded history.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter addressed to her from a 22-year-old Afghan refugee,
the young woman wrote: ``We do not have a future. I know I have
very bad destiny. I cannot go to school. I do not have a job. I
cannot take care of my old mother. I cannot take it any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why God made me a woman?''
</P>
<P>
   The last line, Smeal said, ``just cut into me.'' She showed it
to President Clinton, who, she said, suggested that the group start
a scholarship program for women like the refugee.
</P>
<P>
   The first seven Afghan women have arrived for courses this fall.
The group doesn't include the letter-writer, and Smeal acknowledged
that it's a small step. But for one of the seven, it has meant new
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine being a teacher in a country where it is a crime to
teach girls to count,'' said Frayba Wakili, a refugee who began
classes this week at the University of Maryland. ``Imagine living
in a country where a child could be killed for learning the
alphabet and opening a book. Imagine being beaten for organizing an
underground library that distributes books to girls. This is
happening in Afghanistan every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation will send donations to private charities that
already work with underground schools for girls. With great
secrecy, such charities will be able to facilitate exchanges of
photographs and letters between Afghan and US schools, Smeal said.
She wouldn't name the charities.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the foundation's Afghan campaign, see
its Web site, www.feminist.org, and click on ``Stop Gender
Apartheid.'' For more information on the Taliban's position, see
its Web site, www.taleban.com, and click on the heading ``News,''
under which there is a rebuttal to the foundation's program.
</P>
<P>
   Mostipak, the Brandeis student, hopes to begin fund-raising
soon, launch a petition drive and urge her university's leadership
to offer scholarships for Afghan women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brandeis was formed with a mission for social justice, so
there's a lot of support,'' she said. ``What outrages me the most
is that women were treated fairly equitably over there, and then,
overnight, the Taliban stripped away every right they had.''

PICKING UP THE STICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's only so much fishing, diving, and lazing around that one
person can do in Hawaii, right? ``What was happening was that I was
getting bored, but I wasn't being honest about it,'' admits Bill
Kreutzmann, the Grateful Dead drummer who had retired to Hawaii and
hadn't toured since Jerry Garcia died five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kreutzmann is back on the road with the Other Ones _ the
post-Dead band that includes fellow Dead alums Bob Weir, Mickey
Hart, and Bruce Hornsby. The group is already off to a great start
after Bonnie Raitt joined them recently for a few songs in San
Francisco and Steve Winwood sang ``Dear Mr. Fantasy'' with them in
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an adventure again _ and that's what we've been looking
for,'' says Weir.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an exhilarating feeling that all the Deadheads
want to feel,'' adds Hornsby. ``That feeling didn't happen that
often in the last years of the Dead because of various problems,
including burnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the main story of this band now is Bill Kreutzmann, who
had to get it all back together and he's done that,'' says Hornsby.
``His attitude is great and he's playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heaven. It's like a piece that's been missing,'' says
percussionist Hart, who is once again teaming with Kreutzmann
during mid-show ``drums and space'' segments. ``I remember the day
that Bill said he was hanging up his sticks _ and my heart just
stopped. But I always hoped he'd come back. We're tied at the hip.
When he returned, it was just like getting back on a bicycle. We
locked instantly. We didn't miss a beat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the new guy,'' says a chuckling Kreutzmann, who surprised
his mates by showing up unannounced at an audition for drummers for
the tour. ``I passed,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the rhythm is good, life is good,'' says Hart. ``And to
see this form out of the ashes (of the Dead) is great. The spirit
is strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Other Ones, with a different lineup, toured two years ago.
Dead bassist Phil Lesh was in that group, but has since left to
form his traveling collective, Phil Lesh &AMP; Friends. Lesh and the
remaining Dead survivors have exhanged some shots in the press _
and the friction still hasn't subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a big void after Garcia (died), and Phil tried to
slip in as the ultimate ruler,'' says Hart. All agree, however,
that Lesh is ``irreplaceable,'' though new bassist Alphonso Johnson
(ex-Weather Report) has been filling in beautifully, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't hate anybody. I worked with Phil for 30 years and I
love the guy. He turned me on to Coltrane when I was 17,'' says
Kreutzmann, adding, ``I hope that Phil finds his musical happiness
in whatever he wants to do. He wants to do it his way, but this
band is about doing it the music's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kreutzmann, ever the peacemaker, says, ``It's very
refreshing to play with a new bassist, as it must be for Lesh to
play with a new drummer!''
</P>
<P>
   The Other Ones have rehearsed as many as 80 songs, says Weir,
enabling them, just like the Grateful Dead, to not repeat any songs
in subsequent nights. However, the group's jams _ and expect a lot
of them this time _ have centered on a rejiggered 6/8 rhythm on the
song ``The Other One,'' and on the recurrent musical themes of
``Dark Star'' and ``Bird Song.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really enjoying playing with Alphonso,'' says Hornsby.
``He's very versatile and we've been able to create new harmonic
areas, new chord sequences in the jams. We miss Phil _ Phil had
perfect pitch _ but Alphonso has been a joy.''
</P>
<P>
   And filling Garcia's shoes again is the twin-guitar lineup of
Steve Kimock and Mark Karan. ``One is a raunch king (Karan), the
other is more ethereal,'' says Kreutzmann. ``But they're sorting
themselves out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Other Ones are playing a lot of well-known and obscure Dead
tunes _ and even did an acoustic version of ``Deal'' recently. And
several new songs _ with lyrics by longtime Dead songwriter Robert
Hunter _ will be added shortly, possibly one or two by the Boston
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``This won't be the last tour by this band. We're enjoying it
too much,'' says Hart. ``We might even tour again in six months.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fleetwood Mac legend returns: Eric Clapton may have been
nicknamed ``God'' in the '60s, but guitarist Peter Green wasn't far
behind. Green played in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (as did
Clapton) and also in Fleetwood Mac, back when the Mac was a
blues-rock powerhouse that scorched the Boston Tea Party club a few
times. The Mac boasted a three-guitar lineup that was unmatched for
explosiveness, especially when Green cranked up the volume.
</P>
<P>
   Green later became a celebrated dropout, turning his back on
music to become a gravedigger in England for a while. ``I was
trying to make an LSD vision come true,'' he says of that era. Or
as his guitar-playing partner of today, Nigel Watson, recalls,
``Pete had a long holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Green and Watson (who joined Fleetwood Mac in 1971 when Spencer
left the group) just released an engaging album, ``Hot Foot
Powder,'' filled with mostly acoustic, but some electric, versions
of Robert Johnson songs. ``We tried to take the songs and stretch
them a little for a wider audience,'' says Watson, noting that the
CD also features such guests as Dr. John, Otis Rush, Hubert Sumlin,
and Honeyboy Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Blues history is about to be made when Green and Watson, in a
long-awaited Boston visit, share a bill at the Roxy on Wednesday
with fellow English royals, John Mayall &AMP; the Bluesbreakers. They
just did a 30-date overseas tour, and it was a smash.
</P>
<P>
   Green no longer goes for in-your-face volume, but rather a
``devotion to simplicity'' in his playing, he says. For blues fans,
seeing Green back in Boston should be a genuine treat.

`OPEN HOUSE' FEELS COZY DESPITE THE CLICHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AMY GRAVES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
OPEN HOUSE 
By Elizabeth Berg 
Random House. 256 pp. $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you realize that the person at the center of your world
doesn't love you anymore, what then? It's a familiar story, told a
thousand ways. Some versions are despairing, some inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   In Elizabeth Berg's ``Open House,'' we have Samantha, a 40-ish
housewife and mother, living with David, her cold, overprivileged
WASP husband, and Travis, their adorable 11-year-old son, in an
unnamed Boston suburb. Things are fine, or at least bearable, until
one day she realizes that they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   `` `David?' I said. He looked up. I said, `You know, you're
right in saying we have some serious problems. But there are so
many reasons to try to work things out.' I hoped my voice was
pleasant and light. I hoped my hair wasn't sticking up or that my
nose didn't look too big and that I didn't look fat when I sat up
to adjust the pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   To enjoy this somewhat unsurprising, cliche-heavy story about
how Sam puts her life back together after painful separations from
both husband and son, it helps to overlook the obvious and
concentrate instead on the humor. Thankfully, Samantha, who goes by
Sam, has a sense of humor. Her first steps as a soon-to-be-divorced
mom are awkward and painful and amusing by turns, sometimes all at
once.
</P>
<P>
   First, she goes on a wild spending spree with her estranged
husband's checkbook. Though it's not a very original way to cope
with her shock and anger, we are soon swept up by the
outrageousness of how far she takes it: straight to Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man shows me the figures for the cost of the silver and
the china. With the cost of the bracelet, my total will be over
twelve thousand dollars. Twelve thousand! The number zips a finger
up my spine, thrills me deeply in a way that reminds me of sex.
From what I can recall.''
</P>
<P>
   Things really liven up when Sam decides to get a roommate to
help defray the mortgage payments on the house. She starts with the
elderly mother of a cashier at her favorite grocery store. When
that nice lady moves in, Travis gets upset because she snores, and
he threatens to move out and live with his dad.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Well, what, Travis? What's the big deal? So she snores.'
`She woke me up! I have to go to school tomorrow! I have to get a
good night's sleep!' I refrain from commenting on this new interest
in academic repsonsibilities, say instead, `Tomorrow's Sunday,
Travis.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her coping strategies continue. Sam tries to win David back;
later, she and her best friend scan the personals. Sam finds paid
employment in the form of temporary jobs. The jobs have no serious
connection to her life, but they boost her confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Other scenes are a bit predictable, including Sam's first
Thanksgiving alone, arguments with her mother and her best friend
as Sam begins to live more on her own terms, and one disastrous
blind date.
</P>
<P>
   What lifts Sam out of her despair over losing David are her
relationships with other people. She gains a new understanding of
her mother and son, finds new friends and a new love interest.
These are the more entertaining passages of this ultimately
uplifting story. If they fail to offer an intellectual challenge,
they fit Sam's character.
</P>
<P>
   Her new friendship with a man named King, an MIT graduate who
likes to take life one day at a time, literally, is an example: ``
`What are you doing with all these dogs, anyway?' I asked when we
stopped in a park to rest. And he told me walking dogs was his job
for the day, he took jobs by the day. Yesterday he'd handed out
samples of cheese at a supermarket. Smoked gouda. Very good. `I
see,' I said. I didn't really see. I think what he does is pretty
nutty. But I like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg finds humor even in the serious moments between Sam and her
husband, and between her and her son. As Sam tries to help her son
make sense of what's happening to their family, she struggles with
what she wants to say to him, versus what she should say:
</P>
<P>
   `` `We both love you very much, and we will both continue to be
your parents. It's just that Dad and I can't live together any
more.' `Why?' `Well. . .' Sometimes people, even when they really
love each other, they kind of grow apart. . . `Because your father
is a very, very selfish person who thinks only of himself. Always
has, always will. He deserted me, Travis, just like that. . .' ''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a novel that sets out to challenge our ideas about
love and belonging. It does explore the tension that exists for
many of us, especially many women, when the need to please other
people comes up against the need for self-realization.
</P>
<P>
   If you can ignore some of the obvious plot devices for the sake
of the big-hearted, hopeful outlook of Sam and her interesting
array of friends, reading ``Open House'' is like receiving a warm
embrace.

   Once again seeking substance where others go for sensationalism,
ABC News' ``Nightline'' will spend three consecutive nights
(beginning tonight at 11:35 p.m.) trying to explain hip-hop music,
style and culture. With its huge sales and rebellious attitudes,
hip-hop is perhaps the leading influence on today's kids,
especially teen-age boys. Host Ted Koppel and correspondent Robert
Krulwich will look at the upside as well as the down, with
in-studio discussion and profiles of DJ Grandmaster Flash,
entrepreneur Russell Simmons, rapper Jay Z and 22-year-old clothing
designer Kevin Leong.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HIGHLIGHTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' CBS at 8: Another house mouse is nominated for
banishment. Julie Chen continues her determined effort to destroy
her journalism career. And Dr. Drew Pinsky offers more fatuous

<P>
   ``Dateline,'' NBC at 8: Maria Shriver has a chat with Minnesota
Gov. Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond the Fatal Shore,'' PBS 9-11: With the Sydney Olympics
just over a week away, a lot of shows will take a look at
Australian culture. Among the best is ``Beyond the Fatal Shore,'' a
six-part documentary by Time magazine art critic Robert Hughes.
Hughes wrote the bestselling history ``The Fatal Shore,'' and
brings his native land to life here. Hours three and four include a
look at class issues in the allegedly classless society.

(played by former tabloid bad boy Rob Lowe) is photographed giving
a gift to a call girl. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law &AMP; Order,'' NBC at 10: In an episode cleverly titled
``Untitled,'' a sick murder leads the detectives into the

</P>
<P>
   ``This Is Spinal Tap,'' VH1 at 9, followed at 11 by a ``Where
Are They Now?'' edition devoted to the entirely fictional heavy
metal band: The 1984 mockumentary led some of our finest comic
minds _ Harry Shearer, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, Rob

HARDWARE FIRMS RIDE BIOTECH WAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a stock market full of companies bursting with the kind
of high-tech promise that might change people's lives but scant
sales to show and no profits to speak of.
</P>
<P>
   We might be talking about the Internet stock bubble, as an
extraordinary episode in the recent past. But we could just as
easily be talking about the biotech investing frenzy going on right
now.
</P>
<P>
   Many biotech companies ``have the type of risk profile of public
venture capital,'' says Linda Miller, manager of the $500 million
John Hancock Health Science fund. ``You'd better be assuming
valuations that leave you venture capital rates of return.'' Sound
familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Internet investors discovered most of their enduring gains were
made not with the scores of high-concept start-ups but with those
established companies whose equipment was needed to turn the
promise of the Web into reality. Will history repeat itself?
</P>
<P>
   The ``pick and shovel'' companies of the Internet include big
players such as Cisco Systems Inc. and EMC Corp., whose routers and
storage equipment build a virtual world for the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Comparable players in the biotech market are instrument
companies whose equipment is used by pharmaceutical giants, biotech
companies, and government sponsored labs around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies have ridden the biotech hardware wave like Waters
Corp., a Milford, Mass. company that went public with a modest
stock offering five years ago and zoomed to a market value crossing
$10 billion for the first time last week.
</P>
<P>
   Waters shares increased a staggering twentyfold since their IPO
in 1995, but have staged some of their biggest dollar gains of all
this year with a 200 percent advance.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Waters or any other instrument company will
become the next Cisco. We can envision a world with almost endless
demand for computer data routers as the global Internet continues
to expand. The same cannot be said for the mass spectrometers and
other pieces of equipment used by drug and biotech researchers.
</P>
<P>
   But instrument companies such as Waters and the larger PE
Biosystems Group of Norwalk, Conn., do benefit from the biotech
boom. They may not hold the same kind of blockbuster business
potential of their customers. But they have established businesses,
solid track records for profits, and much less risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``These instrument companies are in some ways part of the fuel
to the (biotech) revolution,'' said Kristen Tongberg, a medical
equipment analyst at MFS Investment Management in Boston. ``They
feed the pace at which research can be done and enable a larger
amount of research.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Waters, though cautious about forecasting the
future for their business, don't discourage comparison with
Internet gear companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waters provides tools to the pharmaceutical life science
industry just like Cisco provides tools to the Internet,'' said
Brian Mazar, a senior vice president. He points to the company's
steady 25 percent earnings growth since it went public.
</P>
<P>
   Tell Mazar that Waters stock is expensive and he responds that
it would have seemed that way two years ago, at a fraction of its
current price. Some others don't seem to be persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly a value,'' said John Borzilleri, a health
care analyst at State Street Management and Research. He said
Waters stock ``was a value play six months ago, but not now.''
Those shares finished Thursday at $79.56, or nearly 70 times
expected 2000 profits.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the question revolves around assumptions about future
business growth. Tongberg, the MFS analyst, believes Waters could
grow revenues 20 to 25 percent a year over the next decade, but it
might happen in surges and lulls.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 cents of every current sales dollar at Waters comes
from ``life science'' customers such as drug and biotech customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's longstanding bread-and-butter business, selling
High Performance Liquid Chromatography instruments, still accounts
for two of every three sales dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the most rapid and closely watched sales growth involves the
company's mass spectrometry instruments used in the fast growing
field of proteomics.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say proteomics, identifying proteins in cells, could
supply information needed for more practical medical products than
gene-sequencing genomics. Complex proteins command bodily functions
and the vast majority of all drugs work by interacting with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing belief that proteomics can be bigger than
genomics,'' said Mazar. ``Proteomics should tell you a lot more
about disease states than genomics.''
</P>
<P>
   Basic mass spectrometry instruments may run $150,000, but a
complete system involving sophsticated computer hardware and
software, capable of analyzing thousands of proteins in a blood or
tissue sample, can cost nearly $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers spend about $100 million a year on instruments used
in proteomics, but some aggressive estimates believe that figure
could grow to $1 billion. Waters is not alone in that field, but
counts itself among a group of leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Who will produce the breakthrough biotech products of the future
remains an investor's crap shoot, but every competitor will need to
buy the equipment to try.

   Gabriel!
</P>
<P>
   Yes boss!?!?
</P>
<P>
   Step into my den. We've got a problem.
</P>
<P>
   (Gabriel walks in while God is clicking back and forth between
stations, catching the nightly news on American television).
</P>
<P>
   See these guys, Gabe?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, not again boss (Gabriel lets out a sarcastic yawn). Haven't
you had enough of those guys running for the White House in
America?
</P>
<P>
   Actually I have, Gabe. And that's where you come in.
</P>
<P>
   Uh oh. Umm, boss, you're not thinking about interfering with the
American elections are you? Remember the separation between church
and state and heaven and earth? Besides, we haven't had many
successes lately. Pharmaceuticals are still gouging elders, the
World Wrestling Federation threw me out of the ring, and the
``Survivor'' cast voted me off of the island.
</P>
<P>
   We have no choice, Gabe. Two of these four men are going to run
America. They're all taking my name in, well, if it's not in vain,
it's the wrong vein.
</P>
<P>
   How do you mean, boss?
</P>
<P>
   Over here, you have Al Gore saying that before he makes a
decison he asks, ``What Would Jesus Do?'' Over here (click), you
have Joe Lieberman saying ``As a people, we need to reaffirm our
faith and renew the dedication of our nation and ourselves to God
and God's purpose.'' Over here (click), George Bush says Jesus is
his favorite philosopher, proclaims a ``Jesus Day'' in Texas and
says, ``Our nation is chosen by God and commissioned by history to
be a model to the world of justice and inclusion and diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with that, boss? Wouldn't we want a man of faith to
lead the country instead of Jesse Ventura?
</P>
<P>
   Haven't I gotten this through your head after 14 billion years,
Gabe? There is a thin line between faith and fad.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute boss, are you saying they're fakes?
</P>
<P>
   No Gabe, it's just that I am not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   How's that boss?
</P>
<P>
   You see Gabe, these guys talk a good game about God, but
frankly, they sometimes behave more like Jim and Tammy Bakker and
Rev. Ike. Over here, you have Bush born wealthy, born with
connections, then talking about how he pulled himself up by his
bootstraps. Then instead of spending his own money, he passed the
offering plate to get the middle class and the poor to build a new
baseball stadium that exponentially increased his holdings in the
Texas Rangers. That's not my idea of tithing.
</P>
<P>
   Over here you have Lieberman who says the United States is ``the
most religious country in the world,'' yet sometimes it seems he
has two Gods, me and G-ood O-ld D-ollars. He takes all kinds of
campaign contributions from people who gouge and even hurt the
middle class and the poor. He never met a pharmaceutical maker,
insurance company, or defense contractor he didn't like. As head of
the Democratic Leadership Council, he took money, lots of money,
from Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   I think I get your point, boss.
</P>
<P>
   That's right Gabe. Concerned that my memory may not be as sharp
as it used to be after 14 billion years, I just did an Internet
search, but I was right. As much as I tried, I could not find
anything that said ``On the fourth day, God created cigarettes and
publically-funded baseball stadiums.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do we do, Lord?
</P>
<P>
   Suit up, Gabe. We'll get you a press pass. You'll cover both
presidential campaigns. Everytime Gore talks about what Jesus will
do, you raise your hand and ask, ``Mr. Vice President, do you ask
that when you are looking over your Occidental stocks?''
</P>
<P>
   Every time Bush says that Jesus Christ is his philosopher, ask,
``Governor, you believe in the death penalty. How does that square
with Jesus's philosophy of forgiving all sins?'' Every time Bush
says our nation is chosen by God to be a model to the world of
justice, ask him how God would have thought about Texas being the
nation's leading incarcerator.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Lieberman urges Americans to reaffirm their faith and
``renew the dedication of our nation and ourselves to God and God's
purpose,'' I want you to burst up to the front of the pack and get
straight to the point and ask, ``Senator, is it God's purpose that
drug companies can make the world's highest margins of profits for
any industry while people are sick and diseased? And I have a
followup. Is it also God's purpose for you or the organizations
that you lead to take money from industries that produce cancer and
heart disease?''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you say, Lord. But I have one question.
</P>
<P>
   What's that, Gabe.
</P>
<P>
   If I ask those kinds of questions, I will probably draw
attention to myself. Who do I say I work for?
</P>
<P>
   That's easy, Gabe. Just tell them you work for NPR, National
Purgatory Radio. If they are really men of faith, that will get
their attention.

MASSACHUSETTS WORST IN DRUG USE, SURVEY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Massachusetts residents in every age group had
among the highest levels of illegal drug use last year, making it
the only one of the 50 states to show such an across-the-board
pattern, according to a first-ever, state-by-state survey of drug
abuse released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing an embarrassing blow to state officials _ and perhaps
silencing those who believed that drugs were not a problem in their
backyard _ the report's estimates revealed several glaring problems
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The state had the highest percentage in the nation in several
categories: 12- to 17-year-olds addicted to illegal drugs as well
as alcohol; 18- to 25-year-olds using marijuana in the past month;
18- to 25-year-olds using any illicit drugs in the past month; and
26 years or older taking any illegal drug other than marijuana. It
was based on a series of door-to-door surveys taken throughout
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Statisticians who oversaw the study cautioned that the states'
numbers were often so close together that it was more accurate to
look at groupings of fifths to discern trends. Even if the rankings
were discarded, however, Massachusetts was still spotlighted as a
center of drug use and excessive drinking.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier regional studies of drug use, the Northeast and the
West have consistently led the nation as centers of drug commerce
because their urban areas offered higher numbers of users and each
had multiple points of entry for traffickers. The benefit of the
state-by-state survey was to zero in on each region's zones of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come to hold states accountable for drug policy.
If drug policy nationally is going to succeed, it's going to
require the strong participation of state and local government,''
said John T. Carnevale, a drug policy consultant who recently left
a senior position in the US drug czar's office.
</P>
<P>
   Carnevale said the study provides valuable baseline data for
states, but he added that ``the issue is not where you are, but
what you are going to do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings, contained in a nationwide household survey of drug
abuse, are sure to spark new discussion about how Massachusetts and
the rest of New England should tackle drug abuse. Many will
advocate more money for treatment; others will argue for reforms in
the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the evidence of high use, but we also have the
evidence that treatment works, and so it seems to me that we need
to have more treatment available to people,'' said Brian J.
Sylvester, southeast regional manager for the state's Bureau of
Substance Abuse Services.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Massachusetts, the Northeast's centers of drug
activity included New Hampshire and Vermont showing high rates of
binge drinking among 18- to 25-year olds; and New Hampshire, Rhode
Island, and Connecticut landing in the top fifth of young people
using any illicit drugs in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   And every New England state was in the highest ranks of
marijuana use among 18- to 25-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' numbers were ``disappointing, but it doesn't
shock me,'' said Thomas W. Clark, research associate at Health and
Addictions Research, a non-profit group that conducts drug-use
research for Massachusetts. ``There are some hypotheses, such as
maybe we have more liberal attitudes about substance abuse, but we
don't have the protection that the South does with its religious
influence, where religion is showed to be more of a protective
factor'' against drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Roseanne Pawelec, spokeswoman for the state Department of Public
Health, said another factor may be the ``plethora of colleges here
that other states do not have. Kids are coming from across the
country, putting us at somewhat of a disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also examined cigarette use among all ages, and
Massachusetts was ranked in the middle of the states for ages 12 to
25, and lower than most states for those 26 and older.
Massachusetts has conducted one of the most aggressive anti-tobacco
campaigns in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers do not reveal whether the rate of drug and alcohol
use in Massachusetts is going up or down, or the rates of drugs
such as heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, steroids, or psychedelic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide study released in June showed a stabilization of
drug use with the exception of a sharp increase in reports of
ecstasy use. It also reported that heroin has surpassed cocaine as
the street drug of choice, and the use of crack cocaine continues
to decline.
</P>
<P>
   And it showed that by a large margin alcohol remained the most
abused drug for those seeking treatment in state-funded programs,
as 60 percent said they drank in the month before seeking help.
Thirty-four percent admitted using heroin and 29 percent said they
used powder or crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The national survey released Thursday was conducted with the use
of laptop computers equipped with headphones. Respondents privately
listened to questions and then entered answers into the computer.
</P>
<P>
   About 67,000 people nationwide participated in the study. In
Massachusetts, between 700 and 1,000 people were surveyed, the
respondents chosen after statisticians broke down the state into 12
regions and then picked a specific number from each area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people were spread all through Massachusetts. It's
representative of Massachusetts,'' said Douglas A. Wright, a
mathematical statistican for the federal Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration. Wright said the methodology was
peer-reviewed by private statisticians.
</P>
<P>
   Carnevale, the drug policy consultant, said the national survey
was far superior than past household surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Massachusetts had one of the lowest response rates to the
survey in the country. About 62 percent of those questioned at
their door agreed to be interviewed; Connecticut had the lowest
rate with about 59 percent responding, while the highest was
Mississippi with 82 percent agreeing to the interview. ``We're not
exactly sure why some states had a somewhat lower response rate,''
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the Massachusetts drug researcher, also cautioned that
the numbers of respondents were relatively small, compared to his
organization's studies that typically include 3,000 to 4,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other drug policy analysts in Massachusetts didn't
dispute the finding that drug use in the state was among the
highest in the nation. One drug study now being finalized appears
to show that ``Massachusetts has done better than the nation in
terms of trends of drug use going down, but overall the rates are
still on the higher end,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, drug use declined for the second straight year among
teens to 9 percent from 9.9 percent last year, although it was not
a statistically significant drop.
</P>
<P>
   Donna E. Shalala, Department of Health and Human Services
secretary, and Barry R. McCaffrey, the nation's drug czar,
trumpeted the decline in drug use from a 1997 high of 11.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the numbers of youths taking illegal drugs today are
statistically similiar to 1996, the year that McCaffrey took over
his position and the year that he uses as the internal benchmark to
judge his office's performance. Also, the two Cabinet members
noted, illegal drug use among all ages remained about the same last
year from the year before.

   In ``Psycho Beach Party,'' Norman Bates meets Gidget. It's a
cheeky little pop tart that somehow does campy, cockeyed, cartoony
justice to both of its sources and will leave you smiling at its
genial outrageousness. One doesn't think of Alfred Hitchcock as a
sand-in-his shoes type, but the big kahuna of suspense is given
some mischievous spin here, while Sandra Dee's squeaky-clean Gidget
is stood on her golden pony-tailed head. Lauren Ambrose's surfer
girl, Chicklet, is a beach party hoot when ``Vertigo''-like circles
hypnotize her into a couple of multiple personalities with attitude
and a very possibly lethal mean streak.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latter that appeals to Thomas Gibson's surfing dude,
Kanaka. He's perpetually ready to forgo his surfboard if it means
he can be on the receiving end of some S &AMP; M, but then much of the
appeal of ``Psycho Beach Party'' lies in its subversion of movie
icons. The muscled, mindless surfers, for instance, are too dumb to
notice that they're homosexual, and that one reason they're against
having girls join their gang is that females would be utterly
superfluous. Charles Busch, who wrote the stage play on which the
film is based (it's been running for years in San Francisco), knows
his way around gay icons and juggles them smartly.
</P>
<P>
   Busch himself plays a very butch cop investigating the ongoing
killings about which Chicklet, schizophrenic tomboy that she is,
may know more than she realizes. Moms come in for more than a bit
of ribbing. The straighter they are, the more Busch twists the
knife. He's aided no end by the timing of Beth Broderick as
Chicklet's conventional mom, and Kimberley Davies as the B-movie
queen renting a haunted beach house to escape the rigors of filming
such items as ``Tarantula Queen of Hoboken.'' In fact, the women
have it all over the surfing dudes when it comes to sheer
over-the-topness, although Matt Keeslar's Swedish exchange student
doesn't go down without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   From its blatantly back-projected waves to its drive-in
cheesiness to its climactic oceanside luau, ``Psycho Beach Party''
is more light-handed than its caricaturing of various beach-blanket
bimbos makes immediately apparent. Robert Lee King's direction
offers noticeably less wattage than Busch's savvier, more sharply
focused writing. Still, ``Psycho Beach Party'' aims to win you over
rather than bowl you over, and it succeeds with flamboyant aplomb.
At many points, the film's fun and games with the demon butcher of
Malibu Beach are more entertaining than the stuff it's parodying.
Annette and Frankie never had it so bad. Or ever realized that mere
surf could be so thick with sexual subtexts.

   LEXINGTON, Mass. _ While an estimated 200 Raytheon Co. strikers
rallied on Lexington Green Thursday, Charlene Palmer stood among
them, holding a cigarette, a sign, and a lot of anger.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old tester and trouble-shooter, a member of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1505, views
the strike that caused 2,700 members to take to the streets Sunday
as an all-out push to save her union's dwindling ranks and add more
top-of-the-line manufacturing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In Palmer's eyes, white-collar employment at Raytheon has
surged, but there seems to be less need for veteran plant people
like herself. ``We were the ones who worked around the clock,'' she
said bitterly. ``We were the ones who built this company. Our
generation of workers was taught about quality of work. Now, we've
got a lot of managers that don't even know what they're building. .
. . All these new people want is a quick dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon spokesman David Polk denied that the company values its
longtime manufacturing workers less, but stressed that the industry
has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an increase in the need for software and chip
technology and a corresponding decline in hardware,'' he said.
``That is why we need more engineers, particularly software
engineers and the like.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that factor, corporate America's increased reliance on
white-collar engineering, technical and service staff, and a
corresponding push to subcontract manufacturing jobs or move them
to lower-cost states or countries, that has unions like Local 1505
up in arms.
</P>
<P>
   For these workers, as for the 85,000 telephone employees who
struck Verizon Communications on Aug. 6, a key sticking point
between management and labor in the new economy is job security and
the future of work among a group of employees who have come to the
painful realization they can be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Raytheon is not the only company in the state that
has slashed jobs. But to Charlene Palmer and many others who
protested Thursday just a few miles from Raytheon headquarters in
affluent Lexington, the qualities that used to matter _ seniority,
loyalty, and continuity _ don't seem to count anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Polk, meanwhile, points to the company's final contract offer as
proof that the company values its veteran plant workers as much as
its new engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we assaulting our employees with a 14.7 percent wage
increase over the life of a four-year contract?'' he asked. ``Are
we assaulting them with a $1,500 contract bonus to help offset the
escalating cost of health care premiums? Are we assaulting them
with an improved pension formula?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there are roughly 13,000 Raytheon employees in
Massachusetts, and only 3,000 are represented by the union,'' Polk
continued. ``That is a fact. The other 10,000 are engineers,
technologists, and administrative people. . . . Obviously, there
has been a change in the employment profile, not only in our
industry, but also in our region.''
</P>
<P>
   That trend has spread far beyond Raytheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost 30,000 manufacturing jobs in this state since
1995, and Raytheon is only a part of that,'' said state Senator
Susan Fargo, a Democrat whose district includes Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   Fargo told The Boston Globe this week that Raytheon's lobbyist,
Dennis G. Austin, has told her in the past that she should be most
concerned about the company's white-collar employees, particularly
those from her western suburban district.
</P>
<P>
   But, Fargo said, ``I support the strike. These people have been
worked over.''
</P>
<P>
   Polk maintains that the union, whose membership has declined
from a high of about 10,000 in the early 1990s to 2,700 today,
could see a net increase of 75 manufacturing jobs in Massachusetts
at the end of the year as a result of the consolidation of
facilities at Raytheon, Hughes Aircraft Co., and Texas Instruments.
But that's not enough of an increase to appease the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 18 months, 439 union jobs have been transferred
out of the state, and 514 were brought into Massachusetts. Since
1998, the union has lost about 1,000 jobs because of business
divestitures, program delays, and reductions in volume, said Polk.
Those numbers do not account for the deep losses that occurred in
prior years when the company, rocked by changes in the defense
industry, began eliminating jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``High technology mandates that the process of making high-tech
and low-tech products requires more advanced training,'' said Brian
Gilmore, executive vice president of Associated Industries of
Massachusetts, which represents about 5,000 companies. ``So, what
we are seeing is part of the restructuring of the defense industry.
That sector has been very hard hit.''
</P>
<P>
   That's no consolation to union members.
</P>
<P>
   They can't forget that in 1995, after referring to the high cost
of doing business in Massachusetts, company executives said
Raytheon would have to look at moving its 17,000-employee defense
electronics division out of the state if it could not cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   The union, fearing job losses, agreed to wage freezes and job
restructurings. Then, the Legislature granted the company's request
for a change in the state's corporate tax structure. At the time,
researchers estimated that the change would save the company $21
million a year in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, union workers who backed the measure because they thought
it would mean job security and retention are angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, we gave them work-rule changes,'' recalled IBEW Local
1505's president, Stanley Lichwala. ``We had more than 420
different job classifications, and we agreed to reduce them to 40.
We gave them modified work weeks, we gave them a wage freeze, and
we asked for and got training. Now, we're overstaffed with support
people and managers making $75,000 and $100,000 a year but they
don't want to cut managers. . . . It's ridiculous.''

INDIANS REJUVENATED BY REINFORCEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ From the bleach-blond hair and pierced tongue
of David Segui to a smiling Manny Ramirez in uniform to long looks
at pagers that relay out-of-town scores, there is nothing subtle
about the signs of change in the Cleveland clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Segui represents the five players acquired at the trading
deadline to bolster Cleveland's playoff chances. Ramirez ready to
play symbolizes the Indians' return to health. The attention to
other American League scores serves as a reminder of the tight
wild-card race the Indians are trying to win, finding themselves
facing stiff competition for a postseason berth for the first time
since 1959.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the familiar Tribe of the recent past. The team that
collapsed in the 1999 American League Division Series and last
faced Boston at the beginning of June has reinvented itself,
overcoming adversity and working toward a postseason berth that's
not assured for the first time in six seasons. Although the Indians
have comfortably won the Central Division since 1995, the Chicago
White Sox appear poised to take that title. Cleveland finds itself
contending for the wild card against Boston, Oakland, Anaheim, and
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing start triggered by injuries left the team
trailing Chicago by 10 1/2 games at the All-Star break, Cleveland
restocked its roster just before the trading deadline,
rehabilitated injured players, and reemerged in the playoff
picture. By putting an 18-28 midsummer skid behind them and playing
well throughout August, the Indians take a 1-game wild-card lead
over Boston into September. The Red Sox and Indians face each other
eight times this month, including two doubleheaders. The contests
should prove crucial in determining the AL wild-card
representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been difficult, but we've battled through it,'' said Jim
Thome, who's batting .324 in the second half with nine home runs
and 26 RBIs in 42 games. ``I think the way we've come back tells
about our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Indians are on a hot streak. Cleveland has won 18
of its last 26 games, posting a .692 (18-8) winning percentage
since Aug. 2 and gaining 3 1/2 games on Chicago since the break.
The Indians are quick to credit late-season moves and a more
regular, injury-free lineup for the surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things weren't going right for us and we were playing flat
before the trades. Something was needed to get things going,'' said
Omar Vizquel, who has hit in 50 of his last 64 games and owns a
.285 batting average. ``(Wil) Cordero and Segui are going to move
things around. They were pretty good additions. The pitching was
the big question mark. (Jason) Bere, (Steve) Woodard, and (Bob)
Wickman are a good trio for helping the team win. Manny coming back
at the right time helped, too. We've been playing pretty good
baseball the last couple of weeks, and it's just by getting
everything together. Everybody here knows how important these games
are.''
</P>
<P>
   A chain reaction of deals involving the Indians actually started
June 29, when Cleveland sent outfielder David Justice to the
Yankees for Ricky Ledee and two players to be named. Moving Justice
freed payroll room ($18 million for the rest of this season and the
next two) and made future trades by general manager John Hart
easier to accomplish. Hart saved his big moves for the days leading
up to the July 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   On July 28, the general manager traded Ledee to Texas for Segui,
who is signed only through 2000, which shows Hart is not looking
past the current playoff race. Cleveland acquired Milwaukee closer
Wickman and starters Bere and Woodard in exchange for power hitter
Richie Sexson, young pitchers Paul Rigdon and Kane Davis, and a
player to be named. After leaving as a free agent last winter,
Cordero returned to the Indians in a deal that sent infielder
Enrique Wilson and outfielder Alex Ramirez to the Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest keys to this whole year has been the loss
of Richie Sexson, who was one of our real good prospects,'' said
relief pitcher Paul Shuey. ``But we needed the pitching we got in
that trade. We got three seasoned veterans in that trade, and
they're helping us win now. That's a huge key to us . . . And with
the trades to get Segui and Cordero, it's a totally different
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The deadline deals helped, but the return of valuable, injured
players also gave Cleveland strength. Excluding the long-term
ailments and rehabilitation efforts of starting pitchers Jaret
Wright and Charles Nagy, the Indians are now essentially healthy.
But at different points during the season, catcher Sandy Alomar,
Shuey, Lofton, and Ramirez spent significant time on the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   After a period of adjustment that involved veteran Cleveland
players showing particular disappointment with the organization for
trading away 25-year-old Sexson (31 home runs, 116 RBIs in 1999),
the old, new, and recovered have blended into a potent mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting Manny back and the players we got (through trades) is
still growing on our team,'' said manager Charlie Manuel, who has
also returned to health after two intestinal surgeries. ``We're
settling down and starting to play. At least, I'm hoping it's that
way. It's just the way the modern-day players are. I think they
were looking to see exactly how these guys were going to help us.
Now, they're really getting to know one another. I like the way
things are coming together.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui and Cordero provide the contact hitting Cleveland needed
in the middle of the lineup. By supplying consistent hitting at
usually the fifth, sixth, or seventh spot, the pair have made
Manuel's job easier, giving the manager more options for moving men
along the basepaths. Since the two players were acquired, the
Indians' strikeouts per game have declined from 7.1 to 5.1. The
club's on-base percentage has improved from .356 to .364, which
ranks first in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   If consistency down the stretch helps produce wild-card winners,
Segui and Cordero should become more valuable during September.
Already, Segui has hit safely in 26 of 29 games he has appeared in
for Cleveland, including his fifth career grand slam July 30 at
Baltimore. Through Wednesday, he was batting .342 for Cleveland
with four home runs and 21 RBIs. With Segui the active leader in
career fielding percentage (.996, through Wednesday) at first base,
it doesn't hurt to have him play the infield, either. In 30 games
with the Indians, Cordero is currently batting .269. Over his last
19 games through Wednesday, he was hitting .295 with 11 runs scored
and 11 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a team that has the talent to win,'' said
Segui. ``If we just play like we're capable of playing, we'll give
ourselves a real good chance (at the wild-card spot). The problem
this team had was doing it on a consistent basis. Anybody can play
well for streaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Add the talents of Segui and Cordero to a healthy cleanup hitter
(Ramirez) and the offensive potential becomes impressive, without
even mentioning Thome, Vizquel, or Roberto Alomar. Although Ramirez
was not the only player hurt, his absence in the lineup was most
sorely missed. A lingering injury to his left hamstring kept
Ramirez out of the lineup from May 30 until July 13. The Indians
went 19-20 without him. Since returning from the disabled list,
Ramirez batted .365 (50 for 137) with 14 home runs, 40 RBIs in his
first 38 games, not including Thursday night. The Indians have gone
27-18 with him off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries forced Manuel to take desperate measures with his
staff. Early in the season, it was nearly impossible for the
manager to get through the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   After going on and off the disabled list a couple times, Wright
had season-ending right shoulder surgery in mid-August. Nagy is on
a rehabilitation assignment after surgery for loose bodies in his
right elbow. Key pitchers Bartolo Colon, Ricardo Rincon, and Shuey
also made appearances on the disabled list. In their absences,
Cleveland used 26 pitchers in the first half, tying a team record.
In the process, 14 unprepared minor leaguers were called up and
instability set in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were asking too many minor league pitchers to perform to
the level of a veteran pitching staff,'' said catcher Alomar. ``You
can't ask a rookie to do the job of a veteran. It's impossible. We
were putting a lot of pressure on them, so they got some veteran
pitchers who have been in this type of situation before.''
</P>
<P>
   The revolving door finally stopped spinning in July. The
additions of Bere, Woodard, and Wickman provided the experienced
pitching that had been missing. Since arriving in Cleveland, Bere
has posted a 4-2 record and a 5.59 ERA in seven starts. Woodard
owns a 1-2 record with a 5.72 ERA after picking up his first win
for Cleveland Tuesday night against Texas. Wickman has eight saves
in 10 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the players know we came here trying to fit in, but
the only way to fit in is to go out and do your job and be
aggressive and competitive,'' said Bere, who lives in North
Andover. ``This type of team scores a lot of runs, so as a starting
pitcher your job is just to try to go out there, eat up some
quality innings, and get deep into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The return of Shuey in late June after a monthlong leave gave
Manuel a much-needed setup man. Since coming back, Shuey has
allowed just 11 runs over 25 innings over 26 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, this is the best shot we've had to be
strong going into the playoffs,'' said Shuey. ``I like the
situation we're in because if we do get to the playoffs we'll have
to be hot to get there. In the past, that hasn't been the case. If
we're hot and get in there, there's a good chance we'll do
something in the playoffs.''

`TIC CODE' REVEALS REAL FEELINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
THE TIC CODE 
Directed by: Gary Winick 
Screenplay by: Polly Draper 
Starring: Gregory Hines, Christopher George Marquette, Draper 
Running time: 91 minutes 
Rated: R 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its soft, muted, heartfelt way, ``The Tic Code'' is about as
far away from Hollywood assembly line thinking as American movies
get. It's got more genuine-seeming feelings and a more accurate
take on its particular corner of the world than a coliseum of
summer blockbusters. All you need to know about how right it goes
is that two of its three main characters have Tourette's syndrome,
yet it never seems like a disease movie. It stays an affecting,
naturalistically-textured study of a single mom, her precocious
son, a saxophonist, and the closeness of all three to the world of
jazz, which is inscribed with rare, unforced rightness.
</P>
<P>
   The script is by Polly Walker, who also stars as the mother,
Laura, who conveniently avoids her own issues by focusing on the
needs of her 12-year-old son, Miles. Blaming himself for the
breakup of his parents' marriage, he's still emotionally bruised
after having been abandoned by his jazz pianist father, who
couldn't handle the boy's neurological disorder. Miles may even
have surpassed his father as a keyboard prodigy. Yet one of the
admirable things about the script, based in part on the experiences
of Draper's jazz musician husband, Michael Wolff, is that it
doesn't present Tourette's as the obstacle you might assume it
would be to Miles' music-making.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the film presents Miles' improvisational freedom as the
other side of the same coin of an inability to control his every
move that marks Tourette's syndrome. Not that Miles, habitually
mortified by the involuntary movements he can't control, sees
Tourette's as a blessing. Christopher George Marquette delivers an
arresting and heartbreaking performance as the conflicted prodigy,
trying not to be derailed by the torrents of feeling inside him,
encouraged, yet cautioned by the example of Gregory Hines'
similarly afflicted and even more conflicted saxophonist, Tyrone,
who refuses to talk about his Tourette's and is sitting on a lot of
anger connected to it.
</P>
<P>
   No small part of the film is set in the venerable Village
Vanguard nightclub, where the jazz interludes (supervised by Wolff)
have a rightness and unforced authority virtually unknown in film.
One of the film's peaks comes when Miles, initially too overwound
to speak to the older musician, returns for an improvised jazz duet
that pulses with the give and take of the real thing. The
personalized immediacy and handmade craftsmanship of ``The Tic
Code'' are qualities that attract actors, which is why such
seasoned pros as Camryn Manheim, Tony Shalhoub, Carol Kane, Bill
Nunn, and Fisher Stevens can be seen in smaller roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tic Code'' is not without rough technical patches, and a
forced melodramatic resolution, the only wrong note in a film
that's otherwise enticingly musical in its own right, with subtle
tonalities and intertwining melodic lines that include a deepening,
if problematic, romance between Laura and Tyrone. Draper does an
impressive job of avoiding the inspirational cliches lying like
undetonated land mines in a film of this sort. She even attunes us
to the dynamic of art and its sources more than films that speak
about them overtly, usually in banalities. Ever since his
underrated ``Sweet Nothing,'' one of the best movies ever made
about the effects of drug addiction on a working-class family, I've
been waiting to see what director Gary Winick would come up with
next. ``The Tic Code'' confirms his early promise. A lot more than
money was invested in this film, and it shows.

THE MAN WITH THE SONGS IN HIS HEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Be careful what you say to Dwight Yoakam, because you might end
up in a song. Yoakam, a hard-driving country-rock singer, is one of
those people who has music constantly running through his head. The
slightest conversation might spark a fresh song lyric or melody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I communicate with myself musically all of the time,'' says
Yoakam. ``It's been with me so long that I realized the last couple
of years that I had almost come to ignore it on a daily basis. In
other words, I have musical thoughts based off of conversations
that I'll be having. I'll just walk away and I'll hear something. I
think in musical, melodic terms, and I have all my life. So what I
started doing was making myself get to the nearest tape recorder _
I keep several of them around _ and capture that musical thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam has captured enough of those thoughts to become a
Grammy-winning singer whose music has an earthy reality completely
missing from many of today's faux cowboy acts.
</P>
<P>
   From his first album, ``Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc.,'' in 1984, to
his latest, ``dwightyoakamacoustic.net'' (featuring sparkling solo
versions of many of his hits), Yoakam has carved a path as real as
the Bakersfield soil that affected his main influences _ Buck Owens
and Merle Haggard _ though he's also been influenced by
tougher-than-nails rock bands like the Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam's ability to fashion music out of everyday life _ through
such hits as ``Ain't That Lonely Yet,'' ``A Thousand Miles From
Nowhere'' and ``Try Not to Look So Pretty'' _ puts him in an ideal
position to maintain a recording career at the same time as he's
trying to build an acting profile.
</P>
<P>
   His acting reached new heights a few years ago in ``Sling
Blade'' (in which Yoakam played a menacing, abusive husband) and
will come around again in ``South of Heaven, West of Hell,'' due
for release next year. It's a ``gothic Western set in 1907,'' says
Yoakam, who wrote, directed, and starred in it.
</P>
<P>
   While finishing the film earlier this year, Yoakam was still
able to write songs on the set _ thanks to having a trusty tape
recorder nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do both, because I've learned to integrate them,'' he
says. ``Music is something that is so a part of my innate makeup
that I just have to keep myself alert to it. And it enabled me to
be finishing the film while writing and recording simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really write when I'm on the road touring. But I can
write when I'm on a movie set,'' he adds with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   While on the set for ``South of Heaven,'' Yoakam finished tunes
that will come out on a new CD, ``Tomorrow's Sounds Today,'' next
month. Unfortunately, the album hasn't been released to coincide
with his current 80-city tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's appropriate that the album is called `Tomorrow's Sounds
Today,' because that's what we find ourselves doing. We're playing
five tracks from it, even though it's not yet out,'' he says with
another chuckle, though a less hearty one this time.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote one of the songs with idol Buck Owens _ the first time
the two have collaborated. It's called ``Sad Side of Town'' and is
also part of the song list for the tour. The collaboration stemmed
from playing a New Year's Eve gig last winter with Owens in
Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sitting in his dressing room and he played a bit of a
melody,'' Yoakam recalls. ``To me it sounded like classic Buck. It
was a great two-beat idea and I knew I wanted to write something
for it. So we got back together a couple of months later and worked
it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam isn't sure how country radio will receive it, but that
has not deterred him in the past. The Kentucky native is a career
artist who writes from the heart rather than for the corporate
suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that radio will play it,'' he says of the
forthcoming album. ``But, in all honesty, I'm not sure where we fit
in the larger picture of country music. Country music is in flux
right now, but I do think the music I recorded, and continue to
record, is still valid and pertinent.''
</P>
<P>
   To the outside world, it seems as if men in general are having a
tougher time getting played on country radio, thanks to the female
invasion led by the likes of Shania Twain, Jo Dee Messina, and the
Dixie Chicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it ebbs and flows,'' says Yoakam. ``There also are
times when it's all men. There are moments when you couldn't get
female artists played, or when female artists wouldn't sell. But
it's not something you can worry about all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   His next studio CD will be his eighth in the last 16 years, says
Yoakam, who is happy to have a loyal fan base that will drive miles
to appreciate his tradition-influenced but modern-sounding music
courtesy of producer Pete Anderson, who is also his tour guitarist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first few years that we did this,'' Yoakam says, ``I felt
we were still introducing ourselves to the audience on some level.
Whereas now, it's as if we're coming back to see friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoakam gave those friends a special gift in the acoustic
double-CD, ``dwightyoakamacoustic.net.'' It grew out of a segment
in his shows when he gives his band a rest and performs solo. These
moments have been well-received by fans, so it was logical to give
them something more expansive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never abandon making records with my band,'' he says.
``But this album allowed me to revisit the material myself in a
more intimate way. It was coming full circle, but at the same time
it was a discovery of new emotional territory.''
</P>
<P>
   However, don't expect an upsurge of acoustic tunes on the new
tour. Yoakam is still rocking with the band for the most part _ and
``doing the acoustic stuff usually at the end,'' he says.

HAPPY LABOR DAY? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept 3, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Happy Labor Day?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But the words lack the oomph and of, say, ``Happy New
Year'' or ``Happy Fourth.'' The weekend to celebrate work has never
been a ripper.
</P>
<P>
   A more appropriate greeting might be: ``Not-so-bad Labor Day,''
or ``Mezzo-mezzo Monday,'' or ``Here we go, ready or not,'' for in
the calendars of our minds, the work year and the autumn begin on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   We're looking at the first day of school for adults here; never
mind that we were at our desks for most of the summer. Desks in the
summer have an entirely different gestalt. They can be left early
without raising too many eyebrows. Their phones are quieter _ and
just about went dead last week.
</P>
<P>
   People sitting at them dress down, in some cases way down, to
Hawaiian shirts, tank tops, and shorts that will prompt memos next
week restating the limits of casual Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us don't need the memo. We can already feel the
corporate circadian rhythms pulling us away from pastels and toward
navy and black. Sandals and slides might hang in for a while,
exposing painted toes as a fashion statement in some cubicles, but
the safest career move will be to minimize skin.
</P>
<P>
   Are the people in the big offices back into serious suits? Then
forget the Dockers at the staff meeting. The first day of school
for adults is pretty much like it was in 9th grade, only longer.
Peer pressure rules.
</P>
<P>
   Briefcases will be back, replacing the lighter canvas bags that
people figured were OK for schlepping papers in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of school demands leather, maybe new leather,
although that decision can also be weighted with political
consequences. Is it better to go with the old beat-up satchel,
exuding the confidence of a veteran who doesn't need to care about
high-end accessories? Or should one strive to be flashy and hip,
catching the wave of Euro-chic with something off the shoulder from
Italy?
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day trains the mind on such matters. It's a picnic with
homework, ``celebrating'' the great American gear-shift that forces
people to deal with everything that was so easily put off in June.
</P>
<P>
   Asking for a raise, for instance, is just not a summertime
thing. A person needs to be wearing shoulder pads and be steeped in
the corporate milieu. A person also needs to have the top of the
executive food chain around, because any manager fielding the raise
question before Labor Day will inevitably say, ``Let's deal with
that when everyone's back.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll be back Tuesday, but they'll be in a meeting. When they
come out of the meeting they will have lists of projects, which
means the rest of us will have lists of projects. So the raise
question is probably best saved for Wednesday or Thursday, although
it will occupy the mind tomorrow, or probably today.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day refuses to let people laze. It demands to see the
agenda, starting with work around the house. Spouses often have
lists as long as the project schedule at work. The kids have lists.
The dog and cat need their shots.
</P>
<P>
   None of this seemed pressing in August, or even on Friday's
start of the long weekend. Friday was still summer. But yesterday,
reality moved in with a mop and a paint brush. ``Back to School''
was no longer a concept. It became a broken lunch box and ripped
pants.
</P>
<P>
   It became the folder in the kitchen drawer, jammed with the fine
print of insurance papers, receipts, phone numbers of financial
planners, the form for increasing contributions to the 401(k), and
an article on tax-free municipal bonds _ all saved for a September
mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   Are we there yet? Not quite. We're in transition, ramping up,
and putting summer down. And that's always work.

ORGANIC VS. FIBERGLASS ROOF SHINGLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September   03, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What are the advantages of organic roof shingles over
fiberglass? My roofer is Canadian, and recommends organics.
</P>
<P>
   ED LETTIC, Lancaster and Paxton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First, let's define the terms. The shingles in question are
asphalt, but the organics have a saturated (with asphalt) felt core
covered on both sides with asphalt and small stones for color and
durability. Fiberglass shingles have a core of fiberglass, also
covered with asphalt and stones.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of organics are their durability, resistance to
cracking, and ease of installing. Two brands of fiberglass shingles
have had problems of premature failure. There are a number of
class-action suits against them.
</P>
<P>
   Other brands of fiberglass have not had any problems. One
advantage of fiberglass is that fiberglass shingles have a class A
fire rating, compared to a class C rating for organics, meaning
they are more fire resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Two manufacturers of organic shingles are Canadian: Iko and BP.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I had my house shingled three years ago, and two coats of an
oil stain applied. It peeled in a year. What went wrong and how can
I make sure a new stain won't peel?
</P>
<P>
   ALICE OSTROWSKA, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think that oil stain was a solid stain, and solid stains
are like paint, which create a film on the wood and can peel. It
certainly did, probably due to moisture behind the shingles.
Another possible reason it peeled is that it was put on too
thickly.
</P>
<P>
   The cure is to scrape and sand off that old stuff and apply a
semitransparent stain. It will not peel; well, it has a 95 percent
chance of not peeling, which is a far better chance than the
original stain.
</P>
<P>
   Another good thing about a semitransparent stain is that only
one coat is needed. Then, in five years, when you need another
coat, there is virtually no preparation before putting on the next
coat.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have four wood chairs with seats of black webbing. The
webbing is hard to clean when it gets dirty. Any secret?
</P>
<P>
   WAITING
</P>
<P>
   A. If the webbing is plastic, make a strong solution of Spic and
Span and water. If there is mold on the webbing, add a cup of
bleach. Apply this solution and let it sit on the webbing for
several minutes; then scrub and rinse. If you use bleach, try it on
a small area to make sure it does not bleach out the plastic, but
if it is plastic, this is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   If the webbing is cloth, clean it with upholstery cleaner, just
as you would clean an upholstered chair or sofa.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think I have some mold on my shower curtain, except it is
red and does not come off with a bleach/cleanser. What will work?
</P>
<P>
   CARL DETTMAN, Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The bleach/cleanser is not strong enough. Paint the stains
with a solution of household bleach and water. I had similar red
stains and they came off with bleach. Or, put the curtain in the
washing machine with bleach added. If nothing works, get a new
curtain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house is less than a year old, equipped with a ridge vent
and soffit vents. During cold weather the attic stairs were open to
the attic for several hours. I then noticed a lot of water
developed on the nail points coming through the roof, dripping on
the floor. A few days later there was still moisture, but then the
attic was dry a few days after that. Someone suggested putting in
more vents, or to put in gable vents. What happened? Do I need more
vents?
</P>
<P>
   CLAUDIA COOPER, Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You do not need more vents. What happened is this: Opening
that attic door allowed warm, moist air in the house to flow up
into the attic; there was so much of it that the vents could not
handle it, and the moist air condensed on the cold nail points.
When you closed the attic door, you stopped that air flow, and the
attic dried out.
</P>
<P>
   You do not need more vents, but if the soffit vents are not a
continuous 2- or 3-inch-wide strip, then install one; it will give
better ventilation than a series of rectangular or round vents,
which are usually spaced too far apart to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. After work was done on the house, a lot of dust was left on
the floor and furniture. It is very gritty and heavy, and I don't
want to scratch when I wipe it. What is best to use?
</P>
<P>
   WORRIED
</P>
<P>
   A. Not to worry. Use a Whizzer cloth or other lighty lubricated
dry cloth to wipe off that grit. Or, wipe with a damp cloth and a
light hand. Or, put a tablespoon of cooking oil in a bucket of warm
water, dip a sponge in this concoction, squeeze out, and wipe
lightly. The oil will help pick up the grit, and also will remove
plaster dust, without scratching.

TITANIC TOWN 
Directed by: Roger Michell 
Screenplay by: Anne Devlin (novel: Mary Costello) 
Starring: Julie Walters, Ciaran Hinds, Nuala O'Neill, James
Loughran, Barry Loughran, Elizabeth Donaghy, Ciaran McMenamin,
Aingeal Grehan 
Running time: 102 minutes 
Unrated 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Titanic Town,'' filmed a couple of years ago, just before the
still-fragile Easter Sunday ceasefire in Northern Ireland, rides
the intensity and heartfelt conviction of Julie Walters as a West
Belfast wife and mother radicalized into peace activism. The film
loses little time demystifying its title, and letting the irony
fall where it may, by revealing that the town had been known as the
place where the Titanic was built. When Walters's Bernie McPhelimy
and her family move into a neat little row house in a Catholic
neighborhood in 1972, the place is well along the way to sinking
itself, thanks to the deadly combat between British troops and the
IRA. When Bernie's friend is gunned down in one of the frequent
exchanges of gunfire, she sets her lips in a grim, tight line and
decides to do something.
</P>
<P>
   What she's quite likely to do, explains her ulcer-ridden husband
(Ciaran Hinds), is get herself killed. Sure enough, when she
agitates to at least have the gun duels scheduled for hours when
fewer people are in the streets, each side assumes she's the
other's pawn. When she escalates her efforts and gets thousands of
signatures on a petition, the Brits listen, but a TV reporter edits
the context out of her remarks so that it looks as if she's
condemning the IRA. At first, she's saved by her naivete, although
death threats are forthcoming. As jolting as the bullets tearing
through the neighborhood at any given moment, followed by crudely
invasive house-to-house searches by uniformed troops, is the
matter-of-fact acceptance of death as a daily occurrence by
children who have never known anything different.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Michell's film is not without bursts of savage violence.
But it's at its most devastating when Bernie's youngest daughter
asks her older sister, with horrifying logic, if the latter will
leave her all of her dolls in her will. When the little girl
politely hands a British soldier back the rifle he had laid down
during a search, and the rifles of his comrades are cocked in
jangly unison, your heart stops. Throughout, Bernie's family is
inscribed with idiomatic rightness. Nuala O'Neill is a standout as
the adolescent daughter who trades dolls for first love with Ciaran
McMenamin's newcomer to the troubled neighborhood. Hinds projects
quiet strength in the least showy role, that of Bernie's husband,
and Angeal Grehan helps firm up the drama as the friend who sticks
by Bernie when things get dicey and other more risk-averse
neighbors drop away.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding polemics, and displaying an awreness of the lethal
complexities of the political snarl, Michell makes many of the
film's points with telling details. When a truckful of British
troops is advancing down her street on a search mission, Bernie
tells the kids to make sure the beds are made before the soldiers
enter. Later, when an IRA threat takes the form of a rock tossed
through her window, Bernie displays the rock proudly alongside her
other domestic treasures. When she meets with the British
mucky-mucks, she fumbles in her purse until she locates a list of
IRA conditions she's been asked to relay. Once she does, though,
her voice and gaze are steady. Walters's unswerving command of the
moral force Bernie embodies is the engine that drives the vivid and
all-too-authentic ``Titanic Town.''

Communications, formerly Bell Atlantic, and because of the
elimination of temporary jobs at the Census Bureau. Private-sector
jobs would have grown by 102,000 if not for the Verizon strike. The
unemployment rate rose to 4.1 percent from 4 percent. Factory jobs
fell 79,000, the largest drop since the General Motors strike in

</P>
<P>
   ANTI-CHRONOLOGY (Undated) _ In the art world, antichronology
seems to be the rage. Numerous U.S. museums have re-hung their
painting and sculpture collections according to subject instead of
chronology. The one thing curators seem to agree on about
antichronology is that chronology and time are only the surface
issues. The deeper issue is genealogy: whether there is a great
lineage of art, a natural progression of one art movement after
another leading up to the grand finale, abstraction. By Sarah
Boxer.

Internal Revenue Service $135,000 in federal and state taxes on the
sale of several items in a group of valuable religious relics taken
by a U.S. Army lieutenant while he was stationed in Germany in the
final days of World War II. The artworks, long since returned to
Germany, are part of a group of medieval treasures many of which

 (For release Sunday, September   03, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why do they call it Labor Day when it was designed as Loafing
Day?
</P>
<P>
   It's only the one day out of 365 commemorating the toil of the
sweaty miner, harried waitress, grizzled fisherman, the pliant
people who pick produce and clean hoppers and remake hotel beds,
the horny-handed husbandman and roofers toasted by 98-degree
sojurns applying tar or shingles.
</P>
<P>
   Like the crude rock pile of Stonehenge, Labor Day is a memorial
erected in one era that remains inviolate for a subsequent era that
regards it with more curiosity than comprehension. The cleavage
between working class and middle class that rent Europe for
centuries never took hold here. The mass rallies of Europe's labor
movement, the formation of workers' political parties and socialist
affinity groups of all types, none of those attempts to unite the
workers of the world really caught on for long here.
</P>
<P>
   In the present mature stages of the longest economic expansion
on record, workers are employed at near-record levels (96 percent),
even the Republicans in Congress are conceding ground on the
question of raising the minimum wage over six bucks an hour, and
prosperity is so widespread among the top four-fifths of households
that the presidential race hinges on symbolic issues labeled
``family values'' and ``morality'' and which ticket can appear more
devout, more domestic, more ``faith-based.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? You win national elections in this country by appealing to
the middle. You can have subtle gravitation to right or to left,
you can have sly tricks up your sleeve or harbor private intent to
reward one interest or punish another. But you have to appear to be
on the side of the little guy and the little gal, the humble worker
and said humble worker's near-and-dear ones.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the Republicans' tax cut schemes, or the Democrats'
prescription drug subsidies, are pitched in such a way as to cleave
the undecided bloc in favor of the aforesaid. Human nature being
what it is, we tend to divide ourselves by what we have and what we
want.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are the party of the well-off and those who wish
to be, plus those who suspect or resent the government in all or
some of its aspects, i.e. making laws about guns, banning school
prayer, enforcing tax levies. The Democrats have a wider potential
base, but a narrower participation rate. The Dems have their
well-heeled or muscular adherents _ trial lawyers, unions,
minorities, the less-well-off, and the Great Unwashed, who require
more in the nature of government aid than the business go-getter
types.
</P>
<P>
   Every presidential contest hinges on which party swipes most of
the middle, the 10 to 20 percent of moderate, perhaps only
mildly-interested folks. When only half the potential voters 18 and
over actually vote, the contest becomes an intricate game of
discouraging the other side's turnout and maximizing yours, in the
five or 10 states from New Jersey over to Michigan that typically
decide close elections.
</P>
<P>
   FDR saved capitalism from itself in the Great Depression. The
aristocratic democrat, also a Democrat, became the greatest
president of the 20th century because he faced down the most
daunting challenges: the enemies within, depression and national
demoralization, then the enemies without, in the great war against
facism. But the South that was solidly Democratic in FDR's four
terms turned its back on the national Democrats over civil rights
and the gradual empowerment of black American voters.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, Reagan, and Bush the Elder cozied up to white Southerners
and stroked their desires. Jimmy Carter once and Bill Clinton twice
proved that a Southern moderate Democrat could reclaim some
electoral votes below the Mason-Dixon line. Each quadrennial Labor
Day ushers in the Olympics and then the presidential election. The
flag-waving commercialized by the sponsoring Olympic network and
its sponsoring sponsors prepares us for the blather and bluster and
blatherskiting of the election. Chest-beating, podium-pounding,
baby-bussing, sabre-rattling and crow-eating are rampant.
</P>
<P>
   It's all for the benefit of the undecided voter, presumed to
follow her or his inclination as to which choice is in her or his
best interest. Slicing the undecided voter pie is a matter of
careful calibration. Is the household of Mr. and Mrs. Undecided
earning more, but working longer hours? Does day care outweigh gun
ownership at that address? Is it the estate tax, or the co-pay on
Granny's meds the cutting issue?
</P>
<P>
   Never has a politician addressed the problem of the worker more
succinctly than in the story Ted Kennedy tells of his first Senate
race, in the 1962 primary against Eddie McCormack, who had
scornfully said young Ted ``had never worked a day in your life.''
As Kennedy tells it, he ran into a longshoreman next morning who
pumped his hand, reminded Kennedy of the McCormack jibe, and said,
``Kid, you haven't missed a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not till the last burger has been broiled, the last potato chip
crunched, the last diet soda inhaled, will the attention of the
great glob of undecideds turn to the decision of the first Tuesday
in November. Most Americans haven't been paying attention. Slowly,
with a sigh, they'll start perusing the papers and the news with
more attentiveness. The deebates will sharpen the choice.
</P>
<P>
   The polls point to a close contest. The needle will swing back
and forth. The scale can be tipped by the flightiest breeze. A
ridiculous gaffe, an unimagined event, a foreign crisis, a ghost
from the past, almost anything can tip the outcome. The Republican
says America has gotten worse since his daddy was minding the
store, the military is falling apart, government is screwed up. The
Democrat says there have never been better economic times, the
United States leads the planet like never before, and the other guy
would wreck this good thing we have going here.
</P>
<P>
   The undecided voters? They say, ``Can I have a little more
barbecue sauce on that little baby?'' This is why Labor Day is more
like the Fourth of July than Christmas or New Year's: It testifies
to the power of the people to wrest from the powerful interest
groups, the bosses, a long weekend, a paid holiday, a chance to
savor the end of summer. And it ushers in the climax of
choosing-up-sides that determines how we'll be governed for the
next four years.

hoping for some coattail momentum to help boost his name
recognition after having not been on the ballot for 14 years. But

   POLITICS-AD Republicans see no double-standard in play because
in 1996 they assailed Clinton for writing Democratic ``issues'' ads
in the White House while now Bush signs off on Republican ``soft

power over what they may or may not say about the Gore campaign.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ While some of the American educational reforms
were changed after Allied occupation forces left Japan in 1952,
most of the American-imposed reforms stayed in place and were
responsible for Japan's meteoric postwar rise to international
economic power. Now Japanese school children routinely wipe the

   LATHAM-COLUMN _ MARSHALL, Texas _ I was born at high noon 46
years ago, back in the days when the opening day of dove season
began at high noon on the Friday of Labor Day weekend. The day, as
I understand it, my birthday was Friday. So my father was pacing,
pacing, pacing outside the labor room and I'm thinking it was every

Who wins the presidential election may well be decided by who wins
the debates. But right now, more important than that, is the debate
about the debates. Al Gore's people want it to be the classic

   GA-ECONOMY _ An exhaustive study by a Washington, D.C. think
tank shows that Georgia outpaced the nation in jobs and wage growth
during the 1990s. But the state's economic boom wasn't reflected in
most workers' paychecks. Georgia's median wage of $11.31 an hour is
56 cents lower than the nation. ``The economy in Georgia is
growing,'' said one of the authors of the Economic Policy
Institute's 450-page tome ``The State of Working America. ``But
it's not necessarily transferring to big gains for workers at the
middle or the bottom.'' One in seven Georgians lives in poverty and
nearly 30 percent of the jobs in Georgia pay less than the wages
needed to lift a family of four out of poverty. Other key findings:
Americans are paying a high price for prosperity.We're making more
money and wracking up loads of overtime and debt in the process.

   DELTA-PILOTS _ The new pilot contract at United could cost
Atlanta-based Delta a bundle. That's because it appears to include
unusually hefty pay raises, which United was under pressure to pay
because of service woes. Delta pilots have been in talks for a year
and want an ``industry leading'' deal of their own, which means
they'll want to leapfrog the United deal. (Fonti, Atlanta

   COXNET WHEELS 0902: 2001 KIA RIO _ Although not as intriguing as
a visit to the Brazilian city with which it shares its name, the
2001 Rio from Kia does have some attention-worthy features,
including a base price of $8,668 and adequate room for four adults.

   CHURCH-SCHOOL _ Church schools are gearing up for fall. They
promise kids enlightening spiritual lessons. But most parents are
completely in the dark about them. Sunday schools are arguably one

parents haven't a clue what goes on inside those classrooms.

   CONCUSSIONS _ Concussions are common among high-school athletes.
Some 300,000 high-school athletes suffer concussions each year,
with a third of those injuries coming off the football field. What
is worrisome is that athletes sometimes don't tell anyone about
their injury. Successive concussions can lead to serious brain

   ANTI-CHRONOLOGY (Undated) _ In the art world, antichronology
seems to be the rage. Numerous U.S. museums have re-hung their
painting and sculpture collections according to subject instead of
chronology. The one thing curators seem to agree on about
antichronology is that chronology and time are only the surface
issues. The deeper issue is genealogy: whether there is a great
lineage of art, a natural progression of one art movement after
another leading up to the grand finale, abstraction. By Sarah
Boxer.

by a U.S. Army lieutenant while he was stationed in Germany in the

articles, for publication Sunday, September 3, and thereafter, will

   &UR; COVER PAGE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FBN-DEEP-STRIKE (Undated) _ When Isaac Bruce caught the
game-winning 73-yard touchdown pass in Super Bowl XXXIV, he could
have kept running and zipped right into the 2000 National Football
League season. Because Bruce and his St. Louis Rams, along with
teams like the Minnesota Vikings, the Indianapolis Colts and the
Washington Redskins, are swaying offenses back to the vertical
passing game. The hunger for big plays this season will be
insatiable. And while teams will yearn for big plays to erupt in
the running game, and they will insist on their surfacing in the
passing game. By Thomas George.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-QUARTERBACKS (Undated) _ When the NFL lost John Elway, Dan
Marino and Steve Young to retirement, all in the past two years,
there was concern about who would fill their shoulder pads. But,
surprisingly, there is a healthy surplus of candidates, which is
good news for a league that continues to expand. The number of
solid young passers, more than a dozen, is at its highest level
since 1983, when six quarterbacks were selected in the first round
of the draft. But there is something else happening at the position
besides an increase in young arms. Many of them, like Peyton
Manning and Donovan McNabb, were drafted not only for their
abilities, but also for their capacity to handle the myriad
off-the-field distractions and requests for their time from
increasingly hungry, hostile and intrusive news media and fans. By
Mike Freeman.

</P>
<P>
   FBN-ANDERSON-COLUMN (Undated) _ Dave Anderson sports column on
the ``invisible jackals'' pressuring coaches Al Groh and Jim
Fassel. The Jets new head coach Al Groh is replacing Bill Parcells
while Giants coach Fassel has to win to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-NOTEBOOK (Undated) _ Lead item: If there is one troublesome
sign for the Rams _ and there are not very many on a team stacked
with talent _ it is new coach Mike Martz's paranoia and desire to
have Bill Parcells-like control of the media. If Martz loses a few
games, his paranoia will only increase, and players start loosing
confidence in coaches who worry more about who is behind that bush
with a boom microphone than about things that matter like the game
plan. By Mike Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-TV-SPORTS (Undated) _ While the spotlight may be on Dennis
Miller's hiring on ABC's ``Monday Night Football,'' other new faces
will be present for the ``fall feeding feast.'' By Richard
Sandomir.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-COLLINS (Undated) _ The fall of 1998 was a fireball of
strife for Kerry Collins, the quarterback and new field leader of
the New York Giants, a stunning decline from athletic idol to
object of scorn, all crystallized in one early morning meeting in
the office of Carolina Panthers' coach Dom Capers. Capers announced
that Collins had done something unthinkable in sport, he had quit.
Capers no longer discusses the meeting and Collins has never given
his side. But late one afternoon last week, Collins said of that
day: ``As it turned out, it was the best thing that every happened
to me.'' By Bill Pennington.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-JETS (Undated) _ The Jets' regular season begins Sunday
against Green Bay, but the restiveness that accompanied an
offseason of tumult may linger for awhile. An eerily quiet training
camp _ a quiet assured in some part by the trade of receiver
Keyshawn Johnson _ gives way to a season during which the Jets will
be required to solve their mysteries as a team just as surely as
they must solve opposing defenses. Is Vinny Testaverde healthy?
Whither the passing game, now that Johnson is gone? What sort of
imprint will Coach Al Groh try to put on the team before the
inevitable looming shadow of Bill Parcells threatens to engulf him?

unprecedented peace and prosperity, military spending is not what
most voters are thinking about. By MARIANNE MEANS.

&HT;     SAN FRANCISCO'S HOMELESS NOW INCLUDE CARS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE COSTANTINOU  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>

   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's so hard to find parking here that people
are having the land under their houses excavated to build a garage,
and paying oodles for it _ $100,00, $200,000, even a million bucks.
</P>
<P>
   It's so hard to find parking here that people hunting for a
house to buy often refuse to look at a prospect if it doesn't have
a garage.
</P>
<P>
   It's so hard to find parking here that people can wait two years
to rent a space in a garage, then pay as much as $500 per month for
it.
</P>
<P>
   And those are the options for the lucky ones who can afford to
build that garage, buy that house, rent that stall.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest, parking on the streets of San Francisco usually
means endless circling followed by that all-too-familiar,
inevitable, desperate last resort: parking in crosswalks, by fire
hydrants, in bus zones, across driveways and even on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for parking in the city is so acute that the
residential garage construction business is booming. One company,
Add-a-Garage, specializes in it.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Pavlow, 76, had already retired from the general contractor
business when he founded the company 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, business is booming.
</P>
<P>
   A simple two-car space typically costs $150,000 to $200,000. One
of Pavlow's customers, a 38-year-old owner of a Pacific Heights
home, is paying $1 million for a six-car garage that is being built
into the hill.
</P>
<P>
   In the hot real estate market in San Francisco, a house without
a garage will certainly sell, said Mindy Kershner, a real estate
agent with Tower Properties.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``It's always better to have a garage than to not have a
garage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A garage has become so important on the wish list of house
hunters that before an open house, real estate agents are now
getting construction estimates to add a garage, just as they do for
needed roof or termite work.
</P>
<P>
   Those who own a house or rent an apartment without a garage
often look for a private garage to rent. One Internet site had 309
listings as of Thursday afternoon under the parking category, most
from seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, I am begging, if you don't have a car and own a
parking space, have a kind heart and let me use your space,'' said
one ad from someone seeking a spot for $175.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Driveway to Call Home'' beckons another advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Even the well-to-do have it tough.
</P>
<P>
   Maher Kara, 29, an investment banker who just moved here from
New York City, pays $3,000 per month rent for a one-bedroom
apartment, but his new car is homeless. His 10-story apartment
building has a two-year waiting list for parking spaces, and his
classified ads and neighborhood flyers have been to no avail. The
closest he got was a bidding war. He bailed out when the
competition offered $500.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to New York City, parking in San Francisco is a lot
tougher, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is much worse,'' Kara said. ``In NYC, if you've got
money, you can get an apartment and parking. There is supply. It's
just a matter of price. Here, money makes no difference.''

&HT;     NEWCOMERS STRUGGLE IN SAN FRANCISCO'S HOT REAL ESTATE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RICHARD PAOLI  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Terri Allon wasn't entirely unprepared for
getting into San Francisco's housing market. Research told her that
prices would be high as she prepared to move from Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the home-buying process here has left her shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bidding war scene was unexpected,'' said Allon, who is
moving to San Francisco with her son following her divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the biggest problem for buying here is the mind-set you
need to buy up, above the asking price _ it's difficult to
swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   A limited supply of homes on the market, along with
sky-rocketing prices, has made San Francisco the nation's least
affordable city in which to buy a home, according to a National
Association of Home Builders survey released this week.
</P>
<P>
   Only 5.9 percent of San Francisco households with a median
income of $74,900 can afford to buy the $510,000 median-priced
home, according to the survey. Median means that half of the
incomes or prices are above that point and half are below.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 173 cities in the affordability survey, San Francisco
ranked last. It also was the only city with an affordability rating
below 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Four other Northern California cities joined San Francisco at
the top of the least-affordable list: Santa Cruz, 10.7 percent, No.
172; Salinas, 13.9 percent, No. 171; San Jose, 14.4 percent, No.
170; and Santa Rosa, 15.9 percent, No. 169.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, 25.9 percent, ranked No. 165; and the
Vallejo-Fairfield-Napa area, 31 percent, ranked No. 160.
</P>
<P>
   Rockford, Ill., ranked first in the affordability survey. In
that city, 89.3 percent of families with the median income of
$55,300 could afford to buy the median-priced house of $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   A major step toward broadening home affordability in San
Francisco, said Aldo Congi, vice president for McGuire Real
Estate's San Francisco district, ``is to build more housing.''
</P>
<P>
   With a nod to City Hall, Congi noted, ``The current regime has
done a good job making this a desirable city to live in, but they
have to address one result of that: the need for more housing. And
it can't be done without serious regard to keeping the open space.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-density zoning would be a step toward increasing the
city's housing because San Francisco has run out of land,'' he
said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress returns to Capitol Hill Tuesday for a
fast-paced final month of work in which members will jockey to
showcase an agenda designed primarily to win votes in November.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative goals are taking a back seat to political strategies
as polls are showing a tight presidential race between Texas Gov.
George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Eyeing the election, Democrats will push popular legislation to
boost the minimum wage and grant patients a bill of rights against
managed care providers.
</P>
<P>
   With the same focus, Republicans will try to override President
Clinton's veto of the so-called marriage penalty tax as well as his
veto last Thursday of a plan to phase out the federal estate tax.
They will also push a measure to expand Individual Retirement
Accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some members of both parties will fight behind closed
doors to stymie legislation, hoping to keep certain issues alive
for the campaign. For instance, measures to make prescription drugs
more affordable for seniors are not expected to advance simply
because the two parties' plans are too far apart and not enough
time remains to resolve the differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be much sound and fury but very little actual
lawmaking because each side has an incentive to posture rather than
legislate,'' predicts Jack Pitney, a political scientist at
Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, says David Rohde, a political scientist at
Michigan State University, ``nobody wants to be seen as an
obstructionist, and each side wants the other side to be seen as
obstructionist.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue are already
tense. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott fired off a letter last
week charging that President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
``are engineering `a train wreck' to affect the political
environment'' by vetoing spending bills. So far, only two of the 13
measures that fund the federal government have been signed into
law.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert shot back, saying Congress is
``well behind in its work,'' and that ``it's time to stop making
excuses and get a budget together.''
</P>
<P>
   That will probably happen _ with plenty of last-minute
compromises _ since no one wants another government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are still stung by the bruising House losses they
suffered after getting blamed for two partial federal government
shutdowns in late 1995 and early 1996 that resulted from budget
stalemates between them and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to avoid a repeat, Republicans in 1996 and 1998 made
major concessions to Clinton to complete the federal budget. Later
many GOP strategists blamed those concessions for additional
Republican losses in the House in 1998. Now Republicans have a
seven-vote majority there and a five-vote majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats remember all too well the legislative gridlock, plus
Clinton's failed health care overhaul, that swept congressional
Republicans to power in 1994. Voters blamed both sides for the
stalemate but punished Democrats at the polls that year.
</P>
<P>
   As the targeted adjournment date of Oct. 6 nears, horse-trading
between Republican leaders and the White House will go into high
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything depends on how vulnerable the Republicans feel and
what they make by way of concessions without alienating their
conservative base,'' says Thomas E. Mann, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the final month of the 106th Congress, President Clinton
will seek to burnish his legacy and drum up support for Gore and
for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for a U.S. Senate seat
from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The following legislation will take center stage as Congress
returns:
</P>
<P>
   _ CHINA TRADE. The Senate will soon consider the landmark,
House-passed bill that would grant China permanent trading
privileges with the United States, which most other countries
enjoy, without an annual review. Since the measure, opposed by
organized labor, is a top priority for Clinton and Lott and is
backed by Gore and Bush, it will likely pass. But the vote could be
slowed by a controversial companion measure by Sens. Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn., and Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. It would prod the White
House to impose sanctions if China fails to stop giving weapons of
mass destruction to rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   _ MINIMUM WAGE. House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., with
Lott's approval, offered a deal to Clinton last week. He said
Congress would agree to the president's plan to raise the minimum
wage by $1 over two years in exchange for a GOP proposal to provide
$76 billion in tax breaks over 10 years for small businesses. While
the House approved the minimum wage boost over two years, the
Senate has insisted on implementing it over three years. A
compromise version has stalled for months, but now, with Clinton
indicating he could accept the tax measure, passage looks likely.
</P>
<P>
   _ RETIREMENT SAVINGS. Lott has pledged to push legislation that
would expand contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts from
$2,000 to $5,000 over three years. The measure passed the House
with 401 votes in July, but the Treasury Department opposes it and
has said it will recommend a veto. Outlook: possible.
</P>
<P>
   _ MARRIAGE PENALTY. House Republican leaders will try to
override Clinton's Aug. 5 veto of the so-called marriage penalty
tax, a quirk in the tax code that causes some couples to owe more
income taxes if they marry than if they live together but remain
single. An override is doubtful but has a slim chance.
</P>
<P>
   _ ESTATE TAX. Hastert will try to override President Clinton's
Aug. 31 veto of a bill that would phase out the estate tax over 10
years. The speaker says it forces family farms and businesses to
break up. But in 1998, only 47,500 estates, 2 percent of the total,
paid the tax, and most of the revenue came from estates worth more
than $5 million. Republicans have been vulnerable to charges they
are catering to the wealthy, and their override attempt is likely
to fall short of the two-thirds majority needed.
</P>
<P>
   _ PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., will
look for chances to attach to spending bills a measure that would
require health plans to pay for emergency care, allow patients to
see certain specialists without prior health plan approval and let
patients sue a health plan in state courts. Democrats claim they
have 50 votes, which with Gore's tie-breaker would allow them to
pass the measure. But they couldn't muster 60 votes to quash a GOP
filibuster, and since the Republicans are not likely to give Gore
such a plum, the measure will probably die.

 &HT;    H `The purest game'
 &HT;    By Ben Wear

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When the old Austin High Maroons get together,
and they do so with some frequency, the talk often turns to the
unusually cold autumn of 1950. To Coach Kitchen and two-a-days, to
bus trips for games at Waco and Corpus and San Antonio and icy
Kerrville, and to that scarf incident on the charter plane to El
Paso. To Friday nights under the lights at a packed House Park. And
to that state championship game in Dallas against the hated Wichita
Falls Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the guys were players back then, some just fans and
classmates. These are men with wives and children and grandchildren
and professions. But memories of those days 50 years ago _ a time
before television and the pro sports explosion, when an Austin of
130,000 people focused so much on the one white high school in town
_ still stir them and unite them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take nostalgia trips, without guilt,'' says Hunter Morris,
a Maroon yell leader that fall and now a retired Episcopalian
minister.
</P>
<P>
   The memory machine for more than 1,200 Texas high schools gins
up again this weekend. The bus and car caravans formed Friday and
headed down the road and temporarily double the populations of
nearby towns. The small-town radio football analysts will take over
AM airwaves for a few hours a week. And each Friday, across the
state, dozens of boys will make a run or a diving catch or a
tackle, or a mistake, that will turn into a practiced war story by
the 10-year reunion, mythology by the 50th.
</P>
<P>
   The game doesn't get everyone, of course. Texas is too diverse
for that, and there are many competitors for our attention and our
passion. A good number of people think spectator sports overall are
a ludicrous waste of time and public capital. And that's fine.
</P>
<P>
   But for those in its thrall, the high school game defines autumn
in Texas. Let New England have the turning of the leaves. We'll
take an 0-0 record, the smell of cotton candy, football without TV
timeouts, and the possibility that this might be the year our kids
make it to state.
</P>
<P>
   ``High school football to me is the purest game there is,'' says
Rodney Williams, a halfback and leading rusher for that 1950 Austin
High team. He lives in Fort Worth now. ``There's no big bucks.
You're playing for the school. You're playing because you love to
play. It's just a whole different attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoolboy football _ in Texas especially, but everywhere _ is
essentially cheap and available entertainment. It's 25,000 to
30,000 boys, 5,000 or so coaches and tens of thousands of co-ed bit
players and backstage crew saying, ``Let's put on a show.'' It's an
August-to-December (for the fortunate) miniseries to determine
survivors, complete with bright lights, boot-black makeup on the
actors' faces, music during the breaks, a little sex appeal on the
cinder track, mostly bloodless violence and loosely choreographed
grace on the field, reviews in the morning paper and gold-embossed
statuettes at the end for the best performers.
</P>
<P>
   Its appeal is that it is at once extremely real, and completely
fleeting, to its audience.
</P>
<P>
   Actual injuries occur, some of them disabling or, once in a blue
moon, fatal. Coaches lose jobs over bad teams, or a string of them,
or sometimes one glaringly boneheaded decision. Boys win or lose
scholarships to college, and wide spots in the road make it onto
the map of Texas' consciousness. Players create memories and
self-images, good or bad, that linger into old age.
</P>
<P>
   These things really matter.
</P>
<P>
   But in increasingly urbanized Texas, especially in the big
cities, they don't matter as much as they used to. School board
trustees, scratching for money to pay teachers or the state, aren't
as likely to plow money into first-rate weight rooms and uniforms
and coaches. Athletic kids have so many other options _ whippety,
would-be wide receivers playing forward on the soccer team, rangy
potential defensive ends concentrating on basketball _ and so does
the student body. The fever still burns at suburban Westlake High,
with its sold-out stadium and metronomic success. Austin district
schools, though, mostly play to half-empty stadiums now.
</P>
<P>
   But each fall, at least until the first frost and mostly in
Texas towns still small enough to have a sense of place, high
school football can still grab a community and wring it giddy. In
1950, Austin was still one of those places.
</P>
<P>
   Westlake of its time
</P>
<P>
   Austin High _ a punching bag these days routinely pummeled by
Westlake _ was in fact the Westlake of the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   From 1939 to 1950, Austin won 118 games _ almost 10 a season _
and went to the playoffs seven times and played in three state
championship games.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, they weren't the only good high school team in town.
Anderson, descendant of the ``colored'' school created a couple of
years after Austin High in the 1880s, won six district titles in
that same period and was the 1942 state champion among black high
schools. But in the rigidly segregated Austin of that time,
Anderson's victories were like a tree falling in a small grove set
off from the big forest nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The Maroon games were broadcast to a large radio audience, up to
50,000 by one newspaper account. The Maroons played before crowds
of 8,000 to 15,000 all year long. And Austin's march to the 1942
state championship was front-page news for days. Anderson's similar
victory two weeks earlier merited 79 words on the bottom half of
the Austin American's sports page. It was a different time.
</P>
<P>
   Austin High, meanwhile, had almost 2,700 students and an
assembly line of well-stocked B and C teams training boys to run
the varsity's single-wing offense. The 1949 team made it to the
Class 2A state championship game against Wichita Falls, losing by a
single point after a late field goal attempt was ruled wide _
incorrectly as seen through Maroon-colored glasses.
</P>
<P>
   But all but one offensive starter and several on the defense
graduated. Expectations were guarded for 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The season began with a road trip to Waco High and a House Park
game against Fort Worth Arlington Heights.
</P>
<P>
   For Delano Womack, a junior tailback in 1950, Waco was the first
game in a career that would lead to him starting for the University
of Texas three years. Womack, a sinewy and sunny man who even at
age 66 looks as though he could drop 10 pounds and be ready to put
on the pads, wasted no time storing away some memories. He scored
two touchdowns in the 21-0 win over Waco. Then, with less than two
minutes left against Heights, with the Maroons behind and folks
gathering up their stuff in the stands, he broke off a 63-yard run
for the 18-14 win. He can still retrace his steps on the run, and
the key blocks ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't forget something like that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   After losing 27-0 to San Antonio Jefferson, the Maroons won
their remaining seven regular season games. Austin, with huge
linemen who routinely outweighed the other side by about 20 pounds
apiece, tended to wear down opponents. A creative Austin American
reporter described the line as ``lumbersome.'' The team's passing
was shaky, at best. But the head-banging approach worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a very dull team to watch _ three yards and a cloud of
dust,'' says Oliver Bradshaw, the spinner back and team leader who
normally got the shotgun-style snap and either ran, handed off or
passed.
</P>
<P>
   The highlights during that run: a 60-12 drubbing of a tiny El
Paso team, a trip memorable mostly for a few moments on the tarmac
at El Paso's airport. Some team members had developed sticky
fingers in the terminal, pinching some scarves for their
girlfriends back in Austin. Authorities observed the act, boarded
the Braniff charter and collected the booty. No one was arrested,
or suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The Maroons won district by easily beating Kerrville Tivy in
28-degree wet weather, eked by Temple in their first playoff game
and then stomped Harlingen. Womack was lost for the season in that
game, breaking his foot on an interception return.
</P>
<P>
   Austin traveled to Houston for the semifinal game in Rice
Stadium. The Baytown Ganders stuffed Austin's offense. But in the
fourth quarter, 140-pound Durwood Watkins caught a punt on the
25-yard line, shot forward and then cut left behind a wall of
Maroons for a 75-yard touchdown. Final score: 7-6, Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in Dallas for the state championship game was, once
again, Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   And it looked for a while like it might be different this time.
Bradshaw broke for an 81-yard touchdown in the second quarter. A
few minutes later, Austin lined up for a field goal that could have
made it 9-0. Again, a close _ and disputed _ miss. Wichita Falls
scored to go ahead just before the halftime break.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a nightmare second half, especially for Bradshaw. His
short punt led to a Coyote touchdown, as did a later interception.
His fumble stopped another drive. The Coyotes darted around the
larger Maroon defense and won 34-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sick,'' says Womack, who had spent the afternoon in a
walking cast on the sideline, trying to buck up his increasingly
discouraged friends.
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw, according to an Austin newspaper story the next day,
``had little to say about the engagement.'' This is what he says
now:
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't hold my head up, because I knew I'd
disappointed my parents, my classmates, my teammates and everybody.
And the City of Austin. Good God, that was quite a thing. I never
felt so low in my entire life. ... It still kind of bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   Another show coming up
</P>
<P>
   For most of the people beneath the lights, unlike Bradshaw and
his teammates so long ago, the emotions and visions linger only
until they reach the car in the parking lot. Or maybe through
Tuesday or Wednesday of the next week, when events have been
massaged to death at work and the talk turns to something else.
After all, there's another show coming up Friday night, one with a
different cast, different costumes, altered stakes and maybe a
different setting across town or an hour or two down the road. And
there'll be a whole other season of shows beginning next September,
with new actors and some not-so-new, maturing into their roles. Who
knows what will happen?
</P>
<P>
   For some _ the players and coaches, but also those who love the
show _ events hang on longer. And that's OK, too. Bradshaw
remembers the jarring hits, the foes knocked into temporary
silliness or proper respect for his guts and leg drive. Womack
remembers the well-timed blocks in front of him providing a
free-form geometry for his serpentine dances to the House Park end
zone. Watkins remembers that wall of protectors forming down the
left sideline of Rice Stadium and the joy of an untouched sprint.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, they remember the pain of a gray December afternoon in
Dallas, when the script went awry and they were cast as foils for
the boys from Wichita Falls. They remember a delirious town and
school suddenly deflated by their failure to get it done. They
recall that feeling of death in the fourth quarter and quiet sobs
in the locker room of Dal-Hi Stadium. They can see these things
clearly, 50 years and lifetimes of marriage, child-raising and
career-building down the road.
</P>
<P>
   A later generation of Maroons recalls a clear and invigorating
night in 1969 when 21,000 people _ 21,000 for a regular-season high
school game _ came to Memorial Stadium to see Austin play two-time
reigning state champion Reagan. They remember the endless choruses
of the Na-Na song and the pep rally that morning in the gym that
surged out of control into a singing march through the drafty old
school's halls, grinning teachers standing by letting it happen.
They can see Kent Marshall's impossibly high rainbow pass down the
northeast sideline dropping into Don Hill's hands for a 50-yard
touchdown. They can see Mickey Macaluso, tall and thick-legged and
yet so smooth, breaking free off left guard and cutting back right
40-something yards into the south end zone. They recall savoring
Reagan's defeat the next day when local TV showed a tape-delayed
version. Ridiculous that we remember all that. We don't care.
</P>
<P>
   These things shouldn't matter. We shouldn't care so much about a
show, should we? But we do.

 &HT;    INTERNET COMING OF AGE IN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (p) political
categories
 &HT;    (850 &AMP; add)
 &HT;    Moving in advance for release Monday, Labor Day, Sept. 4
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic and Republican strategists concur that
in the not-so-distant future presidential debates will staged on
the World Wide Web, perhaps with online voters posing questions to
the White House contestants.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 2000 race, Al Gore and George Bush have yet to agree
on ground rules for the traditional televised debates, let alone
deal with the uncharted risks of political combat in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the vice president and the Texas governor have
fully integrated the Internet into their campaigns. Each side has
thoroughly revamped its Web site for the general election contest,
with results that are far removed from the novelty items of the
not-so-distant past.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Internet assumes a dynamic role in their quest for
the presidency, their divergent Internet strategies have sparked a
lively debate on which of them makes the best use of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're struck by the way the two redesigns reflect what each of
the campaigns chooses to emphasize,'' Tucker Eskew, senior
communications adviser for the Bush campaign, said in a telephone
interview from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our site,'' he added, ``allows for much more intense
personalization, while the Gore site emphasizes the ability to
create (linked) interest group Web sites. Philosophically, Bush
focuses on the individual while the vice president's approach is
mired more in an interest-group style.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using our Internet site to rally our supporters and get
our message out aggressively. They don't do that,'' countered Ben
Green, a veteran political webmaster who has served as Gore's
director of Internet operations since last February.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Nashville, where he sometimes
appears on an always-on office webcam, Green asserted that ``one of
the clearest differences between our site and their site is that on
ours ... you can see the campaign actually as it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web address for Gore is: www.algore.com. The Web address for
Bush is: www.georgewbush.com
</P>
<P>
   Each side claims credit for having scored some notable firsts in
their online duel. Still, visitors to the Gore and Bush sites are
more likely to be struck by how similar they are in their basic
purpose, if not in their individual personality.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns make extensive use of powerful search engines
that are able to find archived issues papers, campaign speeches and
press releases on virtually every topic that has been in the news _
and quite a few that have not.
</P>
<P>
   They also let users customize the Web sites to reflect their
home state, their choice of English or Spanish, and a long laundry
list of specific interests. Both sites adhere to a rigorous privacy
code. Gore and Bush send a ``personalized'' electronic thank you
note to anyone who signs up.
</P>
<P>
   Each site also pushes the digital envelope into the broadband
future by offering extensive audio and video materials. Bush posts
all his campaign ads, including a 30-second spot a supposed
``first'' devoted exclusively to plugging his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   One Bush response to the unique Gore webcam is a ``daily trivia
contest.'' If they answer correctly, visitors can win a Bush coffee
mug.
</P>
<P>
   One difference: The Bush campaign shuns online donations while
the Gore site actively solicits contributions for a ``General
Election Legal &AMP; Accounting Compliance Fund.'' That reflects a
legal loophole in the campaign laws. Otherwise, the campaigns are
now limited to spending $68 million apiece in taxpayer subsidies
which must also cover the cost of their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have so far posted only one of their campaign ads.
But they seem to be ahead in the video streaming race by featuring
frequent ``live'' appearances of Gore and his running mate, Sen.
Joe Lieberman, on the campaign trail. The Bush site counters with a
link to CNN.com, where viewers can watch ``live'' Bush coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps license vendors to sell campaign-related materials
online, beyond the usual buttons and balloons. Goregear.com, for
example, offers $55 rolls of ``Gay &AMP; Lesbian Outreach Lapel
Stickers,'' an item not to be found at georgewbushstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP outlet advertises, at $32.40 a case, 16-ounce plastic
bottles of ``George W. Bush Drinking Water,'' which is said to
``come naturally from underground springs in the heart of
Kentucky's famous Blue Grass region.''
</P>
<P>
   According to PC Data Online, a leading Web site traffic tracking
service, for the week that ended Aug. 19, the official Bush site
attracted 193,000 unique visitors while Gore's attracted 175,000.
Each campaign also currently sends targeted e-mail updates to more
than 200,000 people who have signed up for them.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns continue to devise more strategies to lure even
more ``eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Eskew and Green envision the day when the Internet will
assume a leading role in interactive presidential debates. One
possibility: Users could review an extensive list of issues and
rank those that concern them the most. The candidates would then be
obliged to respond according to these ``votes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Story can end here. Optional add follows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Green, Gore's cyberspace guru, noted that ``when Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman are on the campaign trail, the Web site address is on the
podium. So it gets into the local news shots ... and on the
politics page of the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush staffers accuse the Gore camp of copying its new supersite,
which went up first. Said Eskew: ``They followed our lead. We can
cite many examples of Gore following Bush's lead with pale
imitations, such as Social Security reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush site is still in seeming need of some tweaks. A
recent ``personalized'' request on ``MyGeorgeW'' for Bush's views
turned up an apologetic ``sorry, we found nothing'' on Bush's own
list of topics for such subjects as antitrust, biotechnology,
defense modernization, uninsured health care, e-commerce, Medicare,
prescription drugs, the Vietnam war and the Balkans. On the other
hand, ``your interest in Social Security'' yielded links to 98 Bush
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor clearly has extensive views on all those
(unreferenced) matters,'' Eskew said. ``We're going to have to fix
that.''

code. Gore and Bush send a ``personalized'' electronic thank you
note to anyone who signs up.
</P>
<P>
   Each site also pushes the digital envelope into the broadband
future by offering extensive audio and video materials. Bush posts
all his campaign ads, including a 30-second spot a supposed
``first'' devoted exclusively to plugging his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   One Bush response to the unique Gore webcam is a ``daily trivia
contest.'' If they answer correctly, visitors can win a Bush coffee
mug.
</P>
<P>
   One difference: The Bush campaign shuns online donations while
the Gore site actively solicits contributions for a ``General
Election Legal &AMP; Accounting Compliance Fund.'' That reflects a
legal loophole in the campaign laws. Otherwise, the campaigns are
now limited to spending $68 million apiece in taxpayer subsidies
which must also cover the cost of their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have so far posted only one of their campaign ads.
But they seem to be ahead in the video streaming race by featuring
frequent ``live'' appearances of Gore and his running mate, Sen.
Joe Lieberman, on the campaign trail. The Bush site counters with a
link to CNN.com, where viewers can watch ``live'' Bush coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps license vendors to sell campaign-related materials
online, beyond the usual buttons and balloons. Goregear.com, for
example, offers $55 rolls of ``Gay &AMP; Lesbian Outreach Lapel
Stickers,'' an item not to be found at georgewbushstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP outlet advertises, at $32.40 a case, 16-ounce plastic
bottles of ``George W. Bush Drinking Water,'' which is said to
``come naturally from underground springs in the heart of
Kentucky's famous Blue Grass region.''
</P>
<P>
   According to PC Data Online, a leading Web site traffic tracking
service, for the week that ended Aug. 19, the official Bush site
attracted 193,000 unique visitors while Gore's attracted 175,000.
Each campaign also currently sends targeted e-mail updates to more
than 200,000 people who have signed up for them.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns continue to devise more strategies to lure even
more ``eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Eskew and Green envision the day when the Internet will
assume a leading role in interactive presidential debates. One
possibility: Users could review an extensive list of issues and
rank those that concern them the most. The candidates would then be
obliged to respond according to these ``votes.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Green, Gore's cyberspace guru, noted that ``when Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman are on the campaign trail, the Web site address is on the
podium. So it gets into the local news shots ... and on the
politics page of the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush staffers accuse the Gore camp of copying its new supersite,
which went up first. Said Eskew: ``They followed our lead. We can
cite many examples of Gore following Bush's lead with pale
imitations, such as Social Security reform.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush site is still in seeming need of some tweaks. A
recent ``personalized'' request on ``MyGeorgeW'' for Bush's views
turned up an apologetic ``sorry, we found nothing'' on Bush's own
list of topics for such subjects as antitrust, biotechnology,
defense modernization, uninsured health care, e-commerce, Medicare,
prescription drugs, the Vietnam war and the Balkans. On the other
hand, ``your interest in Social Security'' yielded links to 98 Bush
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor clearly has extensive views on all those
(unreferenced) matters,'' Eskew said. ``We're going to have to fix
that.''

   Requiem for a Dream: Web site for the about-to-open independent
movie of the same name from Darren Aronofsky, whose striking sci-fi
first feature, ``Pi,'' also came with a beautifully done Web home
(www.pithemovie.com). &QL; 
Where: www.requiemforadream.com. &QL; 
What's cool: Based on a 1978 book by Hubert Selby Jr. (who also did
``Last Exit to Brooklyn''), the movie's site is a fractured,
phantasmic visual feast, opening with a faux commercial Web site,
then a second one, rended by what looks like technical snafus on
the site itself, and all undergirded by beautiful, haunting music.
It's not big on linearity, but its makers did a great job
stretching the artistic abilities of the Web. &QL; 
Features: Navigation is a challenge, because nothing is obvious or
straightforward. Click around when the screen stops changing, and
you'll probably start something else happening. There's a trailer
to the film (a 5.8-megabyte download, so be patient), but you may
be hard-pressed to find it. Though the film is rated NC-17, there's
nothing inappropriate on the site. &QL; 
You'll like this if: People who like both offbeat Web sites and
movies. &QL;

   GALVESTON, Texas _ Dated Sept. 14, 1900, the letter from Charles
Rodewald Byrne to his wife Frances in Baltimore began with a
plaintive question: ``Darling, Darling, Darling, Where am I to
begin to tell you this sad, sad story?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God there were none of you here to run the awful risks
and thank God a thousand times you were not here to witness sights
such as perhaps were never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hearts are sodden with grief. We meet people and they tell
us pitiable tales, at every corner, and we can only answer, `God
help you, we can absorb no more.'''
</P>
<P>
   Byrne wrote the letter six days after a ferocious hurricane hit
Galveston taking at least 6,000 lives and destroying 3,600 houses.
A century later, it remains the nation's greatest natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Never before published, Byrne's letter opened with a circumspect
inventory of loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, your people are all safe _ Harris lost three sisters.
The Davenports lost three children, that is, all but one. Our
neighbors Mrs. Fordtran and sister are dead. Fordtran is still
looking for his wife's body. I believe it is under the Ripley house
in our lot. They found his sister in our place,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In closing, he wrote: ``It was chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   On that fateful Saturday in early September, Galveston's
children frolicked in the rising Gulf waters before their parents
sensed the coming danger _ too late.
</P>
<P>
   Those who survived the 120 mph winds and the 20-foot tidal surge
that hours later washed over the narrow island in the Gulf of
Mexico, staggered forth Sunday morning to a sunny new hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out into the streets and most horrible sights you can
ever imagine. I gazed upon dead bodies lying here and there. The
houses all blown into pieces; women, men and children all walking
the streets in a weak condition with bleeding heads and bodies, and
feet all torn to pieces,'' recalled Charles Law, a visiting
salesman caught in Galveston by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   It was indeed, the saddest of sad stories, told many times over
in the letters and chronicles of the survivors, and the stark
photographs of the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   But it has taken Galveston a full century to tell it publicly.
Now, for the first time, the city is poised to embrace and examine
the cataclysm that changed the city forever.
</P>
<P>
   The four days of commemorative events will include panel
discussions by authors of storm books; memorial services and the
placement of wreathes; a centennial tribute at the local stadium
featuring CBS News anchor Dan Rather as keynote speaker; and the
dedication of a large bronze statute on the granite seawall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm approaching it in the same way I'd approach a funeral.
It's a time of reflection on how lucky we've been and how chance is
so involved in our existence,'' said Kenneth Shelton, a Galveston
native and great-grandson of the letter writer, Charles Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will mark a time of a lot of introspection by the people
who love this city for what it was, who love the vestiges and
remnants of it, and also for the great personal loss,'' he said.

<P>
   Days before it hit Galveston, the unnamed storm pummeled Cuba
and the Florida Keys, before confounding meteorologists, who
forecast a route north. Instead it moved rapidly due west.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Sept. 8, 1900, the storm made landfall about
30 miles west of Galveston. Between 6,000 and 8,000 people died in
and around the island. The exact number was never known.
</P>
<P>
   For months afterward, the bodies of unidentified victims found
in the ruins were burned _ along with the corpses of livestock _ in
funeral pyres on the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huge piles of burning wreckage, in which bodies of victims
were being consumed, became such an usual spectacle, as to create
no comment,'' recalled Ben Stuart, a Galveston newspaperman who
weathered the storm.
</P>
<P>
   It was a disaster of epic dimension, many times more lethal than
other, better-known catastrophes such as the San Francisco
earthquake of 1906 (452 killed) or the Chicago fire of 1871 (250
killed).
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, a visitor wandering the city's streets would find few
clues that anything even vaguely noteworthy happened here a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   A Wal-Mart superstore now sprawls over the beachside site of the
old St. Mary's Orphanage where 10 nuns and 90 children died while
praying and singing, ``Queen of the Waves.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17-foot high seawall, built in the aftermath of the
hurricane, is decorated with cartoonish crabs and big-eyed fish.
</P>
<P>
   From the beachside Voodoo Daddy bar to the tee-shirt shops on
the Strand, from the medical school to the new beach homes in the
west, there are no statues or inscribed chunks of marble to
commemorate Galveston's horrific misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than a marker in the cemetery over the graves of some of
the unknown dead, there is nothing,'' said Michael Doherty,
chairman of the commemoration committee and a descendent of storm
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was such a place of business and commerce, and it (the
storm) was bad for business. It was our family story, and you
didn't talk about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such was apparently the case 50 years ago at the half-century
anniversary of the storm. No records exist of any public events
held then and a story about the hurricane published in the
Galveston News appeared on page 5.
</P>
<P>
   But the city has been preparing for two years for the 100th
anniversary, and its approach has prompted new books and re-issues
of volumes published 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Larson, whose best-selling book, ``Isaac's Storm,'' has
introduced hundreds of thousands of readers to the tragedy, said
that for many Americans it is a new story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of Texas, few people knew about this storm until my
book came out,'' he said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not the kind of event that was installed in the
national psyche like the Johnstown flood or the San Francisco
earthquake, so there's a fundamental fascination that anything so
horrible could have gone unnoticed by the culture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Galveston where island-born residents are never far from
the radio during hurricane season, the storm of 1900 is unreal to
some.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the more recent arrivals, it's more abstract. Look at the
west end of the island. There are palaces on stilts beyond the
seawall,'' Larson said.

   Present-day Galveston is a quirky, eccentric place, mixing a
beach town's tacky charm and poor, rundown neighborhoods with
pockets of majestic Victorian homes. Improbably attached to the
east end is the University of Texas Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred years ago, Galveston was a far grander place. As the
new century dawned, the ``Oleander City,'' was a center of wealth
and commerce, sustained by an insouciant self-confidence in its own
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston, the first city in Texas to have telephones and
electricity, was cosmopolitan and sophisticated. In 1900 was the
third largest city in Texas, trailing only San Antonio and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   In that golden era, Galveston had one of the highest per capita
incomes in America, its port was the busiest in the South.

<P>
   &UR; GALVESTON, Texas: x x x in the South. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Galveston sat low on a narrow, barrier island, and to ships
approaching from the Gulf, it was a mirage, a city that floated on
the waters.
</P>
<P>
   Its sense of invulnerability was also an illusion.
</P>
<P>
   Even though its highest point was less than nine feet above sea
level, Galveston was sublimely confident that no hurricane could
harm it.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Cline, the subject of Larson's book, was the chief of the
National Weather Bureau station in Galveston in 1900 and had
studied the situation.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech several years earlier, Cline dismissed the
possibility that Galveston could be seriously menaced by a
hurricane as ``an absurd delusion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Sept. 8, 1900, there was no hint that
anything beyond a mild storm was in the works. Most expected just
another ``washover,'' that would quickly pass, leaving behind wet
streets and gardens.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sept. 7, the Weather Bureau extended its storm warning
west to Galveston. The next day, Cline became alarmed by the
falling barometer and rising ocean swells, and attempted to warn
people of the danger.
</P>
<P>
   His last cable to his superiors in Washington D.C., transmitted
at 2:30 p.m. said in part that ``the city was fast going under
water and great loss of life must result.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1900, Galveston was connected to the mainland by three
railroad trestles and one long bridge, and all four were knocked
out by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who holed up on the bayside survived the storm.
Those who chose to ride it out on the Gulf side died by the
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   In the clinically-worded report he filed after the storm, Cline
began, ``The hurricane which visited Galveston Island on Saturday,
September 8, 1900, is no doubt one of the most important
meteorological events in the world's history. The ruin which it
wrought beggars description and conservative estimates place the
loss of life at the appalling figure, 6,000.''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, martial law was declared, and Galveston was
closed to outsiders. Looters and corpse robbers were shot on sight
and able-bodied men were conscripted at gunpoint to collect the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston's city fathers, who years earlier had considered
building a sea wall, wasted little time in acting after the
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers commissioned by the city recommended a three-mile wall
of concrete, 17 feet high, to protect the eastern edge of the city.
The wall would have a concave face to push the force of the waves
upward, and be fronted with boulders of red granite.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers also recommended raising the city's elevation
behind the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The seawall project was begun in early 1903 and finished the
next year. A series of later extensions lengthened to more than
along the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Raising Galveston's grade was more complicated. It involved
jacking up more than 2,000 buildings, including the 3,000-ton St.
Patrick's Church, and then pumping in more than 16 million cubic
yards of sand.
</P>
<P>
   It was completed in 1910.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storm was total, but the recovery was also total. It was
almost like building a city from scratch,'' said Casey Greene, head
of special collections at the Rosenberg Library, which has the
finest storm archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point I want to make is that we had visionary men and
women back then, to make it happen, and what is amazing is how
rapidly the city recovered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And although Galveston never regained its former prestige and
was quickly eclipsed by Houston, neither did it share the fate of
Indianola, a Gulf city that vanished after being hit twice by
hurricanes in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1915, the city was again struck by a ferocious hurricane, but
the sea wall protected Galveston. Only eight lives were lost.
</P>
<P>
   As the anniversary nears, those who have spent years organizing
the events say they it will have two themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a commemoration of the 6,000 dead, but it's also a
celebration of the recovery of Galveston,'' said Doherty, chairman
of commemoration committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the people stayed and rebuilt Galveston. They
built the seawall and they raised the grade of the city. We want
people to understand the tenacity of those who stayed. It's a
dramatic story, he said.

COMMENTARY: HOME-GROWN INNOVATION, HOME-GROWN WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 3) 
 By STEVE LOHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chronic problem of the nation's high-technology labor force?
Simple: There isn't enough of it.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of technology workers explains one of Washington's
annual rituals. Silicon Valley executives warn Congress that unless
the industry is allowed to hire more skilled foreign workers,
growth in the new economy will sputter for lack of able minds.
Organized labor complains, but to little effect. The industry
typically prevails, reasonably, because the problem is a real one _
and the visa quotas for skilled immigrants are raised once more.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is more American than immigration. Yet the persistent
shortage of home-grown technology workers to fill these high-skill,
high-wage jobs does suggest that something is amiss in the labor
market. Why isn't the supply of graduates from the nation's
universities adjusting faster to meet to the demand? What policy
steps can help solve the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Those questions are the focus of a recent paper by Paul Romer,
an economist at the Stanford Business School, prepared for the
National Bureau of Economic Research. Romer is a pioneering thinker
behind a set of ideas called new growth theory.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, new growth theory emphasizes the economic role of
innovation. And innovation, according to Romer, is the X-factor in
an economy, the elixir of sustained growth. So the goal of policy,
he says, should be to foster innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The right kinds of institutions are essential, he wrote in his
paper, but ``unfortunately, in the last 20 years, innovation policy
in the United States has almost entirely ignored the structure of
our institutions of higher learning.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he explained that any policy analysis has to
``get deeply into the details of how those institutions work.''
</P>
<P>
   In the university system, he sees a marketplace sorely in need
of new and different incentives if it is ever to help erase the
shortage of skilled workers in technology fields. He said he
believes that there is a role for government to play in overhauling
those incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, according to Romer, government programs intended to
encourage scientific research have simply handed money or tax
breaks to universities and companies _ which mainly increases the
demand for scientists and engineers without doing anything for the
supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crucial input,'' he said, ``is to have more well-trained
people who are engaged in innovative activities.''
</P>
<P>
   We would spend the money far differently. At the undergraduate
level, he recommends paying schools a bounty for increasing the
number of graduates who receive science or engineering degrees _
$10,000 a head. This would reward liberal-arts schools, whose
student populations tend to run heavy with English, history and
social science majors, an incentive to expand science and
engineering programs.
</P>
<P>
   At the graduate level, Romer sees different dimensions of the
problem and suggests a different kind of supply-side subsidy.
Increasingly, he said, research grants go to star professors, who
then support graduate students as their research assistants. This
system, he says, delivers some real benefits in basic research, but
it nurtures an academic research culture instead of one that
responds well to the needs of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Romer solution is to liberate graduate science and
engineering students from dependence on money trickling down from
professors; instead, he would have the government underwrite
three-year fellowships with $20,000 annual stipends for nearly
17,000 students a year to pursue advanced degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The two programs would combine to subsidize the right thing _
turning out more qualified people _ while giving more power to
individuals and innovative institutions to decide how resources are
used, Romer argues, adding that this approach sidesteps political
problems. ``It avoids the issues of pork-barrel science, giving
money to politically favored constituents, and it also avoids the
pitfall of having the government try to pick technology winners and
losers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag? For 100,000 additional undergraduate degrees, $1
billion a year, and another $1 billion for the graduate
fellowships.
</P>
<P>
   Justifying the spending, he said, would be the ``social return''
_ improved prospects for higher growth over the next 20 to 50
years, as more people engage in innovative activity.
</P>
<P>
   In his paper, Romer cited a comparable policy that proved a
winner: Creation of a new academic discipline, computer science, in
the 1960s. ``Even now,'' he wrote, ``with the passage of 40 years,
our sense of the magnitude of the payoff from this investment is
still growing.''

 By ROBERT HURTADO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bond market this year has outperformed the stock market for
the first time in a decade, and Dr. Edward Yardeni, chief global
economist and investment strategist at Deutsche Bank Securities,
forecasts that aging baby boomers will help keep the bond rally
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict that the 10-year government bond yield might fall to
5 percent by the end of next year,'' he said, from its current 5.68
percent, ``and to 4.5 percent by the middle of the decade.'' As the
bond's yield falls, of course, its price rises, giving investors a
higher total return.
</P>
<P>
   In making a case for bonds amid strong economic growth, Yardeni
points to a statistical measure, called the ``age wave,'' that he
developed many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although some other prognosticators are skeptical of the
measure's predictive value, Yardeni's arguments are food for
thought. The age wave tracks the percentage of the labor force that
is 16 to 34 years old; as baby boomers have aged, the age wave has
fallen.
</P>
<P>
   The path of that wave has been roughly parallel to that of
inflation and the 10-year government bond yield. All three hit a
trough in the early 1960s, crested during the first half of the
1980s and have generally been falling since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back now,'' Yardeni said, ``it turns out that this
wave has been remarkably well correlated with the wave of both
inflation and the bond yield,'' a trend that he has forecast will
last until 2010, when significant numbers of baby boomers are
retired.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni, who began to write about the impact of demographics on
markets in the late 1980s, contends that there are sound reasons
for the correlation. As the baby boomers have aged, he argues,
productivity has improved, because older workers have more
experience than younger ones and are more committed to their jobs.
``Faster productivity growth,'' he said, ``would be an important
source of disinflationary pressure, pushing bond yields lower.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that older baby boomers tended to favor tax cuts
and less government spending. As the government buys back debt
securities and issues fewer Treasuries, there has been increased
investor demand for those securities.
</P>
<P>
   The age wave, meanwhile, has continued to fall. Having peaked at
51 percent during January 1981, the percentage of the work force
that is 16 to 34 is now down to 38 percent. The five-year moving
average of the inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price
Index, is down to 2.4 percent, just above where it should be, based
on the age wave. And the five-year moving average of the 10-year
Treasury note, at 5.71 percent, is about two percentage points
above where the age wave suggests it could be. One economist who
considers a yield drop of that size highly unlikely is Brian L.
Beaulieu, director of the Institute for Trend Research in
Contoocook, N.H., although he is still bullish on bonds, at least
for the near term. ``I think Dr. Yardeni has some valid points,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to using the age wave to predict bond yields,
he added: ``I think his assumptions do not bear up under close
scrutiny. The past is not necessarily prologue _ other factors will
affect the market. For instance, almost no one is looking at Japan,
a huge wild card. Its economy could slip back into a severe
recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at bonds, for the near term to 12 months, Beaulieu
favors government issues over corporates. ``I'm confident about
U.S. government bond yields,'' he said, ``but I'm not confident
about corporate rates, because there is still a fair amount of
inflationary pressure within the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the intermediate term, going out to 2003, both sides of the
bond markets will prosper,'' he said, ``while in the post-2003
period I think all the potential is on the downside for bonds.
There is a significant inflationary cycle headed toward us and that
is going to be sending bond prices tumbling.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Fleming Asset
Management, had a different response to the issue of the age wave
and bond yields. ``Putting aside the powers of various theories, I
have only two thoughts concerning what lies beyond 2010,'' he said.
``One, I hope to still be alive, and two, I hope the planet is
still in one piece.''

HOW DO YOU SAY 'LESABRE' IN JAPANESE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 3) 
 By LEONARD M. APCAR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Japan's automakers made a name for themselves in
the United States with small cars that were reasonably priced,
economical to own and fun to drive. Detroit sold small cars in
those days _ Chevy Vega owners, please stand up _ but its heart
wasn't really in it.
</P>
<P>
   But whenever Toyota, Nissan, Honda or even Mazda tried to beat
the Big Three at their game _ building trucks or big family cars _
they usually fell flat. There aren't many fan clubs or newsletters
for enthusiasts of the Toyota Cressida.
</P>
<P>
   Then, five years ago, Toyota brought out the Avalon, a
made-in-America family sedan aimed right at the business that
Buick, Chrysler and Oldsmobile had owned for years. Based on the
ever-popular Camry, the Avalon was a smooth-riding, well-padded
cruiser that was long on quality although a little short on flash.
It looked like a fancier Camry, which itself had styling that was
far from the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   Car buffs dismissed the Avalon as a Japanese Buick. But today
even Toyota executives use that description as shorthand for what
the car is about: Easy-riding, mid-range luxury for buyers in their
mid-50s, which is considerably younger than the average Buick
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Buick, by the way, has also transcended its reputation. Last
year, when I tested the redesigned LeSabre with an optional touring
suspension, I was surprised by the car's relatively crisp handling
and taut road manners. Taut? Crisp? These are not words one used to
associate with Buicks.
</P>
<P>
   So how does the Avalon measure up against the LeSabre? Pretty
well, actually.
</P>
<P>
   For the 2000 model, just about every visible element of the
Avalon was changed. It is wider and taller to give it greater
stature and more room inside. To add space, the dashboard was moved
forward several inches and the rear seat was set back a tad. The
result is a cabin built for stretching out.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most noticeable changes inside is a Buck Rogers
dashboard with a large, back-lighted liquid-crystal display showing
the date, time, compass reading and outside temperature. The
display is eye-catching, with amber lettering on a cool blue-green
background, but it is so large and distracting that it is hard to
get used to.
</P>
<P>
   The interior redesign results in more headroom, and in
significantly more legroom in the rear. Since the Avalon is now
wider, and there is little dead space between the doors and the
seats, it is not a stretch to call this a six-passenger car when it
is equipped with a front bench seat. In no car, including this one,
is the middle seating position comfortable for long, but the room
is there to put three adults abreast in front and rear. There are
three adjustable headrests in the back along with three shoulder
belts.
</P>
<P>
   All this interior decorating has produced an exterior design
that is, at first, jarring. The idea was to make the Avalon look a
lot different from the Camry, and it does. But it also comes off
looking a little dated in some ways, a little heavy and oafish in
others. The body seems high and disjointed, as if it was designed
by committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalon's flat sides hark back to the sheet-metal slabs that
Mercedes has scrapped on its biggest cars. The fixed windows behind
the rear doors serve as reminders of the opera-window craze of the
'70s. And behind the sizable trunk, the tail lights attempt to
mimic Mercedes but miss badly with oddly positioned backup lights
that detract from the otherwise simple design.
</P>
<P>
   But if prospective buyers find the Avalon's look ungainly, it is
not keeping them out of showrooms. Although the car is at the high
end of its price bracket, with a base price of $26,300 and fully
dressed XLS sedans exceeding $34,000, sales are up a whopping 90
percent from 1999. Business is so good that Toyota has increased
production at its plant in Georgetown, Ky., where the Camry is also
made. Clearly, many shoppers think the Avalon is worth its $4,000
premium over a comparable Camry.
</P>
<P>
   On the road, the Avalon is quiet and competent, just what you'd
expect from Toyota. Outside noise is pretty well muted, as are the
bumps and ripples of the road. Braking is superbly confident, and
while there was some minor hesitation in acceleration it was
insignificant. The four-speed automatic transmission was virtually
seamless.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalon executed corners well for a front-drive car of its
bulk, and while it backed away a bit in some twists of the road _
leaning a little here and there _ it fared better than most sedans
in its category.
</P>
<P>
   In a matchup with the LeSabre, I would give the Avalon a slight
edge. The ride is smooth and the handling is impressive, with no
hint of sloth. But a fully equipped LeSabre costs several thousand
dollars less than a loaded Avalon, and Buick currently offers a
$1,500 rebate, to boot.
</P>
<P>
   I was disappointed that the Avalon's 3-liter, 24-valve V-6
requires pricey 91-octane gasoline, particularly since the power
plant is quite similar to the regular-gas engine of the Camry. The
chief difference is that the Avalon V-6 has sophisticated variable
valve timing, which raises the horsepower rating to 210 from 194.
The good news is that the fuel economy rating ranges from 21 mpg in
the city to 29 on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000-model test car came with some annoyances that were
surprising, given its $34,033 window sticker. For one, while there
were lots of thoughtful interior touches, like covered storage bins
in the doors, reading lamps and power outlets, the power-window
switches were not lighted at night. There were also inexcusable
rattles, some from the pull-down compartments in the doors. Every
time you closed the door or hit a bump the items inside
jingle-jangled.
</P>
<P>
   There were also rattles in the front cup holders _ particularly
surprising given that their lids, and the glovebox door, are
dampened to glide open slowly and softly.
</P>

&HT;     PBS BOLSTERS ITS PROGRAMMING FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK McGUIRE  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PBS takes the prize for its quality, value-laden weekday
children's programming _ despite worthy competition, especially
from Nick Jr.
</P>
<P>
   What makes PBS the place to go is that it has and remains the
one outlet that consistently provides quality programming to the
youngest viewers, ages 2-6. The obvious bonus: no commercials. (The
same can be said for Nick Jr. during the shows, but those programs
are buffered by ads that have the little ones whining to Mommy
and/or Daddy within 2.3 seconds.)
</P>
<P>
   Now PBS is preparing to venture into the dark morass of Saturday
mornings while at the same time strengthening its weekday lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon has a great lineup of kids' shows, from the
surprisingly deep ``Hey, Arnold'' to the wonderful ``Rugrats.''
Nick Jr., the network's younger cousin, has ``Blues Clues'' and the
sweet ``Maisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it can't touch PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Sept. 30, PBS will be offering a revamped
Saturday-morning lineup that continues the public network's
tradition of preschool programming.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the thumbnails for the new shows (check local
listings), which go under the umbrella title ``Bookworm Bunch'':
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Corduroy'': Based on Don Freeman's best-selling books,
Corduroy Bear and his African-American friend Lisa explore
diversity in an urban setting.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Elliot Moose'': From Andrea Beck's book series, this is a
combination of live-action, puppetry and animation.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Timothy Goes to School'': From Rosemary Wells' books.
Timothy is a 5-year-old raccoon who tries to do things on his own
four feet.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Seven Little Monsters'': From Maurice Sendak, author of
arguably the greatest kids' book ever, ``Where the Wild Things
Are.'' The seven monsters are siblings, each with monstrously
unique features.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``George Shrinks'': From the books of William Joyce, George is
3 inches of kid who's willing to try anything.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Marvin the Tap-Dancing Horse'': Set in a carnival, it is a
story of a 9-year-old boy who can communicate with the animals.
</P>
<P>
   The weekday schedule will feature two new kids shows.
``Caillou'' (pronounced ky-yoo) is a realistic animated show (with
some live-action and puppetry) in which the challenges of life is
captured through the eyes of the 4-year-old title character. The
kid is hyper and inquisitive, with more questions than Sam
Donaldson at a news conference after 12 cups of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Slight warning: In a sample episode released to critics, the
subject matter was death. It's handled artfully, but be prepared to
answer a lot of questions from little ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clifford'' sticks to the spirit of the Scholastic books.
Voiced by John Ritter of ``Three's Company'' fame, Clifford is a
really big red dog. The lessons are simplistic and sweet, the
pacing slow enough for younger viewers.
</P>
<P>
   All right, ``Teletubbies'' still wigs me out a little bit. And
Loonette and the gang are a little too Insane Clown Posse-ish, but
you get the idea.
</P>

&HT;     DAVIDON GOES FOR SCULLS MEDAL AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The doctor is in. Or make that back in.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Davidon, a surgical resident at Stanford University, was
one of America's best hopes for a medal in the women's single
sculls at Atlanta in 1996, but, hampered by a fractured rib, she
finished sixth. And shortly after, she took her oars out of the
water.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if her long rowing career might well be at an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I unloaded everything, including my boat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But elite athletes don't give up easily. Davidon kept working
out on a rowing machine, and then began running, biking and
cross-country skiing to stay in shape.
</P>
<P>
   When she could find the time, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were points during my residency when my only exercise
would be hauling some 250-pound guy across the operating table,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But then she began rowing again, under the guidance of coach
Steve Gladstone, and in January, she turned heads all around her
sport when she turned in a super-quick time on the ergometer, the
machine used to simulate rowing.
</P>
<P>
   While pleased with her time of 20:47, which was 1.4 seconds
better than erg standout Amy Fuller and 25 seconds better than
anyone else, Davidon said, ``I was surprised at how terrible I
felt. I was dying. I was coughing and sputtering _ it was
definitely very painful.''
</P>
<P>
   The pain produced plenty of gain, however.
</P>
<P>
   At the Olympic trials, Davidon, now 36, teamed with new partner
Carol Skricki to win an Olympic berth in the women's double sculls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were thrown together right before the doubles competition
at the trials,'' Davidon said. ``We thought we were going to row in
the quadruple sculls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely different than singles. So much of my
energy now is spent in rowing identically with Carol. But it's just
great. I feel really lucky. There are a lot of personalities and
politics in rowing. I'm lucky to have a doubles partner who's got
her head screwed on straight, works hard and really wants to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Their three-month athletic union already has produced some
impressive results: two bronze medals and a silver in three races
in Europe last month.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. has never earned a medal in the Olympic women's double
sculls, but Davidon said, ``Our coach seems to think we have the
best chance for a medal of any of the American doubles teams. It's
a very competitive event. The German doubles team is very strong
and accomplished, and everyone is predicting they'll get the gold.
But Carol and I are very hungry for it. Someone has to beat the
Germans some year, and we hope this will be the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidon's competitive rowing future is uncertain, but right now,
her complete focus is on the double sculls starting line in
Australia Sept. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some final technical tweaking and tapering to do
before the start of the racing,'' she said. ``We have to win our
heat to go directly into the final Sept. 23, but if we don't, we'll
have a second chance two days later.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidon realizes she already has gotten one second chance, and
is grateful for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like having been in the Olympics before, and
not getting a medal, to give you the drive and determination to
return and win one,'' she said.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sept. 3, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   NUCLEAR-SECRETS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The case of Dr. Wen Ho Lee
raises a troubling question: what's really secret anymore? The
surprising answer is a lot. Some restricted data is deemed so
sensitive that Washington is engaged in a quiet effort to raise
classifications from secret to top secret for 65 nuclear topics,
making whole libraries of sequestered data less likely to slip into
foreign hands. By William J. Broad. (Moving in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   MOSQUITOES-GLOBALIZATION-REVIEW (Paris) _ Mosquitoes and efforts
to control them are at the nexus between the poor, infected world
and the rich, scared one. A look at how globalization has
intensified the spread of mosquitoes, exposing rich countries to
the same hazards as poor lands. By Donald G. McNeil. (Moving in `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   POLS-MENTAL-HEALTH-REVIEW (Washington) _ New disclosures of
President Richard M. Nixon's purported drug abuse and mental health
problems raise important questions. While the physical health of
presidents and politicians has become a fit topic for public
discussion, the majority still hide their mental difficulties. Vast
increases in the willingness of ordinary Americans willing to seek
mental health help and talk about it have not been reflected in the
political class. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   UNIONS-INCOME-REVIEW (Undated) _ For the nation's labor
movement, Public Enemy No. 1 has long been the nation's growing
income gap. But as the presidential campaign has heated up, labor
leaders have begun speaking out less than usual about the income
gap partly because focusing on it might embarrass Vice President Al
Gore, since the gap continued to widen under the Clinton
administration. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   CHEERLEADING-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ After years of disregard
and even ridicule, cheerleading is back, bigger than ever _ and
with a sassy, teeth-baring attitude that's a long way from
old-fashioned pom-pom waving. Excerpts from recent issues of
American Cheerleader magazine suggest some of the forces at play in
the brave new world of cheerleader empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   ABBIE-HOFFMAN-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The late radical activist
Abbie Hoffman is the subject of a new film ``Steal This Movie,''
which may enlighten young Americans who know some '60s music but
regard his life and times as remote from their own dot-com lives.
Throughout his life, Hoffman wrote letters to his brother, Jack,
who ran the family business in Worcester, Mass. Some excerpts from
the letters provide rare insight into Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-RELIGION-REVIEW (Atlanta) Sen. Joseph Lieberman's
emphasis on America's need for religious values in public life has
made him popular with the Christian right and raised some concern
among many with more moderate religious views. But Christian
conservatives believe they have a mission to spread the gospel of
Jesus to non-believers, while Lieberman, as a Jew without a
sectarian mandate to proselytize, bears none of the baggage of the
religious salesman, and is thus more palatable to a wider public.
By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIDRUG-PROGRAMS-REVIEW (Undated) _ When Colombian President
Andres Pastrana said the key to winning the war on drugs was taming
demand in the United States, he ruffled some American feathers, in
part because he took no account of the myriad demand-reduction
programs already in place. A look at some of those efforts. By Alan
Feuer.
</P>
<P>
   TEN-USOPEN-APPAREL-REVIEW (New York) _ The death of tennis
whites: a look at how competitors at the U.S. Open have turned to
playing in more colorful and fashionable attire. By Liz Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   SUBMARINES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Kursk disaster has cast a
harsher light on the secrecy that continues to define submarine
operations. It has also raised the question of whether a little
less cloak and dagger _ and more cooperation among seafaring
nations _ could go a long way toward improving the safety of those
on board the vessels. By Christopher Drew.
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-SUITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at some recent cases in
which courts in the United States have agreed to hear civil cases
involving human rights violations outside of U.S. territory. By
John Sullivan.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sept. 3, will move Saturday.

<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   NUCLEAR-SECRETS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The case of Dr. Wen Ho Lee
raises a troubling question: what's really secret anymore? The
surprising answer is a lot. Some restricted data is deemed so
sensitive that Washington is engaged in a quiet effort to raise
classifications from secret to top secret for 65 nuclear topics,
making whole libraries of sequestered data less likely to slip into
foreign hands. By William J. Broad. (Moving in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   MOSQUITOES-GLOBALIZATION-REVIEW (Paris) _ Mosquitoes and efforts
to control them are at the nexus between the poor, infected world
and the rich, scared one. A look at how globalization has
intensified the spread of mosquitoes, exposing rich countries to
the same hazards as poor lands. By Donald G. McNeil. (Moving in `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   POLS-MENTAL-HEALTH-REVIEW (Washington) _ New disclosures of
President Richard M. Nixon's purported drug abuse and mental health
problems raise important questions. While the physical health of
presidents and politicians has become a fit topic for public
discussion, the majority still hide their mental difficulties. Vast
increases in the willingness of ordinary Americans willing to seek
mental health help and talk about it have not been reflected in the
political class. By Adam Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   UNIONS-INCOME-REVIEW (Undated) _ For the nation's labor
movement, Public Enemy No. 1 has long been the nation's growing
income gap. But as the presidential campaign has heated up, labor
leaders have begun speaking out less than usual about the income
gap partly because focusing on it might embarrass Vice President Al
Gore, since the gap continued to widen under the Clinton
administration. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   CHEERLEADING-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ After years of disregard
and even ridicule, cheerleading is back, bigger than ever _ and
with a sassy, teeth-baring attitude that's a long way from
old-fashioned pom-pom waving. Excerpts from recent issues of
American Cheerleader magazine suggest some of the forces at play in
the brave new world of cheerleader empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   ABBIE-HOFFMAN-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The late radical activist
Abbie Hoffman is the subject of a new film ``Steal This Movie,''
which may enlighten young Americans who know some '60s music but
regard his life and times as remote from their own dot-com lives.
Throughout his life, Hoffman wrote letters to his brother, Jack,
who ran the family business in Worcester, Mass. Some excerpts from
the letters provide rare insight into Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN-RELIGION-REVIEW (Atlanta) Sen. Joseph Lieberman's
emphasis on America's need for religious values in public life has
made him popular with the Christian right and raised some concern
among many with more moderate religious views. But Christian
conservatives believe they have a mission to spread the gospel of
Jesus to non-believers, while Lieberman, as a Jew without a
sectarian mandate to proselytize, bears none of the baggage of the
religious salesman, and is thus more palatable to a wider public.
By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIDRUG-PROGRAMS-REVIEW (Undated) _ When Colombian President
Andres Pastrana said the key to winning the war on drugs was taming
demand in the United States, he ruffled some American feathers, in
part because he took no account of the myriad demand-reduction
programs already in place. A look at some of those efforts. By Alan
Feuer.
</P>
<P>
   TEN-USOPEN-APPAREL-REVIEW (New York) _ The death of tennis
whites: a look at how competitors at the U.S. Open have turned to
playing in more colorful and fashionable attire. By Liz Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   SUBMARINES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Kursk disaster has cast a
harsher light on the secrecy that continues to define submarine
operations. It has also raised the question of whether a little
less cloak and dagger _ and more cooperation among seafaring
nations _ could go a long way toward improving the safety of those
on board the vessels. By Christopher Drew.
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-SUITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at some recent cases in
which courts in the United States have agreed to hear civil cases
involving human rights violations outside of U.S. territory. By
John Sullivan.

 &HT;    Parents: Monitor Sunday schools
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Church schools are gearing up for fall. They
promise kids enlightening spiritual lessons. But most parents are
completely in the dark about them.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday schools are arguably one of the most formative
experiences in a youngster's life. And most parents haven't a clue
what goes on inside those classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   They innocently entrust the minds and spirits of their children
to a largely volunteer faculty that has little biblical education
beyond their own Sunday school days.
</P>
<P>
   Most churches accept virtually any willing, warm body as a
teacher. Some offer modest training. Many teachers are simply
thrown into a classroom with a Bible and a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Those gracious, ever-suffering teachers impart to open minds a
sense of morals, values and religious faith that will linger with
the children throughout their lives.
</P>
<P>
   They teach definitively about social issues, human sexuality and
the role of women. They try to shape a child to the will of God as
that church understands it.
</P>
<P>
   Parents know very little of what their kids are taught about
life's most profound subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Kids learn about the nature of God and what God wants of them
according to the way the church or the pastor or an education
committee interprets the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   They learn about themselves and others, about sin and grace,
hope, heavenly bliss and eternal damnation. Serious concepts of
guilt and forgiveness are routinely discussed. Impressions are made
that stick.
</P>
<P>
   Parents tend to ask few questions. They should ask many.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to the pastor. Talk to the church school coordinator. Visit
classes often and observe.
</P>
<P>
   Ask for a copy of the curriculum if there is one. What does it
say about God? About God's children? About the Bible? Are you
comfortable with its style and emphasis?
</P>
<P>
   How does the church treat Holy Scripture? Is the Bible literally
true, or is it an inspired but not strictly factual account of God
and his people? Does Genesis describe the precise manner of
creation?
</P>
<P>
   Some churches believe the Bible is a textbook for religious
behavior. Others consider it a poetic log of a spiritual journey.
Churches teach Scripture in radically different ways.
</P>
<P>
   What does the church teach about human sexuality, sex and the
sexes? Where are girls and women in the divine pecking order? Can
young women aspire to the same heights as their male classmates?
Some churches say no. Some parents want it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Does God forgive easily or condemn quickly? Must the child have
a spiritual conversion experience to be accepted by the church?
</P>
<P>
   Churches can teach children anything they choose. Some are
historically orthodox. Others are bizarrely heterodox.
</P>
<P>
   No one regulates churches. No one censors them. That's as it
should be.
</P>
<P>
   So parents must do their homework.

national missile defense that is prohibited by a 1972 arms control

   TAIWAN-CHINA (Taipei, Taiwan) _ Since he came to power in May,
Taiwan's new president, Chen Shui-bian, has labored to persuade
China that he is not a wild-eyed separatist, driven by dreams of
Taiwanese independence. But Chen's charm offensive has come to an
abrupt end. In an interview here Friday, he took a harder line
toward the Chinese government on the crucial issue of when _ or
even whether _ Taiwan and China will be unified. ``We don't think
unification is the only principle,'' Chen declared. ``There could
be two or three, or countless different conclusions. We see Taiwan
as a democratic country, with the people in a position to decide.''

   TIRE-RECALL (Dearborn, Mich.) _ Federal regulators issued a
public warning Friday that their review of Firestone's data had
found that tires on 1991 Chevrolet Blazer sport utility vehicles
and on some Nissan and Ford pickup trucks were even more prone to
failure than the tires already recalled on several Ford models,
mainly the Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle. The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued an unusual ``consumer
advisory'' saying that it had asked Firestone on Wednesday to widen
its recall, but that the tire maker had refused on Thursday to do
so. Firestone officials had no immediate comment. By Keith
Bradsher.

<P>
   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ In another clear signal that the economy
is slowing in response to rising interest rates, the nation's
private employers created only 17,000 new jobs in August, the Labor
Department reported Friday, and the unemployment rate ticked up to
4.1 percent from 4 percent. The slowing was particularly noticeable
in manufacturing, where 79,000 jobs disappeared and the National
Association of Purchasing Management, in a separate report, said
that its index of manufacturing activity had turned negative for
the first time in 20 months. With consumer demand weaker,
manufacturers appear to be trimming production. The Federal Reserve
is unlikely to raise interest rates before next year at the
earliest, the argument being that the Fed's six rate increases
since June of last year have been enough to slow the economy to a
growth rate that the Fed considers non-inflationary. By Louis
Uchitelle.

   ANTI-CHRONOLOGY (Undated) _ A little war against time has begun.
Last year, when the Museum of Modern Art opened the show ``Modern
Starts: People, Places, Things,'' Cezanne's ``Bather'' from 1885
was found hanging next to a 1993 Rineke Dijkstra photograph of a
pale boy in a maroon bathing suit. Later the Tate Modern, in its
permanent collection, lined up Matisse's sculptures of women's
backs before a firing squad of ink drawings of nude women by a
contemporary artist named Marlene Dumas. The critics were up in
arms. What got them was not the mixing of media or the mixing of
masterpieces with lesser works. It was the mixing of time periods.
As Jed Perl, an American art critic, put it in The New Republic,
``Chronology, that backbone of the historical sense, has been
collapsed into some kind of postmodern time warp.'' By Sarah Boxer.

1.8 MILLION MORE FAULTY TIRES MAY BE ON ROAD, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal regulators warned Friday that an additional 1.4 million
Firestone tires pose a possible safety risk to drivers. They issued
the warning after their request that Bridgestone recall the tires
was refused, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The warning follows a recall early last month by Bridgestone,
Firestone's parent company, of 6.5 million tires. Safety
investigators have warned that the treads on those tires can peel
off in high temperatures and high speeds if they are
under-inflated.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued the
warning about possible defects to another 1.4 million tires, a
preliminary step to ordering a government recall, saying the tires
pose a possible safety risk.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said their study indicated that some of the 1.4.
million tires have higher rates of failure than some of the tires
included in the company's voluntary recall. The safety
administration said that although Firestone may not offer consumers
new tires, car owners should consider replacing any tires included
in the warning on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the investigation is not yet complete, that review
indicated that the rate of tread separation for certain other tire
models and sizes exceeded those of the recalled tires, sometimes by
a large margin,'' the safety administration said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The safety administration does not have the power to recall
tires until an investigation is complete. The statement said
regulators asked Bridgestone on Wednesday to recall the tires but
the company refused.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone did not immediately issue a response to the warning.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said they might order Bridgestone to recall the tires
when their investigation was finished, but decided to warn
consumers now. The safety administration told consumers with 24
additional sizes and brands of Firestone tires to take special
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should check the tires for wear, make sure they are
properly inflated, avoid driving at high rates of speed in hot
weather and avoid overloading the vehicle, regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   The safety administration on Thursday increased by 26 the number
of deaths in the United States that have been linked to the
recalled Firestone tires. That brings to 88 the number of deaths
being investigated by the agency, along with more than 250 injuries
in 1,400 complaints it has received concerning tire separations on
popular sport utility vehicles manufactured by Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   The warning expanded the number of 15-inch Firestone tires
recalled and also added some 16-inch versions of the tires. A
complete list of the tires included in the warning is posted on the
safety administrations web site at:
</P>
<P>
   http://www.nhtsa.gov/hot/firestone/consumer/consumer_09-01-00.html
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the continuing investigation by federal
regulators, congressional hearings will begin next week.
Investigators are hoping to learn why Ford or Firestone did not
recall the tires in the United States until months after learning
of problems with similar tires in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan officials on Thursday accused both Ford and
Bridgestone of conspiring to hide tire defects that caused dozens
of deaths. Venezuela's consumer protection agency asked the
nation's prosecutor to bring criminal charges against both
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The companies ``had concealed vital information from Venezuelan
consumers,'' said Samuel Ruh Rios, chairman of the Venezuelan
consumer agency. He said the companies were well aware that ``a
macabre combination of a soft suspension and an inadequate tire''
was to blame for at least 80 accidents in which 47 people died.
</P>
<P>
   The tires involved in Venezuela are similar to those being
recalled in the United States in that they are suspected of tearing
apart at highway speeds and causing Ford Explorers to roll over.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ford and Bridgestone officials denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In Dearborn, Mich., Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's president,
defended the company's actions in Venezuela and denied any attempt
to mislead authorities. Nasser said on Thursday that the company
did not lie to authorities and would cooperate with any Venezuelan
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser also promised to testify next week before congressional
committees investigating the tire failures and Explorer accidents.
Earlier this week he had said he would not appear, leading to
criticism that Ford was not being sufficiently open with the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser insisted that the problem ``was a tire issue, not a
vehicle issue,'' and said that 1.5 million tires had already been
replaced, representing 22 percent of the 6.5 million Firestone
tires being recalled.

(For release Sunday, Sept. 3) 
 By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a few months, John Welch will step down as chief executive of
the General Electric Co., leaving behind a remarkable 20-year run
of earnings growth and near cultlike devotion. And the three
front-runners to succeed this 20th-century business icon fit a
pattern. All are gung-ho results-getters for the company _ and all
are white men.
</P>
<P>
   In June, GE promoted three more executives who stand ready to
replace any front-runner who bails out if he is not anointed as
Welch's successor. These three, too, fit the mold: Stellar
growth-and-earnings producers, and all white men.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the women? The blacks? The Latinos? The Asians?
</P>
<P>
   Together, these groups make up about 40 percent of GE's domestic
work force, but they are not easy to find in the top executive
corps of GE, which is regarded in many management circles as
America's most admired corporation. Just 6.4 percent of its
corporate officers are women, compared with an average of 11.9
percent for all the Fortune 500 companies, according to a 1999
survey by Catalyst, a nonprofit research and advisory group that
studies women in business.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 20 businesses that provided 90 percent of GE's earnings
in 1999, only one is headed by someone who is not white: GE
Industrial Systems has an African-American president and chief
executive, Lloyd Trotter, who is also a senior vice president of
the parent corporation.
</P>
<P>
   And the first woman to become chief executive of a GE business _
Sandra Derickson, at GE Capital Auto Financial Services _ left
unceremoniously in 1999 after the fast-growing auto-leasing unit
posted a sharp earnings decline and had to be restructured. A man
replaced her.
</P>
<P>
   GE has had diversity on its agenda for at least three decades,
and its efforts to retain women and minorities have intensified in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have put a lot of programs in place to make sure that GE's
global diversity is real and lasting, and we measure our
progress,'' Welch said. Responding to questions by e-mail, he
conceded that GE isn't ``where we want to be yet,'' but pointed to
current efforts to move more diverse talent through GE's managerial
``pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone think that Welch has gone touchy-feely in his final
months at the helm, he stressed that diversity was a bottom-line
necessity today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diversity isn't just a nice corporate program,'' he said.
``It's a business and a global reality. The '90s have been largely
about global growth and going after the brightest minds, wherever
they may be in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I believe the future has never been better for a
truly diverse GE.''
</P>
<P>
   In the here and now, however, GE's all-male and nearly all-white
leadership slate raises intriguing issues. After all, it is no
longer unheard-of for large American companies to be led by women
or minorities _ American Express, Maytag and Hewlett-Packard are
high-profile examples. Catalyst has measured steady annual
increases in women corporate officers since it started counting in
1995, and Spencer Stuart, the executive search firm, reports a
small but growing minority presence in American boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Under Welch, GE has become a gold standard for management
practices. Detractors may criticize its mass layoffs and chemical
spills, but its managerial training and promotion practices inspire
widespread praise and imitation. To many in corporate America, GE
is a meritocracy par excellence _ a place where managers are judged
on their ability to meet tough financial goals, not on whether they
speak with the right accent, attended the right schools or had the
right father.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, the white, male leadership slate? Is there something
about this acclaimed corporate culture that is inhospitable to
women and minorities?
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of interviews with current and former GE managers turned
up much agreement that GE's efforts at promoting diversity had
fallen short, at least until recently. But there was no unanimity
about why. ``It really is a paradox,'' said Karen Nelson, a former
GE Medical Systems marketing manager who served as the diversity
director of that business from 1991 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Some pointed to the company's practice of grooming talent
through frequent relocations, saying that it was tougher on women,
and unappealing to minority managers, who would have to drag
spouses and children to parochial towns. Others said GE's
engineering history was the reason, arguing that today's statistics
reflect the difficulties that all engineering businesses had in
attracting women and minorities as trainees years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Trotter, GE's most senior black executive, thinks those theories
let management, including himself, off too easily. ``If I had
managed my business the way I had managed diversity, I think I'd
have gotten fired,'' he said, noting that GE requires every
business unit to be first or second in its market, or risk sale or
closure. There is no such requirement for diversity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The priorities have now changed, Trotter said, adding that new
measures to recruit and retain more African-Americans, designed by
GE's black managers themselves, were more likely to work. These
initiatives, which have more recently been adapted by GE's women,
Latinos and Asian-Americans, pose no challenge to GE's culture of
meritocracy, but try to bolster participants' confidence, groom
them for promotion and give them a better idea of how they fit into
the corporate structure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, others who are knowledgeable about GE's workings wonder
whether diversity can be achieved within a system that prizes
growth and earnings above all else.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, for one, said that she savored the adrenaline highs of
working in GE's tough culture, but that she began to believe that
this same culture was burning out the very women and minorities she
was working so hard to recruit, to say nothing of herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would get four hours of sleep a night,'' recalled Nelson,
who gave birth to her second child while serving as diversity
officer for the United States, Canada and Latin America. ``I was
traveling so much I knew all the porters in the airport by their
first names. I would stagger home at midnight and get back up at 4
a.m. We had staff meetings at 7:30 in the morning, and you had to
be there.''
</P>
<P>
   GE tried to accommodate Nelson, granting a postpartum ``family
leave,'' and letting a nanny bring the baby to the office for
midday feedings. But Nelson knew that accommodations could hurt as
well as help, suggesting special treatment in a system that values
a lean and mean image.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly troubled by work-family conflicts, and uncertain
that diversity could ever take root in such arid soil, Nelson
resigned in 1994 and is now president of the Leaders Forum, a
nonprofit group in Milwaukee that promotes African-American
business interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I don't know how to begin to change the GE culture,''
she said. ``All we were saying was, `Let's level the playing
field.' Now, do we really want to say, `We have to change the game
altogether?'''
</P>
<P>
   The company's efforts to promote women and minorities began in
the early 1970s, when civil-rights victories were bearing fruit in
many American workplaces. A women's advisory panel was convened at
the company, affirmative-action guidelines were issued, and Welch's
predecessor, Reginald Jones, traveled to Washington to become
chairman of the National Advisory Council on Minorities in
Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, the General Electric Foundation went so far
as to commission a one-act play to raise management consciousness.
In the play, a male executive refuses to promote a secretary, then
has a nightmare in which he is endlessly patronized by women. He
wakes up screaming, ``I'm not a statistic!'' and, as the curtain
falls, promises to stop blocking women's careers.
</P>
<P>
   The early initiatives put more women into jobs as welders and
foremen, and even attracted some minority managers, like Trotter,
who joined in 1970. But they did little to change demographics at
the top.
</P>
<P>
   After Welch became chief executive in 1981, some people saw
reason for optimism. True, Welch had come out of GE's plastics
business, a division known for its free-wheeling frat-house
culture, and he began selling GE businesses, laying off tens of
thousands of workers and instilling a harsh, Darwinian ethos
through the company. But by eliminating whole layers of middle
management that had been predominantly white and male, Welch raised
hope in some circles that he was clearing the way for diverse
up-and-comers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, an article in Working Woman magazine contended that the
``Welch management revolution'' bore a striking resemblance to
then-current feminist management theories: Welch was trying to
flatten hierarchies, encourage teamwork and have managers pool
information across rigid turf lines, the article said, just as
feminist scholars were declaring women to be quicker to share
information, cooperate and encourage teamwork on the job.
</P>
<P>
   It was that atmosphere that convinced Anne Poirson, a computer
scientist, to go to work for GE as a systems designer in the early
Welch years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I researched different corporations around the country, and
found out that GE was supposed to be one of the best for women,''
she recalled. ``There was equal pay, promotional opportunities.''
And Poirson also approved, in theory, of Welch's campaign to
reshape and ``de-layer'' GE.
</P>
<P>
   But in practice, Poirson found herself thrown in with a lot of
frightened, white, male middle managers who believed that they were
fighting for their survival _ and that she was the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of managers told me they were intimidated by me,'' she
said. ``I was a young woman in charge of some big projects, and I
had a lot of clout. I was bringing in computer systems that were
upsetting the power structure of the whole company. At one point,
my productivity was rated on how many jobs I eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Poirson said she soon found herself excluded from key meetings
and denied the secretarial help that she wanted. One day, she said,
her boss told her point-blank, ``I'm making twice as much as you
are, and someone is going to figure out that there should be two of
you, and then they won't need me any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The entrenched layers of middle managers were being thinned, all
right, but Poirson stopped hoping that women would rise in that
environment. The whole point of restructuring was to strip away
bureaucracy and improve earnings, she said, but because there were
fewer management positions to go around, those who survived faced
multiple workloads.
</P>
<P>
   Poirson resigned in 1986, after five years with the company, to
go into business for herself. Today, at 52, she has her own
software consulting firm and says she has more control over her
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone in my position is not going to stick around at GE and
wait for equality to simmer through the corporation,'' she said.
``Yes, it's a very good company, but in my particular case, I
didn't think it was going to pay off for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Watkins Snead, an engineer, told a similar story. One of
the first black women to receive an engineering degree from the
University of Massachusetts _ Welch's alma mater _ she said GE
appeared eager to recruit female engineers. She joined the company
in 1981 and moved quickly though a series of assignments in the
United States, the Caribbean and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, Snead said, she found herself wondering: Did all
the transfers really mean that she was moving up?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just at GE, but in corporate America, there are only so
many management slots,'' she said. ``It gets to the point where
your moves are lateral, not vertical.''
</P>
<P>
   Had more women been near the top of the corporate flow chart,
Snead said, she might have felt more confident that her labors
would pay off one day. But the two minority women on GE's board
today _ Andrea Jung, an Asian-American who is president and chief
executive of Avon Products, and Ann M. Fudge, the African-American
who is executive vice president of Kraft Foods _ arrived in 1998
and 1999, after Snead had resigned and founded Banneker Industries,
an outsourcing firm.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, no one at GE ever contended that a main goal of
restructuring was to advance women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the '80s were about getting our business model right,
`de-layering' and creating a `boundaryless culture,''' said Welch,
using GE language for lopping off tiers of the corporate
organization chart and encouraging employees to go directly to
senior managers for information rather than inching up the chain of
command.
</P>
<P>
   But years later, it was clear that the focus on earnings and
market share had left diversity an orphan. GE's leaders realized
that they would have to address what they called the company's
``social architecture'' if they wanted to stop losing people like
Poirson and Snead. They decided to apply ``work out'' _ a
group-analysis process used to solve business problems in the 1980s
_ to diversity. About 60 well-placed executives were called to the
corporate headquarters in Fairfield, Conn. in early 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were 15 African-Americans, who decided to sit down
privately beforehand to sharpen their presentations. Trotter said
he had a revelation as he walked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been around the company for 18 years, and I only knew 3
of the 15 people in the room,'' he said. One of diversity's most
powerful advocates at GE, he suddenly realized he could not
possibly promote talented blacks if he did not know who they were.
``It was a mirror test,'' he said. ``I looked at myself and said,
`Am I using all of the necessary energy and the skill moving people
up the ladder?' And the answer was, `No.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Steven Thorne, then a GE human resources manager, said it was
not just that GE's black executives were too busy working to seek
out one another. In general, African-Americans at GE were reluctant
to call attention to themselves, he said, because the company's
culture promoted colorblindness. If you were supposed to rise or
fall on the basis of performance, what good would it do to bring up
race?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way of avoiding making waves,'' said Thorne, who
became the corporation's top diversity officer last year. ``You put
yourself at risk if you set yourself out.''
</P>
<P>
   At that first meeting, however, those 15 black managers began to
think that if minority recruits at GE kept playing the corporate
game by the colorblind rules, they would never even know who their
teammates were, much less score. Certainly, they began to think,
there was some way of bringing African-Americans together and
promoting their interests without challenging the meritocracy
itself and creating a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   When they raised the idea with Welch, he asked them what they
had in mind. They had no answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back and said to each other, `If he ever asks us that
again, we don't want to be in that position,''' Thorne said.
</P>
<P>
   For the next year, on their own time, black managers studied
glass-ceiling issues and minority retention at other corporations,
trying to learn what practices brought lasting gains, and which of
those might work in GE's culture. They also polled other black
managers at the company., asking what they thought might be useful.
They moved cautiously, Thorne said, fearing that if they threw
together an ill-conceived program that failed, they would not
receive a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they settled on an in-house self-help network,
called the African-American Forum. Started in 1992, its mandate is
narrow: To demystify GE's personnel policies, to provide a setting
where GE blacks can meet one another and to develop a formal mentor
program, in which GE's senior executives are required to
participate. GE says it is keeping track of which mentors' trainees
receive promotions and is rating the mentors accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Outside critics may find this disappointingly tame, but the GE
planners chose to avoid any hint of advocacy, special status or
quotas. They figured that a narrow focus on self-improvement, well
within the confines of GE's existing culture, would draw more
members _ and that a large group with limited goals would
accomplish more over time than a small group that tried too much.
</P>
<P>
   David Thomas, a Harvard Business School professor of
organizational behavior who has studied diversity initiatives in
large companies, agreed with that thinking. Corporate minority
networks that succeed, he said, tend to have goals that jibe with
the company's philosophy and can point to the participation of top
executives.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent gathering of the African-American Forum, in
July, attracted 1,800 participants, including Welch and most of
GE's other senior executives based in the United States.
Participants say the meetings provide something simple but
important: A place where they can meet top executives without the
usual pressure of being outnumbered by whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my first year and a half, I knew every corporate officer,''
said Louis Parker, president of direct products for GE Financial
Assurance, who came to GE in 1996 after stints at IBM, Automatic
Data Processing and Morgan Stanley. ``It was very different from
where I had been before. I've heard about diversity at other
places, but GE is the first place I've felt it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the African American Forum began receiving plaudits like
that, other groups at GE took note. Managerial women started
planning their own self-help network in 1997, researching possible
structures for a year and deciding that they, too, would restrict
their mandate to narrow, nonconfrontational goals.
</P>
<P>
   There were no calls to celebrate women's ``web thinking'' or
other supposed feminine advantages now being promoted in some
theorist circles. In interviews, many GE women said they enjoyed
the intense, no-holds-barred environment at GE and wanted their
group, called the Women's Network, to help them better compete on
those terms.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the network's founders put work-family issues on their
agenda. Though much research shows that these issues affect
corporate women more than men, the GE women said they believed that
the problems required individual solutions and that they did not
want to lobby for one-size-fits-all remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Women's Network has focused since 1998 on coaching
women in public speaking, in making effective presentations and in
exuding leadership qualities. It also links participants with
senior-executive mentors. GE, meanwhile, has asked Catalyst to
conduct follow-up interviews with high-level women who leave the
company, to make sure that there were no hidden gender issues
driving them away.
</P>
<P>
   None of this will catapult any women or blacks _ or the Asians
and Latinos now organizing their own groups _ past those white men
at the front of the pack in time to claim Welch's job. But the many
consultants who study GE and try to graft its practices onto other
corporations are watching the latest efforts to see what they
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that by some of the programs that Jack Welch is
pushing, he's kind of admitting that we have to do some special
things'' to accelerate diversity, said Noel M. Tichy, a professor
of organizational behavior at the University of Michigan who ran
GE's management training center from 1985 to 1987 and now writes
and consults extensively on its management practices. ``That
doesn't mean you don't have standards, and you're not going to be a
meritocracy. I would put them as one of the companies that's pretty
seriously driving this agenda. I don't know why it took them so
long.''

 &HT;    U.S., EUROPEAN SCRUTINY GROWING OVER AOL-TIME WARNER MERGER
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Executives for America Online Inc. and Time Warner
Inc. insist their proposed merger is facing no serious antitrust
obstacles. But eight months after their deal was announced,
government scrutiny is growing more intense, both in the United
States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the European Commission, which sets anti-trust
policies for the 15 countries in the European Union, announced it
will take testimony from Time Warner and AOL executives at an
antitrust hearing Thursday in Brussels. The commission also will
hold a hearing Wednesday on Time Warner's plan for a music joint
venture with EMI Group PLC. The London-based company is the world's
largest music publisher and third-largest recording company.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, a confidential European Union document was
leaked to the media. The document, described in The Wall Street
Journal as ``sharply critical'' of both mergers, suggests European
regulators fear a combined AOL Time Warner/EMI would dominate
access to the Internet and wield too much power over the digital
delivery of music, film and sports programming.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is expected to rule on the Time Warner/EMI deal
Oct. 18, and on the AOL and Time Warner merger Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Rep. W.J. ``Billy''
Tauzin , R-LA., chairman of the House telecommunications
subcommittee, said the chief executives of AOL and Time Warner will
testify on Capitol Hill later this month.
</P>
<P>
   At the House hearing, whose date has not yet been set, AOL's
Steve Case and Time Warner's Gerald Levin will be asked about the
merger's impact on interactive television, a new technology that
blends the Internet with television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to get a glimpse into the 21st century and see
what interactive television will look like,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   AOL and Time Warner hope to put their merged company at the
center of the interactive television revolution with the help of a
briefcase-sized box that connects to a TV and telephone line. The
set-top box allows subscribers to AOLTV to use a wireless keyboard
to surf the Internet, send e-mails and flash instant messages on
the same screen where they are watching television. This summer,
AOL has been rolling out the service in eight test markets from
Baltimore to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   During a speech last month at a high-tech conference in Aspen,
Colo., Levin said that ``over time, there won't be any
distinction'' between television and the Internet. ``What we are
creating is really the first Internet-powered media-communications
company of the 21st century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the merger fear this next-generation television
technology could get locked up in one company's hands. Many
competitors, especially the Walt Disney Co., NBC Inc. and USA
Networks Inc., are warning that Time Warner could use its extensive
cable lines to force AOL Time Warner services and content on
captive consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said it was likely some subcommittee members will ask
Case and Levin about the antitrust implications of the merger.
``There are a lot of people who still have some concerns about the
competitive aspects of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications
Commission are reviewing the deal, and are expected to rule this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   In his Aspen speech, Levin said he does not believe government
officials ultimately will oppose the merger on antitrust grounds
because AOL, an online access provider, and Time Warner, an
old-fashioned media company, are in different businesses. ``To my
view, I don't think there are any regulatory issues,'' he said.
``This is not a conventional, horizontal merger. There are no
business overlaps.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, AOL spokeswoman Tricia Primrose said the U.S. and
European hearings are ``part of the normal process of review'' and
do not threaten the deal. ``We believe the merger is on track to
close this fall.'' Shareholders of both companies already have
approved it overwhelmingly.

<P>
   After a decade of highly publicized legal wrangling,
international negotiation and criminal indictments, the famous
Quedlinburg art theft case has been quietly put to rest with the
agreement by two Texans to pay a total of $135,000 in federal and
state taxes, penalties and interest.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was reached April 20 in federal tax court but was
not publicly announced.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts and art professionals said the figure was
surprisingly low since until recently the government had been
seeking $8.6 million in federal taxes, $2.1 million in federal
penalties and more than $40 million in interest from the heirs of
an Army lieutenant who stole a group of priceless religious
artworks while stationed in Germany in the final days of World War
II. The heirs had been accused of trafficking in stolen property
when they tried to sell some of the objects, but those criminal
charges were thrown out several years ago, leaving only the tax
case.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the settlement were provided by Don Lan, a tax lawyer
in Dallas who represented Jack Meador, 80, a hardware salesman of
Whitewright, Texas; Jane Meador Cook, 66, of Mesquite, Texas; and
the estate of Joe Tom Meador, the Army lieutenant. Meador died in
1980; Jack Meador and Cook are his brother and sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very favorable settlement,'' Lan said.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers and art experts familiar with the drawn-out
proceedings expressed disappointment with the amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slap on the wrist,'' said Thomas R. Kline, a
Washington lawyer who represented the German government in its
efforts to recover the Quedlinburg treasures. ``It was a lost
opportunity to encourage dealers, museum people and collectors to
return stolen objects as a way of avoiding significant estate tax
liabilities. The reverse message was sent.''
</P>
<P>
   Constance Lowenthal, director of the World Jewish Congress'
Commission for Art Recovery, who followed the case closely, said
she, too, was disappointed by the decision of the tax court but
hoped that the case as a whole would act as a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Meadors have had 10 years without peace, and although the
criminal case against them failed on technical grounds they must
now realize that selling their brother's loot was the wrong way to
go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they repent or are regretful,'' she continued,
``but they are the poorer for it.'' Donald Roberts, a spokesman for
the Internal Revenue Service, said that the disclosure provisions
in tax law prohibited him from discussing the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Meadors also escaped the most serious criminal penalties
that might have been handed to them. In January 1996, the Meadors
and their former lawyer, John Torigian, 46, of Houston, were
indicted on federal charges of illegally selling two of the
treasures they had inherited, nearly three years after the German
government had paid them $2.75 million for the entire collection.
(The remaining artworks were not mentioned in the indictment.) Each
defendant faced a possible 10-year sentence and a fine of up to
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The federal indictment charged the three with conspiracy to sell
two of the 10 treasures: the Samuhel Gospels, a spectacular gold,
silver and jewel-encrusted ninth-century manuscript, and a
16th-century prayer book that is also of artistic and historical
importance.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, as the case was coming to trial in Sherman,
Texas, a federal judge dismissed the charges on technical grounds,
saying the prosecutor had collected evidence beyond the lawful time
limit. When that decision was upheld by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in New Orleans, the criminal prosecution came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The artworks, long since returned to Germany, are part of a
group of medieval treasures, many of which were kept for a
millennium in the Schatzkammer, or treasure chamber, of the
Quedlinburg cathedral in central Germany.
</P>
<P>
   They were moved to a nearby cave to shelter them when the Allies
began widespread bombing of German cities in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Meador helped himself to 10 of the best of more than 100 art
objects in the cave.
</P>
<P>
   When returned to Germany in 1993, the treasures were exhibited
triumphantly in Berlin before being returned to the Quedlinburg
cathedral, which had been fitted with a modern security system.

JUDGE AWARDS CONNECTICUT COMPANY $1 MILLION IN MICROSOFT LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.)

<P>
   A federal judge has questioned the truthfulness of statements
made by Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, and awarded $1 million in
punitive damages to a small Connecticut company that brought an
antitrust suit against the giant software publisher.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999 a federal jury in Bridgeport, Conn., found that
Microsoft committed a deceptive act that violated the Connecticut
Unfair Trade Practices Act, but awarded the plaintiff, Bristol
Technology, just $1 on that claim.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives at the time had hailed the minimal fine as
a justification for the company's business practices. But U.S.
District Judge Janet C. Hall, who was permitted to award punitive
damages under the terms of last year's ruling, ruled Thursday that
the deceptive conduct in which Microsoft had engaged ``rises to the
level of reckless and wanton indifference to the harm it caused
Bristol and others.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time she noted that a $1 million penalty against a
company like Microsoft, with $14.5 billion in revenue last year,
would be unlikely to deter the company in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also ruled that Microsoft's chairman gave an
intentionally false statement during a 1996 speech, in which he
assured other software companies and customers that Microsoft would
continue to provide its latest products for conversion to UNIX
programs.

   WATCHDOG GROUP SAYS POLITICAL LANDSCAPE TILTS TOWARD INCUMBENTS
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The congressional elections are still two months
off, but in the eyes of one monitoring group the results are
already in. And the easy winners are House incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Voting and Democracy says the power of historic
voting patterns dictates that House members will roll to
re-election this November and the parties will probably hang on to
the open seats they are defending. The group says the trend is
particularly true in the South, which it ranks as the least
electorally competitive region in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana and Florida rank at the bottom of the group's
Democracy Index based on the ease with which incumbents were
re-elected over the past decade. Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee
and Virginia helped round out the bottom 10.
</P>
<P>
   Center director Rob Richie attributed the South's tendency to
stick with incumbents to its one-party past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is coming out of that tradition of a one-party situation,
where there was obviously a disenfranchising of a large part of the
population,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the group's take on what it calls ``dubious democracy''
is that once either the Democratic or Republican party gains
control of a congressional district, it is almost impossible to
dislodge it, resulting in a monopoly that ultimately drives down
voter interest.
</P>
<P>
   The group suggests a variety of solutions, including a focus on
the upcoming congressional remapping to make districts more
competitive and a move to larger, multi-member districts.
</P>
<P>
   And there are some naturally occurring changes in the political
landscape as well. Florida, for instance, has a handful of
competitive races this year and some challengers in Alabama and
North Carolina are raising enough money to throw a scare into
incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about time,'' said Richie, who nevertheless predicts
more than 98 percent of incumbents will be re-elected, most by
landslides.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN ON THE FARM
</P>
<P>
   Policymakers in 10 states in the South and Great Plains need to
devote more attention to education in rural communities or risk
leaving students behind, an interest group that promotes better
rural schooling warned in a new report.
</P>
<P>
   The Rural School and Community Trust said 10 states _ including
Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi _ stood out
in a review that compared states by such factors as rural teacher
pay, Internet connections, poverty, enrollment and test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Declining enrollment in schools is widespread in these states,
teacher pay is consistently low and rural adults have low levels of
educational attainment,'' said the trust. It called for a renewed
focus on rural education not just in the 10 states, but across the
nation. ``Every state can improve the policy climate within which
its rural schools operate.''
</P>
<P>
   GUNNING FOR TROUBLE
</P>
<P>
   Southern states typically don't fare very well when their
policies are reviewed by gun-control groups. But Kentucky set a new
standard in the recent report card issued by Handgun Control Inc.
when the advocacy group ranked states by their efforts to keep guns
away from juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   The group gave the Blugrass State an F-minus for not only
failing to enact tougher safeguards to limit access to guns by
youngsters, but for weakening its existing concealed weapon law.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when we are still losing 10 young people a day to
gun homicides, suicides and accidents, the failure of so many
states to strengthen their gun laws is unconscionable,'' said Sarah
Brady, chairwoman of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Grades of other Southern states included Alabama, F; Florida,
C-minus; Georgia, D; Louisiana, F; Mississippi, D; North Carolina,
C; and South Carolina, C.
</P>
<P>
   LEMON FRESH SCENT
</P>
<P>
   Citrus groves and hog farms might not have much in common, but
they are linked in a congressional fight that will resume when
Congress returns after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   The National Pork Producers Council wants congressional
negotiators to strip an import ban on Argentine lemons from a
pending farm spending bill. The group fears the citrus restrictions
could provoke a protectionist response and shut off a potential
market for ``the other white meat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be unreasonable to expect Argentina to delay
indefinitely the approval process on pork and other American
agricultural products,'' wrote council president Craig Jarolimek to
key lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Citrus growers say they are worried such imports could include
diseased fruit that would threaten domestic groves. But the pork
group says rules would be in place to cut such risks.

YOU KNOW YOU'RE OLD WHEN... 

</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you do not have your own, personal teen-ager, chances are you
do not fully comprehend how out of touch you are with the younger
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Since I am lucky enough to have a 14-year-old living in the same
house with me, I am reminded of my out-of-touchness every day. The
generation gap appears to me in increments rather than all at once.
It's less frightening that way, I think, and it makes you more
likely to view teen-agers as people rather than alien life forms.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I felt rather sorry for that segment of the
non-teen-ager-owning population that read the story in last
Sunday's paper called ``Mindset of the Class of 2004.'' The 50-item
list is published annually by the faculty of Beloit College, a
liberal-arts school in Wisconsin. The idea, according to humanities
professor Tom McBride, is to remind the faculty (some of whom may
be 50 years older than the arriving freshmen) of the cultural gaps
between the generations and how these gaps need to be taken into
account when teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The first bitter pill that readers had to swallow was that this
year's freshmen (or first-year students as they prefer to be called
these days) were born in 1982. If you are 50-ish or older, 1982
does not seem that long ago. According to our memories, which are
stuffed with TV commercial jingles from the '60s, Beach-Boy song
lyrics and the names of elementary-school teachers, the period
between 1982 and today zipped by in about 2 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   We can't remember what we did yesterday but we can easily
remember when we were freshmen in college. Unhappily, that day was
30-plus years ago, an era that today's first-year students have no
more personal memory of than we do of the Bronze Age.
</P>
<P>
   What are some of the ``cultural touchstones'' that identify the
class of 2004?
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan was shot before they were born.
</P>
<P>
   John Lennon, Elvis and Karen Carpenter have always been dead.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody named George Bush as been on every national ticket,
except one, since they were born.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy tragedy was a plane crash, not an assassination.
</P>
<P>
   They were born into war. The Falklands war.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has never been a monopoly in their lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The movie ``E.T.'' came out the year they were born.
</P>
<P>
   They have never known a world without ATM machines.
</P>
<P>
   Watergate is as relevant to their lives as the Teapot Dome
scandal is to ours.
</P>
<P>
   They're not angry at the recording industry for making all their
vinyl LPs obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes have always had men's and women's names.
</P>
<P>
   When they use the word ``spam,'' chances are they're referring
to something having to do with computers rather than the canned,
pink luncheon-meat substance.
</P>
<P>
   Same with ``cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   They never thought of Jane Fonda as ``Hanoi Jane,'' nor
associated her with any revolution other than the ``Fitness
Revolution'' videotape they may have found in the attic.
</P>
<P>
   They remember the Vietnam War about as well as we remember the
War of 1812.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the Cuban crisis was all about Elian Gonzalez, not
Soviet missiles.
</P>
<P>
   They have never known a world without AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Depressing? Sure. But there is a bright side. In 25 or 30 years,
they'll be starting sentences with ``Back in the '80s'' or ``When I
was your age'' and they'll be boring the ears off their own
teenagers with tales of how much better things were ``back then.''
</P>
<P>
   And then they'll be the ones feeling old, like we do now.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Friday that he would not
take the initial steps to deploy a national missile defense shield,
leaving to his successor the final decision.
</P>
<P>
   At a speech at Georgetown University, Clinton said he would not
approve construction of a radar station on an Alaskan island, the
first step in creating the missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that although the technology was promising, the
system was not yet proven. He cited the failure of the most recent
tests, and questions about the ability of the missile interceptors
to deal with decoys and countermeasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore I have decided not to authorize deployment of a
national missile defense system at this time,'' Clinton said. ``We
need more tests against more challenging targets and more
simulations before we can responsibly commit our nation's resources
to deployment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his decision not to deploy a missile defense would
not significantly delay the deployment if the next president
decided to proceed with building the radar station and beginning to
install the national defense.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser,
telephoned congressional leaders Thursday evening to brief them on
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Berger told the congressional leaders that Clinton was delaying
the decision because of technical concerns, including the failure
of recent tests, and the objections of Russia and NATO allies, who
argue that deploying a missile defense would violate the
Antiballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said in his speech that the Antiballistic Missile Treaty
was an important element of national security and international
stability. Building a national missile defense would, however,
require abandoning or altering the treaty with Russia, something
the Russian government opposes.
</P>
<P>
   He said that despite the end of the Cold War, deterrence was
still important in reducing the risk of conflict with Russia, and
that preserving the treaty was important.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are no longer adversaries we are not yet real
allies,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The initial Russian reaction to Clinton's decision was positive.
Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head of the international military cooperation
department of the Defense Ministry, told the Interfax news agency
that he was hopeful that the decision meant that the United States
would take a ``considered approach'' before deploying a missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton said that ballistic nuclear missiles were
still a threat to national security and that although North Korea
had reduced its missile testing program, there was still a threat
that a terrorist group could acquire ballistic missile technology
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an obligation to determine the feasibility and impact
of a national missile defense,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision comes after opposition not only from Russia
but from European allies, and after a legal dispute over how far
the system could proceed before it violated an important arms
control treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Friday that the United States should not move
forward until other nations could be convinced that a missile
defense was in the best interests of world security.
</P>
<P>
   ``No nation can have a veto over American national security,''
Clinton said. ``But we can never afford to overlook the fact that
the actions and reactions of others in an interdependent world do
bear on our security.''
</P>
<P>
   William Cohen, the defense secretary, a Republican and the
Clinton administration's strongest supporter of the missile
defense, had recommended that Clinton begin construction of the
radar site in Alaska. But Berger and other diplomatic advisers
argued that taking the first step toward deployment was not worth
the consternation it would cause among the Russians and Western
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen issued a statement Friday supporting Clinton's decision to
continue research on the missile defense system and leave to his
successor a decision on deploying it.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon will probably delay the next test until January,
administration officials said Thursday. Clinton said it was
important to continue research to answer questions about the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``A national missile defense should be part of a larger strategy
to preserve and enhance the peace, strength and security we now
enjoy and to build an even safer world,'' Clinton said. ``I have
tried to maximize the ability of the next president to pursue that
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon had requested bids for initial construction of the
radar site in Alaska, setting Sept. 7 as the deadline for technical
and cost proposals from contractors. The first contracts would have
had to be awarded by December to permit building to begin next
spring and to have the $60 billion system in place by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush has vigorously endorsed proceeding with the
missile shield, which was first supported by President Reagan to
defend against any threat from the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has been noncommittal about whether he
would proceed with a defense, but has said he supports continued
research and development.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush reiterated his support for the missile defense,
and criticized Clinton for failing to deploy the system. Bush said
that a system should be tested thoroughly to make sure it works,
but that if he was elected president he would renegotiate the
Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration missed an opportunity to develop a missile
defense system that will protect all 50 states, protect ourselves,
our allies, from accidental launch or political blackmail,'' Bush
said. ``Should I become president I will seize the moment and
develop an effective antiballistic missile system.''

 &HT;    MEXICO'S ZEDILLO LEAVES OFFICE A WINNER, DESPITE PARTY'S LOSS
 &HT;    EDs: This story will be updated, re-topped following President
Zedillo's speech scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. CT (8 p.m. ET).
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ He's been dismissed as the accidental president, a
bespectacled economist who often appeared nerdy and ill-tempered.
</P>
<P>
   But three months before he leaves office, Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo is viewed as an exceptionally positive figure at
home and abroad. Friday night, Zedillo delivers his last State of
the Union speech after a six-year term that began in December 1994
with one of the worst economic crises in Mexico's history.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, Zedillo has stabilized Mexico's economy and has
promised that this country will not follow a 30-year pattern of
fiscal crisis that has plagued every new president who takes over.
More than any other accomplishment, however, Zedillo is
acknowledged with helping orchestrate sweeping electoral reforms
that led to the defeat of his own party _ the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI _ after 71 years of presidential
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's defeat, which Zedillo acknowledged gracefully the
night of Mexico's July 2 presidential election, is probably his
greatest legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernesto Zedillo is going to leave office with a great public
legitimacy. I think few Mexicans have much to criticize. Those who
are criticizing him are a small group of PRI insiders who probably
don't number more than 1,000,'' said political analyst Jaime
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who thought the president could still
engineer fraud to win elections,'' Gonzalez added.
</P>
<P>
   But Zedillo knew Mexicans were clamoring for fair elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great defect of Zedillo's presidency,'' Gonzalez said,
``is poverty. And that will remain obscured largely because of what
else he accomplished. Plus, Mexicans know that Zedillo didn't
create poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in December 1995 _ a year after Mexico's over-valued peso
was slashed in half _ 60 percent of the public disapproved of
Zedillo's performance, according to Reforma newspaper. In a poll
Reforma published Friday, of 1,549 Mexicans surveyed nationwide,
Zedillo was given a 69 percent approval rating.
</P>
<P>
   For several months, Zedillo has assured the country that
Mexico's laws have been reformed sufficiently to avoid the cycle of
crises caused by previous presidents' irresponsible handling of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   His has maintained tight fiscal discipline, which critics said
caused suffering among the poor and middle classes, and hurt his
reputation. And he reformed investment and banking laws to avoid
the damaging speculation that swept Mexico prior to his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo reluctantly became the PRI's nominee for president in
1994. He replaced Luis Donaldo Colosio, who was assassinated just a
few months before the election.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of today's high approval ratings, Zedillo's years in
office have been marked by a number of embarrassing events. In 1997
the anti-drug czar he had just appointed, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez
Rebollo, was charged with colluding with one of Mexico's most
wanted traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, 45 people in a pro-Zapatista rebel village
were massacred by PRI loyalists in the southern state of Chiapas.
Zedillo expanded the military presence in Chiapas in response,
deported some human rights observers and has faced criticism for
failing to resolve the original conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The former PRI governor of Quintana Roo state, Mario Villanueva,
went into hiding just as he was to be arrested on trafficking
charges in 1999. And for several years now, vows from Zedillo's
administration to arrest the leaders of a violent Tijuana-based
drug cartel have gone unfulfilled, drawing criticism from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, during a series of crippling floods here, Zedillo lost
his temper when visiting a disaster area and told one man to ``shut
up'' and show him respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zedillo has been unusually stubborn and obstinate,
fundamentalist, and politically, quite clumsy,'' wrote Milenio
magazine columnist Raymundo Riva Palacio. ``But Zedillo is
finishing his term as a president acclaimed throughout the world
for having ushered in the end of a closed system . . . These are
the paradoxes of public life.''

 &HT;    REPUBLICANS: BUSH AD IS INDEPENDENT EFFORT
 &HT;    Moving in the (w) Washington and (p) political categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON The Republican National Committee said Friday that it
had complied with federal campaign finance laws in spending soft
money to run an ad questioning Vice President Al Gore's commitment
to campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The legal issues raised by the 30-second television spot, which
began airing in 16 states Friday, revolve around the involvement of
the Republican presidential nominee, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, in
approving the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a difference between coordination and collusion'' with
the Bush campaign, said Bill Pascoe, the party's press secretary.
``We are allowed to preview ads. We are allowed to coordinate the
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``they do not have decision-making authority.
They don't have veto power. They don't have control.''
</P>
<P>
   Pascoe said widespread press accounts that a week ago Bush had
personally blocked another proposed commercial that also would have
questioned Gore's truthfulness and which also would have been paid
for by the party's soft money coffers were in error.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Bush campaign) suggested that it not run,'' he said.
``They did not order us to do it. That would have been illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Such watchdog groups as the Annenberg Public Policy Center at
the University of Pennsylvania and Common Cause maintain that radio
and TV messages paid for by a political party must be produced
independently of a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Bush and Gore campaigns have $67.5 million in taxpayer
funds to spend on their campaigns, including all ads. Although
federal regulators have rarely intervened, watchdog groups hold
that the laws set up a ``Chinese Wall'' between the campaigns,
which are blocked from using other funds, and any subsequent soft
money spending on their behalf. Soft money, as opposed to money
given directly to a candidate, can be raised in any amounts and
spent for party-building and advocacy ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most dangerous money in American politics is the
unlimited, secret contribution,'' said Fred Wertheimer of Democracy
21, a group that advocates campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The new Republican attack on Gore's credibility _ it also
ridicules his claim that he ``took the initiative in creating the
Internet'' while in Congress _ falls into the broad category of
issue ads.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, such ads can criticize or admire candidates,
but they are not permitted to directly advocate their election or
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1996 campaign, congressional Republicans asserted that
President Clinton, having accepted taxpayer funds to run his
campaign on the condition that he would not spend any other money,
led a Democratic National Committee effort to raise $44 million in
soft money.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Republicans claimed the president and his aides
broke the law when they personally supervised the preparation of
such issue ads, with Clinton allegedly drafting some of the scripts
himself in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   They called on Attorney General Janet Reno to name an
independent counsel to probe whether improper collusion between the
party and the Clinton's re-election drive had spawned ads that had
violated election laws.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno held that such close coordination between a party and
its candidate is not in and of itself illegal. In any case, she
said, it was up to the Federal Election Committee, and not the
Justice Department, to enforce those laws.
</P>
<P>
   After auditing both the Democratic and Republican campaigns, the
commission staff recommended that they each repay millions of
dollars in taxpayer money for having allegedly exceeded their
spending limits. But the commission subsequently refused to
penalize either campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike unaffiliated groups, political parties, which are
regulated by the commission, must report their donors and use a
blend of soft and hard money to pay for their issue ads.
</P>
<P>
   For every $100 spent by the parties on issue ads, $65 can be
soft money, while $35 must be hard money, where campaign donations
are strictly limited. Both major parties, claiming they are
handicapped by the rule, have unsuccessfully sued the commission in
a bid to overturn it.

(For release Sunday, Sept. 3) 
 By RANDALL LANE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the Olympic version of ``Say it ain't so, Joe.''
Disgusted by the bidding scandal emanating from Salt Lake City,
which will host the 2002 Winter Games, David D'Alessandro, the
chief executive of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance, last year
ordered the Olympic rings logo stripped from his company's
television ads, its annual report, even its stationery _ all the
nifty extras intended to help justify a four-year, $55 million
sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   With the opening ceremonies of the 2000 Summer Games set for
September 15 in Sydney, however, D'Alessandro has rediscovered the
Olympic spirit. Not only have the five interlocked rings returned
to John Hancock's documents and advertisements, but D'Alessandro
even committed in February to paying an estimated $65 million to
extend the company's sponsorship through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens on the track, in the pool or on the
field, there may be no more dramatic comeback in 2000 than the one
the International Olympic Committee has made on the sponsorship
front. Committee officials boast of reforms like term limits and an
independent ethics commission. But most sponsors and marketing
experts instead attribute the turnaround to unique qualities that
continue to insulate the Olympics, in commercial terms, from
scandals and fee increases alike.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsorships are the key measure of the Games' financial health.
Back in 1995, NBC locked up television rights through 2008, but
almost all the marketing deals _ sold globally, and by individual
host cities, national committees and even specific teams _ are cut
and recut every four years.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Olympics forbid any commercial signs where the games
take place or on uniforms _ even the Goodyear blimp must cover its
logo _ these sponsorships may be the most ephemeral in all of
sports. All companies receive is an association with the Olympic
movement and whatever they can milk out of it.
</P>
<P>
   That fact worried many people at the IOC after 18 months of bad
news. First were revelations of more than $1 million in cash
payments, gifts and inducements surrounding Salt Lake City's bid;
then the resignations or expulsions of 10 committee members; and,
most recently, two criminal indictments of Utah organizers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Olympics have emerged stronger than ever financially.
``The negative fallout that you would have expected just didn't
happen,'' said Lesa Ukman, editor of IEG Sponsorship Report, a
newsletter published by the International Events Group, which
monitors sponsorships for corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   Ukman said she had expected the scandals to tarnish the Games,
but, she added, ``nothing stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the rest of sports, the scoreboard tells the story. Eleven
global sponsorships _ the deals exclusive to a business category
that cover one cycle of Winter and Summer Games, as well as all 200
national Olympic committees and their teams _ should bring in $605
million for the four years leading up to the Sydney Games, compared
with 10 deals worth $400 million for the period leading up to the
1996 Games in Atlanta, according to the International Events Group.
Sponsorships cost $55 million now, compared with $40 million for
the last cycle.
</P>
<P>
   More tellingly, 9 of the 11 global sponsors _ ``the Olympic
Partners'' or ``TOP'' in committee parlance _ have committed to
extending their relationships through 2004, when the Summer Games
will be held in Athens. Add the Sema Group of Paris, which has
already replaced IBM, a 40-year Olympic sponsor that is ending its
relationship, after the Sydney Games, not over scandal but over
disagreement over how to divide the high-tech category, and the
estimated haul from global sponsors for the four years leading up
to Athens is $650 million. They are paying $65 million each.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to one-time sponsorships, Games held in the United
States draw the biggest amounts, usually from domestic companies,
for local organizing committees. Atlanta brought in some $700
million, versus about $460 million for Sydney, according to the
International Events Group.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scandal in Salt Lake City, some 40 one-time
sponsorships have been sold by organizers for the Games there,
including eight-figure deals with Seiko, General Motors and
Anheuser-Busch, which alone is expected to pay $50 million. The 40
deals are twice the number completed for the 1998 Winter Games in
Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   So where is the outrage? ``What the Games are about is the
athletes,'' not about anything that happened in Salt Lake City long
before their arrival, said Michael Lynch, vice president for event
and sponsorship marketing for Visa USA, an Olympic sponsor for 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   Visa USA was worried enough, however, to conduct focus groups
and surveys, but found that consumers separated the actions of
bureaucrats from those of the athletes _ and that they viewed
sponsors as backing the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors have concluded that the high costs are worth it, if
only because no other event approaches its reach. People in 214
countries watched the Olympics at one time or another in 1996. (In
the United States, 87 percent of television households tuned in at
some point, according to Nielsen Media Research.) And IOC officials
estimate that 3.7 billion of the world's population of 6 billion
will be watching this month.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the other global sporting events _ World Cup soccer
and Formula One auto racing _ draws audiences of that size,
particularly in the United States. Both feature unabashedly
professional players in unabashedly commercial settings, leaving
the Olympics, even with its problems, on the highest plane of sport
in many viewers' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have another platform,'' said Lynch of Visa.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping this unique platform away from competitors also
contributes to an inelastic demand for Olympic sponsorships. ``Fear
drives this in part,'' said John Bevilaqua, who served as vice
president for communications at the 1984 Summer Games in Los
Angeles and now runs a sports consulting firm, Creative Marketing
Strategies. ``They're caught in a box. They might not like the
price, or endorse the scandals or problems, but they feel like they
have to continue with this in order to keep their competitors
out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not that competitors can be removed completely. Ambush marketing
was seen all over Atlanta in 1996, as nonsponsors filled the city's
billboards and ran demonstration booths and vending outlets next to
areas maintained for official sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pound, vice president for marketing and sponsorships for
the IOC, conceded that Atlanta was ``swallowed up in garishness''
and said that the committee had reacted accordingly. Urged on by
the IOC, Sydney has restricted who can buy billboards, created a
system to produce near-immediate cease-and-desist orders against
interlopers and planned public relations counterstrikes against
ambushers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, while McDonald's might pay $55 million to be a global
Olympic sponsor, there is nothing to stop another fast-food chain
from buying an ad during NBC's coverage. And while Eastman Kodak is
among the most loyal Olympic partners, Fuji Photo Film can say it
sponsors USA Track and Field, which oversees the American men's and
women's teams.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, what sponsors receive from an official
Olympic affiliation depends on how well they leverage it. ``You're
just buying a ticket to the dance,'' Bevilaqua said. ``You still
have to rent the tuxedo and buy the corsage.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sponsors, like Visa and McDonald's, report that the
business surges from their Olympic efforts more than cover the
fees. Other sponsors, like Samsung, bask in the company of
better-known ones like IBM and Xerox and can build images through
association. Kodak, for one, uses the Games to show off new
technology, like a Times Square billboard with digitized
photographs of historic Olympic events, and to offer special
contests that are tied to store displays. Virtually all the
companies entertain top clients at the Games, with 2,500 guests for
Kodak alone, tapping into VIP seats and hotel rooms reserved for
them in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   And this year, the IOC will introduce a new revenue stream. Four
years ago, Unilever approached the committee about starting a line
of high-performance personal care products like deodorant, shower
gel and after-shave. A licensing deal was struck, and the product
line, called Physio Sport, has undergone test-marketing in Britain
for the last two years. The committee gets a royalty from sales,
rather than a fixed sponsorship payment.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC could use such a licensing arrangement as leverage
against current sponsors who balk at higher fees or to develop its
own products.
</P>
<P>
   With over $1 billion in sponsorships on display in Sydney,
however, the committee is mindful of who is on the team. When told
by a reporter that the Physio Sport line sounded like a
personal-hygiene version of Gatorade, Pound concurred, with one
exception: ``Make it Powerade,'' he said _ a product of Coca-Cola,
a sponsor.

AMERICAN-STYLE THEME PARKS FLOURISHING IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DRONTEN, Netherlands _ A paunchy kangaroo used to perch atop the
entrance to the old Walibi Flevo theme park here, a red ``W'' on
its sweater for the Walibi Group of Belgium, which ran the park.
</P>
<P>
   The kangaroo is gone now, and the old gate is, too, replaced by
a pastel-and-aluminum art deco facade, capped with the name Six
Flags Holland. On masts nearby flutter the flags of the
Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Spain and the United States
_ the countries where the American owner, Six Flags Inc., a unit of
Premier Parks, operates parks.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem odd that the Dutch and other Europeans, surrounded
by glories like the canals of Amsterdam and the museums and
churches of Brussels, would flock to an American-style theme park.
</P>
<P>
   But they do. Europeans visited theme parks in record numbers
this summer, stirred by spreading affluence, booming tourism and
greater variety. In the last decade the number of theme parks in
Europe has increased by a third, to an estimated 83, according to
Economics Research Associates, which tracks the industry, while the
number of admissions has risen two-thirds, to 101 million last
year, and revenues doubled, to $2.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion is gathering momentum and drawing outside
investment, notably from the United States, transforming the
European industry, long known for family-owned, mom-and-pop parks.
Last year, Europe's 83 parks averaged about 1.2 million visitors
each, far fewer than the 2 million that packed into each of
America's 226 parks. And once inside, Americans were induced into
spending an average of $30 a visitor, against $22 in Europe. ``Our
trans-Atlantic cousins can still teach us a few things,'' David
Camp, an analyst in London for Economics Research Associates, wrote
to clients recently.
</P>
<P>
   But as Europeans rush to catch up, the Continent is increasingly
luring American park operators with expertise in design and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to buying the park and five others in Europe from
Walibi in 1998, Six Flags last year acquired Warner Brothers Movie
World, in Germany's densely populated Ruhr basin, and another
Warner studio park being built outside Madrid. The theme park unit
of Universal Studios also acquired control of Spain's biggest park,
Port Aventura, on the Costa Dorada near Barcelona. Universal, a
part of Seagram Co. that was recently bought by the French
conglomerate Vivendi, has ambitious plans to transform Port
Aventura into Europe's No. 2 park after Disneyland Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outflanked, Disney announced a major expansion last
year of its site at Marne-la-Vallee, east of Paris, including a new
studio park alongside Disneyland Paris.
</P>
<P>
   European companies are getting into the action, too. Global
Family Attractions, the theme park division of Lego System, of
Denmark, will open a $138 million theme park south of Munich in
2002. Like Lego's other parks in Denmark, Britain and California,
it will be based on Lego blocks. In Spain a $400 million park,
Terra Mitica, opened its gates this summer near Alicante in the
southeast, and as many as 20 other projects are in the works.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Not that selling Europeans on magic kingdoms and Wild West
villages comes easily. In Belgium, laws prevent students from
working more than one month a year, so Six Flags continually trains
new crops of students for summer jobs. And not every slogan
translates well. For a season's-end Halloween festival, Six Flags
marketing experts puzzled over whether to call it a Fright Fest,
then dropped the name as untranslatable.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is every project an automatic winner. In Spain, investors
including Ogden Corp. of New York built a park called Isla Magica
on the site of the 1992 Seville world's fair. But Isla Magica ran
up nothing but losses after it opened in 1997, a victim of poor
marketing and high costs. Last spring, Ogden bailed out and sold
its theme park interests to a Greek investor after a consortium of
Spanish banks effectively took over Isla Magica.
</P>
<P>
   Six Flags' strategy in Holland, a kind of pilot project for its
European parks, illustrates the impact of fresh investment and
aggressive marketing. When the old Walibi park closed in October,
Six Flags mobilized hundreds of workers from a dozen countries to
complete almost $40 million of improvements, including the new
entrance, rides like a 115-foot Ferris wheel, and four additional
roller coasters. To generate more spending in the park, Six Flags
increased restaurant capacity by 50 percent and introduced 20
pushcarts offering snacks.
</P>
<P>
   To lure visitors back, Six Flags introduced a season pass, good
at all its parks. To nudge visitors to buy the pass, it increased
the single-entry ticket to 41 Dutch gilders, about $17, from 33.
The season pass is 160 gilders. Spending for television and radio
ads was sharply increased; to draw visitors for events like
conventions, weddings and birthday parties, marketing executives
fanned out to schools, social clubs and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were good facilities doing a reasonable profit,'' said
Daniel P. Aylward, Six Flags' managing director for Europe.
Aylward, a veteran at turning American parks around, ducks and bobs
as he shows a visitor through the park, snatching up litter as he
walks. ``But there were lots of opportunities for advertising and
marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   For local politicians and planners, the investments and the jobs
are welcome. In Holland, the number of park employees, some of them
poorly paid performers, has grown to 700 from 300 in two years. In
Madrid, much of the $300 million investment in the new Warner
studio park is being borne by regional governments. While Six Flags
will manage the park when it opens in 2002, it will have only 5
percent ownership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

   Herman Otte, 38, who knew the old Walibi park, recently drove 60
miles from his home north of Amsterdam after hearing about the
refurbished Dutch park in a television commercial. ``It's more
attractive for children, and far larger,'' he said, as his family
made its way to a snack bar from the new Looney Tunes area, where
Bugs Bunny and his pals had cavorted in a musical sketch. Earlier,
Otte and his daughter Yanique, 3, had enjoyed the big new Ferris
wheel. ``She wasn't afraid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such visitors cheer executives at Six Flags' American parent,
for whom Europe brings the promise of renewed investor favor. After
Six Flags, then called Premier Parks, went public in 1996, its
share price roughly tripled in two years. The shares have tumbled
by 50 percent since the start of the year, though, with analysts
putting the blame on this summer's bad weather in parts of the
United States and a kind of consumer fatigue with leisure and
entertainment products.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly view Europe as a very ripe market to expand their
business,'' said Jill S. Krutick, an analyst with Salomon Smith
Barney. Last month, she cut her recommendation back a notch, to
outperform from buy. ``In Europe, there's an enormous opportunity
to consolidate the market,'' she said. ``It's very inefficient,
with many parks out there,'' adding that the biggest risk for Six
Flags lay in its management of the new growth.
</P>
<P>
   Kieran E. Burke, Six Flags' 43-year-old chairman and chief
executive, described the thrust into Europe as but one prong of a
broader international strategy that included Latin America, where
Six Flags operates a park outside Mexico City, and Asia, where it
is looking for places to invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many respects,'' he said, ``we are really just getting
started,'' adding that the planned expansion would have
``significant ramifications for the value of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, as in the United States, Six Flags' strategy is to
operate regional parks, mostly for nearby day trippers, who often
become season ticket holders who might drop into the parks more
often, if only for a few hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   At Universal Studios, by contrast, the goal is to transform Port
Aventura, which this season was renamed Universal Studios Port
Aventura, into a destination park, perhaps adding a studio park to
the existing theme park, as well as hotels and sport activities
like golf.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Tom Williams, chairman of Universal Studios' theme park
group, does not hesitate to say the goal is ``to turn this
single-gated attraction into a year-round family resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Port Aventura, which opened in 1995, packed in 3 million
visitors this year by the end of July, roughly the number it drew
in all 1999, when attendance rose 11 percent from the year before.
Under Universal's management, Port Aventura this year opened a $30
million submarine ride, Sea Odyssey, and next season plans another
blockbuster, Temple of Fire, in which visitors walk through flames.
By last year, Port Aventura was employing roughly 3,000 people,
generating $85 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Williams appears to be leading the expansion of Port Aventura
into an all-year destination resort along the lines of Universal
Studios Escape in Orlando, whose creation he oversaw before taking
the Universal job a year ago. The immediate plans for Spain, he
said, involve building two 500-room hotels for occupancy in 2003,
with meeting rooms allowing Universal to draw business and
convention travelers, focusing on a European market that Disney
once had pretty much to itself. Unlike Paris, with its cool and
cloudy climate, the Barcelona site, much like Orlando, boasts 300
days of sunshine a year and average temperatures of 72 degrees.
Indeed, the city was the runner-up to Paris when Disney chose the
location for its European park in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the 7 million annual admissions at Six Flags'
parks in Europe are little more than half the 12.5 million
Disneyland Paris packed in last year, and Disney is hardly in
danger of losing its leadership position. Last year, Disney, which
owns 39 percent of the company that runs Disneyland Paris,
announced plans for a new $615 million, 62-acre park that will
focus on film studios, animation and television.
</P>
<P>
   James Rasulo, the 15-year Disney veteran who is chief executive
of the French unit, Euro Disney, said attendance at the site should
rise from 12.5 million visitors last year to 17.5 million when the
new park opens in April 2002. To accommodate the increase, Disney
is negotiating with tour operators and hotel management companies
to build new hotels with a total 1,500 rooms, to add to the six
hotels with 5,160 rooms it now operates.
</P>
<P>
   Rasulo says the pattern in Europe apes that in America.
Improvements in the design and management of regional parks are
lifting the image of theme parks generally, ultimately benefiting
the market leader, Disney. ``Most of these guys are mimicking us,
in the layout of their parks, in the handling of people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exactly the pattern you had in the United States,'' he
added. ``More professionalism, and that drove more business.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: HOW CREED INSPIRES DEVOTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By ANN POWERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scott Stapp obviously thinks he deserves to be a rock
god. The front man for Creed, the Florida-based band that packed
Madison Square Garden on Monday and plays a sold-out show Sunday at
Jones Beach, works to project the aura of a champion.
</P>
<P>
   At the Garden, in a gleaming white shirt and leather hip-huggers
that would have delighted his idol, Jim Morrison, Stapp made so
many heroic moves that it seemed as if this was his qualifying
routine for the front-man olympics. He pranced and crouched and
swept his arms heavenward, straining his enormous baritone, a
foghorn warning all contenders to watch out for his wake.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden audience clearly supported Stapp's victory bid.
Roaring along so enthusiastically that Stapp could regularly take
microphone breaks and let them take over songs, Creed's fans
reached their zenith on ``Higher,'' which rivals Santana's
``Smooth'' as the people's song of the moment. The audience didn't
just sing: They emoted, some nearly weeping, others raising their
hands as if undergoing a conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Stapp was raised in the Pentecostal faith, and although he says
he is not a practicing Christian, his lyrics resound with a
doubting Thomas' fear of God. ``Higher,'' which he says is about
lucid dreaming, still has a decidedly biblical chorus about golden
streets where blind men see. Such images are the meat of Christian
popular culture and have contributed to the band's phenomenal
success.
</P>
<P>
   That success is evident in the numbers. Creed's two albums, ``My
Own Prison'' (1998) and ``Human Clay'' (1999), have sold a total of
nearly 10 million copies, each spending almost a year on the
Billboard charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higher'' is still in the Top 20 singles after 44 weeks,
despite never having been officially released in that form. The
sales are all the more notable because the band records for an
independent label, Wind-Up, as do the much touted teen-age stars on
Jive and the hip-hop artists on Cash Money and No Limit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the praise that the music business usually offers its cash
cows eludes Creed. The group has won awards from industry
publications like Billboard and technical magazines like Guitar
World. But it has no Grammy, boasts only one nomination at next
week's MTV Video Music Awards and has received middling-to-poor
reviews in most publications. Even Spin's recent cover story on the
band mustered only faint praise.
</P>
<P>
   Creed has not fared much better among its peers. Fred Durst of
Limp Bizkit started a feud with Stapp when both bands performed at
a KROQ-sponsored festival this summer, calling him an egomaniac. On
its recent tour, the pop-punk band Blink 182 made fun of Creed
every night.
</P>
<P>
   And so Creed has become the latest rock pariah.
Self-righteousness is part of its problem. Hipsters have little
sympathy for spiritual quests, especially those that bear the
mantle of Christianity. Stapp's lyrics, which have at times been
anti-abortion and anti-affirmative action, don't help.
</P>
<P>
   Yet religious faith is hardly unusual in music. Lauryn Hill made
a profoundly pious 1998 debut album and swept every awards
ceremony. Even the pornography-loving members of Blink 182 embrace
Christianity in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it fair to say that Creed just makes bad music. The
group's metallic rock plunders the outdated grunge style, but the
guitarist Mark Tremonti has his own ethereal approach. Stapp's
lyrics are overblown, but plenty of simplistic pop gets a big
thumbs up from the overextended, product-hungry media.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Creed is that Stapp is a true believer _
perhaps not in Jesus, but in himself, and in the rock 'n' roll he
discovered when he fled his church as a young man. He embodies the
belief that rock music can change lives; it changed his, after all.
He refuses to take it lightly. To many, his furtive embrace of rock
cliches makes him a clown.
</P>
<P>
   Pop music now runs on an engine of subtle self-loathing. Its
movers and shakers agree to believe that this is a degraded realm.
Plastic teen-age pop is admired for being calculated. Sexist and
homophobic lyrics in hard rock and hip-hop are justified because
they are offered in the spirit of a joke. The more self-consciously
trivial an artist can be, the better: He will make for a better
punch line on MTV or VH1.
</P>
<P>
   Earnestness is not completely dead. Artists like Bruce
Springsteen or U2 have earned emeritus status and get away with it.
Young geniuses like D'Angelo and Hill can be serious about soul
music because of their sheer musicality. A few bands have taken up
the countercultural torch, notably Rage Against the Machine and
Pearl Jam. These groups survive the occasional jab because their
fan base so strongly supports them.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, though, a group like Creed plods into the
spotlight, with not a whit of redeeming grooviness, and triumphs.
Such successes shine a harsh light on a void _ the lack of sympathy
for better artists whose passions mount as high. The belief that
popular music can raise consciousness is old hat. Everyone agrees,
except the 10 million people, most more conservative than
countercultural, who love Creed.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Christian rock, by that or any other name, is a
major story. Those who find Creed's pieties troubling might note
that outside the periscope of fashionable pop, such sentiments are
everywhere. The voices raised along with Stapp's prove that faith
is still a strong force for change. But that faith need not only be
self-righteous. It could as easily be pagan, radical and
anarchistic. It can take as many forms as the culture industry
allows.

JASMINE IN NEED OF A TENDER TOUCH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
(c) 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
Q: I bought a night-blooming jasmine that was in full sun at the
nursery. I brought it home and put it in my atrium. The leaves
started turning yellow and dropping, so I figured maybe it had too
much sun, so I brought it inside by a bright window, but not much
direct sun. All the leaves are pale green or turning yellow and
dropping. Can I grow it outside? Supposedly it blooms in summer,
but it is not doing anything. _ C.M., Cypress, Texas
<TEXT>
<P>
   A: &UR;  &LR; Move the plant outside. But since it is in poor condition,
gradually introduce it to sun. Place in a partially sunny area, and
for the first few days, avoid the intense afternoon rays. Don't
overwater. This causes leaves to yellow and drop. Water, allow the
soil to dry some, then water again.
</P>
<P>
   When the scorching heat and drought eases, plant the
night-blooming jessamine (Cestrum nocturnum) in a sunny or
partially sunny spot. Plant in an organically enriched,
well-draining soil. Mulch, and reapply mulch for protection during
cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   This plant does produce small, but highly fragrant flowers mid
or late summer into fall. Those in our garden have just a few buds.
There's a chance yours may bloom this year, but I would just
concentrate on restoring healthy growth for now.
</P>
<P>
   This shrub is inclined to be irregular in form. Prune heavily in
late winter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Would you advise when and how to fertilize and prune
camellias, crape myrtles, gardenias, hibiscus, jasmine, roses and
wisteria? _ A.J.C., Houston, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: &UR;  &LR; Proper soil and proper light are keys to good shrub and vine
health. An organically enriched soil that drains well will serve
all these plants well and decreases the need of frequent
fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   Grow camellias in a raised bed of equal parts topsoil, sand and
pine bark to help ensure good health and growth. A slightly acidic
soil with a pH of 5-7 is important. Organic matter is important as
it boosts soil porosity, crucial to camellia health, as well as
acidity as the pine bark breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   Camellias grow well in containers, too.
</P>
<P>
   Camellias need a moist but not soggy soil. City water is
alkaline, and when used on camellias, it often becomes necessary to
counteract alkalinity by adding agricultural sulfur or a
quicker-acting chemical such as iron sulfate to acidify the soil.
Yellow, chlorotic foliage is a symptom of an overly alkaline soil.
Yellow leaves also can be a sign of poor drainage or too much sun.
</P>
<P>
   A well-draining spot that receives morning sun and some filtered
shade is ideal. Pine trees create an excellent environment for
camellias. It's best to protect the plants from cold winds and hot
afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   Camellias are slow growers and therefore do not require heavy
fertilization. Do not overfertilize. Do not fertilize the first
year after planting. The Houston Camellia Society suggests using a
commercial camellia fertilizer after flowering and again around
mid-May. A light application of cottonseed meal, a slow-release
organic nitrogen fertilizer, is helpful in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   Prune camellias after flowering.
</P>
<P>
   Crape myrtles are not picky about soil, but a humus-enriched,
well-draining soil is ideal. Crapes have the reputation of being
drought-tolerant once established, but don't skimp water during dry
periods such as we're experiencing now. There are wilted crapes
around town.
</P>
<P>
   The key to a full head of blooms is an abundance of sun and good
air circulation. These conditions also discourage powdery mildew, a
fungal disease that can be troublesome to some crape varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Many prune heavily with the thought that more new wood produces
more flowers. Do not top crapes. Such heavy pruning can lead to
diminished tree health. The vigorous new growth is weakly attached
and prone to snap in bad weather. This, in turn, makes the tree
more susceptible to insects and disease.
</P>
<P>
   In January or February, remove weak and dead wood (some remove
any wood smaller than a pencil) and water sprouts along the
branches. This will encourage a clean, strong and naturally shaped
skeleton. Keep root suckers removed at all times. Remove spent
blooms to encourage more flowers.
</P>
<P>
   When grown in good soil, crape myrtles do not require heavy
fertilization. Crapes bloom on new wood, and an early spring
application of a 3-1-2 formula will encourage that growth. Some
gardeners apply a formula with more phosphorus, represented by the
second number in the formula, but phosphorus does build up in our
soils, so don't overdo it. An application of a balanced fertilizer
in June is beneficial when soil fertility is low. But avoid
late-summer fertilization, which encourages growth susceptible to
early freeze damage.
</P>
<P>
   Fertilize gardenias in early spring, around March. Use a
gardenia-specific formula. Gardenias prefer a slightly acidic soil
and such formulas can help prevent overly alkaline conditions. You
might also occasionally apply an organic fertilizer such as fish
emulsion during the growing season. Apply a foliar spray and apply
to the soil around the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The best times to prune gardenias are in early spring to remove
frost damage and after they bloom for shape. Many are setting new
buds in late summer, so those pruned then lose the next season's
blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Hibiscus evolved in volcanic areas where they became accustomed
to soils high in potassium and magnesium. They prefer fertilizers
higher in potassium, represented by the last number in the
fertilizer formula, than phosphorus, represented by the middle
number. Continued use of a high-middle-number fertilizer will
eventually block the plant's ability to use soil nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Hibiscus prefer a fertilizer with a dominant ammoniacal
nitrogen. A fertilizer with urea as the main nitrogen source can be
harmful. There are specially formulated hibiscus fertilizers
readily available. Some local nurseries carry their own products.
</P>
<P>
   Fertilize regularly, frequently and lightly. Some fertilize
biweekly, others monthly. Water before and after fertilizing,
especially if you use a dry fertilizer. Fertilize in the cooler
parts of the day. Frequent watering washes nutrients away quickly,
so more frequent fertilizing may be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   These tropical plants also respond to Epsom salt, a source of
magnesium sulfate. Frequency rate of application varies from three
times a year, lightly, to a tablespoon per gallon of pot size
monthly with the fertilizer. Occasional applications of fish
emulsion also are beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want larger shrubs rarely prune. Those gardeners who
prefer late-spring and summer blooms prune during late fall and
winter. Unless winter protection can be provided, prune when tender
new growth won't be subject to freezing temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Using clean, sharp tools, remove dead or diseased wood. Cut back
into green wood, pruning to about a quarter-inch above an
outward-pointing bud so that new growth will be away from the
center of the shrub. This allows light and air to the interior.
Cuts should be at a slant so water will roll off. Do not leave
stubs, as these invite decay.
</P>
<P>
   Remove branches that grow toward the center of the plant to
promote more light and air penetration. Prune as much as 30 percent
of the plant at one time.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure which jasmine you mean, but you'll be safe with an
early application of a balanced, slow-release formula. Prune after
bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Roses like slightly acidic soil _ a pH of 6.5 is ideal _ and
good drainage is essential. A soil rich in organic matter will help
provide nutrients as well as ensure drainage. Amend gumbolike soil
with compost. Many rosarians add smaller amounts of alfalfa
pellets, fish meal, cottonseed meal and/or bone meal to enrich
growing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Begin a fertilizer program with new growth in the spring. Then
fertilize monthly or lightly every two weeks until September. Avoid
overfertilizing, and water before and after applying any
fertilizer. Composted manure, compost and other organic supplements
are beneficial. There are also numerous commercial rose fertilizers
available.
</P>
<P>
   Prune roses on Valentine's Day, as they benefit from pruning
before they break dormancy. Pruning removes weak wood that drains
the plant, decreases the chances of disease, and promotes new
growth. Study each rose to determine pruning needs.
</P>
<P>
   Modern and antique roses vary in their pruning needs.
</P>
<P>
   Antiques grow on their own rootstock and do not require heavy
pruning, just a light shaping. Prune once-a-year bloomers after
flowering. Remove any dead or diseased canes and twiggy growth.
Then give the overall plant a light trim. Repeat bloomers can be
lightly trimmed on Valentine's Day. During the growing season,
occasional light trims may be in order after a flowering spree to
shape a vigorous repeat bloomer.
</P>
<P>
   Modern roses need more. Prune the bush back by about a third of
its height. Make 45-degree cuts a quarter-inch above a growth or
bud eye on the outside of the cane. A growth or bud eye is a small
bulge with a small ``eye'' and a horizontal crease below it. When
the plant breaks dormancy, the eye will become a new shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting to outside bud eyes encourages outward growth rather
than growth toward the center of the plant, which would decrease
air circulation and, therefore, plant health. Cutting at 45-degree
angles prevents moisture from accumulating on the tips, again
discouraging disease.
</P>
<P>
   Prune modern roses to get rid of nonproductive, damaged and
unwanted canes. Look for canes that are brittle, brown or black.
Remove this old or dead wood at the bud union. Remove spindly stems
smaller than a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   Prune any canes that emerge below the bud union that bump at the
base of the plant where a preferred rose has been grafted onto
hardy rootstock. These are rootstock suckers, and they may bloom,
but the flowers will differ from those produced above the graft,
and these suckers sap energy from the desired, productive canes
that grow from the bud union.
</P>
<P>
   Leave three or four healthy canes for an open, vase-shaped
effect. This gives the rose breathing room, opening the center for
better air circulation, which in turn helps discourage fungal
diseases such as black spot. Sunlight better penetrates an open
rose.
</P>
<P>
   Climbers are pruned according to their bloom time. Those that
flower once a year are pruned after they bloom. Repeat-bloom
climbers are generally pruned while dormant, so prune these when
pruning modern hybrid teas. Prune all but three or four healthy
young canes. Remove unproductive canes, dead or diseased canes, old
and weak canes. If the rose is grafted, remove any rootstock
suckers.
</P>
<P>
   Wisteria can be aggressive, so do not overfertilize. A fertile
soil goes a long way. Prune heavily after bloom. Avoid winter
pruning or you'll remove spring flowers.

&HT;     GIVE THE PRESIDENT A BREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HELEN THOMAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Give the guy a break. President Clinton, that is.
Enough is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the punishment has fit the crime _ impeachment by the
House, trial by the Senate, public humiliation, ridicule from
late-night comedians, interminable investigations and huge fines
and legal bills not only for himself but his staffers and close
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Robert Ray is pursuing Clinton with the same
relentless zeal that drove Ray's predecessor, Kenneth Starr. In
some eyes, Ray is emulating the fictional Inspector Javert in ``Les
Miserables,'' as Starr did when he was on the Clinton case.
</P>
<P>
   Ray goes public often. In an article that he recently wrote for
the New York Times he defended his move to impanel a federal grand
jury to consider criminal evidence against Clinton because of ``the
gravity of the situation.'' He conceded that the country may be
``weary of the subject'' but insisted that he is bound by his oath
of office to bring the matter to closure.
</P>
<P>
   In revisiting the Monica Lewinsky matter, Ray's avowed mission
is to prove that no one, not even a president, is above the law. He
said his duty is to present evidence of perjury and obstruction of
justice to the panel but added that he has not yet decided whether
to seek an indictment of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ray may be hard put to find jurors who are not familiar with the
intimate details of the accusations against the president and who
have not already made up their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has acknowledged his affair with the former White House
intern and admitted, in effect, that he lied about it. He has
expressed remorse and asked forgiveness before religious
gatherings. He has said he hopes his backsliding will not hurt Vice
President Al Gore in his quest for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Those who really count with him _ his wife Hillary and daughter
Chelsea _ have forgiven him.
</P>
<P>
   In the excruciating Senate trial, he had only one thing going
for him _ the American people, who did not want him removed from
office. Apparently his transgressions fell short of high crimes and
misdemeanors with the senator-jurors, who also read the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Still hanging over his head is the effort by some Arkansas Bar
Association members to disbar him. Clinton's lawyers say that would
be harsh and unprecedented punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Hasn't he paid enough of a price for his dalliances?
</P>
<P>
   For his detractors, probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has done a lot of soul-searching. Two years ago, he
promised to meet regularly with three spiritual counselors, and
they say he has been faithful to that pledge. Rev. Philip J.
Wogaman, pastor of Foundry United Methodist Church here, said
Clinton is still ``on a journey and is making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Another counselor, the Rev. Tony Campolo, an evangelical Baptist
minister and a professor emeritus at Eastern College in St. Davids,
Pa., said that in seeking redemption, Clinton is asking himself:
``What went wrong? How could I have been so wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   Campolo said Clinton is looking at his earlier life to find the
answers but added that ``he is not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Campolo also revealed that for Clinton it is ``payback time'' _
he wants to help staffers who are burdened with enormous legal
bills as a result of the unending investigations into his
transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People are always asking, ``What will Clinton do after he leaves
the White House?''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. After a decompression period, he will be busy.
Among his priorities: building his presidential library in Little
Rock. He also will write his memoirs, which will command a hefty
advance.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years in the White House he should have a lot to
say. But don't forget that presidential memoirs are usually
self-serving and self-protective.
</P>
<P>
   If he loses his license to practice law, under Securities and
Exchange Commission rules he will not be able to serve on any of
the blue-chip corporate boards that probably would love to add him
to their rosters.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his predecessors, Clinton will seek to travel a lot
as a world peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Campolo said the president is ``looking for a purpose'' when his
presidency is over, and he sees Jimmy Carter, one of the most
activist former presidents, as a role model. Speaking recently at a
fundraiser in New Jersey, Clinton told his fans, ``I'm coming back
to where you are. This is the first time in 26 years I haven't been
running for anything. I'm going to be a citizen activist.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if Chelsea Clinton may be having second thoughts
about going to medical school to become a pediatrician.
Globe-trotting with her parents has made her the most traveled
presidential offspring in history. As a result, she has become more
interested in international and political affairs. Aides say the
attention she has gotten on her journeys to foreign lands has
whetted her appetite for public life. She told CNN-TV interviewer
Larry King she may decide to go to Oxford University in England,
one of her father's alma maters, after she graduates from Stanford
next spring. She has taken a sabbatical from her studies this
semester to help her mother campaign for a Senate seat from New
York.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sultry air will cover a large area from the central and southern
Mississippi Valley to the Atlantic Seaboard. A slow-moving
disturbance will continue to promote plenty of clouds and clusters
of showers from the Appalachians to the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Weak winds aloft will favor some slow-moving thunderstorms,
which will produce local downpours that can cause flooding in poor
drainage areas. A wavering front from the southern Great Lakes to
northern New England will separate the warm, humid air mass from
much cooler air to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Stifling heat will persist over much of the southern Plains. The
chance for some cooling afternoon showers from northeastern Texas
to Arkansas will be greater than in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably cool and showery conditions will envelop the
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies. The Southwest will be sunny
and hot.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: AUGUST EXTREMES
</P>
<P>
   The last days of August were fitting for a summer replete with
extremes. In Dallas and Little Rock, Ark., the nearly cloudless
skies in August's final few days concluded a month in which not a
drop of rain fell in either city. On Thursday the mercury reached
110 in Houston, tying the record high temperature there. Meanwhile,
exceptionally cool summer weather spread over parts of the West
Coast states. On Wednesday, San Jose, Calif., had its coolest
August afternoon on record when the mercury struggled to reach only
66 degrees.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ ``Concorde 4590, you have flames, you have flames behind
you,'' the control tower warned the crew of the plane, which had
just lifted off at about 200 mph from Charles de Gaulle airport.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, the Concorde's navigator said Engine 2 had
malfunctioned and the pilot ordered, ``Engine fire procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the co-pilot warned: ``Watch out, the indicator, the
indicator, the indicator!'' meaning the speed was dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really burning,'' the air controller told the crew, ``and
I'm not sure it's coming from the engine.''
</P>
<P>
   The first realization that Air France's Flight 4590 was in
trouble was in those exchanges, released Thursday night on the Web
site of the French Air Accident Investigation Bureau and elaborated
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators still defended their July 28 assumption that an
exploding tire had ruptured wing fuel tanks, starting a major fire.
It was also revealed Friday that an inspection of the runway was
skipped that day because of a fire drill.
</P>
<P>
   But questions began to be raised as to whether the pilot had
unwittingly made a crucial mistake: Told by his navigator that
Engine No. 2 was malfunctioning and by the tower that flames were
shooting out, he apparently assumed Engine No. 2 was on fire and
ordered it cut off.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, perhaps not knowing it, he was losing power in Engine
No. 1, next to it. That may have left the plane with too little
thrust to fly. Investigators later found no marks of fire in either
engine; only the wing and fuselage were scorched.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's preliminary report carefully does not criticize any
decision made that day. ``The crew,'' it notes, ``had no way of
knowing the nature of the fire nor of fighting against it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Le Monde, the Paris daily, asked: ``What would have happened
if he had kept Engine No. 2 working? It's impossible to say whether
the crash could have been avoided.'' And the author of the article,
Michel Alberganti, said a careful analysis of the transcript and
report led him to the conclusion that ``it was the wrong decision''
but understandable given what the pilot was told.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell from the transcript exactly what the crew
knew. They did not remark aloud on Engine No. 1. One of the plane's
black boxes indicated later that its power decreased, increased,
then decreased again, for unknown reasons. After the pilot ordered
power cut to No. 2, he was distracted by the landing gear's failure
to retract. Meanwhile, the co-pilot kept drawing attention to the
airspeed indicator.
</P>
<P>
   While those decisions were being made on July 25 in the 77
seconds between 4:43:13 p.m. , when the controller spotted the
fire, and 4:44:30, when the last sound was recorded, amateur
photographers on the highways below were capturing the flight's
death throes: a Concorde filled with German tourists hoping to be
on a supersonic rendezvous with a New York cruise ship was seen
fatally crippled, spewing flames and smoke as it roared low over
the suburbs and farms north of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots were allowed a half-minute of hope that they could
make Le Bourget, a small airport used by private planes. But then
the plane banked sharply left and crashed into a small hotel in a
neighborhood known as ``The Goosefoot of Gonesse.'' All 109 on
board were killed, as were four on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The final report will not be issued until the plane is rebuilt
in a naval air-base hangar, which could take a year, but
investigators still believe that just as the Concorde had reached
195 mph _ too fast to abort takeoff _ a stray piece of bent metal
stabbed deep into one of its tires. The tire, hot from friction,
exploded, sending chunks of rubber as heavy as 8 pounds flying
upward with such force that they punctured the huge triangular left
wing. The plane lifted off, but as the jet fuel ignited, the
left-side engines malfunctioned. The pilot reacted, but the plane
lost speed.
</P>
<P>
   The transcript picked up controllers scrambling to call the
airport's fire brigade, clearing Runway 26 and cooly telling the
crew: ``4590, you have fierce flames behind you. At your
convenience, you have priority to return to the runway.'' But it
could not. With fire alarms gonging in the cockpit and an automatic
warning system whooping, the pilot, Christian Marty, was heard to
say: ``Too late. No time, no.''
</P>
<P>
   The last recorded words were from the co-pilot, Jean Marcot:
``Negative. We're trying Le Bouget . . . No.''
</P>
<P>
   For about nine seconds, there were noises described as
``unclear, sounds like exertion,'' and then the recording ended. It
was the first fatal crash in the 26 years that Concordes have been
flying commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators warned that any of France's five remaining
Concordes, now grounded, could suffer the same burst-tire accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no certitude that, if another Concorde were to make
the same flight today, the same thing would not happen,''
Paul-Louis Arslanian, director of the air investigation bureau,
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There have been six previous cases of damage to Concorde gas
tanks. In a 1979 incident at Washington's Dulles Airport, rubber
debris and wheel shrapnel tore completely through a wing, but the
plane landed safely.
</P>
<P>
   British aviation officials said last month that their Concordes
were modified in 1993 with landing gear deflectors to protect the
wings in a tire blowout. French ones, they said, were not.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of the 17-inch strip of metal found on the runway that
investigators believe slashed the tire was posted on the agency's
Web site; it is long and thin, bent in a 7-shape and has pairs of
holes, some of which contained ``cherry'' rivets, the report said.
The type of plane it came from has not been identified.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of a piece of the blown tire was also released; it has
a clear 12-inch slice in it.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the crash, the usual three daily inspections of
the runway for debris did not take place, Arslanian said Friday,
because a fire drill interfered. The last complete inspection took
place at 4:30 a.m., he said, and there was a cursory sweep of parts
of the airport at noon.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying causes are, of course, of great interest to the
families of the 100 victims, whose lawyers are now trying to form a
class action; one said he hoped to win $270 million, arguing that
the typical award in American plane crashes is $2.7 million per
victim.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, investigators said they had recovered roughly
5,000 pieces of jewelry and other valuables like watches, lighters
and eyeglasses from the wreckage. ``Just imagine what people going
on a cruise on an ocean liner would take with them,'' a spokesman
for the Air Transport Police was quoted as saying. The police said
the valuables would be photographed and the photos given to
victims' embassies so relatives could claim them. The plane's 100
passengers included 96 Germans, two Danes, an Austrian and an
American. The nine crew members were French. Two of those killed on
the ground were Poles.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's report can be found at www.bea-fr.org in French and
at www.bea-fr.org/anglaise/index.htm in English translation.

`HIGHLANDER: ENDGAME': IMMORTALS WITH GRUDGES AND ENDLESS BACK
STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The rules have been broken; one of your kind has gone
renegade,'' the good guy immortal, Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul), of
the clan MacLeod, is told in ``Highlander: Endgame.'' The evil
immortal, Jacob Kell (Bruce Payne), has gone on a rampage. And such
an earthshaking event hasn't transpired on Earth since, well, since
the last ``Highlander'' movie, when the evil immortal Kane had to
be stopped by good guy Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert), of the
clan MacLeod. Kell wants to torture Connor for all eternity because
Connor killed his father centuries before. (Though, to be fair,
Kell and others burned Connor's mother at the stake.)
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Endgame''is only 95 minutes long, there is so much
exposition that some may find it as confusing as the Samuel Beckett
play of the same name. In the ``Highlander'' mythology immortals
walk the earth; they modestly refer to themselves as ``the seeds of
legend.'' Each time one is killed in battle _ his head has to be
cut off, leading to a light show that could be right out of an Ozzy
Osbourne concert _ his spirit and power enter the victor. I'm sure
there's a lengthy monograph on the homoeroticism of ``Highlander''
somewhere at the Sorbonne, and ``Endgame'' lets Kell jokingly
allude to it. This may be the only thing that will keep those
unaware of the ``Highlander'' mythology interested.
</P>
<P>
   The mythology began in the 1986 fantasy film ``Highlander,''
which has the distinction of being one of the most overdirected
films of that decade. The camera flies around so much you assume
the camera operators were being paid by the mile. Lambert starred
in the sequels, which lost whatever sprightliness the first one
had, perhaps because that quality was embodied by Sean Connery,
playing Lambert's mentor and, even more absurdly, a Spaniard with a
Scottish lilt. (The inappropriate accents are a big part of
``Highlander''; Connor seems to have been singled out to be an
immortal because he has the least convincing Scottish accent in the
country.)
</P>
<P>
   Connery's gargantuan, jovial presence _ he seemed to be in on
some private joke _ was glimpsed briefly in the second
``Highlander,'' where he had a cameo that was such a brazen attempt
to bring in an audience that he seemed to be cashing his check on
the set. The other sequels have become increasingly grim and
dolorous; it's no fun having to live forever. That's the theme of
``Endgame.'' And to set up this picture the producers use endless
flashbacks, because the audience unfamiliar with ``Highlander''
movies and the spinoff television series, in which all of the
immortals seemed to have moved to Canada, have to be brought up to
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Connor, looking about as miserable as anyone who has lived for
several centuries can, has gone into seclusion for 10 years, a
revelation that means the movie sequels apparently never took
place, since they were set in the 1990s. (``Endgame'' doesn't even
bother to be consistent with its own phony past.) He leaves the
sanctuary, called Sanctuary no less, to join Duncan so that
together they can keep Kell from being the last surviving immortal.
(The immortal creed is, There can be only one!) There's so much
exposition that Paul, whose impish Duncan was the protagonist of
the television spinoff, doesn't even appear until 10 minutes into
the action.
</P>
<P>
   And the action is the best thing in the picture, taking place in
warehouses and abandoned buildings that make the film look like an
Einsturzende Neubauten stage show. It's nice to see mindless
violence back in a B picture, where it belongs, and the swordplay
is impressive. When ``Highlander'' sticks to the hand-to-hand
battles and doesn't try to offer deeper thoughts on the life of an
immortal, it works on its own terms. (No one explains how the two
Britons, Connor and Duncan, learned sword-fighting techniques that
look Japanese, but it's probably pointless to ask too many
questions here.)

BIG JAPANESE COMPANY SEEKS RELIEF FROM CREDITORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKI TANIKAWA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A major Japanese construction company, Kumagai Gumi, is
expected to ask its creditors to forgive 450 billion yen in debt,
or $4.25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company joins a number of debt-burdened businesses, many of
them construction companies, that have asked for relief from their
creditors. Japan's construction industry has been among the most
heavily indebted.
</P>
<P>
   Kumagai Gumi said Friday in a statement only that it was in
talks with its main creditor, Sumitomo Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But reports here said that in return for debt relief, Kumagai
Gumi had agreed to cut jobs sharply and to reduce back orders to
half their current level. The company, the reports said, is also
seeking a partnership with Kajima Corp., one of the largest
Japanese general contractors, which would inject fresh capital into
Kumagai Gumi.
</P>
<P>
   A number of big contractors including Tobishima, Aoki and Haseko
have already reached accords with their lenders, seeking waivers of
debt in the hundreds of billions of yen. ``All weak construction
companies are close to having some form of debt relief,'' said
Garry Evans, a strategist with HSBC Securities here.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have not been so lucky. Sogo, a major
department-store chain that collapsed in July, had asked banks to
forgive loans totaling 631.9 billion yen, or nearly $6 billion. The
bailout plan fell through when one of the biggest creditors,
Shinsei Bank _ acquired last year by a group of foreign investors
led by Ripplewood Holdings of New York _ balked. (Shinsei is also a
major creditor of Kumagai Gumi.)
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say that construction companies are too politically
connected to fail. ``Construction firms are basically not allowed
to go bust,'' Evans said. In Japan the construction industry
employs more than 10 percent of the work force, and construction
workers often campaign in support of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party.

<P>
   STANDARD CHARTERED ACQUISITION
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a recent buying spree in Asia where it earns two
thirds of its income, Standard Chartered PLC said it will pay $1.32
billion in cash to buy Chase Manhattan Corp.'s Hong Kong credit
card and retail banking division. The acquisition would make
Standard Chartered the biggest credit card provider in Hong Kong
with one quarter of the market. The British-based bank said it
would fund the acquisition by issuing 50 million new shares at 915
pence and by selling a British subsidiary to Lloyds/TSB for 627
million pounds. Standard Chartered's shares rose by 1 pence to 955
pence.
</P>
<P>
   TELEFONICA PROFIT FALLS
</P>
<P>
   Spanish telecommunications giant Telefonica SA reported net
profit for the first half of the year at 989 million euros ($881
million), a 3 percent drop from the same period in 1999. In a
statement, the company said that positive results from its domestic
cell-phone operations and its international activities helped
compensate for weakness in other areas, such as traditional
services. Earnings from Latin American operations were almost 125
million euros, up 31 percent over the first half of last year,
reflecting that region's improving economy. On the Madrid bolsa,
Telefonica's share prices rose as high as 8.7 percent at the news.
Giving in to pressure from the board, chairman Juan Villalonga
resigned just over a month ago ending months of uncertainty over
the company's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ASIA
</P>
<P>
   DAEWOO CHARGES POSSIBLE
</P>
<P>
   Former chairman Kim Woo-Choong of Daewoo Group and as many as 40
executives from the conglomerate may face criminal charges for
inflating the asset values of several affiliates, which worsened
the assessment of the business group's liabilities, the watchdog
Financial Supervisory Commission said Friday. Daewoo Group, which
was at one time the second largest business group in South Korea,
is being sold off in pieces in order to repay debts totaling $79
billion. The state-run watchdog agency said it is considering
possible penalties against accounting companies as well.
</P>
<P>
   KOREAN BANK APPLICATION
</P>
<P>
   The Asia Development Bank said that North Korea has applied for
membership status, which would give the impoverished nation access
to low-interest loans to rebuild its outdated infrastructure and
feed its people. As part of its conciliatory gestures, South Korea
has tried to help North Korea gain membership in the development
bank. However, the United States and Japan have opposed even
observer status in the bank, because of concerns about North
Korea's sponsorship of terrorism. The development bank said North
Korea's application has been referred to its shareholders.

&HT;     U.S., CANADA SHOULD CONSIDER MEXICO'S ECONOMIC PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>

years.)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sweeping out of Mexico like a fast-moving tropical
storm, Vicente Fox, who revolutionized politics in his homeland,
has injected some revolutionary concepts into Mexico's relationship
with the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In separate visits with leaders of his two northern neighbors,
Mexico's president-elect suggested that the two countries consider
helping Mexico expand its economy in order to create new,
well-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, would deter workers from trying to leave Mexico.
At the same time, he urged a shift in American policy so that
Mexican workers coming to the United States would be viewed ``as an
opportunity, not a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The towering (6 foot, 4 inch) former Coca Cola executive, who
will be inaugurated as president of Mexico Dec. 1, also spoke in
visionary terms about developing a closer interdependence among the
three North American allies.
</P>
<P>
   His remarkable election on July 2 as the candidate of the
center-right National Action Party marked the first time in 71
years that a candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI) had been defeated. Throughout Mexico, people rejoiced
over Fox's triumph.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Fox Aug. 24 at the White House, President
Clinton also predicted an eventual ``growing interdependence in our
hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not commit himself on the specifics of Fox's proposal.
But Clinton, whose term ends Jan. 20, said of interdependence, ``I
think it will be the way of the world. I regret I won't be around
for a lot of it. But it is a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who also
met with Fox, were equally noncommittal on his proposals. But the
Republican presidential nominee, whose state has the longest border
with Mexico, said he will continue to enforce laws that protect
America's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidential nominees are internationalists who can be
counted on to seek improved relations with all of Latin America,
especially Mexico, which, next to Canada, is the United States'
chief trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   Fox insists that in this global era barriers must come down
along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Mexico to visit Washington and Ottawa, Fox said
that ``building up walls putting up arms (and) dedicating billions
of dollars to avoid migration (are) not the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, debate over Mexican migration into the United
States has festered, and sometimes it has exploded. In 1994
California voters passed a ballot initiative, Proposition 187, that
prohibited children of illegal immigrants from going to school and
receiving most health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, supported by then Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, was
later declared unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Its impact was to help diminish GOP power in a state with a huge
Hispanic population that had been dominated by Republicans for
years. The furious reaction of Latinos and Asian Americans to what
they saw as immigrant-bashing by California Republicans was a big
factor in the 1998 election of Gray Davis, the state's first
Democratic governor in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, we in the United States have failed to look seriously
at the problems of Mexico. For too long we viewed Mexico through
the stereotypes created by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Few visitors to Mexico noticed its vast areas of poverty and
deprivation. Instead, they refreshed themselves with visits to
Acapulco and Cancun, inspected magnificent Mayan ruins and enjoyed
Mexico's Ballet Folklorico.
</P>
<P>
   Every six years, Mexico would automatically elect the
presidential candidate of the ruling PRI party. The new leader
would meet with the U.S. president and exchange pleasantries, and
the United States would pledge various forms of aid to its sister
republic.
</P>
<P>
   But poverty-stricken Mexicans continue to try in every way to
sneak into this country, which in turn spends millions of dollars
each year trying to keep them out.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's visionary proposals should neither be rejected out of hand
nor accepted without thorough study. But Mexico needs our help, and
we need to find better ways to curtail illegal immigration from
that country.
</P>
<P>
   If we are to move together into a brighter future, we cannot do
so simply by cursing illegal immigrants or building higher,
stronger fences along the border.
</P>
<P>
   There must be, as Fox and Clinton have suggested, more
enlightened ways to bolster Mexico's economy and job expansion
while at the same time reducing illegal immigration and
strengthening our own economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come to try a new approach.

BUSH SAYS GORE AD A RESPONSE TO ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN JOHNSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAFAYETTE, La. _ George W. Bush Friday said a
``tongue-in-cheekish'' ad questioning Al Gore's credibility was
justified by Democrats' attacks on him, and he signaled a new line
of more aggressive campaigning by urging hundreds at a rally in the
bayou heat: ``Let's get after 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading a planned day of rest for two quick stops in the Texas
border states of Louisiana and Arkansas, the Texas governor told
reporters he had no apologies for a Republican National Committee
ad that jabs at the vice president's statements about campaign
fund-raising and inventing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Although he personally approved the spot, Bush sought to keep
his distance, saying at one point, ``I appreciate the Republicans
coming to my defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Republican presidential contender said the ad
was justified in light of the $30 million in advertising aired by
the Democrats during the GOP's convention in Philadelphia, as well
as Gore's statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the man's own words,'' Bush said. ``Let the American
people judge whether it's accurate or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain how it was not the type of negative campaigning
he decries, Bush replied: ``I thought it was tongue-in-cheek, I
thought it was tongue-in-cheekish.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign disagreed and said Bush was responding to
recent public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's downward-spiraling poll numbers have
apparently made him so dizzy that he can no longer distinguish
negative from positive,'' said Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for the
vice president. ``His ridiculous statement is today's sign of just
how desperate the Bush campaign has become and how out-of-touch
George W. Bush is with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush first stopped in Louisiana, where it was even hotter than
the 105-degree temperatures that have enveloped his hometown of
Austin, Texas. Peeling off his coat and rolling up his shirt
sleeves, Bush dripped sweat as he declared to an airport rally:
``Labor Day's the traditional start, and I'm ready, and I like what
I see. I like what I hear not only here in the state of Louisiana,
but all across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor lambasted the Clinton administration for raising
taxes instead of cutting them, and for failing to get prescription
drug coverage for senior citizens. He noted that the state's
Democratic senator, John Breaux, had pushed a bipartisan Medicare
reform plan that included prescription drugs, but that the
administration quashed his panel's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to have a president who will work with the likes of
John Breaux, and make sure the promise of Medicare and the promise
of Social Security is met and kept, and I'm ready to take the
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also played to the hometown crowd by saying he supported
oil and natural gas exploration off the coast in the Gulf of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate very much your support,'' he said. ``Let's get
after 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush later read to students and delivered a speech on reading at
the College Hill Elementary School in Texarkana, Ark. Saturday he
was to receive his first national security briefing from the
Central Intelligence Agency, standard fare for presidential
nominees since 1952.

   CHOW-HOTSPOT (New York) _ Michael Chow, owner of the three
restaurants that bear his name, never intended to deliver diced
squab to the unremarkable. But for a good portion of the 1990s it
was largely the cachet-deficient who showed up, not only in New
York, but also in the Mr. Chows in Los Angeles and London. In the
past year or so, though, the Chow here has re-emerged as a
destination for all subspecies of the moneyed and glamorous, with
dumpling connoisseurs from the suburbs there, too. By Ginia
Bellefante.

   ROBOT-DOGS (New York) _ After Sony's tail-wagging success with
its Aibo robo-dog _ it sold out its entire 45,000-unit production
run of the $2,500 electric critters last winter _ at least four toy
companies are putting their own, less expensive versions on the
market this fall. By Allen Salkin.

   FALL-FASHIONS-BOOKS (Undated) - When sorting through the guides
that tell you what is and is not stylish and important, it's
important to know who or what you aspire to, writes Penelope Green.
``Bright Young Things'' by Brooke de Ocampo, a contributing editor
at Vogue and ``card-carrying B.Y.T. herself,'' according to the
book's introduction, displays a huge menu of possibilities, and
possible settings.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ Phyllostachys, or giant bamboo, can
form beautiful groves of canes _ culms, they are correctly called _
from 10 feet to more than 100 feet tall, depending on the species.
The culms are wonderfully varied in color: green, yellow, golden
orange; yellow with a vertical green stripe; green with a yellow
groove; mottled green and black, like snakeskin; as jet black as a
Steinway. By Anne Raver.

   ATLANTA BALLET E-WAR: As the Atlanta Ballet musicians' strike
makes national and international headlines, the ballet's electronic
guest book continues to be a battleground. After numerous
contentious entries were purged recently, the Regional Orchestra
Players' Association picked them up ``unedited, uncensored.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are showing them here because they seem to disappear from
that site on a regular basis,'' the site says.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet orchestra site _ aborchestra.com _ is devoted
exclusively to the labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has started to get some attention on national
industry Web sites as well. Musicalamerica.com picked up an
Associated Press rewrite of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Aug.

International Herald Tribune, the Cleveland Plain Dealer and the
Orlando Sentinel.

   WEB-DANCE: The 10-day Sundance Film Festival just got bigger _
and more computery. An online festival will be added to the 2001
event, the largest confab of independent films in America. The
Sundance Online Film Festival, to coincide with the regular Jan.
18-28 screenings, will be produced by StreamSearch.com and located
on www.sundance.org. Sundance promises that the Internet fest will
include ``both a selection of new work developed specifically for
the Web and a retrospective of past Web highlights.'' Submissions
must be ``mixed-media pieces'' made specifically for the Web,
including animation, live-action, documentaries and interactive or
experimental works. The deadline is Sept. 29.

   ``MY VH1 MUSIC AWARDS'': The folks who bring us ``Behind the
Music'' are set to give us something else we didn't know we needed:
an awards show built from the ground up by music fans. Let's hope
it's as train-wreck fascinating as ``Behind the Music.'' On VH1's
Web site, visitors are asked to suggest categories, nominees and,
eventually, the winners for ``My VH1 Music Awards.'' The show will
be broadcast live on Nov. 30, with the online voting continuing
until the awards are given. It's bound to be better than the
Grammys, but it also conjures up thoughts of such dreaded annual
debacles as ``The American Music Awards.'' The categories that have
popped up on the site's message board so far would make for a
pretty pedestrian show. Best boy band? Worst boy band? That would
make ``The Peoples' Choice Awards'' look suspenseful. Among the
more entertaining suggestions is an award for the best use of
saliva in a heavy-metal video.

SIX BIDDERS FOR SEAGRAMS JOCKEY FOR POSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE KAPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Seagram Co. opened its books this week to
prospective buyers of its drinks business in what is the first
stage of a sale that may run through mid-October. Already, the
biggest spirits companies are jockeying for position.
</P>
<P>
   The number of possible bidders has grown from two to six.
Alliances have been formed, broken and reformed. Absolut vodka, the
centerpiece of the Seagram empire, remains a wild card. And complex
tax issues threaten the very idea of a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of people with lots of interests to defend,''
one executive close to the discussions said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even as the field may be confusing, most analysts expect
just one outcome. Allied Domecq PLC was considered the front-runner
when Seagram first announced plans to sell its wine and spirits
business in June as part of its plan to merge with Vivendi SA, the
French media and utility conglomerate. And the same holds true
today.
</P>
<P>
   Working to Allied's advantage is its ability to bid for the
business independently, thanks to its financial muscle and lack of
regulatory conflicts _ two issues that could handicap competitors.
</P>
<P>
   First, analysts say that Allied is the most likely partner for
Vin and Sprit, the Swedish owner of Absolut vodka, which has hinted
that it will use the change of ownership to secure a better deal,
possibly with a new partner. Vin and Sprit's existing contract with
Seagram is confidential, but analysts estimate that Absolut
accounts for 10 percent of the beverage operation's total liquor
sales, or $75 million to $100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   But Allied's success _ which depends in part on its ability to
raise debt or equity so that it may swallow a company with a market
value nearly twice its own _ is far from assured. It is facing
stiff competition from Diageo PLC of Britain, which is flush with
cash, and could easily match Allied in a bidding war that threatens
to inflate the price to $9 billion _ a value at which analysts said
most companies would be hard pressed to make the deal pay off.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that locking up support from Vin and Sprit will
be crucial in the battle for one of the last gems in a rapidly
consolidating industry.
</P>
<P>
   With brands ranging from Chivas Regal premium Scotch to Captain
Morgan's rum, Seagram's wine and spirits business ranks third
worldwide, behind Diageo, home of Johnnie Walker Scotch and
Smirnoff vodka, and Allied Domecq, which owns Ballantine's Scotch
and Kahlua liqueur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vin and Sprit doesn't want to be in this position again, where
someone decides to sell a business and carve it up,'' the executive
close to the discussions said. ``They would like to get more
control, either through ownership, or some iron-clad rights
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   One way for Vin and Sprit to shore up its prospects is to take a
stake in one of the bidders. Absolut declined to comment on the
contract or the bidding process, as did Allied and Diageo.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo, which was formed through the 1997 merger of GrandMet and
Guinness, could have less bargaining power than Allied. GrandMet
used to own the global distribution rights to Absolut, but lost
them to Seagram in 1994, because Vin and Sprit did not want Absolut
sold in tandem with GrandMet's other vodka label, Smirnoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allied will retain the support of Absolut,'' said Graeme
Eadie, an analyst with Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Eadie said he expected Allied to win the auction for three
reasons: An alliance with Vin and Sprit, cost savings that will
allow it to make the deal, and the flexibility that comes with
bidding independently.
</P>
<P>
   Allied will be able to offer the highest price for Seagram's
drinks business, he said, because it will also see the greatest
cost savings. He expects Allied to save 220 million pounds a year,
or $319 million, by pushing Seagram brands through its existing
distribution system _ nearly double the savings seen for Diageo.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the few companies able to bid independently for
Seagram, Allied has more freedom than does Diageo, which has chosen
to bid jointly with Pernod Ricard of France. The two companies are
expected to split the Seagram brands between them, and in this way
Diageo hopes to avoid antitrust issues.
</P>
<P>
   Consortiums have a greater chance of failure, Eadie noted,
especially during the last phase of bidding, because it is often
difficult to get the parties to agree on the fair value of a
company.
</P>
<P>
   Allied, which is one of the few companies that could swallow
Seagram whole, may have another advantage in the form of a giant
tax bill that could be imposed on any company trying to split up
the business _ an issue that flies against Diageo's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax implications are tremendously complicated,'' the
executive close to the discussions said. The Seagram business was
built ``without any thought of it ever being pulled apart.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the other players, Bacardi lacks the financial muscle to
bid independently, and after initial talks with Diageo broke down
over how to carve up Seagram, Bacardi has yet to find another
partner. Remy Cointreau's strategy of buying ``tail brands'' on the
cheap makes it an unlikely contender. Then there is the Bronfman
family, which owns 24 percent of Seagram and is said to be keen on
keeping the business that Samuel Bronfman bought in 1924. Even if
the Bronfmans formed a consortium to finance the deal, analysts
said, Allied and Diageo could easily outbid that group.
</P>
<P>
   The first bids are due by the end of the month.

 &HT;    Lawrenceville man pens best-selling comic books, shakes up genre
with stories that go far beyond cliches of yesteryear
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 3.
 &HT;    By Don Fernandez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Jenkins spends his nights exploring the psyche of
Spider-Man and conveying the inner rage of the Hulk. He crafts
comic book characters and conflict that capture the attention of a
growing legion of readers every month. But this is part of a bigger
battle.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old writer is waging a crusade to legitimize comics,
particularly the superhero genre, a much-maligned species that gets
short shrift for respect on the publishing food chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comic creators in Europe and Japan are seen as highly
respected, literate people,'' says Jenkins, of Lawrenceville, Ga.,
his eyes swollen after struggling with a script until 4 a.m. ``Here
we're seen as literary castoffs. People don't take it seriously,
and it's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   From a basement lair in a suburban cul-de-sac not far from the
Mall of Georgia, he writes three of the top-selling comic books in
the United States: ``Peter Parker: Spider-Man,'' ``The Incredible
Hulk'' and ``Witchblade.'' The first two are comic book icons that
have saturated popular media for years; the third, a story about a
female police officer who possesses, or is possessed by, a gauntlet
with mystical powers, was made into a TV movie that was shown on
TNT last week.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the stale cliches of a superhero story that
interest Jenkins, a Briton who moved here last year with his
girlfriend. (``It's a brilliant, brilliant place,'' he says of
Atlanta. ``I always liked the South. Lots of nice golf courses,
seasons.'') Spandex-draped muscleheads duking it out have been done
to death. Instead, he journeys into the minds and souls of these
characters, writing rich, psychological tales full of twists and
metaphors aimed at an audience more sophisticated than the
traditional consumers of the comics genre, pubescent males looking
for a power fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take these superhero characters and tell really good
stories _ for a change,'' Jenkins says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is no starry-eyed prodigy. He has scraped by for more
than a decade in an often unforgiving industry, from marketing
comic books and related merchandise to editing titles. Writing was
a goal he fought to pursue. Now, as the mercury rises on his
career, he's not bashful about championing his ability _ but he
doesn't take it for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing very well,'' he says, his blond, spiked hair limp
after the all-nighter. ``I want to keep the iron hot by doing work
I enjoy, is well-done and not skimping on what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins is most anxious about ``Sentry,'' a character he created
seven years ago to explore the evolution of superheroes and add
fresh context to the genre. Part of the ``Marvel Knights'' line of
books, the title character is a near-omnipotent being who has
forgotten his greatness and suffers from an identity crisis, a
troubled marriage and, possibly, addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want a sophisticated take on superheroes and
superheroism,'' say Jenkins, who waited years to see ``Sentry''
published. ``The story is about what if a person like this has a
power. What would it feel like?''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Sentry'' series, which has just reached print, doesn't
read like a typical yarn depicting good vs. evil. It begins with a
sluggish, middle-aged man with a full midsection having flashbacks
to a possible past as a superhero. These recollections are told
using artistic styles typical of a certain time, from the cartoony
style of the 1960s to the darker images associated with 1980s comic
artwork. So far, barely a punch has been thrown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't care about the conflicts of people unless we
care about them,'' he says. ``My primary mission is to make people
care about these people before we care about what they do. We in
comics have ignored that directive for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no formula for doing this. He works from his perceptions
and interprets these into text.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just observing them (the characters) and asking, `How can
I see a piece of myself in them?''' Jenkins explains.
``Spider-Man's a great example. He has an old aunt who's a strong
figure. I have an old granny in Wales who's the same way. I write
myself and put myself into that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Handling the drawing chores is Jae Lee, the penciller who teamed
up with Jenkins on ``The Inhumans,'' his 1998 repair job for Marvel
comics. The scripts, Lee says, aim to elevate superhero
storytelling into relevant literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writers like Paul treat comic characters as real characters
who just have these abilities,'' says Lee, who's based in Virginia.
``It's a more mature and realistic take. It's not dumbed down for
kids. Paul's part of a movement.''
</P>
<P>
   More character-based, mature storytelling is the current rage in
comics, with the Marvel Knights line _ featuring more humanistic
and darker characters such as the blind superhero Daredevil and the
nihilistic vigilante the Punisher _ leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins' graceful presentation is key. Fluid sentences and
descriptive narratives drill into a character's psyche, examining
the quirks, flaws and mental struggles that drive a superhero.
Achieving this requires the writer to channel these characters and
immerse himself into their fictional worlds. When he has tucked
away a Spider-Man tale, he prepares for a round with the Hulk.
</P>
<P>
   Once Jenkins completes a script, he erases that world of
characters from his mind and pores over his notes and preparation
material for the next story. The characters, he says, consume his
thoughts while he goes out for a run _ or cooks _ and he is
constantly sorting through ways to improve story flow or flesh out
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can get really tiring when I switch gears,'' he allows.
``It's the most mentally challenging part. But I have to _ I truly
live in the world I create.''
</P>
<P>
   Those seeking a hit of adrenalin won't be disappointed. He may
eschew nonsensical scrapes, but action with context can be an
effective storytelling skill.
</P>
<P>
   For example, nary a punch was thrown in the first four issues of
``The Inhumans,'' but when the action finally exploded, it was a
culmination of substance: The Inhumans' city was attacked by
humans. The Inhumans' leader, Black Bolt _ who has been silent so
far throughout the story _ was viewed as so altruistic by the human
race that it manipulated this weakness to its advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, Triton, a character with water-based
abilities, saves a small child _ a passenger on the World War I-era
ocean liner Lusitania _ from drowning. It is Triton's first
exposure to war, and he experiences actions he's unaccustomed to
(such as bravery) while watching an old man attempting to save his
grandson. The grandson reappears later as an old man, searching for
the ``mermaid'' who once saved him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say they want action, but they truly want character,''
Jenkins says. ``You have to establish character early on so you
care. Having powers doesn't mean as much unless it's a real
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a leap from the child who used to write and illustrate
homemade comic books for his mother, with titles such as ``Alfred
and the Egg Giants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She sees the little boy who sat and drew stories for her and
sees my writing stuff that's published _ which are comics _ and is
really proud,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Old World inspiration
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in England was magical, says Jenkins. He was raised
in the southwestern area of Dorset, which he describes as ``King
Arthur country.'' Forts from the Roman and Iron Ages and royal
burial grounds graced the terrain and instilled in the would-be
writer an appreciation for the age of heroes. He lived for the
fantasy of space travel, he says, which sparked his imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a fairyland. My parents divorced when I was
young, and my mother was a single parent in the early 1970s. We
were by far the poorest family. We lived on a farm and I would
often eat food from there _ or (occasionally) the rabbits I
snared.''
</P>
<P>
   He left England in 1988 to teach music to disabled children in
Northampton, Mass., and experience life in the States. He formed a
rock band, Grave Goods (which disbanded four years later), and met
a pair of friends who would soon revolutionize the comic book
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird had just created the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles, a late-1980s black-market comic book that
quickly evolved into creative and financial dynamite. They hired
English major Jenkins to be the editor at Tundra Publishing, the
comic book home of the Turtles empire. He was the third employee in
a company that ignited a cultural sensation and eventually expanded
to include toys, cartoons and a series of movies.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jenkins wore an exhausting slew of hats _ editorial,
promotional, licensing and production duties were all on his plate
_ the venture finally fizzled four years later, which he attributes
to inexperience and greed. Still sour after watching the empire and
its potential crumble, he refers to Tundra as a ``spectacular
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad lesson that I learned, a cautionary tale. I wanted
to be trusting, but no matter how much I trust people now, I look
into their eyes _ shaking their hands _ and wonder if what I'm
seeing is subterfuge.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins went on to become editor in chief at a struggling Ohio
comic company that went bankrupt three months later. He toiled to
make it work, going without pay for months and incurring debt.
Though he learned that the comic business is prey to all the
problems of any creative industry, Jenkins says he never lost his
love of the genre.
</P>
<P>
   The fix-it man
</P>
<P>
   What he really wanted to do was write. In 1994, powerhouse DC
Comics offered him a shot at writing ``Hellblazer,'' a title in its
adult-themed Vertigo line of comic books. The plots centered on a
``working-class magician'' named John Constantine, who encounters a
series of wicked situations spiked with a dose of the supernatural.
</P>
<P>
   It turned into a nearly four-year gig, in which Jenkins culled
inspiration from family members and tales told by his mother. While
jogging around a cemetery in the rain, he remembered a legend she
had recounted about how walking around a graveyard three times
counterclockwise will cause the ghosts of that necropolis to haunt
and curse that person. The myth made it into ``Hellblazer,'' where
the main character ends the chaos resulting from a jogger's taking
this path by reversing a directional sign to a clockwise direction
near a cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hellblazer'' was the first step in what became a sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Marvel Comics hatched a plan to invigorate a group of
second-string characters in its pantheon, adding an edge previously
untapped. The concept was dubbed ``Marvel Knights,'' and Jenkins
was enlisted a year after his work on ``Hellblazer'' to tackle
``The Inhumans,'' a royal sect of genetically blessed characters
that were often viewed as a bit of a joke.
</P>
<P>
   The result was more prose than punches. In the 12-issue series,
Jenkins got to explore such themes as the burdens of aristocracy
and the metamorphosis of adolescence, and even worked in metaphors
for civil rights struggles. His effort was rewarded with a 1999
Eisner Award, the Oscar of the comics world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work yourself out onto the page of the book if you really
care about it,'' he says. ``I can look at stories and say, `Boy,
was I really angry at injustice there.' Different things like that
I can see afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   He was soon recruited to perform similar repair jobs on other
flagging comics. The Hulk's sales were sagging. Jenkins provided
the antidote last year _ introducing a new villain, General Ryker,
and examining the intellect of Bruce Banner, the Hulk's alter ego _
which has spiked sales. ``Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' was devoid of
juice and interest was evaporating. Jenkins lent a spark by
returning the title character to his lighthearted roots, creating
the kinds of personal and professional struggles that made
Spider-Man an Everyman inspiration almost 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``On `Spider-Man,' we had one writer doing both `Spider-Man'
titles, and we both were a little tired,'' says Ralph Macchio,
editor of all ``Spider-Man'' titles at Marvel Comics in New York,
who pressed to get Jenkins onto his team. ``Paul told me one of the
characters he really wanted to do was Spider-Man, but he had such a
crowded schedule. I thought if I could just get him to do it, we
could deal with the deadline problems. He knows all the things that
make Spider-Man tick and brought a slew of new ideas. The word of
mouth and letters have been loudly favorable. He has a long-term
commitment to Spider-Man, and I hope he's in for the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Now ``Witchblade'' is receiving Jenkins' repair skills. Long
dismissed as little more than pictures of a scantily clad,
voluptuous cop, Jenkins plans to turn the comic into a crime drama
and drop much of its cheeky surface. He's three issues into his
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creatively, it was treading water,'' he says diplomatically.
``It was intended to be `NYPD Blue' meets `The X-Files.' (Main
character Sara Pezzini) is a beautiful young woman who made
detective on the NYPD, and I think that would be incredibly
testing; what kinds of pressures are put on her? It's detective
stuff with a supernatural angle.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent TV movie is closer to his work on ``Witchblade,'' and
coincidentally he was working on his issues with the crime focus at
the same time the TV project was being sorted out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They actually did a really good job, and the acting was good.
It's a difficult comic to compare to the TV show if you look at it
before I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Witchblade'' is one of three comics that Jenkins is writing
that are receiving the live-action treatment. ``Spider-Man'' is
slated to start filming this fall, and a ``Hulk'' movie is in the
late pre-production stage. He'll be happy if the quality of those
projects is on par with the recent ``X-Men'' movie, which has raked
in about $150 million at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not very fond of blockbuster movies or movies driven by
special effects,'' he says. ``But they tried to give the characters
an edge and it was very good. I hope they do the Spidey movie like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins' skill at injecting new life into old characters has put
him much in demand. He's had to turn down several projects because
of his workload.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes in this industry, you're so stuck in the past you
need someone with an outside view who did not grow up worshipping
these characters,'' says Joe Quesada, editor of the Marvel Knights
imprint in New York, who chose Jenkins for ``The Inhumans.'' ``It's
a very humanistic approach to this stuff, and it's what we need
today to make these characters plausible for the general public.''
</P>
<P>
   An outsider's view
</P>
<P>
   Despite spending hours a day charting possibilities for comic
characters, Jenkins reads relatively few titles. He's fond of the
other books in the Marvel Knights line and still reads
``Hellblazer.'' Fellow comic authors he admires include Alan Moore
(``The Watchmen'') and Neil Gaiman (``Sandman''), which is akin to
an actor listing Al Pacino and Robert De Niro as inspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the fresh perspective entering the comic industry has
its origins in Britain. Jenkins is among a number of British
scribes whose work is bringing unconventional approaches to the
medium. Others include the legendary Moore, whose ``Watchmen''
series helped revolutionize comics in 1986 with a dark and adult
approach to superheroes; Grant Morrison, who just finished his run
on ``JLA'' (for ``Justice League of America''), DC Comics'
best-selling title; and Warren Ellis (``Planetary,''
``Transmetropolitan''), who was cited in Rolling Stone magazine's
recent ``hot'' issue for his comic book work.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins reasons that icons such as Superman, Batman and
Spider-Man resonate differently overseas, viewed as wild and
wonderful products of a foreign culture. They're not taken for
granted, he says, and therefore are approached from an outsider's
viewpoint and open for interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a theory,'' he says. ``But it might be that Brits
have a better perspective.''

 &HT;    Dark director finds lighter side in `Nurse Betty'
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 3.
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe there's a good reason critics have praised writer-director
Neil LaBute's movies but moviegoers have stayed away. Or, if
they've gone to see them, have argued afterward about whether
they'd just seen a comedy or a tragedy. Or just gotten depressed
about human nature.
</P>
<P>
   Where to start? LaBute's ``In the Company of Men'' (1997)
featured two arrogant businessmen who take revenge on the female
species by seducing and then abandoning a sweet, deaf woman they
meet during a training seminar. Possibly even meaner, ``Your
Friends and Neighbors'' (1998) coolly dissected infidelities and
lies among a circle of supposed best buddies. LaBute considered
giving that movie a title that best described its characters:
``Lepers.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also a playwright, whose off-Broadway ``Bash: Latter-Day
Plays,'' which was televised last week on Showtime, included
monologues about an unwed mother who kills her own child and a guy
who boasts about brutally attacking a gay man.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, he's off the beaten path,'' says Morgan Freeman,
star of LaBute's latest film, ``Nurse Betty,'' opening Friday.
``He's not making your everyday straight-at-you kind of stuff. He's
doing edgy, offbeat work.''
</P>
<P>
   So who knew that LaBute had it in him to direct something as
beguilingly funny as ``Betty,'' a quirky comedy-drama that manages
to balance its darker side with a genuine sweetness?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a certain, not shrewdness on my part, but a
certain clear-eyed look at where I was,'' LaBute says by telephone,
explaining his decision to make the movie as a change of pace after
his two dark originals. When he read the script (the first he's
directed that he didn't write himself), ``I thought, `This would be
surprising.' People who knew my work wouldn't expect me to write
something like this, let alone direct it. I think that as a
filmmaker you should continually try to surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled, though. ``Nurse Betty'' isn't a totally
lightweight romp. It stars Renee Zellweger (in a luminous, complex
performance) as a Kansas homemaker addicted to a soap opera called
``A Reason to Love.'' After a bout of trauma-induced amnesia, she
travels to Los Angeles, convinced that she's a nurse and the
fiancee of her favorite character on the show, Dr. David Ravell,
aka actor George McCord (Greg Kinnear).
</P>
<P>
   Um, did we mention that she's also being trailed by a couple of
hit men (Freeman and Chris Rock), one of whom starts to fall in
love with her?
</P>
<P>
   Incorporating elements of farce, romantic comedy, road trip,
Quentin Tarantino-style violence and a dose of female empowerment,
``Betty'' required LaBute to balance moods much trickier than the
steady black humor of his first two movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This veers so wildly in tone,'' he says. ``The others were
very straightforward in their approach _ they were like a
sledgehammer swinging back and forth. With `Betty,' sometimes the
tone changes in a single scene. Finding the balance where you feel
you've kept the movie still juggling up in the air _ whether it
calls for humor, or a road-picture feeling, or violence _ is very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``Nurse Betty'' manages to maintain a wacky believability
no matter how weird it gets is something that LaBute, 37, credits
to his actors, a pitch-perfect cast that includes his longtime star
Aaron Eckhart as Betty's no-'count husband and the deadpan Allison
Janney (``The West Wing'') as the soap opera's executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about truth in the acting,'' LaBute says. ``They're
not playing the results. They're not thinking it's funny
themselves, as characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman rejects his director's generosity. ``It's all because of
Neil,'' he declares. ``Neil knew what he was doing, and it worked
because the director had a firm grasp of what he was doing and
where he was going with it. He knew it was a gamble, and he was out
on a limb, but that's who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's centerpiece scene _ and possibly its trickiest to
pull off _ is one in which Betty meets David/George at a benefit
and insists to the bewildered actor (and his soap opera colleagues)
that she is his fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to make that scene happen, but you also have to make
it work, and have the audience be charmed and not go, `Oh, come
on.' So much of the movie is about Betty. Do you want her to
succeed?''
</P>
<P>
   Largely thanks to Zellweger's performance, you do. ``It's lovely
work, a complete creation,'' the director says. ``You can create a
persona people like, but it's not the same as goodness. Renee can
just look at you and smile, and you go, `I want to help her
along.'''
</P>
<P>
   But as viewers of his other films know, ``I've never been
someone as a filmmaker interested in whether the audience likes a
character,'' LaBute says. ``The key has always been, are these
people interesting. They could be bastards, but they have to be
compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Freeman's work as a surprisingly tenderhearted
hit man. ``Talk about a balancing act,'' LaBute says of the actor's
work. ``Here's a guy who, by his own description, is a killer, a
`garbage man,' but you believe in his dignity and grace. He keeps
winning you back no matter what he does, not only getting laughs on
the way but making you believe how obsessed he becomes with
Betty.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman says, ``What's interesting about the whole idea of him
forming this relationship is that he's doing exactly what Betty is.
This whole fantasy love affair starts to develop, but it's
happening against his better judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBute originally was thinking of Eckhart and Gene Hackman as
the movie's hit men. ``The one thing I didn't want was that
black-and-white combination that's in every other movie,'' he says,
referring to the stereotype of African-American actors cast as
villains. But when producer Steve Golin suggested the Freeman-Rock
pairing, LaBute found it hard to resist.
</P>
<P>
   As for Freeman, he says, ``About halfway through reading the
script, I knew I had a very interesting character to play there.
And I knew the other character was being played by Chris Rock.
Juxtaposing those two facts, it was a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Written by first-timers John C. Richards and James Flamberg, and
winner of the best screenplay award at the Cannes Film Festival,
the script was tweaked throughout by LaBute. ``I was very much like
an editor,'' he says. ``I found that it freed me in many ways; I
found myself not so emotionally attached to it. I did a lot of
writing on the dialogue, deciding how to make this or that joke
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards and Flamberg also wrote extra lines during the
shooting, adding more arch scenes for the soap opera clips.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was also a very conscious effort along the way not to
make it more me,'' LaBute says, acknowledging his tendency toward a
darker view. ``If I had written it, Betty would have died at sea in
the last reel. People wouldn't have expected that, would they?''
</P>
<P>
   In a Neil LaBute movie, maybe they would.

 &HT;    Australia's vast, remote interior is home to 'roos and the rock,
to strange and wonderous animals, natural light shows, awesome
silence and more stars than ever imagined
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 3.

<P>
   ALICE SPRINGS, Australia _ The first Australia guidebook I
consulted showed a yellow traffic sign with the silhouette of a
bounding kangaroo. How cute, I thought _ probably one of those
novelty items you can find in the Sydney airport next to the emu
oil and the stuffed koalas.
</P>
<P>
   Then we arrived in the unofficial capital of the Outback, Alice
Springs, the only town of any consequence for hundreds of miles in
every direction. We had just gotten off an overnight train from
Adelaide and had not seen a single bouncing marsupial in 19 hours
of crossing the bush. Now we were waiting at the car rental counter
listening to a clerk recite insurance mumbo jumbo. Something she
said jerked me out of my stupor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't cover kangaroos.''
</P>
<P>
   I chuckled, wondering whether she was pulling my leg, and
assured her that we didn't need any _ wink _ kangaroo insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine,'' she said. ``But if you hit a kangaroo, you pay the
damages.''
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't kidding. ``Does that really happen?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes. We had a party from California hit one a couple of
weeks ago. Totaled the car. Watch out around sunset; that's when
the boomers come out.''
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to me that I was probably standing in the only place
on Earth where such a conversation might take place.
</P>
<P>
   Australians say that if you want to understand their country,
you have to go to the Outback, the vast interior where highway
signs really do warn of kangaroos darting across the roads like
deer. They say this despite the fact that few Australians actually
inhabit the Outback. Though the nation is about the size of the
lower 48 states, it has a population of only 19 million (less than
Georgia and the Carolinas combined), and the great majority are
huddled near the sea, especially along the boomerang-shaped coast
that stretches from Adelaide to Melbourne to Sydney to Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest of Australia is barren, remote, inhospitable _
``the ghastly blank,'' as one pioneer diarist called it. American
explorers like Lewis and Clark came back with thrilling tales and
enticing samples of the Western flora and fauna. Burke and Wills,
the most famous Australian explorers, tried to cross the continent
in 1860 and died of starvation. This land demands respect.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, growing numbers of tourists have been venturing
into the Outback to admire the desert vistas and glimpse the lonely
sheep stations and learn something of the ancient Aboriginal
culture. My wife and I were curious, too. After a week and a half
in Sydney, we wanted to see the solitary side of Australia, so we
exercised an option that poor old Burke and Wills never had: We
flew to Adelaide and took the train.
</P>
<P>
   The alien fauna of Alice
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1920s, the main supply route into the heart of
Australia was a camel caravan tended by Afghan herders. The
railroad that replaced it _ still called the Ghan _ was for years
notoriously unreliable. Termites devoured the crossties. Flash
floods washed out the tracks and stranded passengers for days, the
crew shooting kangaroos to feed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have to do that. We're well provisioned,'' our
steward, Norbert, assured us as we boarded on a Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   We settled into a holiday class twinette _ a private berth about
the size of a back booth at the Waffle House _ and watched as
civilization slipped away outside our window. Suburbs gave way to
vineyards and then to fields of sheep and finally to flat scrubland
dotted with clumps of saltbush. After dinner in the Matilda car, we
made a brief stop in Port Augusta, a mining town, and turned north
for the void that Australians of a poetic bent call the
never-never.
</P>
<P>
   Norbert pulled down our stretcher-size beds, and the gentle
rocking of the rails soon lulled me to sleep. I didn't wake until
the first hint of day colored the oily dark on the eastern horizon.
The scene was breathtakingly empty and beautiful _ I felt like an
astronaut watching planet Earth from space. I called to my wife in
the upper berth, but she let out a low growl like an irritated cat.
She was in no mood for dawn patrol; the gentle rocking I found so
restful was a fitful tossing in the top bunk.
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning we were in Alice Springs, a place I knew only from
the movies. Thanks to ``A Town Like Alice,'' a love story about a
rancher back from war, and ``The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of
the Desert,'' a comedy about drag queens on the road, I didn't know
whether to expect cross-dressers or dusty jackeroos.
</P>
<P>
   We saw neither. Alice used to be renowned as an end-of-the-line
outpost that attracted all manner of eccentrics _ an Aussie Key
West. You can still catch vestiges of that spirit every October
during the Henley-on-Todd Regatta, in which beery contestants race
bottomless boats, like Fred Flintstone motoring with his feet, down
the dry bed of the Todd River. But for the most part, Alice has
become a thriving tourist center whose 26,000 residents all seem to
run motels, souvenir shops, art galleries and fast-food joints. The
busiest spot in town appeared to be the KFC, where the Colonel's
original recipe has apparently replaced emu and kangaroo as the
principal protein source among the indigenous population.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Alice's attractions relate in some way to its isolation.
We visited the School of the Air, where lessons are broadcast on
two-way radio to children scattered across thousands of miles of
Outback. And we stopped by the Royal Flying Doctor Service, an
airborne medical corps that provides care to ranching families and
rural communities that are hours from the nearest hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The most engaging place we found was the Alice Springs Desert
Park, a wildlife preserve that answers the question: What could
possibly survive in this Martian landscape?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Red Center, as central Australia is known, was
rather green when we arrived. An Indian Ocean cyclone had doused
the desert, and the crimson sand was bursting with wildflowers,
mulga trees and spiky spinifex grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best rain we've had in years,'' said Mark Richardson, the
curator of botany. ``I'm taking the family camping next week. We'll
never see this many things growing again in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   In half a day at the park, we saw all sorts of strange and
wondrous animals _ bilbies and wedge-tailed eagles and thorny devil
lizards and desert death adders coiled in a dim exhibit hall
devoted to nocturnal creatures. We loved the emus. With their
ruffled gray feathers and beady orange eyes, the gawky, flightless
birds wear a look of perpetual befuddlement.
</P>
<P>
   But our favorites, predictably, were the kangaroos. I felt a
rush of pure childish delight when I entered the fenced enclosure
and caught my first sight of a 'roo in the flesh. He was a boomer
all right, as tall as a man, with a rusty coat to match the dirt.
Yet there was something awkward about seeing him in repose. We're
so used to watching kangaroos leap through nature films that when
we see one just hanging around, propped on his tail and hind legs
like a folded-up tripod, he looks rather tame.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this was a real live kangaroo, and we were enthralled. We
must have shot a roll of film as he shuffled around the yard
munching on spinifex, looking up now and then, almost
lackadaisically, as if to say: OK, I'll pose, but no autographs
please.
</P>
<P>
   A big show at a the rock
</P>
<P>
   The next kangaroo we saw was roadkill, a carcass flattened onto
the shoulder of the two-lane blacktop we took to Uluru, five hours
southwest of Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Uluru, or Ayers Rock, is Australia's most familiar natural
landmark. No taller than Stone Mountain, it makes a more dramatic
impact because of the way it erupts from the arid plain like a fist
from the netherworld. The monolith is actually an eroded hunk of
sandstone with a veneer of oxidized iron, a bright red color that
changes in the dawn and dusk like a gargantuan mood ring. Twice a
day, crowds gather to watch the show.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn was the subtler entertainment. We rose at 5 a.m. and caught
a bus for the morning viewing area, already thick with lawn chairs
and spectators wrapped in blankets against the chill. The sun's
first rays dabbed at the rock with pinks and pastels before
settling on the brilliant red you see on the postcards.
</P>
<P>
   Dusk was splashier in every way. We hopped the bus again and
arrived at Sunset Strip (the other viewing area) to find a throng
of tailgaters worthy of a Georgia Bulldogs football game. Barbies
were smoking, wineglasses were clinking, cameras were poised. The
rock didn't disappoint. In the last slanting light of the day, it
went from red to salmon to brown to black. The only downside was
the traffic jam trying to get out.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted to a take a closer look at the mountain on the
following morning, but decided against climbing it, as many
tourists insist on doing. The Aborigines who own Uluru discourage
climbing not only because of the rock's near-sacred significance in
their traditions, but because it's dangerous. Thirty-nine people
have died trying to make the steep, windy, milelong ascent.
Aborigines have a word for the climbers, who cling to a chain rope,
single-file, as they scale the sheer slope: minga _ ant people.
</P>
<P>
   We elected instead to take the six-mile hike around the base.
The monolith seemed less monolithic as we walked past caves,
rockslides and other geological details that, like clouds, all
seemed to resemble something. We imagined snakes, fish, a skull, a
pair of lips. It's easy to understand how the Aborigines were able
to conjure so many legends about this place.
</P>
<P>
   It was also easy to see why no one else much wanted to live
around here. As the sun rose higher, the dratted bush flies began
to assault our orifices, and we scrambled to find the face netting
our hotel had given us when we checked in.
</P>
<P>
   That night we did the rock again at the Sounds of Silence
dinner, an evening under the stars that's one of the best parts of
visiting the Red Center. Another bus took us to a sandhill midway
between Uluru and the Olgas, a nearby cluster of sandstone
formations that look like chips off the old rock. We were greeted
with champagne and canapes, and we marked another sunset as a
musician coaxed weird vibrations out of a didgeridoo. Then we were
led to a dining patio, where we ate grilled lamb under more stars
than I ever imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the Southern Cross there,'' pointed out one of our
table mates, Jim McKillop, a retired professor from Queensland. His
accent was a dead ringer for Sean Connery's, so we weren't
surprised to hear that he had come from Scotland as a lad, back in
the days when Australia was desperate to populate its empty
continent.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, we gathered around a fire, and a family of
Italians started singing opera while some Australians fought back
with folk songs, and a couple of Japanese women giggled. Presently,
an astrologer with a plummy British accent commanded our attention
and walked us through the Southern constellations with a high-beam
flashlight and telescope. When he finished, no one said a word. The
silence of the desert night was almost holy.
</P>
<P>
   Travels with Charlie
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday morning, having spent one dawn and two dusks at the
rock, we were starting to hum that old dirge from ``Fiddler on the
Roof'': sunrise ... sunset. But there was one more daybreak we
wanted to experience, not so much for the scenery as for the eyes
we would be seeing it through. It was an Aboriginal tour.
</P>
<P>
   Uluru, after all, is Aboriginal land _ a status the Australian
government recognized in 1985 when it returned the park to the
Anangu people who have lived here for eons. Our tour guide was one
of their descendants, a stocky fellow with a shock of black hair
and threadbare clothes that smelled of campfire smoke. He smiled,
revealing a couple of missing teeth, and introduced himself as
Charlie Walkabout.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours, we followed Charlie down a sandy red trail as he
showed us how to make glue from spinifex, how to use the glue and
bindings made from kangaroo tendons to attach a spearhead, and how
to throw the spear to kill kangaroos. His English was spotty, so he
usually spoke through an interpreter as he told us how the features
of the mountain figured in the creation stories his people have
passed down for generations. I couldn't follow it all, but it
seemed to be a wild tale involving snakes, wallabies, blue-tongued
lizard men and a boulder that resembles an emu drumstick.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the tour, Charlie motioned for us all to come
closer. ``We are all going to die,'' he began, speaking directly to
us in hushed English. ``The rock was here before us, it will be
here after us. Our children will bring their children to see it,
your children will bring their children. The rock isn't just for
black people.''
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't decide whether Charlie was imparting the wisdom of
the ages or simply saying, ``Y'all come back.'' Either way, I
thought he was one of the most unusual guides I had ever met. The
impression was reinforced when his interpreter handed us business
cards that said ``Charlie Walkabout, Senior Aboriginal Guide'' and
noted an address that was anything but aboriginal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie likes to get e-mail,'' she said.

 &HT;    Beyond Boston: Day trips reveal New England
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 3.
 &HT;    By Nick Tate
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Freedom Trail. Boston Common. The Boston Tea Party
Museum. Each year, hordes of visitors flock to these well-known
Boston destinations.
</P>
<P>
   But as any native will tell you, the tourist spots downtown are
not necessarily the best places to experience the best the Boston
area has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Bostonians, in fact, are notorious day-trippers. And for good
reason. Downtown Boston is only a short drive from a wide variety
of prime spots that showcase the region's stunning wild beauty and
provide an authentic slice of New England life. And as late summer
gives way to the first chill of autumn, these places take on a
special charm for history buffs and nature lovers alike.
</P>
<P>
   Lush forests of tall oak and maple _ stretching from the
outskirts of the city to the nearby foothills of the White
Mountains of New Hampshire _ provide a perfect setting for fall
foliage hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Cool lakes, rivers and ponds _ teeming with fish and, often,
sailboats _ offer a quiet respite from the madding crowds and
snarled traffic downtown.
</P>
<P>
   White-sand beaches along Boston's south shore and Cape Cod are
picture-postcard settings for leisurely encounters with the great
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   And quaint New England fishing villages dotting the state's
rocky north shore are a piece of Massachusetts' maritime history,
along with alluring boutiques, art galleries and some of the best
seafood restaurants in the world.
</P>
<P>
   So when in Boston, do as the Bostonians do: Get out of town.
</P>
<P>
   To get you started, we've come up with six best bets for short
escapes from the city _ all within a few hours' drive of Boston
Common: Walden Pond, Rockport, Mount Monadnock, the Arnold
Arboretum, Newburyport and Martha's Vineyard.

 &HT;    Author Tim McLaurin faced with cancer, he finds love, healing
and new story
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim McLaurin is used to facing death. Long before he became a
critically acclaimed writer, the Fayetteville, N.C., native
regularly handled rattlesnakes, copperheads and cobras in his
traveling reptile exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   He has survived several poisonous bites as well as an agonizing
struggle with multiple myeloma, a bone marrow cancer. And so, when
McLaurin, 46, was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus a few
months ago, he was well prepared to die.
</P>
<P>
   He had lived a full life, he told himself. An ex-Marine who had
kicked a debilitating drinking habit after 20 years, he had been
married and divorced twice, had two teenage children, and had
worked as a Peace Corps volunteer in Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered if ... it was time for me to die ... to chronicle
that in writing, straightforward and honestly,'' he says, ``and I
was willing to do that.'' Besides, he had undergone a painful bone
marrow transplant years before, and he didn't want to go through
that kind of treatment again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want to deal with the hassle of being sick,'' he
says. ``I didn't want to deal with being poked and prodded and that
loss of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he met a woman who not only changed his life, but helped
save it as well.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Quaine arrived one day in mid-February and offered the
touch of her healing hands. A friend of a friend, Quaine had a
Ph.D. in business, but she also was trained as a healer in Reiki, a
technique developed by a Buddhist monk in Japan in the late 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   McLaurin says the first time she placed her hands on his chest,
he thought she was using a heating pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every day for three weeks she returned and placed her
hands upon me, wafted fragrant smoke upon my body, lit candles and
rang bells,'' he wrote in a newspaper story. ``She told me that
sometimes when I talked to her, leaves and feathers fell in a
shower from above my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Her love and trust made him rethink his reluctance to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started thinking, maybe your story isn't to end right here,
to tell people how to die. Maybe you've got other stories to
tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Declared free of the cancer, McLaurin describes his ordeal and
his relationship with Quaine in a 15-page epilogue for ``The River
Less Run,'' a chronicle of his life from June 1998 to June 1999,
that will be published in September by North Carolina-based Down
Home Press.
</P>
<P>
   McLaurin thought it was the last book he would ever write.
</P>
<P>
   ``The River Less Run'' focuses on a cross-country trip McLaurin
took with his mother, children and other relatives in a Winnebago.
He had already written the memoir when cancer struck and Quaine
entered the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Neither McLaurin nor Quaine credits her alone with saving his
life. She says he was cured ``by some of the best Western medicine
and some of the deepest love.''
</P>
<P>
   The story has an even happier ending. McLaurin and Quaine plan
to be married Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 11th is the day we met,'' McLaurin says, ``and we're
getting married on the 11th day of the 11th month. She's an
incredible blend between the real world and the spiritual world.''
</P>
<P>
   What impressed him most, McLaurin says, is that Quaine had never
read any of his books when she met him, yet she seemed to
understand him immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I run into a lot of women who think they know me through my
books, and they don't. She knows me as a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   An honest, fearless writer
</P>
<P>
   None of his friends would have bet that McLaurin would graduate
from high school, let alone become a writer. He grew up poor in
North Carolina, shooting squirrels and birds for dinner, a way of
life chronicled in 1991's ``Keeper of the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way he wrote well-received novels such as ``The Acorn
Plan,'' ``Woodrow's Trumpet'' and ``Cured by Fire.'' His work
reflects his hardscrabble childhood and the influence of writers
such as Harry Crews and Jim Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, Tim is a throwback,'' says North Carolina novelist
Lee Smith, who has offered her Hillsborough, N.C., home as the site
of the Nov. 11 wedding. ``He is a writer who is truly tied to the
land in a way most of us have not been for at least a generation.
He carries around a little bag of dirt from the farm where he grew
up. He's lived very deeply on a very elemental, almost mythic
level, in a way few people do. That's evident in his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an absolutely honest and fearless kind of writer,'' Smith
adds. ``He uses his writing as a way to confront his anger and his
fears.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaurin's editor, Jerry Bledsoe, puts him in the same category
as Crews and Larry Brown _ ``rough South'' writers who come from
poor white backgrounds. ``They are the ones who have been chosen by
whatever forces there are to make sure their own people's stories
are told. Otherwise, no one would be telling these stories.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaurin wants to memorialize his survival by having a phoenix
tattooed on his chest, where doctors operated. The bird will join
tattoos of family names, flowers and animals that adorn his right
arm and the snakes and birds on his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   And he plans to keep painting his toenails. The first time, a
young visitor painted his two big toenails a metallic blue, a color
favored by halter-topped teens. Since then, he and Quaine have
repainted them a couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of like it,'' McLaurin says. ``Some people might look
at it and think it's weird, but I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing as therapy
</P>
<P>
   Even as a child, McLaurin was willing to be the odd man, to
question what he was told. He was taught that snakes were to be
feared and killed. But when he chopped up a harmless rat snake, he
felt guilty enough to read about snakes, learning that most of what
he had been taught was a myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snakes,'' he says, ``represent a way of overcoming ignorance
and fear. And overcoming ignorance in small steps is a way to fix a
lot of what's wrong with the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he finds comfort in the world he and Quaine have made
in Hillsborough with McLaurin's bulldog, Roy Lee; red-tail boa,
bull and Gaboon viper snakes; and an African spur-footed tortoise
named George.
</P>
<P>
   He smokes two cigars a day _ 45-cent Phillies Blunts that he
prefers to Cuban cigars. ``I don't see that big a difference,'' he
says. ``Maybe I cropped so much tobacco growing up that I'm immune
to the finer qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   What he doesn't do anymore is drink. He went on one last epic
drunk in November 1998 that landed him in the hospital. He says it
was deliberate _ one last blow-out so he could walk away from the
bottle once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used that part of my life up until it was dust in my palm
and I could blow it away and it was gone,'' McLaurin says.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't wish his two decades of hangovers on his children, or
his illnesses or his mistakes. But in a sense, he hopes they live
their lives as he has, with a sense of adventure, a courage to look
death in the eye without flinching and to walk away with the will
to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they want to travel and seek and explore _ I hope they
make it to the moon,'' he says. ``I always thought that during my
lifetime, I'd make it to the moon, that by the age of 46, there
were Pan-Am excursions to the moon. But we stopped going to the
moon.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaurin, meanwhile, is hitting the road to promote his memoir.
He'll be in Atlanta this month for the Southeast Booksellers
Association's trade show, and after that he's going back to work on
a novel and another memoir about working in tobacco fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always used writing as a form of therapy,'' he says. ``I
wrote `Keeper of the Moon' when I was going through treatment for
myeloma. Through my words I'm able to leave the hospital bed and
the shell of my own body and go into a place in the past or the
future that's disease-free and peaceful.''

GARDENING: IF IT TRIES TO ESCAPE, EAT IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 3)  
 (eds: optional sidebar at end of article)  
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I can see it now: killer bamboo marches across Central Park.
That was my first reaction when I heard that the Horticultural
Society of New York is holding a festival this month, with the
American Bamboo Society, that actually encourages people to grow
this plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't say invasive _ say overly aggressive,'' Michael Alfano,
president of the society's northeastern chapter, said, standing by
an airy hedge of Phyllostachys bissetii in his garden in Port
Washington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllostachys, or giant bamboo, can form beautiful groves of
canes _ culms, they are correctly called _ from 10 feet to more
than 100 feet tall, depending on the species.
</P>
<P>
   The culms are wonderfully varied in color: green, yellow, golden
orange; yellow with a vertical green stripe; green with a yellow
groove; mottled green and black, like snakeskin; as jet black as a
Steinway.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllostachys is a running bamboo, so called because it extends
rhizomes underground, sending up shoots that grow into tall canes.
If you don't want it to spread, you have to be vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spend a little time each fall harvesting the shoots,
you won't have a problem,'' Alfano said. The shoots of
phyllostachys are edible, especially those of P. dulcis, or
sweetshoot bamboo, which has a sweet, nutty flavor. Cut them just
beneath the soil, like asparagus, peel back the leaves and eat the
crunchy white shoots raw or steamed. But remember, if you don't
want that baby to spread, snap off  &UR; all &LR;  its shoots.
</P>
<P>
   Some people use plastic barriers, buried three feet in the
ground, with three inches above. ``But the runners will just go
right over the top and wander on,'' Alfano said.
</P>
<P>
   The P. bissetii in his yard has vigorous, dark green
seven-year-old culms 20 feet tall, and their flexible, leafy stems
sway and sigh on the wind. ``The neighbors love it,'' he said. It
remains evergreen all winter, and it's magical in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Use common sense when planting. ``Bamboos can be aggressive and
destroy neighboring plants, so don't put them next to anything you
deeply care about,'' said Dr. Peter Del Tredici, the director of
living collections at the Arnold Arboretum at Harvard University.
``But it's not invasive in the sense of spreading by seed, on the
wind or by a bird. It's all vegetative.''
</P>
<P>
   If you plant a variety that's an enthusiastic runner, just make
sure you have room to mow around it so it can't take over, he
advised.
</P>
<P>
   Del Tredici moved the arboretum's bamboo, which was growing too
vigorously, to very poor soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the backhoe out and put them in a roadbed where we had
trouble growing anything,'' he said. They're doing fine _ growing
 &UR; slowly. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Alfano suggests planting a running bamboo near water, which it
doesn't like, or on the edge of a pine woods or in shade. Or sink
it in a pot, and pop up the pot once in a while, to snip off the
runners. Many running bamboos are not hardy in the Northeast, but
they make beautiful potted plants for the terrace or garden in
summer and a cool, sunny room in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Alfano leaned down to an elegantly sheathed seven-inch shoot
poking out of a pot of Phyllostachys aurea koi, a giant golden
bamboo with a green groove, which is not hardy in the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see one of these, just snap it off,'' he said, adding
that in Texas, this little shoot could grow to a 25-foot culm in
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bamboo is a member of the grass family, just like lawns,
ornamental grasses and corn. Key to life in Asia, it is becoming
increasingly popular in the West as a landscape plant, or as a
sustainable supply of beautiful, sturdy material for things like
trellises, flutes, furniture and houses. And about 300 kinds of
bamboo, from 6 inches to 60 feet, are hardy in the New York area,
Alfano said.
</P>
<P>
   He fell for bamboo nine years ago, after he dug a pond in his
backyard, stocked it with koi and wanted some Asian plants to go
with it. That first pond has grown into a series of ponds and
waterfalls terraced down the precipitous slope off the backyard,
extending a good 80 feet down. The rocky niches are perfect for
containing bamboo.
</P>
<P>
   All along the house are small, delicate varieties, like
Plioblastus fortuneii, a dwarf variegated bamboo with
green-and-white-striped leaves, and some elegant clumpings of
Phyllostachys nigra, a luminous black bamboo.
</P>
<P>
   Another running type, but well behaved, is Sudasa japonica, with
graceful narrow culms perfect for making arrows. Alfano planted
this clumping variety from a one-gallon pot four years ago, and
it's spread only about three feet. Another clumping species,
Bambusa ventricosa, affectionately called Buddha's Belly, swells
gently between nodes, and its green leaves have yellow stripes. B.
ventricosa Kimmei has yellow culms striped with green.
</P>
<P>
   If any little shoot appears from an overly aggressive runner,
Alfano simply eats it.
</P>
<P>
   Some bamboos like sun, others shade; some have delicate
filigreed leaves, others' leaves are wide straps, like those of an
amaryllis. Indokalmis terralotis, for example, has such wide leaves
they're used for wrapping food. It's a shade lover, as is Fargessi
nitida, a delicate clumper, whose slender leaves turn crispy in the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these varieties, as well as the art of cultivation, will
be discussed at Bamboo Fest 2000 next weekend at the Horticultural
Society, 128 West 58th Street, in Manhattan. (Information: (212)
757-0915, extension 200.) The weekend begins Friday evening, with a
bamboo art show and a Japanese flute concert. There's a rare plant
auction on Saturday. Lectures cover such varied topics as bamboo
for northern gardeners, bamboo cultivation, bamboo flowering (a
rare event), bamboo bonsai, bamboo basketry and all kinds of uses
for this plant so dear to the heart of Asia.

<P>
   Begin to pot herbs for winter use: take divisions of chives and
mint, and cuttings of woody herbs like rosemary and lemon verbena.
If tender plants have outgrown their containers, replant in pots a
size or two larger. Use the same type of potting mix. To keep the
plant in the same pot, you can carefully trim roots by as much as
25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Apply organic mulch to cut late-season weed germination. Seeds
of many weeds and self-seeding annuals go dormant over winter. Pull
up annuals that have gone by, or cut off seed heads before they
shatter.

   HURRICANE _ While the hurricane of 1900 was erasing life on
Galveston, a plumber was fixing pipes in a Beaumont hotel. W.L.
Ratisseau returned the next morning to an island that vaguely
resembled the one he remembered. His neighborhood had vanished. His
home was gone. And when he found his youngest daughter floating in
the bay, Ratisseau began to understand something else: So was his
family. For the 100th anniversary of the Great Storm of Sept. 8,
1900, we tell the story of the Ratisseaus of Galveston, who
suffered perhaps the greatest loss in the hurricane that remains
the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States.

   STATEOFSOUTH _ CHAPEL HILL, N.C. - A new report analyzing the

Economy cities, such as Atlanta and Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill,
because their prosperity ripples to outlying communities. For
decades, the notion of government and business nurturing its strong
cities has been a sore spot among rural area and their politicians.
But noting that ``the challenge before Southerners is at once
sweeping and exhilarating,'' MDC says, ``It is to ensure that the
region's prospering places and people continue to thrive, while
helping the people and places that are falling further behind gain
the capacity to adapt and flourish in a rapidly changing economy.''

   LABOR _ WASHINGTON _ On Labor Day 1900, the typical American
wage earner was a hardened working man, accustomed to toiling 10
hours a day, six days a week on the farm or in the factory. Still,
optimism was rampant as new technologies stirred hopes for better
days. Electric lights, telephones, trolley cars and
</P>
<P>
   even automobiles were appearing, giving rise to the belief that
work soon would be easier. Those 1900 dreams have become our
reality. On Labor Day 2000, U.S. workers are healthier, safer and
have more buying power than at any time in history. (Geewax, Cox

   OXFORD _ OXFORD, Ga. _ J.P. Godfrey Jr. thought he had left
``separate but equal'' behind when he joined the Air Force in 1952.
But upon returning home decades later, he found vestiges of
segregation in Oxford, 35 miles east of downtown Atlanta. The
Newton County town is home to 2,000 people, including the 600-plus
at Oxford College. ``I have always been quite fond of this old
place,'' said Godfrey, 63, whose grandparents cultivated corn and
cotton there. ``My grandfather was proud of the fact that he owned
property. He used to say, `When you own a foot of land, you own
something.''' Soon after arriving six years ago, Godfrey searched
for his grandparents' graves at Oxford's only cemetery. ``I
couldn't find them,'' he said, so he began making quiries.
Godfrey's questions stirred ghosts from Oxford's past, entangling
the city in a debate over the sins of a bygone era, the cemetery's
future and a pile of money. (Gentry, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   EDITORIAL-BOOKMAN _ ATLANTA _It wasn't government-sponsored
religious persecution, but it was too close for comfort. A few
years ago, while covering the Georgia Legislature, I happened to be
sitting alone in the press gallery early one morning, reading
through the bills filed the day before. On the other side of the
glass partition, legislators were milling about the House chamber,
waiting for the day's session to begin. Over the intercom, I heard
the unmistakable tone of a minister up at the podium, about to
offer the traditional morning prayer. So I set down my papers and
bowed my head, and when the prayer ended, I resumed my work. A few
minutes later, out in the hallway, I was accosted by a red-faced
House usher. ``Somebody saw you back there,'' he told me, waving an
angry finger in my face. ``You have to stand up during the prayer.

   TV-CHILDSTARS _ ``Child Stars: Their Story,'' which airs Sept. 4

go into show business. Sure, the potential for huge paydays is
tempting. But is the price that must be paid for that possible
fortune worth it? Child stars, for instance, are often robbed of a
normal childhood. Growing up is hard enough. Imagine having to do
it in front of millions of people watching your every move or
snickering about every goofy-looking pimple you get. The pressure
to perform is also insanely intense. Many adult actors can't even
take the heat and often resort to drugs and alcohol to cope. Just
think what it's like for a kid to overhear a producer angrily
talking about low ratings and possible cancellation. And in a
business where rejection is the norm, just what kind of toll does
that take on a child's psyche? (Thompson, Palm Beach Post).

bites as well as an agonizing struggle with multiple myeloma, a
bone marrow cancer. And so, when the 46-year-old McLaurin was
diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus a few months ago, he was
well prepared to die. He had lived a full life, he told himself. An
ex-Marine who had kicked a debilitating drinking habit after 20
years, he had been married and divorced twice, had two teenage
children, and had worked as a Peace Corps volunteer in Tunisia. ``I
wondered if . . . it was time for me to die . . . to chronicle that

 &HT;    EDITORIAL: UPHOLDING SEPARATION OF CHURCH, STATE
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _It wasn't government-sponsored religious persecution,
but it was too close for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, while covering the Georgia Legislature, I
happened to be sitting alone in the press gallery early one
morning, reading through the bills filed the day before. On the
other side of the glass partition, legislators were milling about
the House chamber, waiting for the day's session to begin. Over the
intercom, I heard the unmistakable tone of a minister up at the
podium, about to offer the traditional morning prayer.
</P>
<P>
   So I set down my papers and bowed my head, and when the prayer
ended, I resumed my work.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, out in the hallway, I was accosted by a
red-faced House usher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody saw you back there,'' he told me, waving an angry
finger in my face. ``You have to stand up during the prayer. If you
don't stand up, you're not going to be allowed back in that
chamber.''
</P>
<P>
   I had a couple of thoughts. The first was evidence that a little
boy still lived somewhere inside me. Somebody, I realized, had been
peeking when they should have been praying. Naughty naughty.
</P>
<P>
   The second reaction was more serious: This is government, I
realized, trying to tell me how to pray. And that made me mad. I'm
sad to admit that I got right back in that poor man's face, angrily
telling him that nobody was going to tell me how to pray and
demanding to know who had sent him on his ridiculous errand. He
refused to tell me.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, our little confrontation had played out in
public, and a few days later I got an informal feeler from the
American Civil Liberties Union, inquiring whether I might want to
file suit in the case. It would have been a slam-dunk First
Amendment case: a journalist denied access to a place of government
for failing to pray in an approved manner. I declined the offer,
believing that as a journalist I shouldn't become the story.
Besides, I had already made my point.
</P>
<P>
   Until that moment with the usher, though, I had never
consciously appreciated the importance of the wall between church
and state. The traditional morning prayer at the Legislature had
struck me as more harmless custom than religious exercise, although
I had often wondered how some of the representatives would react if
one day the guest minister offered up praise to Allah instead of
Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   After all, we have the right to pray as we wish, or not to pray
at all, and government has no say in that choice whatsoever. Some
people stand to pray, some people kneel, some merely bow their
heads. Muslims prostrate themselves toward Mecca. And in the Sermon
on the Mount, Jesus told his followers that when they pray, they
should ``enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut the door,
pray to thy Father in secret.'' He also warned against praying as
the hypocrites pray, ``for they love to pray standing in the
synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen
of men.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't presume to know the heart and mind of God. But that
admonition against the public display of prayer seems pretty clear
_ and pretty wise _ to me. It also raises a perplexing question. In
response to a recent Supreme Court decision banning organized
prayer at high school football games, some religious groups have
begun to pray out loud at the games anyway, in protest. Many of
those groups also claim a literal belief in the Bible. I wonder how
they justify their public prayer in light of Jesus' admonition. In
the wake of this column, no doubt I'll be offered enlightenment as
to their thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, of course, did not cite Jesus as the basis of
its decision on prayer at football games. Its argument was founded
instead in the First Amendment, which in turn was inspired by a
strong belief in the freedom of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Our forefathers believed that God has given each of us free
will, so that we might decide for ourselves what constitutes
religious truth. They decided that if God in all his wisdom didn't
coerce faith, it wasn't government's place to do so either.

   And they were right. Those who would use government to push
religion on their fellow citizens dishonor their political heritage
as Americans, and belittle the freedom of conscience granted to
each and every one of us. They need to go into a nice quiet closet
and think about that.

By LINDA LEE  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There she was, Amanda Peet, but in the crowd on
Tuesday night at the premiere of her new movie, ``Whipped,'' there
was some confusion about which one she was. A stunning woman in a
tight black, backless dress posed for the cameras. ``Is that her?''
one photographer asked.
</P>
<P>
   No. That was Lauren Holly.
</P>
<P>
   Peet swept into the Chelsea West Cinema wearing a skimpy,
blinding blue dress with teeny little straps. ``I get all my
fashion advice from her,'' she confided later in the lobby, while
the movie was being shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her'' was a friend from her days as a history major at
Columbia (and yes, Peet graduated, too): Tina Chai, another history
major, who had found her destiny first at Vogue and now as a
fashion editor at Us magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Chai was there to support Peet, who seemed to need a lot of
support. She was being attended to by her manager, Eric Kranzler,
from California, who was so completely involved with his client
that his lips moved along with hers as she answered hard-hitting
questions from E! Entertainment about what it feels like to kiss
three men in one movie. Photographers jostled and the crowd looked
stumped, for the most part, by the no-name stars of the movie, who
gathered with Peet for a group photo.
</P>
<P>
   All breezed into the theater for a few words from the
director-writer-producer, Peter Cohen, who wore the obligatory
baseball cap. And then the movie commenced, 88 minutes about four
men sitting around talking about scoring with women, and the woman
( Peet) who brings them to their knees.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 minutes into the movie, Peet sneaked out with Stephen
Hirsh, her agent, to grab a Cosmopolitan from the vodka bar set up
in the lobby. New York was Peet's hometown. She grew up in
Manhattan and attended Friends Seminary; later she worked at City
Crab on Park Avenue South.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days when she was struggling, and only Hirsh
would take her on as a client.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been rejected by four agencies,'' she recalled.
``William Morris said, `You're not ready. You have no confidence.'`
So I practiced having confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peet has every right to be confident now, even though her
manager and agent anxiously followed her through the night like
pilot fish. She is taping her second season of ``Jack and Jill,'' a
series on the WB Television Network. (Believe it or not, she plays
``Jack.'') And ``Whipped'' is a breakout movie for her, a real
starring role. It's her third film to be released this year,
following a flurry of blink-and-you-missed-it movies: ``Isn't She
Great,'' starring Bette Midler as Jacqueline Susann, and ``The
Whole Nine Yards,'' a forgettable movie starring Bruce Willis as a
hit man and Matthew Perry as a dentist. Peet, however, got raves
for playing the dentist's receptionist. ``She's like grapefruit
sorbet: she cleanses the palate,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   All that only eight years after she started out with Hirsh,
rushing to her first audition and ripping her dress ``all the way
up my butt,'' she said, miming how she walked into the casting
office holding her skirt together behind her. ``I asked the
receptionist for a safety pin,'' she recalled, before doing her
monologue from Woody Allen's ``Interiors.''
</P>
<P>
   Peet didn't get the part, and complained bitterly to her agent.
``I have a potty mouth when I'm disappointed,'' she confided.
Surely she didn't learn that at Friends Seminary, a private Quaker
high school in Manhattan. ``No,'' she said. ``But you've got to do
something since you can't hit people.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Hirsh went back to watching the movie through the doors
at the Chelsea West Cinema. Then he whisked her into a car for the
10-block ride to the Lotus lounge on West 14th Street, where people
like Holly, Stephen Dorff and Linda Evangelista gathered to
celebrate one critic's grapefruit sorbet, Hollywood's latest
flavor.

   MATTINGLY _ GOP Senate hopeful Mack Mattingly hung out with some

Wednesday and Nathan Deal in the 9th District on Thursday. He's
hoping for some coattail momentum to help boost his name
recognition after having not been on the ballot for 14 years. But
wonks say he'll need more than that _ namely lots of TV advertising
to become more familiar with voters. (Pruitt, Atlanta

<P>
   POLITICS-AD Republicans see no double-standard in play because
in 1996 they assailed Clinton for writing Democratic ``issues'' ads
in the White House while now Bush signs off on Republican ``soft

power over what they may or may not say about the Gore campaign.

   STILTSVILLE _ Stiltsville, the cluster of seven homes in
Biscayne Bay that remind South Floridians of the days when the city
was called ``Miamuh,'' may finally revert back to the federal
government. Group owners, who use the homes for weekend recreation
and chamber of commerce events, have waged a property rights battle
against the park service that would make Western Freemen proud, but
finally appear to be boxed out of their homes. The parks service
promises to keep the homes open to the public, but Stiltsvillians
doubt the feds will preserve these quirky pieces of history.

Who wins the presidential election may well be decided by who wins
the debates. But right now, more important than that, is the debate
about the debates. Al Gore's people want it to be the classic
one-on-one kind. George W. Bush's people want it to be the Larry

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Bush showing campaign confidence
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   George W. Bush claimed today he has the momentum against Al Gore
despite distractions and slipping polls. To Democratic complaints
that a new Republican campaign ad resorts to negative campaigning,
Bush said it is being broadcast by his party to counter attacks on
him. ``I'm going to defend myself,'' he said. Bush said the ad,
which questions Gore's credibility by citing his past in a
``tongue-in-cheekish'' way, comes after $30 million worth of
Democratic advertising challenging Bush's record. Bush was
campaigning today in Lafayette, La., and Texarkana, Ark.,
concentrating on education _ his chosen topic during a week of
distractions, including a ruling by a federal judge demanding
improvements in his state's handling of medical benefits for
low-income children.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH READY TO RUMBLE
</P>
<P>
   As the presidential race heads into its final two months, George
W. Bush says voters will begin hearing a lot from him about the
``failed leadership'' of the current administration. Hammering on a
theme he launched in his convention acceptance speech _ that Al
Gore has been part of an administration that ``squandered its
opportunities'' _ Bush said he will continue to beat on this point
in the post-Labor Day run-up to the election: ``I'm going to keep
reminding the American people that it's one thing to give flowery
speeches, to talk big about issues, but they've had a chance to
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   24-HOUR `WORKATHON' FOR GORE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore plans to burst into a 24-hour ``American Workathon'' to
mark the Labor Day holiday with a presidential campaign blitz
leading up to a major economic speech. Gore plans a five-city tour
beginning Sunday to ``spend time with Americans who are working.''
That's to be followed by a speech Wednesday in Cleveland where he
was to offer a detailed economic plan with specific goals for the
country's economic future.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTING MCCAIN, DOWNPLAYING NADER
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lieberman criticized George W. Bush's plans for Social
Security and Medicare today, using the words of Bush's defeated
Republican primary rival. ``Let me quote my friend and colleague,
John McCain, who said it best and probably said it right here in
Maine earlier this year, `Governor Bush's plan has not one penny
for Social Security, not one penny for Medicare and not one penny
for paying down the national debt.' John McCain was right then and
it is still right today,'' Lieberman also appealed to voters not to
support the Green Party's Ralph Nader instead of Gore. Lieberman
said Nader's national support has ``gone way down,'' and ``a vote
for Nader is a vote for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   GORE INSISTING ON COMMISSION DEBATES
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's campaign chief said today that Gore would consider
cable and network offers to debate George W. Bush only after
sealing a deal with the Presidential Commission on Debates for
three matchups. Dismissing sole-broadcast forums such as CNN's
``Larry King Live,'' as ``the wrong way to go,'' William Daley said
they wouldn't reach as many American TV viewers as commission
debates which everyone could air. Bush, whose aides were meeting
today with the commission members, hasn't accepted debate offers
yet, while Gore has officially accepted the commission's three
October debates and others.
</P>
<P>
   ATTACK AD AS JUNK BOND
</P>
<P>
   Getting personal, Republicans came out with an ad attacking Al
Gore's credibility in a gambit that exploits his greatest perceived
vulnerability while betraying worry about the course of George W.
Bush's campaign. The decision to attack Gore so directly this early
in the stretch to the Nov. 7 presidential election was widely seen
by those who study campaign conduct as a sign of nervousness about
how Bush is doing. That did not foreclose the possibility the ad
would score big. ``This is a political version of investing in junk
bonds,'' said political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, ``a dramatic and
risky move, which has the potential for a significant return.''
</P>
<P>
   GORE WON'T FIRE BACK, HOPES FOR BACKLASH
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee abandoned plans to release an
ad that seriously questions George W. Bush's record in Texas,
choosing to yield the spotlight to a new Republican attack ad
against Al Gore in the hope that it will backfire. After news
reports about the Republican ad appeared, Gore himself immediately
revised his plans for the day, backing away from a speech about
health care so that the Republicans' message _ an assault on Gore's
credibility _ would come through loud and clear. Gore then deployed
running mate Joe Lieberman to denounce the TV spot.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE TO LABOR DAY LEADER
</P>
<P>
   The presidential candidate significantly ahead in the polls
around Labor Day has won every election for the last 50 years _
largely because there have been few close elections over that span.
That hasn't been the case so far this year, with George W. Bush and
Al Gore virtually tied in many polls as Labor Day approaches. But a
Newsweek poll out today showed Gore 10 points ahead of Bush, and
other polls out late next week will give further evidence of
whether Gore is gaining a lead. ``There's a lot of evidence that
after Labor Day, the polls start to solidify,'' said James
Campbell, a political scientist from Buffalo, N.Y. and author of
``The American Campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   SO, DO WE STILL HAVE TO VOTE?
</P>
<P>
   Eight academics presented statistical models at the annual
meeting of the American Political Science Association, predicting
the outcome of the Nov. 7 election. All seven forecast an Al Gore
victory, with his projected share of the vote ranging from 52.8
percent to 60.3 percent. The seven scholars, with their predictions
for Gore: James Campbell, University at Buffalo, 52.8 percent; Brad
Lockerbie, University of Georgia, 52.9 percent; Alan Abramowitz,
Emory University, 53.2 percent, Helmut Norpoth, State University of
New York at Stony Brook, 55 percent; Christopher Wlezien,
University of Houston, 55.2; Charles Tien, Hunter College, with
Michael Lewis-Beck, University of Iowa, 55.4 percent; and Thomas
Holbrook, University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, 60.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   LIEBERMAN'S SENATE RACE QUESTIONED
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's Democratic secretary of state, Susan Bysiewicz,
says Joe Lieberman should quit his Senate race while running for
vice president. State Democrats generally have supported
Lieberman's decision to stay in the Senate race, but Bysiewicz said
she, and people she has talked to around the state _ ``folks who
think very highly of Senator Lieberman'' _ are ``a little
disappointed'' by it. Lieberman has an overwhelming lead over his
Republican challenger, Waterbury Mayor Phillip Giordano, in the
Senate race. But if he should also win the vice presidency, it
would fall to Republican Gov. John Rowland to appoint a
replacement. Lieberman could quit the Senate race as late as Oct.
27 and be replaced by another Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   OPRAH STRETCHING OUT, SETS GORE INTERVIEW
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey, known for chatting about books and spirituality,
will venture into the political arena next month with season
opening guest Al Gore. Winfrey has scheduled a live interview for
Sept. 11, the first show of her 15th season. This is new territory
for Winfrey. She has done interviews with political figures
including first ladies Barbara Bush and Hillary Clinton, but the
context was decidedly apolitical. Producers also have invited
George W. Bush to appear. Bush has not yet responded.
</P>
<P>
   A GOOD SCHOOL EXPERIENCE
</P>
<P>
   Pop quizzes, more often than not, spell troubles for
politicians. So Dick Cheney looked vaguely concerned when he got
one Thursday morning as he walked into a classroom full of
6-year-olds in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. His task, explained the
teacher, Rosalyn Robinson, was to guess which solution an egg would
float in: corn starch, food coloring or salt. Cheney chose salt,
and as he dropped eggs into cups filled with each solution, he was
borne out. ``Just don't ask me to spell potato,'' he said,
referring to another quiz met with less success by another
Republican, Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   NOT A GOOD SCHOOL EXPERIENCE
</P>
<P>
   It was clearly not Dick Cheney's favorite subject. The
Republican vice presidential nominee had gone to Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., to push the ticket's school construction proposal. The plan
calls for the federal government to allow private companies and
school districts to issue tax-exempt bonds for school construction.
But Cheney quickly became muddled when asked about basic points,
overstating the program's cost by about 1,500 percent and turning
repeatedly to an aide for help. ``I think the $2.8 billion is a
five-year figure,'' he said. ``Kathleen, correct me if I'm wrong,
that $2.8 billion is the revenue that would be foregone by the
federal government.'' Kathleen Shannahan corrected him: ``The total
cost is $181 million over five years, for an (annual) average of
$36.2 million.''
</P>
<P>
   NADER WEARING WELL ON THE WEB
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader's Web sites are up, running and loaded with
``NaderNews,'' video highlights and anything else needed to make
him more than a bit player in the presidential campaign. The Green
Party presidential candidate is still thirsting for coverage by the
mainstream media, where Al Gore and George W. Bush rule the roost.
But votenader.org and the friskier, ``unofficial'' nader2000.org
are avidly chronicling his every move and utterance. The
votenader.org site extols him as an enemy of ``the political decay
that has turned our government over to a plutocracy and to the
politicians who take its marching orders.''
</P>
<P>
   BIG TAX BILL FOR CLINTON'S HOST
</P>
<P>
   The builder playing host to President Clinton and Senate
candidate Hillary Clinton this weekend in the upstate New York
resort village of Skaneateles has an outstanding state tax bill of
almost $1 million, officials said today. A tax warrant against
Thomas B. McDonald, issued in October 1999, claims McDonald owed
the state $771,662 in unpaid income taxes for 1997 and about
$145,000 in interest and penalties as of October. Interest on the
tax bill is believed to have increased the total owed to
$938,357.48, said Marc Carey, a spokesman for the state Department
of Taxation and Finance. Said White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart: ``People from time to time have issues with either the
IRS or the state and they generally get resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   JEWISH WALLETS BEING TAPPED
</P>
<P>
   Trailing in the money race, the Democratic National Committee
has launched a high-stakes effort to capitalize on vice
presidential nominee Joe Lieberman with a fund-raising campaign
aimed at Jewish donors who have not been politically active in the
past. The fund-raising drive will be part of a larger DNC push to
raise at least $50 million over the last two months of the
campaign. One Gore money raiser likened it to the outpouring of
support from Catholics for John Kennedy's candidacy in 1960 or the
response from Greek-Americans to Michael Dukakis' 1988 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   MORE MONEY GOING TO LAZIO
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lazio's New York Senate campaign collected more than $10.7
million between July 1 and Aug. 23, a staggering amount boosted by
small checks from thousands of Hillary Clinton opponents around the
country. Lazio far outstripped his Democratic opponent, who took in
$3.3 million during the same period. The figures were included in
reports the candidates filed with the Federal Elections Commission.
The reports include only ``hard money contributions,'' which are
limited to $2,000 per individual donor and go directly to the
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   LONELINESS AT THE POLLS PREDICTED
</P>
<P>
   Despite a spirited race between Al Gore and George W. Bush,
voter turnout in the 2000 presidential election could be the lowest
in modern American history, according to a new study. Curtis Gans,
director of the nonpartisan Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate, said low turnout in the primaries, scant political
coverage by the major TV networks and an increasingly disinterested
public were to blame. In the 1996, voter turnout dropped to 49
percent of the voting-age population, equaling the total in 1924 _
the lowest percentage for a presidential election in the modern
era. The study by Gans' organization predicts turnout will be lower
on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   LAWSUIT AGAINST BUSH TO GO FORWARD
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has lost his bid for dismissal from a lawsuit
accusing him of violating the free speech rights of environmental
protesters at the Governor's Mansion in Austin, Texas. State
District Judge John Dietz said Bush could be called to testify when
the case goes to trial. No date has been set. The suit alleged that
Bush gave state troopers ``unbridled discretion'' to target
protesters picketing in front of the mansion last year on a public
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   MAKE WAY FOR THE DOT-COM MOM
</P>
<P>
   USA Weekend magazine, along with Steve and Cokie Roberts, have
identified the swing voter in the presidential election. ``Soccer
Mom'' has been displaced by ``Dot-Com Mom'' _ the single American
the candidates must capture in order to win the race. The model
Dot-Com Mom is Cherly O'Donnell. She lives in the suburbs of
Cincinnati. She is a business owner, a wife and a mother of two.
The Dot-Com Mom is Roman Catholic and the youngish of the Baby Boom
era. She works part-time and spends a tremendous amount of time on
her e-commerce business. The Dot-Com Mom uses the Internet daily
from paying bills to planning family vacations. So how's she
leaning? So far, O'Donnell is not impressed with either candidate.

HOW TO ESCAPE THE HAMPTONS: PADDLE! 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 3) 
 By JULIA CHAPLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As I was gliding over the chop on my surfboard last Saturday
afternoon, wearing a red bikini and matching long-sleeve rash
guard, hair matted with salt, I greeted the members of the motley
bronzed gang I'd known for three months, but whose names I still
hadn't caught: ``Hey man, catch any good rides today?''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't exactly how I had planned on spending my summer in
the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   True, after learning surf basics during recent vacations in
Mexico and Los Angeles, I had purchased a 1987 black Monte Carlo SS
so I could cart my long board in style to a cramped surf shack near
Ditch Plains, Montauk's surf mecca. But I wasn't ``hard core'' or
anything. I had only rented the place, sight unseen, with seven
other Manhattan surfers I'd met by chance at a club just before
Memorial Day. (That I claimed I could surf and pay rent served as
adequate reference.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to working the tube, I admit that I also had designs
on that party circuit featured in ``The Mix'' pages of Hamptons
magazine. But after the first few weekends of making the 45-minute
commute to party alongside 18-year-old models with sharp elbows, my
will began to wane. The moment of truth came after Jay Z's Fourth
of July barbecue. Around 3 a.m., at Conscience Point, I found
myself showing off my prized surf bruises to a man wearing shiny
loafers, a tennis sweater over his shoulders and a totally glazed
look.
</P>
<P>
   That night, the tug of the Montauk tide won out. I headed east
and never looked back. I gave up trying to tame my hair against the
forces of the ocean humidity and went with the sun-damaged, nappy
look. I closeted my Gucci heels in favor of flip-flops, shelved the
hip-hop CDs and bought the Beach Boys' ``Pet Sounds.'' The
adjectives ``stoked,'' ``gnarly'' and ``epic'' filtered into my
vocabulary. I was converted.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, I was just joining the wave. While there have
been surfers in Montauk since the 1960s, over the last few years a
new set of boarders is turning out in record numbers. Hipsters,
models, photographers and architects can be spotted riding the soup
alongside local teen-agers and fellow Manhattanites, including the
artist Julian Schnabel, the designer Tracy Feith, the Razorfish
co-founder Jeff Dachis, Paper magazine's David Hershkovits (though
he's actually a boogie boarder), and the nightclub impresario Will
Regan of Union Bar and Lotus.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Foley, who opened the Air &AMP; Speed Board Shop in Montauk
five years ago, says his business has taken off in the last two
seasons. ``There's more surfers than ever, particularly among women
and beginners,'' said Foley, who started holding surf camps this
summer to meet the demand for lessons. East Deck, a '50s-style
motel with rickety wood-paneled suites is a favorite surfer hangout
_ the Four Seasons of Montauk _ because of its choice beach
location in Ditch Plains. The motel has had to implement a waiting
list for the rooms closest to the break, known as the ``A''
section, and is planning to install a digital camera on the roof
that will feed real-time images of the waves to a surf forecast Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Gerri Tomitaz, a real estate agent at Remington Realty Ltd., who
has been renting homes in Montauk for almost 10 years, says that
she has been getting calls from more and more surfers and that as a
group surfers are gaining greater social status. ``Years ago nobody
wanted to rent to surfers because they had a reputation for being
slobs and bums,'' Tomitaz said. ``But this new breed is more
affluent and upscale. They're restaurateurs and architects, and are
considered very desirable tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   Alison Haas, 24, a public relations associate at Chanel, started
surfing this summer, after renting a splintery shack in Ditch
Plains with 14 other people. She has abandoned the tonier Hamptons
for good. ``Out here you can wear flip-flops and sarongs all day,''
she said, peeling off her rash guard shirt and spraying herself
with Chanel sunscreen. ``There's no scene out here at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-lane dropouts may be heading to Montauk as much for
surf-worthy waves as for its anti-Hamptons attitude, but the
laid-back vibe can take some gelling. In Montauk, tiny houses are
seen as a conceptual style choice, not a sign of an anemic bank
account. Even so, when I first laid eyes on my summer rental,
decent by surf share standards, I was somewhat taken aback. It was
hardly the sprawling bachelor lair I had envisioned; instead, it
was a flimsy pre-fab modular, a low-rent version of the kind in
``The Truman Show.'' In place of a pool or a hot tub in the yard
there was a mosquito-ridden swamp, and the view consisted of a
bulldozer and a few tricycles abandoned by the kids across the
street. Getting my equipment out of the basement was always
worrisome: a cute surfer housemate with a knack for picking up
girls slept down there on a double mattress.
</P>
<P>
   It took some adjusting to give up all addictions to gourmet
coffees and food. Most of the restaurant fare in Montauk is greasy,
overcooked or fried. Brawny athletic types in board shorts lounge
about sipping coffees _ no cappuccinos _ outside delis and packing
post-surf-session carbohydrates at hokey diners like Mr. John's
Pancake House. The most nouvelle option is the Ditch Witch, a
health-food truck that sells wraps and smoothies in the dirt lot in
front of the main break.
</P>
<P>
   Social life out East might not require a lot of thought about
what logos to wear to polo matches, but it has its own etiquette,
like not ``dropping in'' on other people's waves or ``bailing off''
boards on crowded, two-foot waves. Name-dropping is another no-no,
largely because people don't even know each other's names. Like
American Indians or mobsters, surfers tend to be identified by
their most prominent physical characteristics, though admittedly
they're less inventive (``the cute blond guy with the red board'').

 &HT;    Sometimes the best vacations of all are spent reaching up to
God, reaching out to others.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sitting at a beachside cafe sipping pina coladas, reading in a
rocking chair on the porch of a mountain cabin, or sightseeing
across the country may be relaxing vacations away from work and
routine. But there are other rewarding uses of time: meditating on
a spiritual retreat; growing vegetables to learn about hunger;
taking students on a journey of reconciliation. With classes back
in session and fall events gearing up, we gave some Georgians whose
holidays were meaningful the classic back-to-school assignment: How
I Spent My Summer Vacation.
</P>
<P>
   EVELYN WATKINS, 34
</P>
<P>
   Residence: Douglasville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Religious affiliation: World Changers Church International.
</P>
<P>
   Activity: Went on retreat at the FieldStone Inn in Hiawassee in
the North Georgia mountains.
</P>
<P>
   IN HER OWN WORDS:
</P>
<P>
   ``As we traveled there on a Friday evening, we whined all the
way. `There are no Chick-fil-A restaurants. The sheets are going to
be musty in the cabin.' But once we got there, a gentleman came in
and said it was beautiful and the view was wonderful and the air
was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``And God convicted me. He said, `Did you hear what they said
and what you said?' When we woke up the next morning, we opened the
curtains; it was just as though someone had hand-painted the scene.
It was majestic. Somehow all of that worry seemed so insignificant
against what reflected out of the windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to think of nature as something we have to control.
But there are some things that are wonderful, functional and
majestic all by themselves. One of the things I enjoyed was how
much nature appreciated nature. The grass under the tree, the
shade, seeing branches move when birds sit on them _ all of
creation seemed to relish what seems so ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming back the ride was quiet. There seemed to be a sense of
peace. I wanted to notice the things on the way back that I didn't
notice on the way there. I wasn't looking for a Chick-fil-A.''
</P>
<P>
   DR. LEE WOODALL, 45
</P>
<P>
   Residence: Barnesville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Religious affiliation: First United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Activity: Woodall, a family physician, made his first trip to do
mission work in Honduras in 1993 under the sponsorship of
Decatur-based Honduras Outreach Inc. He has made several trips
since then, and now serves on the board of Honduras Outreach. In
July, he led a team of eight people to work on clinic and church
repairs in the village of La Ensenada, which has about 120 homes,
mostly mud huts with no electricity. He also treated patients.
</P>
<P>
   IN HIS OWN WORDS:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to realize that my work and responsibilities in
Honduras are an important part of God's call to serve my sisters
and brothers. God has been preparing me for this work for many
years, long before I heard or answered this call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through my experience in Honduras, God has allowed me to more
completely experience his love for my sisters and brothers and for
me. I see the world through different eyes than before. I read his
word with a different understanding. I am privileged to have
discovered sisters and brothers whom I never knew, whom I deeply
love, and whom I consider role models for me in my life. I am a
better person because of them and their love for me. I am honored
that God chose me for this. I am grateful to Honduras Outreach Inc.
for the organizational structure that allows this to happen.''

   CHASTITY GRIFFIN, 15
</P>
<P>
   Residence: Northwest Atlanta; student at Frederick Douglass High
School.
</P>
<P>
   Religious affiliation: Mount Ephraim Baptist Church in northwest
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Activity: The Atlanta Garden for Youth, a two-month day camp
project of the Atlanta Community Food Bank, June 19-Aug. 12, to
train a dozen teenagers in how to grow and sell organic food and to
teach them about hunger issues.
</P>
<P>
   IN HER OWN WORDS:
</P>
<P>
   ``I mulched and weeded and planted and harvested and sold
vegetables. I learned that it's not just people without a job who
get hungry. There are a lot of people who work all day for minimum
wage, and after they pay their rent and utilities and buy clothes
for their family there's not much left for food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me realize I need to get a good education, so I don't
have to work on minimum wage. I'd like to go talk to kids in
different schools about what I did this summer, encouraging them to
get involved in creating food gardens and helping the hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the project I learned to work as part of a team and
made new friends. Since I have mostly attended African-American
schools, the program allowed me to appreciate people from different
backgrounds more.''
</P>
<P>
   CYNTHIA SHAW, 52
</P>
<P>
   Residence: Avondale Estates, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Religious affiliation: Ebenezer Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Activity: Shaw, assistant dean and director of student
development at Emory University, took a group of students on a
``Journey of Reconciliation,'' a service, learning and work trip to
South Africa. The trip was sponsored by Emory's office of the dean
of the chapel and religious life. The journeys are one element in
Emory's ``Year of Reconciliation,'' a series of talks,
performances, projects and events to encourage dialogue on the
theme of reconciliation as it relates to a range of society's most
pressing issues.
</P>
<P>
   IN HER OWN WORDS:
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of this trip, the ones that have gone in the past
and the one to Northern Ireland this year, is to provide Emory
students the opportunity to cultivate relationships with
communities that are engaged in various stages of reconciliation
around the world. We hope to support these communities in their
reconciliation efforts and learn from them. This was my second trip
to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all given African names in a worship service. To a
person, that probably was the most moving experience of the trip.
It is not just that you're given a name; you are usually given the
name of the person standing before you naming you.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Africa when they name a child, they look at the child, they
study the circumstances of the family they're born into, the day of
the week, they factor so many things into how a person is named
that it's a very thoughtful process. When they give away their
name, they're giving away a part of themselves. They're saying that
if you return, because you're a part of me, you will always have a
home here. It's very powerful. Lerato, my African name, means love.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1997 my first trip to Africa was going home. You look at
the people there and they look like me _ like aunts and uncles and
sisters. It affirmed for me that I was home, this is where I came
from.''

<P>
   Religious affiliation: Transfiguration Catholic Church in
Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Activity: Justin, following in the footsteps of his older
brother, Sean, took part in the Ulster Project Atlanta, a
tolerance-building program pairing a dozen Catholic and Protestant
teens from Omagh, Northern Ireland, with teens in Atlanta. The
Irish youngsters spent a month (June 29-July 28) living with the
families of the Atlanta teenagers. The 24 teens participated daily
in social activities, service projects and discussion groups.
Justin and his family hosted Darren Pritchard, 15.
</P>
<P>
   IN HIS OWN WORDS:
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Six Flags and Stone Mountain, helped clean up a
park, and helped feed the homeless downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to a different church each week. We talked about
conflict and how to get along. I was never very social, but now I
am. Almost everyone in the project became my friend. The kids were
so nice, they brought me out. And I got to meet a lot of girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty cool. The Irish say things differently than us.
You say cool, they say lethal. When they say, `We're having good
craic' (pronounced crack), they mean good fun. I've stayed in touch
with four or five of the kids via e-mail, and have called Darren
several times, but it's expensive. He'll be getting e-mail soon.''

</P>
<P>
   Activity: Decided to spend vacation with her husband, Cleve,
traveling to the Potter's House, the church led by Bishop T.D.
Jakes, a nationally known evangelist. Before the trip, Pounds said
God told her to donate her family's van to her sister.
</P>
<P>
   IN HER OWN WORDS:
</P>
<P>
   ``I called my sister and told her, `God is telling us to plant
the car in your life.' So we drove down there and gave the van to
them, even though we only have a car for a family of five.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time down there, Bishop Jakes' message was about
`nonsense faith.' That's a move in your life when God establishes
stuff in your life that actually makes no sense. That was a message
of confirmation for us. We called it the Isaac offering, being
willing to give of yourself, not knowing if it's going to come
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the Potter's House and it was an awesome
experience. It was multicultural, a very charismatic high praise
worship service. It challenged you to not just talk about faith but
to live it. God speaks to you best when you pull back from the
normal hustle and bustle that keeps you distracted. We're mindful
that we're not taking a vacation away from God. We take a vacation
so we can spend time with God.''

   Even the calendar is different out here. While most Hamptonites
pack up on Labor Day, the surfer season peaks from August through
October, when the hurricane storms create the best swells.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even fall waves on Long Island aren't that big
compared with the macking towers of power found in California and
Hawaii. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. In Montauk, the
summer swells are typically a manageable one to three feet, so it's
easy to come off looking like a pro. Status is measured in other
ways. You're somewhere near the top of the pecking order if you: 1)
have friends who are pro surfers or have met Kelly Slater, 2) have
lived/surfed in Hawaii or know someone who does, 3) know Peter
Beard well enough to cut through his property to get to the break
called Ranch or 4) are self-employed so that you can take off at a
moment's notice if the surf's up.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the word is out. Surfers and ``posers'' alike are
flocking to have a piece of the local motion, the main road through
town is lined with cars and SUVs toting piles of boards on their
roofs and, contrary to the idyllic images on local postcards, on
the weekends the waves are so packed with surfers and boogie
boarders that it looks like the Long Island Expressway during rush
hour. In fact, it's starting to resemble the showy beach scene at
Sagaponack's Sagg Main. One day when a guy who looked like a banker
pulled up in a silver Mercedes carrying an expensive board with no
wax on it (a sure sign of little usage) my housemate Tommy shook
his head and sneered, ``What a Barney,'' surfer-speak for a rich
guy who has the latest gear but can't surf.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't stress on the bunk vibes. Montauk has its own
low-key charms, the kind of mindless, grungy summer pleasures you
might have had when you were a teen-ager. We bought a few Tiki
torches, a hammock and Hula-Hoops from Kmart. With the dozens of
surfboards leaned up against the house, I had to admit it looked
pretty authentic.
</P>
<P>
   We held backyard cookouts and made cozy beach bonfires where we
debated the day's rides and made wide-eyed plans to go on surf
safaris to such tubular paradises as Fiji and Mexico. On the days
when the waves weren't ``working'' we huddled on our sandy couch,
reading surf magazines and watching surf videos and the Weather
Channel. Sometimes at night, we'd pile into my housemates' giant
cargo van and drive to local bars like Cantina, a Mexican-themed
dive with too many cactus paintings, for its weekly surf social.
</P>
<P>
   There we'd consume beer and chips in front of a big-screen TV
and watch more surf footage. A favorite was the amateurish ``Big
Wednesday,'' shot last August off Ditch Plains during eight-foot
hurricane swells. Whenever people at the bar saw someone they knew
riding the tube they'd wave a fist and cheer: ``Ye-ah! Shred it up,
dude!''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-August, tanned and buff, we all decided to make our
summer as endless as possible and extend our rental till November.

&HT;     CLINTON PUNTS ON MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While declaring that the missile threat to the
United States is ``real and growing,'' President Clinton announced
Friday that he would let the next administration decide whether to
deploy a controversial system to defend against missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have decided not to authorize deployment of a national
missile defense at this time,'' Clinton said in a speech at
Georgetown University here, adding that he ordered the Pentagon
instead to continue testing the complex system of satellites,
rocket interceptors and sophisticated sensors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made progress but we should not move forward until we
have absolute confidence the system will work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans immediately denounced the president's decision, with
GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush saying the action
``underscores the fact that for seven years the Clinton-Gore
administration has failed to strengthen America's defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Bush said that the administration ``first denied
the need for missile defenses, then delayed. Now they are leaving
this important unfinished business for the next president.''
</P>
<P>
   If elected president, Bush, the Texas governor, said that he
would not hesitate to deploy the National Missile Defense (NMD)
``at the earliest possible date.'' Bush supports deploying a more
extensive version of NMD that theoretically would protect the
United States as well as its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans lined up behind Bush. Rep. Floyd Spence,
R-S.C., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said
Clinton's action would ``leave Americans vulnerable to ballistic
missile attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., called the decision ``dangerous,''
adding that ``the time is rapidly approaching when countries such
as North Korea and Iran will have missiles capable of striking the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last several days, Bush and his running mate, former
defense secretary Dick Cheney, have made the case that the Clinton
White House has undercut military readiness by the combination of
successive years of budget cuts and frequent deployment of troops
to overseas hot spots. The White House and Vice President Al Gore,
the Democratic nominee for president, counter that the military is
the best prepared it has been in years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore defended Clinton's decision on NMD. ``I welcome the
opportunity to be more certain that these technologies actually
work together properly,'' said Gore, who supports a much more
limited NMD system than Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., called the decision ``a win for all
Americans'' because it gives the administration more time to work
out the technological and diplomatic kinks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision also was greeted warmly in Moscow and by arms
control groups.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Interfax news agency, Gen. Leonid Ivashov, a
senior Russian defense ministry official, said: ``There is hope
that a considered approach to the solution of the most important
international problems will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   The Union of Concerned Scientists, which staunchly opposes the
missile defense system, called the action ``the right call at the
right time.'' And the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers said
Clinton ``has come to the common sense conclusion that that NMD is
not ready for prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration says the system is needed to protect the
entire United States from a limited missile attack from North Korea
or Iran, two ``rogue'' country's believed to be the most likely to
fire a missile at the United States. NMD also is being designed to
provide protection against an accidental nuclear missile launch in
Russia, sparked by decaying Soviet-era equipment or a weapon that
falls into the hands of a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   According to current Pentagon plans, the program will be
constructed in several phases. At first the anti-missile system
will use 20 interceptors based in Alaska. But by 2007, the Pentagon
plans to add another 80 interceptor missiles. The cost is estimated
at around $36 billion but could rise to $60 billion or beyond,
depending on how many interceptors and sensors are added.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton said the ballistic missile threat ``is
real and growing and has given new urgency to the debate about
national missile defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that while NMD still faces technological hurdles,
the administration also faces diplomatic obstacles. He said
additional time is needed to assuage the concerns of China, Russia
and several NATO allies. Beijing and Moscow fear that NMD, which is
prohibited under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, might
render their nuclear arsenals obsolete, forcing both to build
improved classes of nuclear weapons, thereby triggering an arms
race.
</P>
<P>
   From a diplomatic standpoint, the United States has two options:
get Moscow to agree to change the treaty or unilaterally exit the
pact. Russia thus far has been loathe to alter the treaty, which
has served as the basis for nuclear security for 28 years.

</P>
<P>
   In three flight tests to date in which a mock intercontinental
ballistic missile was fired against the system, two tests ended in
failure and one scored a direct hit and knocked the missile from
the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision halts plans to build a powerful radar station
on a remote Aleutian Island off the Alaskan coast that would have
been used to scour the skies for signs of a missile attack.
Construction of the radar station would have been the first steps
in deploying the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's action effectively means that NMD won't be operational
until at least 2006, one year later than previously planned. The
first contracts for the radar would have had to be awarded by
December to begin construction next spring.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A little war against time has begun. Last year in New York, when
the Museum of Modern Art opened the show ``Modern Starts: People,
Places, Things,'' the first part of ``MOMA 2000,'' Cezanne's
``Bather'' from 1885 was found hanging next to a 1993 Rineke
Dijkstra photograph of a pale boy in a maroon bathing suit.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later the Tate Modern, in its permanent collection,
lined up Matisse's sculptures of women's backs before a firing
squad of ink drawings of nude women by a contemporary artist named
Marlene Dumas. And at the modern art museum at the Georges Pompidou
Center, Henri Rousseau's 19th-century ``War'' faced off against a
Picasso sculpture from 1950, ``Girl Jumping Rope.''
</P>
<P>
   The critics were up in arms. What got them was not the mixing of
media or the mixing of masterpieces with lesser works. It was the
mixing of time periods. As Jed Perl, an American art critic, put it
in The New Republic, ``Chronology, that backbone of the historical
sense, has been collapsed into some kind of postmodern time warp.''
</P>
<P>
   David Sylvester, a British art critic, wrote in The London
Review of Books that ``chronology is not a tool of art-historical
interpretation which can be used at one moment, discarded at
another.'' Rather, he said, ``It's an objective reality, built into
the fabric of the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticism, anti-chronology is now the rage. The
Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Denver Art Museum and the High Museum
of Art in Atlanta have all rehung their painting and sculpture
collections according to subject instead of chronology. And ``The
Art Book,'' published by Phaidon, ``debunks art-historical
classifications'' (in its words) by arranging artists
alphabetically instead of chronologically. That is, Picasso is
found next to Piero della Francesca and Manet next to Mangold.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing curators seem to agree on about anti-chronology is
this: Chronology and time are only the surface issues. The deeper
issues are genealogy and history, whether there is a great lineage
of art, a natural progression of one art movement after another
leading up to the grand finale, abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   In art history, said Linda Nochlin, the Lila Acheson Wallace
Professor of Modern Art at the Institute of Fine Arts in New York,
``there is a tendency to use chronology as teleology,'' as proof of
a march toward a goal. ``To the degree that a nonchronological hang
can destroy that,'' she said, she approves. ``The main thing is to
break up the idea of an uninterrupted flow.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the problem with flow? The problem is the flow chart. In
1936 Alfred H. Barr Jr., the founding director of the Museum of
Modern Art, created a diagram to go with the exhibition ``Cubism
and Abstract Art.'' It showed the evolution of various movements
or, as they are now called, ``isms'': Neo-Impressionism, Fauvism,
Cubism, Futurism, Expressionism, Orphism, Suprematism,
Constructivism, Dadaism, Neoplasticism, Purism, Surrealism. And all
the isms led to abstraction.
</P>
<P>
   With its Hegelian aura of inevitability and objectivity, the
Barr diagram is the casus belli of the chronological war. In ``Tate
Modern: The Handbook,'' Iwona Blazwick and Frances Morris, who
developed the conceptual framework for the new museum's displays,
note that Barr's chart ``came to dominate most modernist
collections around the world,'' and that it ``is still used to
delineate art into periods and movements.''
</P>
<P>
   That chart ``was the religion of modern art, like the chart of
the House of Windsor,'' said Robert Rosenblum, a professor of fine
arts at New York University. ``It represented truth. This one
married that one and begat that one.'' It was neat, easy to absorb
and difficult to eliminate. Floor plans were designed with the
diagram in mind. As Nicholas Serota, the director of the Tate,
wrote in ``Experience or Interpretation,'' the modern art museum
became a one-way narrative, ``a single path with no byways and only
occasional opportunities for exit.''
</P>
<P>
   Now museums are working to undo the diagram. Why now, at such a
late date? Almost everyone thinks the millennium was a motivating
factor. Blazwick said, ``The idea of starting with 1900 and
marching to 2000 was _ well, there is such a thing as museum
fatigue.'' Charles Stuckey, a curator at the Kimbell Art Museum in
Fort Worth, cited ``the pressures of political correctness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to show that the history of art is not about
masterpieces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Crow, the director of the Getty Research Institute, said the
theoretical ideas from art history and the social sciences are
finally seeping into museums.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, bucking Barr is now a museum sport. Some
have tried the nonchronological approach. Others have gone for the
hyperchronological approach.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Stuckey ``raked together'' the contemporary and modern
collections of the Art Institute of Chicago and showed them
strictly chronologically, without regard for geography, medium or
movement. ``It was a new way to look at the collection, and it
brought out works that had fallen between the cracks,'' he said.
``It's rather neutral politically. It's nonbiased.'' Like an
alphabetical approach, ``it gives no advantage to a group or a
place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim Museum's ``1900,'' a show put together by
Rosenblum that examines a slice of art from 1897 to 1903 with few
works from the modernist canon, was another radical response. ``I
like to shuffle the deck of isms,'' Rosenblum said. ``Showing
everything done at the same time is anti-chronological in a
sense,'' because there is no time passing, no progress. It is a
snapshot of a moment.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog for the second part of ``MOMA 2000,'' ``Making
Choices,'' took a swipe at chronology, too. Rather than surveying a
sweep of time, the book explored core samples of four years: 1929,
1939, 1948, 1955.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, the most popular way of bucking Barr is the
anti-chronological hang. Both ``Tate Modern: The Handbook'' and the
Museum of Modern Art's catalog for ``Modern Starts'' reproduced
Barr's diagram as a kind of cautionary tale. And both made it their
business to get across the idea that there is no one true history,
but rather many.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Tate Modern's installation has no single pathway through it.
And Blazwick noted that in the new museum you can see that
``everything is constructed.'' Even the wall labels are signed now,
and each one expresses the view of its author. In each gallery,
Blazwick said, you can tell that ``someone made a decision.'' That
is, ``by selecting one thing, we are also rejecting something.''
There is no natural order, no objective truth.
</P>
<P>
   And there is no one modernism. The word ``modern,'' Blazwick
said, ``is so flexible and multivalent that we think of it in terms
of modernisms: plural not singular.'' So modern has become
postmodern, a potpourri of choices. Or as John Elderfield, chief
curator at large at the Museum of Modern Art, put it: ``We're not
replacing one orthodoxy with another. We want to show that what was
happening until now was an orthodoxy.'' It is a process of
defamiliarizing the familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is something oddly familiar about the new
anti-chronological hangs. The Tate Modern and the Museum of Modern
Art, after pondering various options _ including organizing the
collection or exhibition according to geography, or around certain
manifestos or important exhibitions, or by modes of fabrication, or
by color, or according to the prevailing thinkers _ independently
came up with those old-fashioned categories called genres.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Modern Art took three categories for ``Modern
Starts'' _ people, places, things. The Tate took four genres _
still life, landscape, nude and history painting _ and then
loosened them up. In both cases, though, it was back to the future.
</P>
<P>
   The nonchronological hang is an old notion. In the 18th century
museums were just collections of loot, Elderfield noted. And before
that there were Wunderkammern, cabinets of wonders, curiosities and
grotesques, organized every which way. The shift began when the
Louvre opened to the public after the French Revolution and assumed
a didactic function.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arranging paintings in terms of schools and countries was a
19th-century invention,'' Elderfield said. ``There was a ``passion
to systematize.'' So the resurrection of genres in installations is
a way of leapfrogging backward over the 19th-century obsession with
linear progress and evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no natural way to hang things,'' he said, just as in
biology there is almost no natural way to categorize things. ``All
taxonomies are subjective except species.'' And in art history
there are no species.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to agree that every hanging is biased and
incomplete. So maybe the chronology war comes down to whether to
dwell on the biases or not. Donna De Salvo, a curator at Tate
Modern said, ``We want to allow things to feel unsettled,'' to let
people see that museums are constructions, not givens. Or as
Blazwick put it, ``We are trying to make the institution more
transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that too much transparency obscures the art. ``Of
course every historical view is partial,'' Stuckey said. ``But I
think the best system is where you're unaware that someone has
arranged it. A curator should walk on the sand without leaving his
footprints.''

ISRAEL LEADER DOWNPLAYS U.S. CONCERN ABOUT IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak displayed no anxiety
Friday about reported U.S. concerns that Iraq might be preparing to
attack Israel, calmly brushing aside the news that the United
States has put a Patriot anti-missile battery on alert for possible
deployment in Israel's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this Patriot missile battery really needs to
be bothered,'' Barak said, adding that he did not think Israelis
should worry. Indeed, there is no state of alert here, no palpable
feeling that there is any cause of concern. The lead story on the
evening news was the opening of the new school year.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving a high school in the town of Ramle on Friday morning,
Barak suggested that Israelis not be distracted by the reports. ``I
would recommend that the students concentrate on their studies,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials confirmed Friday that the Pentagon had ordered an
air defense artillery brigade based in Germany to be prepared to
move its Patriot anti-missile battery to Israel. Sandy Berger, the
national security adviser, said, ``A decision was made that it
would be prudent to put these batteries on a shorter leash time
than ordinarily.'' The full battery consists of 64 supersonic
surface-to-air missiles built to intercept incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The alert was first reported in Friday's Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the Pentagon had specific new information
suggesting an imminent attack or was preparing for the possibility
that Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, might consider the timing
right for a sudden move, with Americans preoccupied by their
presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that he knew of no threat against Israel from Iraq,
adding that given the ``vituperative statements'' that Saddam had
made against Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and the prospect of sending
inspectors back into Iraq, the batteries were placed on alert.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, a U.S. Embassy official said, ``It's only put on
alert _ and publicly put on alert. It's a way to send a message to
Saddam Hussein that we're paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   If Israel were attacked or threatened with imminent attack by
Iraq, it would be unlikely to rely on a Patriot anti-missile
battery for its defense anyway, military experts say.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier model of the Patriot, deployed in Israel during the
Persian Gulf war in 1991, proved ineffectual against the 39 Scud
missiles that Iraq fired at Israel. In 1998, when tensions ran high
between Iraq and the United States, Israel deployed a
new-generation Patriot missile that is said to be better at
tracking and intercepting incoming missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The more advanced Arrow anti-missile system, which Israel is
developing in partnership with the United States, is still in the
testing stages.
</P>
<P>
   But Israel would be expected to respond not defensively but
offensively to any attacks, or even the threat of an attack.
Israeli military officials note that Israeli F-15 fighter jets have
the capacity to strike targets deep inside Iraq and return home
without refueling. Israel is also believed to possess medium-range
ballistic missiles that could be aimed at Iraqi military
installations.

SOUTH AMERICAN LEADERS FAIL TO SUPPORT U.S.-BACKED `PLAN
COLOMBIA' 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ The presidents of South America's 12
countries on Friday rebuffed President Clinton's appeal, made
earlier this week, that they endorse a new, American-backed
military and police offensive aimed at drug trafficking and
guerrilla groups in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint declaration issued at the conclusion of a two-day
summit meeting here, the leaders expressed support for efforts by
Colombia's president, Andres Pastrana, to negotiate an end to four
decades of civil conflict there. But they pointedly omitted any
mention of Pastrana's plan to use military means to weaken the
cocaine cartels and the left-wing guerrilla and right-wing death
squads that are allied with them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a news conference about the deepening political and
military crisis in Colombia, President Ricardo Lagos of Chile made
the distinction explicit. The presidents fully support ``the peace
process, which implies negotiations,'' he said, and which is
therefore, in their view, ``distinct from the problem of narcotics
trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   During his visit to Colombia on Wednesday, Clinton urged that
country's neighbors to ``be strongly supportive of President
Pastrana and Plan Colombia,'' a comprehensive $7.5 billion package
whose military component is largely supplied by the United States.
It is ``just not right,'' Clinton added, that ``all the cancer of
narcotics trafficking and lawless violence should rest on the
shoulders and burden the children of this one nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that increased American aid to
counter-narcotics operations in Colombia, if successful, was likely
to ``cause the problem to spill over the borders'' into neighboring
countries like Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. But he also
said the United States was willing to provide ``a substantial
amount of money to help other countries deal with those problems at
the border when they start,'' an offer that has received no reply.
</P>
<P>
   Looming over the meeting here was concern at what Venezuela's
president, Hugo Chavez, described as the threat of ``the
Vietnamization of the entire Amazon region'' as a result of
increased American support for Colombia. From the moment he arrived
here, Pastrana sought both to refute such notions and to enlist his
colleagues in a broader, regional counter-narcotics campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no cause for fear, because after all we are fighting
a common enemy,'' he told reporters Friday morning after a meeting
with Chavez. ``Drug trafficking is an enemy of Brazil, of Colombia,
of Peru, of the United States, and so we have to work hand in
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's assurances, however, have been greeted with
skepticism, if not by his fellow regional leaders, then certainly
by the news media and by public opinion across the continent.
Friday afternoon, Colombia's foreign minister, Guillermo Fernandez
de Soto, finally vented his government's frustration in remarks to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unjust and counterintuitive that Colombia's efforts to
strengthen itself to fight the threat it faces are the subject of
complaints when no one criticizes the arms buildup of the
insurgents,'' he said, referring to the two main left-wing
guerrilla groups. ``We want cooperation, not unfair criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez, a former Venezuelan army colonel who has often
expressed sympathy for the guerrillas, made it clear, in terms that
several other governments echoed privately, that enhanced regional
cooperation was going to have to come with important
qualifications. ``We support Plan Colombia so long as it does not
generate combat activities that could complicate our situation,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other public comments, Chavez also floated the idea of
organizing what he described as a South American version of the
NATO military alliance.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview in mid-August, Brazil's foreign minister,
Luiz Felipe Lampreia, in effect quashed the idea, which would be
stillborn without Brazil's backing and participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't exactly had that thought or even discussed it
within Mercosur,'' Lampreia said, referring to the decade-old trade
bloc that Brazil helped to found. ``Mercosur is a group whose
purpose is clearly established, and it does not aspire to be a
military bloc or alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit meeting here was a Brazilian initiative drawn up this
year and initially intended to focus on issues of economics, trade
and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States' recent decision to provide $1.3 billion
in emergency aid to Pastrana, combined with Clinton's visit to
Cartagena, Colombia, on Wednesday, forced an unexpected reordering
of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the South American presidents agreed to begin
negotiations aimed at fusing the continent's two main trading
groups. The Mercosur group is led by Brazil and includes Argentina,
Paraguay and Uruguay, while the Andean Community is made up of
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   The objective established here is to create a single free trade
group, ideally by the beginning of 2002. That achieved, South
America would be able to present a common front in negotiations
with the North American Free Trade Agreement group, whose members
are the United States, Mexico and Canada, over a hemispheric trade
accord the United States wants in place by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``United South America will defend its common interests with
greater strength,'' Brazil's president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
said in a speech opening the conference on Thursday. A hemispheric
free trade agreement, he said, only ``will be justified to the
extent it serves as an instrument to overcome socioeconomic
inequalities in the Americas,'' and leads to ``the effective
dismantling of trade barriers by the richer partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on behalf of the smaller, weaker Andean bloc, Chavez
indicated that speaking with a unified voice had become an urgent
matter of historical necessity. ``If we don't integrate, we will be
erased from the map,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents also approved a so-called democracy clause that
would expel from their ranks any government that takes power
through a coup or other nondemocratic means. The measure is aimed
mainly at Ecuador and Paraguay, where there were threats of that
sort earlier this year, but it was signed by all 12 presidents,
including Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru, who recently won a third
term in an election that international observers described as
fraudulent.

found that tires on 1991 Chevrolet Blazer sport utility vehicles
and on some Nissan and Ford pickup trucks were even more prone to
failure than the tires already recalled on several Ford models,
mainly the Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle. The National

its recall, but that the tire maker had refused on Thursday to do
so. Firestone officials had no immediate comment. By Keith

   ILL-RICHES-SCHEME (Mattoon, Ill.) _ Money has never put in much
of an appearance in Mattoon. Folks eat in places like Gill's diner,
circa 1940, where the all-you-can-eat walleye special goes for
$4.99. They work at factories like the Lender's Bagel plant,
sponsor of the annual Bagelfest, the town's biggest event. So more
than a few eyebrows began arching when a handful of people in this
small central Illinois town suddenly seemed to be sitting pretty. A
former police officer built a house with a six-car garage. A
retired electrician started offering people interest-free loans to
build nice houses and start new businesses: the sparkly new
Bluebird Diner, Our Own Original Bakery, Jimmy-John's Sandwich
Shop. This week, federal law enforcement officials gave foundation
to years of Mattoon gossip. They charged 11 Mattoon residents and 8
other people in a bogus financial investment scheme that,
authorities say, hoodwinked more than 10,000 people around the
world out of more than $12.5 million. By Pam Belluck.

 &HT;    Author Tim McLaurin faced with cancer, he finds love, healing
and new story
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Sept. 3.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim McLaurin is used to facing death. Long before he became a
critically acclaimed writer, the Fayetteville, N.C., native
regularly handled rattlesnakes, copperheads and cobras in his
traveling reptile exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   He has survived several poisonous bites as well as an agonizing
struggle with multiple myeloma, a bone marrow cancer. And so, when
McLaurin, 46, was diagnosed with cancer of the esophagus a few
months ago, he was well prepared to die.
</P>
<P>
   He had lived a full life, he told himself. An ex-Marine who had
kicked a debilitating drinking habit after 20 years, he had been
married and divorced twice, had two teenage children, and had
worked as a Peace Corps volunteer in Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wondered if ... it was time for me to die ... to chronicle
that in writing, straightforward and honestly,'' he says, ``and I
was willing to do that.'' Besides, he had undergone a painful bone
marrow transplant years before, and he didn't want to go through
that kind of treatment again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want to deal with the hassle of being sick,'' he
says. ``I didn't want to deal with being poked and prodded and that
loss of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he met a woman who not only changed his life, but helped
save it as well.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Quaine arrived one day in mid-February and offered the
touch of her healing hands. A friend of a friend, Quaine had a
Ph.D. in business, but she also was trained as a healer in Reiki, a
technique developed by a Buddhist monk in Japan in the late 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   McLaurin says the first time she placed her hands on his chest,
he thought she was using a heating pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every day for three weeks she returned and placed her
hands upon me, wafted fragrant smoke upon my body, lit candles and
rang bells,'' he wrote in a newspaper story. ``She told me that
sometimes when I talked to her, leaves and feathers fell in a
shower from above my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Her love and trust made him rethink his reluctance to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started thinking, maybe your story isn't to end right here,
to tell people how to die. Maybe you've got other stories to
tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Declared free of the cancer, McLaurin describes his ordeal and
his relationship with Quaine in a 15-page epilogue for ``The River
Less Run,'' a chronicle of his life from June 1998 to June 1999,
that will be published in September by North Carolina-based Down
Home Press.
</P>
<P>
   McLaurin thought it was the last book he would ever write.
</P>
<P>
   ``The River Less Run'' focuses on a cross-country trip McLaurin
took with his mother, children and other relatives in a Winnebago.
He had already written the memoir when cancer struck and Quaine
entered the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Neither McLaurin nor Quaine credits her alone with saving his
life. She says he was cured ``by some of the best Western medicine
and some of the deepest love.''
</P>
<P>
   The story has an even happier ending. McLaurin and Quaine plan
to be married Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 11th is the day we met,'' McLaurin says, ``and we're
getting married on the 11th day of the 11th month. She's an
incredible blend between the real world and the spiritual world.''
</P>
<P>
   What impressed him most, McLaurin says, is that Quaine had never
read any of his books when she met him, yet she seemed to
understand him immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I run into a lot of women who think they know me through my
books, and they don't. She knows me as a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   An honest, fearless writer
</P>
<P>
   None of his friends would have bet that McLaurin would graduate
from high school, let alone become a writer. He grew up poor in
North Carolina, shooting squirrels and birds for dinner, a way of
life chronicled in 1991's ``Keeper of the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way he wrote well-received novels such as ``The Acorn
Plan,'' ``Woodrow's Trumpet'' and ``Cured by Fire.'' His work
reflects his hardscrabble childhood and the influence of writers
such as Harry Crews and Jim Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, Tim is a throwback,'' says North Carolina novelist
Lee Smith, who has offered her Hillsborough, N.C., home as the site
of the Nov. 11 wedding. ``He is a writer who is truly tied to the
land in a way most of us have not been for at least a generation.
He carries around a little bag of dirt from the farm where he grew
up. He's lived very deeply on a very elemental, almost mythic
level, in a way few people do. That's evident in his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an absolutely honest and fearless kind of writer,'' Smith
adds. ``He uses his writing as a way to confront his anger and his
fears.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaurin's editor, Jerry Bledsoe, puts him in the same category
as Crews and Larry Brown _ ``rough South'' writers who come from
poor white backgrounds. ``They are the ones who have been chosen by
whatever forces there are to make sure their own people's stories
are told. Otherwise, no one would be telling these stories.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaurin wants to memorialize his survival by having a phoenix
tattooed on his chest, where doctors operated. The bird will join
tattoos of family names, flowers and animals that adorn his right
arm and the snakes and birds on his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   And he plans to keep painting his toenails. The first time, a
young visitor painted his two big toenails a metallic blue, a color
favored by halter-topped teens. Since then, he and Quaine have
repainted them a couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of like it,'' McLaurin says. ``Some people might look
at it and think it's weird, but I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing as therapy
</P>
<P>
   Even as a child, McLaurin was willing to be the odd man, to
question what he was told. He was taught that snakes were to be
feared and killed. But when he chopped up a harmless rat snake, he
felt guilty enough to read about snakes, learning that most of what
he had been taught was a myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snakes,'' he says, ``represent a way of overcoming ignorance
and fear. And overcoming ignorance in small steps is a way to fix a
lot of what's wrong with the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he finds comfort in the world he and Quaine have made
in Hillsborough with McLaurin's bulldog, Roy Lee; red-tail boa,
bull and Gaboon viper snakes; and an African spur-footed tortoise
named George.
</P>
<P>
   He smokes two cigars a day _ 45-cent Phillies Blunts that he
prefers to Cuban cigars. ``I don't see that big a difference,'' he
says. ``Maybe I cropped so much tobacco growing up that I'm immune
to the finer qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   What he doesn't do anymore is drink. He went on one last epic
drunk in November 1998 that landed him in the hospital. He says it
was deliberate _ one last blow-out so he could walk away from the
bottle once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used that part of my life up until it was dust in my palm
and I could blow it away and it was gone,'' McLaurin says.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't wish his two decades of hangovers on his children, or
his illnesses or his mistakes. But in a sense, he hopes they live
their lives as he has, with a sense of adventure, a courage to look
death in the eye without flinching and to walk away with the will
to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they want to travel and seek and explore _ I hope they
make it to the moon,'' he says. ``I always thought that during my
lifetime, I'd make it to the moon, that by the age of 46, there
were Pan-Am excursions to the moon. But we stopped going to the
moon.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaurin, meanwhile, is hitting the road to promote his memoir.
He'll be in Atlanta this month for the Southeast Booksellers
Association's trade show, and after that he's going back to work on
a novel and another memoir about working in tobacco fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always used writing as a form of therapy,'' he says. ``I
wrote `Keeper of the Moon' when I was going through treatment for
myeloma. Through my words I'm able to leave the hospital bed and
the shell of my own body and go into a place in the past or the
future that's disease-free and peaceful.''

 &HT;    MEXICAN GENERALS ARRESTED ON SUSPECTED DRUG TIES
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In another scandal to hit Mexico's military, two
Army generals _ one active, one retired _ have been taken into
military custody on suspicions they colluded with the notorious
Juarez-based drug-smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Humberto Quiroz Hermosillo and Gen. Mario Arturo Acosta
Chaparro were arrested Thursday in response to a two-year ongoing
investigation, the military announced Thursday night. Some human
rights activists have accused both generals before of participating
in the violent squelching of leftist rebels in Mexico's Guerrero
state and elsewhere in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very lamentable, difficult situation. But we will
see it through to its final consequences,'' Military Attorney
General Rafael de la Concha was quoted saying in Reforma newspaper
when he announced the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The detentions are reminiscent of the embarrassing arrest in
1997 of Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo _ President Ernesto Zedillo's
anti-drug czar _ who is now serving a 71-year prison sentence for
protecting the Juarez cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Because of police corruption, President Zedillo elevated the
duties of the Mexican military in the interdiction of narcotics and
investigations into smugglers. In spite of scandal, the Mexican
military has improved its ability to intercept shipments of cocaine
from South America and eradicate fields of poppies used to make
heroin, according to Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the U.S. Director of
National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   But many Mexican political figures believe the military's
integrity has been compromised by its anti-drug work and exposed it
to corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican president-elect Vicente Fox has suggested he will review
the role of the military and may curtail its involvement in the war
on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The military provided few details about the careers of the two
generals under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Humberto Toledo, a commentator on national security, said
Acosta is a one-star general who directs an Army section that
oversees fitness of troops. Quiroz directed military transport
until 1998 and was the head of social welfare for the Army until he
retired in June, Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the military said the generals had been
implicated in trafficking by protected witnesses interviewed by
civilian Justice Department officials in 1998. The generals were
arrested in the wake of additional testimony from a witness under
protection in the United States as well as others in Mexico, the
statement said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There she was, Amanda Peet, but in the crowd on
Tuesday night at the premiere of her new movie, ``Whipped,'' there
was some confusion about which one she was. A stunning woman in a
tight black, backless dress posed for the cameras. ``Is that her?''
one photographer asked.
</P>
<P>
   No. That was Lauren Holly.
</P>
<P>
   Peet swept into the Chelsea West Cinema wearing a skimpy,
blinding blue dress with teeny little straps. ``I get all my
fashion advice from her,'' she confided later in the lobby, while
the movie was being shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her'' was a friend from her days as a history major at
Columbia (and yes, Peet graduated, too): Tina Chai, another history
major, who had found her destiny first at Vogue and now as a
fashion editor at Us magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Chai was there to support Peet, who seemed to need a lot of
support. She was being attended to by her manager, Eric Kranzler,
from California, who was so completely involved with his client
that his lips moved along with hers as she answered hard-hitting
questions from E! Entertainment about what it feels like to kiss
three men in one movie. Photographers jostled and the crowd looked
stumped, for the most part, by the no-name stars of the movie, who
gathered with Peet for a group photo.
</P>
<P>
   All breezed into the theater for a few words from the
director-writer-producer, Peter Cohen, who wore the obligatory
baseball cap. And then the movie commenced, 88 minutes about four
men sitting around talking about scoring with women, and the woman
( Peet) who brings them to their knees.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 minutes into the movie, Peet sneaked out with Stephen
Hirsh, her agent, to grab a Cosmopolitan from the vodka bar set up
in the lobby. New York was Peet's hometown. She grew up in
Manhattan and attended Friends Seminary; later she worked at City
Crab on Park Avenue South.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days when she was struggling, and only Hirsh
would take her on as a client.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been rejected by four agencies,'' she recalled.
``William Morris said, `You're not ready. You have no confidence.'`
So I practiced having confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peet has every right to be confident now, even though her
manager and agent anxiously followed her through the night like
pilot fish. She is taping her second season of ``Jack and Jill,'' a
series on the WB Television Network. (Believe it or not, she plays
``Jack.'') And ``Whipped'' is a breakout movie for her, a real
starring role. It's her third film to be released this year,
following a flurry of blink-and-you-missed-it movies: ``Isn't She
Great,'' starring Bette Midler as Jacqueline Susann, and ``The
Whole Nine Yards,'' a forgettable movie starring Bruce Willis as a
hit man and Matthew Perry as a dentist. Peet, however, got raves
for playing the dentist's receptionist. ``She's like grapefruit
sorbet: she cleanses the palate,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   All that only eight years after she started out with Hirsh,
rushing to her first audition and ripping her dress ``all the way
up my butt,'' she said, miming how she walked into the casting
office holding her skirt together behind her. ``I asked the
receptionist for a safety pin,'' she recalled, before doing her
monologue from Woody Allen's ``Interiors.''
</P>
<P>
   Peet didn't get the part, and complained bitterly to her agent.
``I have a potty mouth when I'm disappointed,'' she confided.
Surely she didn't learn that at Friends Seminary, a private Quaker
high school in Manhattan. ``No,'' she said. ``But you've got to do
something since you can't hit people.''
</P>
<P>
   She and Hirsh went back to watching the movie through the doors
at the Chelsea West Cinema. Then he whisked her into a car for the
10-block ride to the Lotus lounge on West 14th Street, where people
like Holly, Stephen Dorff and Linda Evangelista gathered to
celebrate one critic's grapefruit sorbet, Hollywood's latest
flavor.

PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS DISCUSS COMMON PROBLEMS AT `SUMMIT' MEETING

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With many new democracies and some old ones
under strain because of economic setbacks, rebellions and
unsatisfactory political leadership, lawmakers from around the
world have spent the last three days urging one another to make
legislative bodies at every level of government stronger
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers were part of the first ``summit'' meeting of more
than 150 presiding officers of the world's legislatures, an event
that leaders of the U.S. Congress chose not to attend. Throughout
the conference, the speakers, who for the most part were elected by
grass-roots constituencies, repeatedly addressed the question of
how to give their voters a more direct sense of involvement in
national policymaking.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers of both lower and upper houses of parliament at the
conference organized by the Geneva-based Inter-Parliamentary Union,
said that in an era of globalization ordinary people often seemed
to feel that political and economic power was moving farther away
from them, even in established democracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one broad, general trend discernible at this
critical juncture of world history,'' said Bichai Rattakul, speaker
of the Thailand House of Representatives, ``it must surely be the
awakening of the people, the common man, from rich and poor nations
alike, who are now clamoring and positioning themselves to have
more say in the determination of their livelihoods and well being,
and demanding more transparency in the execution of the affairs of
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramesh Jeewoolall, speaker of the National Assembly of
Mauritius, took the argument a step further. ``Let us remind
ourselves,'' he told his fellow legislative leaders, ``democracy
carries with it the idea of free debate of issues, as well as free
choice of a legislative body, which has the sole power to legislate
on behalf of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also cautioned against allowing legislatures to become
too parochial.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, democratically elected legislatures share some
growing problems, some speakers said. G.M.C. Balayogi, speaker of
the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian parliament, cataloged
the concerns as ``the growth of the executive, disproportionate to
the oversight functions of parliaments; the growing influence of
power-brokering groups and lobbies; the nexus in some societies
between politics, bureaucracy, business and crimes; and the
declining probity and standards in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   The point was brought home by Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
president of the Cambodian National Assembly, who clings to his
political space through his legislative title against a strong
central government that has tried to crush most political
opponents. In his speech, Ranariddh pleaded for stronger support
from a range of civic organizations and the media.
</P>
<P>
   Working together, parliaments could play a larger part in
correcting political abuses, said Luciano Violante, president of
the Chamber of Deputies in Italy. ``Parliaments should champion
respect for and implementation of the U.N. conventions on
international humanitarian law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the time is right,'' Violante said, ``for a concise
charter of the duties of states, which could initially represent a
purely moral restraint against inhumane treatment and for the
protection of all minorities, against corruption and for assigning
a reasonable share of public resources to the eradication of
poverty, and for education and health care.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age of special interests, said Raymond Forni, speaker of
the National Assembly of France, the role of promoting citizens'
causes should not be left to nongovernmental organizations, however
welcome a phenomenon they are in most places.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bring together activists who are particularly aware and
energetic,'' he said. ``But membership in the NGOs rests on
personal choices. They cannot claim the same representativeness as
democratically elected parliaments, whose role is to speak on
behalf of the people as a whole on all subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Forni's counterpart in the French Senate, Christian Poncelet,
told legislative leaders not to be content with one elected house.
In the last three decades, Poncelet said, more countries have
established second houses of parliament, which can add balance and
make government less susceptible to partisan pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States is a founding member of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union, it has not paid its dues since 1996. The
United States was criticized not only for its absence, but also
because Washington had denied visas to two national speakers, from
Cuba and Yugoslavia. This decision, a statement from the union
president, Najma Heptulla of India's upper house, said, ``is all
the more regrettable in that it has occurred on the occasion of
this historic parliamentary summit.''

 &HT;    `Highlander' franchise can't be killed by normal means
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ At one point the young immortal looks up at his
older immortal mentor and asks, ``Connor, what the hell is going
on?''
</P>
<P>
   People who pay to see ``Highlander: Endgame'' probably will be
asking one another the same question. The fourth movie in the
series that began with ``Highlander'' in 1986 ends essentially the
same way as the first three movies.
</P>
<P>
   But there are so many confusing turns, plot deadends, red
herrings, interminable flashbacks and special-effects-muddled fight
scenes along the way that you'll need a color-coded flow chart to
follow the story to its familiar climax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Highlander: Endgame'' is not a continuation of a story line
begun with ``Highlander'' and advanced in its two movie sequels. In
fact, the sequels _ the atrocious ``Highlander II: The Quickening
`` from 1991 and the boring ``Highlander: The Final Dimension''
from 1994 _ are completely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Endgame'' instead melds the story line from the original movie
with the plots from the ``Highlander'' television series that ran
from 1993 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Highlander mythology involves a group of immortal beings who
have been living among humans for thousands of years. They can't be
killed by normal means, but they duel with one another with swords
and if one immortal cuts off the head of the other, the winner
gains the strength and knowledge of the loser.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, according to the Highlander legend, ``There can be
only one,'' and the last immortal standing wins the Prize, which is
never explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Endgame'' begins with the immortal hero of the first movie,
Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert), dropping out of sight after a
woman he loves is killed in an explosion. Constantly outliving his
loved ones has finally broken Connor's will, and he retires to the
Sanctuary where worn-out immortals are held in drug-induced
suspended animation.
</P>
<P>
   A group of renegade immortals led by arch-villain Jacob Kell
(Bruce Payne) invades the Sanctuary and kills the dormant
immortals.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul), the hero of the ``Highlander''
television series, refuses to believe his old friend Connor was
killed in the attack. But when Duncan starts investigating Connor's
whereabouts, he's attacked by Kell and his henchmen.
</P>
<P>
   There are subplots about a woman Duncan once loved who now hates
him, an honorable Asian warrior now enslaved to Kell, a group of
mortal ``Watchers'' who keep tabs on the endless immortal duels, a
priest who tries to burn Connor's mother at the stake and lots of
other reasons why everybody wants to cut everybody else's head off.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, it all comes down to the bravest, most
resourceful good guy facing off against the strongest, most
depraved bad guy in a fight to the death.
</P>
<P>
   The first ``Highlander'' was not a particularly good movie, but
it had style and was based on an interesting idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Highlander: Endgame'' starts promisingly with magnificent
footage, shot in Romania, of Connor MacLeod riding through hills
representing Scotland, where he lived his first lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   But it quickly goes astray with fight scenes laden with too many
bullets, too many explosions, too many sparks, lightning bolts and
weird lights _ and too many impalings. The martial-arts
choreography is rendered unimpressive by the fact camera tricks
were obviously used to speed up the action.
</P>
<P>
   The middle of the movie drags along with the characters stopping
every five minutes to explain the rules of the immortal game and
why some characters follow the rules while others don't.
</P>
<P>
   And then it ends, as ``Highlander'' stories generally do, with a
beheading.
</P>
<P>
   The third ``Highlander'' movie was subtitled ``Final
Dimension,'' and this one is subtitled ``Endgame,'' but don't
expect it to be over.
</P>
<P>
   There can be only one immortal, and apparently a few are still
kicking.

<P>
   For years, investors have won big by following the crowd. Piling
into index funds, a handful of big-company technology shares or any
stock that happened to be moving up was the name of the game.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, however, many of the hottest shares have been
of some companies found off the beaten track. Shares of midcap
companies and utilities, for instance, have been the market's
unlikely stars.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this is becoming a stock picker's market, one where
individual stocks can outshine the indexes. Getting into stocks
ahead of the herd is now the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   But identifying which stocks have the most promise has never
been more difficult for investors. In-depth analysis has virtually
disappeared from Wall Street; most equity analysts are so busy
bucking for investment banking business from companies that their
stock picks can be highly suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Better to poll investment professionals famous for their
skepticism, people who know how to take a sharp pencil to corporate
financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the few in that group are Bob Olstein, manager of the
Olstein Financial Alert fund, and Ravi Suria, the Lehman Brothers
convertible-bond analyst who shot to fame last June with his
devastating report on Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Olstein's fund has risen 25 percent a year, on
average; it is up 15.5 percent this year. He says that he tries to
avoid investment mistakes by tearing apart company figures. ``We
don't talk to management and we do not listen to Wall Street
research,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He points to four stocks that he thinks will rise 50 percent in
the next two years:
</P>
<P>
   _Emerson Electric, which makes electronics and instrumentation
for industrial automation, is an old-economy'' company heading into
a rapid-growth phase, he said. The company is generating $1.4
billion in excess cash flow and should earn $3.30 a share this
year.
</P>
<P>
   _National Semiconductor has $800 million in cash and no debt on
its balance sheet, and its shares have lost almost half their value
since March. Olstein expects the company to earn $2.95 a share next
year, giving the stock a price-to-earnings ratio of 15.
</P>
<P>
   _Furniture Brands has new management that will bring earnings
growth back to the company, Olstein said. At $16, the stock has a
P/E ratio of 7, yet he thinks the company will soon generate $100
million in excess cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   _Winnebago Industries is an even cheaper stock, trading at less
than 6 times earnings. ``The company has $50 million in cash, no
debt and $20 million in excess cash flow,'' Olstein said.
Recreational vehicles are a good way for investors to profit from
the aging baby boom population.
</P>
<P>
   Suria, who remains negative on Amazon.com, is decidedly upbeat
on At Home, an Internet service provider offering Web-based content
through the Excite network. The company's stock has tumbled from a
high of $59.75 last year to $14.50; its two convertible-bond issues
yield around 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors view At Home through the wrong lens, Suria said.
Rather than weigh its prospects as an Internet portal, he said, At
Home should be considered a subscription-based services company
whose customers are growing in number _ from 1.8 million
subscribers now to 3 million by year-end. ``As long as the
subscriber base is increasing, cash flow will increase,'' he said.
``When free cash flow starts opening up, it pushes enterprise
valuations. That's what made a lot of people a lot of money in
cable companies in the 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Also compelling is the fact that AT&AMP;T, which owns 24 percent of
the company, has offered to pay $48 a share to buy up to $3 billion
of At Home stock owned by Cox Communications and Comcast beginning
next January and extending until June 2002. ``To me there is no
better indicator of actual value in the company,'' Suria said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Researchers for the first time have used
drugs to increase the life span of an animal, a scientific
breakthrough that could lead to a potion that helps humans live
longer, healthier lives.
</P>
<P>
   The encouraging results are from a major study, reported in
Friday's issue of Science magazine, that found synthetic drugs
extended the life of laboratory worms by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The research, the product of work at the Buck Institute on
Research and Aging, in Novato, Calif., offers the promise that
drugs could one day boost human life expectancy to 120 years and
eliminate many of the illnesses associated with old age.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first robust demonstration that drugs can extend
life span,'' said Simon Melov, a founding faculty member at the
Buck Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The Buck Institute, the only center of its kind in the United
States dedicated to biomedical research on aging and age-associated
diseases, is working in collaboration with Eukarion Inc., a
privately held biopharmaceutical company in Bedford, Mass. Eukarion
developed the synthetic, anti-aging drugs under study.
</P>
<P>
   Melov said continuing studies by the institute and Eukarion
could have far-reaching implications on human health and longevity.
</P>
<P>
   But don't rush to the drugstore just yet. It may be at least
four years before these new drugs are on the market, and then they
would be used for the treatment of such age-related illnesses as
Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, drugs may be developed that prevent the onset of
old-age diseases that so often destroy the quality of life during
an elderly person's last years.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could imagine that by staving off the aging process it
could delay or prevent the diseases that come because of advanced
age,'' Melov said.
</P>
<P>
   Melov's research on the anti-aging drug therapy is continuing
with mice, with preliminary results showing that the drugs appear
to help mice live longer.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, scientists in Massachusetts will test the drug in
clinical studies of older people who have suffered a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Melov, who initiated the pilot studies, worked in collaboration
with scientists in England, Atlanta and Massachusetts on the drug
therapy research reported today in Science.
</P>
<P>
   Melov said the findings, which studied microscopic worms or
nematodes, is relevant because nematodes, though primitive life
forms, share many of the fundamental biological processes of higher
species, like humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worm is great in establishing a concept. That information
is then used in further studies of more complicated life systems,
like mice,'' Melov said. He said once the research with mice is
completed there will be definite information on the drug's efficacy
in extending the life span of mammals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further studies on higher organisms in the near future will
allow us to answer whether or not we have to reconsider aging as an
inevitability,'' Melov said. He would not speculate when the
research project using mice would be completed.
</P>
<P>
   The theory of Melov's scientific research is that synthetic
enzymes produced in the laboratory can mimic the anti-aging action
of naturally occurring antioxidants in living organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Melov and other scientists said it appears oxidative stress is a
major factor in determining the rate of aging. But his research
shows oxidative stress and its impact on life span _ at least in
nematodes _ can be counteracted by drug intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Melov's experiments involved groups of adult nematodes that were
either treated or untreated with synthetic catalytic scavengers, or
SCS's, as scientists call them.
</P>
<P>
   Melov said he and other researchers found that nematodes treated
with SCS's had life spans that were 50 percent longer than the
untreated nematodes.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, researchers discovered that a strain of mutant
nematode, identified as having a shortened life span because of
oxidative stress, lived a more normal life span after being treated
with the SCS's.
</P>
<P>
   These SCS's are synthetic versions of superoxide dismutase and
catalase, which are naturally occurring enzymes involved in the
control of oxidative stress. When people get older their bodies
produce less of the natural enzymes, which causes tissue stress and
the release of toxic chemical by-products.
</P>
<P>
   These toxic chemical by-products have been found to cause the
irreversible cellular damage that occurs in patients suffering from
Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, as well as stroke
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Malfroy, Eukarion's chief executive officer and
co-founder of the company, has spent nine years studying SCS's for
the treatment of degenerative and age-related health disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This work on nematode life span further strengthens our belief
that SCS's have tremendous potential as therapeutics,'' Malfroy
said. ``Our priority now is to move these compounds toward clinical
trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Malfroy said clinical trials will start in 2001, using SCS's to
treat stroke victims. In 2002, clinical trials will study the use
of the drug on older people with Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   He said the clinical trials are aimed at studying the
therapeutic value of the drugs but researchers will glean valuable
information about the drug's impact on aging as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aging, to a large part, is the diseases one gets when they get
older,'' Malfroy said.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned that the development of new drugs is slow and the
research meticulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask when they can go to the supermarket and buy the
drug,'' he said. ``That we cannot know.''
</P>
<P>
   But he speculated that in four or five years there could be a
drug available to treat age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Malfroy said bringing a drug to the market involves a rigorous
testing process and then evaluation by the federal Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Eukarion holds five U.S. patents for its SCS technology and has
been awarded more than $2 million in grants from the National
Institutes of Health to further its research.

SMITH HOPES SAVVY WILL RUB OFF ON YOUNGER PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ He will be one of the calming voices Sunday,
the perspective younger players may need, the inspiration that
Pepper Johnson once was to him.
</P>
<P>
   Otis Smith was plucked off the waiver wire by Bill Belichick for
a purpose, that being Smith knows his defensive system. But he also
understands that what he adds in leadership might be his greatest
attribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill has never asked me to take a player aside and talk to
him, but he expects his leaders to lead,'' said Smith. ``I know
that if I have something to say, they will listen. I haven't played
in the league for 11 years not to be a guy players on the team will
listen to. I have a lot of experience to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith is not a player who will need a big break-in period. Last
Thursday against Carolina he intercepted a pass and recorded a sack
on a blitz. It's instinctive that Smith knows what Belichick is
trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   He looks around the secondary and he knows Ty Law. He knows
Lawyer Milloy and Larry Whigham. He's not going to tell them
anything they don't already know, but he can help Kato Serwanga,
Antwan Harris, Tebucky Jones, and Tony George. And he already has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ty and Lawyer were great players when they were young,'' said
Smith. ``They're that much better now. I have been able to pass
some things on to the younger DBs and hopefully that's helped. This
is what you do when you get to be 34, 35 years old. You begin to
share the wisdom you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom is one thing, but being able to play the game well is
another. He will turn 35 in another month, but Smith said, ``I feel
like I did when I was 26. I keep myself in the best shape all year
round. I never get out of shape. As you get older you have to
approach it that way. You have to be in great condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, his life has been a steady traverse up and down
Interstate 95. He was with the Eagles from 1991-94 and a member of
the Jets in 1995. He was cut during the '96 season and hooked on
with the Patriots. He helped the Patriots advance to the Super
Bowl, intercepting a Mark Brunell pass in the AFC Championship Game
and returning it 47 yards for a touchdown for the final points in
their 20-6 win over Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   The next season, he returned to the Jets, playing for Belichick
and Bill Parcells. He stayed there until the Jets cut him last
week. Smith's cap number, more than $1 million, was too high for a
player who wasn't going to be the starting corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was either you start or you're gone,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was out of work for about 24 hours when Belichick and
Scott Pioli were on the horn, telling him to make the drive up 95
once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny how it's turned out,'' said Smith. ``I'm grafetul
I've been able to play on the East Coast because I'm an East Coast
guy and I haven't had to uproot my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Or learn new names. He used to cover Terry Glenn and Troy Brown
in practice, then in real games for the other side, and now he's
back covering them in practice. When he faces the Jets Sept. 11, he
will oppose former Jets teammates Wayne Chrebet and Dedric Ward, as
well as former Patriots mate Vincent Brisby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess everybody is familiar with everybody else,'' said
Smith. ``I think that's what makes these games so fun is that
there's history between all of us. Even the other guys in the
division are guys I've been playing against for a long time now.''
</P>
<P>
   When he looks around his new/old surroundings, he has flashbacks
of his first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the same number (45) and I'm sitting in the same locker
I used to have,'' said Smith. ``I still see some of the same faces,
but there are a lot of new ones I have to get to know. Both this
team and the Jets are pretty talented. There's good talent level on
both teams, so it'll come down to who gets the breaks, who has the
better coaching, and how well the players execute. It always comes
down to those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Time has changed some things. He used to have Sam Gash, Keith
Byars, Corwin Brown, and Jerome Henderson around him when he sat at
his locker back in '96. Now he has Tony George, Chris Floyd, Harold
Shaw, and Rob Holmberg in his general vicinity. The '96 team was
deep, with veterans making up the last spots on the roster; now
they are filled by rookies. The business of the game has changed a
lot since he was here last, but his goal has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to take care of my responsibilities on the field,''
said Smith. ``I'm here to help Bill (Belichick) win.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For George W. Bush _ whose chances of becoming
president vacillate between inevitable and inconceivable _ it's
campaign-trail deja vu, a political summer re-run.
</P>
<P>
   You may have caught this story line during it's earlier run
after surprising losses in the primaries: Bush is a malaprop-prone
guy who hasn't offered enough specifics, ducks debates and perhaps
should jettison the political team that took him this far.
</P>
<P>
   As in the primary season, months of front-running are being
interrupted by weeks of doubt. As Labor Day approaches, the
double-digit leads of polls from primary season until the
Democratic National Convention have evaporated into a statistical
dead heat with Democratic nominee Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Going into tomorrow's traditional _ and artificial _ start of
the fall campaign, the Bush campaign looks something like it did
after Arizona Sen. John McCain stomped him in New Hampshire and
beat him in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new reality is that Bush is on the defensive and Gore has
put him there,'' said University of Texas government professor
Bruce Buchanan, a presidential scholar and longtime Bush observer.
``I didn't think Gore could do it, but somehow he managed to stop
shooting himself in the foot and shake Bush up for the first time
since McCain did it in the New Hampshire and Michigan primaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The shake-up, which started at the Democratic National
Convention and continued last week, has completely re-jiggered the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aura of inevitability is gone,'' Buchanan said of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Not if the Bush team can help it. Doubt may reign among
academia, the Sunday morning talkers and conventional wisdom, but
it has no place in the public pronouncements of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During a Friday campaign swing, Bush pronounced his campaign in
``excellent shape'' as it enters its most crucial phase. Top
strategist Karl Rove believes the campaign is ``slightly better off
than we thought we'd be on Labor Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a close election. We've said that all
along, `` said Rove. ``The neat thing is we are fighting on
(Gore's) territory rather than him fighting on ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the confidence _ real or otherwise _ is the prospect of
victory in states that have not gone Republican in a presidential
election in a long time. For example, Herbert Hoover, in 1928, was
the last Republican to carry West Virginia. Polls indicate Bush has
a shot. Ditto for states like Missouri, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa
and others that haven't gone GOP in awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Rove does the math and has the answer: Bush needs to find about
44 more electoral votes to get over the 270 needed to get the White
House keys. There are lots of places to get those votes, Rove
believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be more than 270, close to 300,'' said Rove.
</P>
<P>
   When they gather to strategize on the second floor in the
downtown office building that houses the headquarters, Bush
advisers work toward reaching out to the two groups of undecided
voters they see making the difference on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   In house, the first group is called ``radical centrists'' or
``radical moderates.'' They are issue-driven, but the issues are
all over the board, some fiscal, some social, some international.
They are weakly aligned with parties.
</P>
<P>
   The other group of undecideds is less issue-driven, more
interested in the nature of the candidate. They want leadership,
credibility and trust.
</P>
<P>
   As issues are fleshed out, the first group of undecideds
diminishes and the second group becomes more important, according
to the Bush campaign theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Gore has a fundamental credibility problem with these
people,'' said Rove, reflecting an attitude highlighted in a
Republican National Committee ad airing in key states.
</P>
<P>
   The ad shows footage of Gore at the now-famous 1996 Buddhist
temple fund-raising event. A woman's voice, complaining about Gore
``reinventing himself'' says ``Who's he going to be today? The Al
Gore who raises campaign money at a Buddhist temple or the one who
now promises campaign finance reform?''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, who has promised an optimistic, uplifting campaign,
going after Gore is a necessary part of the equation. Asked last
week if he could win without negative ads, he said, ``It all
depends on the definition of negative ads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the American people judge whether or not they think it's
accurate,'' Bush said of the RNC ad that he approved. ``I think it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Fabiani, a Gore-Lieberman spokesman, scoffed at Bush's
assessment of the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's downward-spiraling poll numbers have
apparently made him so dizzy that he can no longer distinguish
negative from positive,'' said Fabiani.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan believes the Bush campaign's best, perhaps only, hope
is something approaching a personality contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Bush can win a policy argument. He can't
outpromise Gore on anything but tax cuts. His competitive
advantages are bipartisan leadership, likability and the prospect
of change,'' the professor said. ``The goal is to get public
attention focused on these things again, with policy more in the
background.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Bush adviser Tom Rath believes that's where
Bush wants the campaign to wind up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they come out of the debates it's going to turn from an
issue-driven race to a character race, an ability-to-lead kind of
race. And that's the race they feel the most comfortable about,''
said Rath. ``They eventually believe this will turn into a national
job interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the campaign is headed, Bush aides want everyone to
believe it is on a course charted long ago and resistant to wild
swings in poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we have a plan,'' said Rove. ``We are executing the
plan. We know we've got a lot of work to do and there are going to
be ups and downs. But I have confidence in the ultimate outcome
because our base is energized. They are going to be standing in
line when the polls open and the other side seems relatively
lukewarm.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, some see Rove's confidence as poker-faced
bluster from a man holding a lesser hand after the most recent
shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Bush camp says they always expected it,'' said
Buchanan. ``But I don't think anybody expected what we see now. For
Bush, a dead heat must feel like 10 points behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign seems off balance,'' he added. ``Bush seems less
confident on the stump. The malapropism rate has gone back up. The
Gore campaign is driving the policy debate. And they're letting the
argument about debate formats seem like Bush is afraid to debate
Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   An out-of-state Bush adviser in close contact with the campaign
said he believes Rove's confidence is far more sincere than spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the one thing that disquieted them in the last week is the
slippage in Florida,'' the adviser said, referring to a recent poll
showing Gore leading there. ``They think they will get Florida, but
they will have to work harder to hold it than they thought they
would.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida, with 25 electorate votes and Jeb Bush, the candidate's
brother, as governor, is considered a key part of the Bush victory
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is does Bush have a positive and optimistic
agenda that will grab people's attention,'' said a top Bush aide.
``It's a work in progress and we are doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   That confidence is bolstered by internal polls showing that Bush
is selling well in key, swing states. In one of those states,
Bush's lead in the internal poll is in the low single digits among
registered voters. But the lead goes up to low double digits when
the poll is refined to reflect self-identified likely voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also a pattern in other states we are looking at,'' said
a Bush aide familiar with the numbers. ``We have a nice lead
developing among likely voters. Every bit of evidence is we do
better among likely voters than we do among registered voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also takes Labor Day solace in the fact that
he also does better among Electoral College voters than among
popular voters. While the national polls show a tight race
nationwide, the state-by-state polls show Bush ahead in states with
248 of the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. Gore leads in
states with 168 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Bush faithful, it adds up to make-your-reservations
kind of confidence, tempered by the fact that no deposit is
required.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that with all your hard work . . . George W. Bush will
win in November!'' Marian Miller, president of the National
Federation of Republican Women said in a missive to members last
week. ``That means this January we will witness the inauguration of
the first Republican president in eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller touted inaugural packages offered by Washington hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would be asked to reserve the room prior to the election
with the understanding that, if Governor Bush is not elected, you
can cancel your reservation with no penalty,'' Miller added.

TAIWAN PRESIDENT TAKES HARDER LINE ON UNIFICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Since he came to power in May, Taiwan's new
president, Chen Shui-bian, has labored to persuade China that he is
not a wild-eyed separatist driven by dreams of Taiwanese
independence.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen's charm offensive has come to an abrupt end. In an
interview Friday, he took a harder line toward the Chinese
government on the crucial issue of when _ and even whether _ Taiwan
and China will be unified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think unification is the only principle,'' Chen
declared. ``There could be two or three, or countless different
conclusions. We see Taiwan as a democratic country, with the people
in a position to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen said his remarks were not a shift in his position. But they
are a radical break from the guiding policy of the Nationalist
Party, which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until Chen's election.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chen's predecessor, Lee Teng-hui, antagonized China in
the last year of his term by asserting that Taiwan and China ought
to negotiate as equals, his party adhered to so-called National
Unification guidelines, which have as their ultimate goal the
unification of Taiwan and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KMT government made unification the only possible
conclusion for Taiwan's future, the only resolution of cross-strait
relations,'' said Chen, using the initials for the Nationalist
Party's Chinese name, Kuomintang. ``This way of handling it is
contrary to public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that a majority of Taiwan's 23 million people opposed
unification with China, at least under the terms Beijing has
proposed. And he said his government needed to develop a new
consensus on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's remarks are likely to anger the Chinese government, which
views him with deep suspicion because of his record as an advocate
of Taiwanese independence. Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade
province and has fought to deny it recognition as a sovereign state
in the international community.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does make it seem like he's backtracked on all his
goodwill gestures,'' said Antonio Chiang, the publisher of The
Taipei Times, an English-language newspaper that has supported
Chen.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the president said his tougher tone could upset the
tenuous stability in cross-strait relations that he has achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as both sides were willing to work toward
reunification, but without a timetable, there was fragile ground
for mutual trust,'' said Ma Ying-jeou, the mayor of Taipei and a
leader of the Nationalists. ``When the president says reunification
is only one option, he opens a Pandora's box.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Chen, talking softly has had limits. By pledging in his
inauguration speech not to declare independence, the president
probably defused a confrontation across the Taiwan Strait. But
China has dismissed Chen's subsequent overtures as empty gestures
unworthy of reply.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has also tried to isolate Chen by
inviting delegations of Taiwan business executives and academics to
Beijing, while studiously ignoring the president. The
state-controlled media do not even mention Chen by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tactics of divide and conquer are pervasive,'' Chen
said. ``Not only are they trying to divide the parties; they are
also trying to divide the government and the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I don't think they can deny the fact that the
Taiwanese people elected me as president last March.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen made his status harder to ignore last month when he went on
a 13-day tour of Central American and African countries that have
diplomatic ties with Taiwan. His trip included a stopover in Los
Angeles, where congressmen sympathetic to Taiwan tried to arrange
meetings with him. Under pressure from the Clinton administration,
Chen demurred.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said Friday he still planned to push for closer economic
links between Taiwan and China, which had been one of his campaign
themes. But he cautioned that negotiations on direct links in trade
and transportation could not be divorced from the larger political
issues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Chen's election was a stunning victory over the entrenched
Nationalists, he won with only 39 percent of the vote. And with
Taiwan's legislature dominated by the losing party, Chen's
government has little muscle. Critics accuse it of incompetence and
legislative paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has even been criticized by officials of his own party, the
Democratic Progressive Party. Political analysts said the
president's sharper tone toward China is also calculated to shore
up his domestic support.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the drumbeat of criticism, Chen seems unruffled. Looking
relaxed and speaking forcefully at the end of a long week, the
49-year-old president said Taiwan was going through a natural
period of upheaval as it adjusted to the first government in its
history drawn from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``After five months, some people are not psychologically
adjusted to this change,'' Chen said. ``Those who support us have
high expectations. Those who don't like us hope there will be
chaos.''

   WASHINGTON _ One of the oddest political developments in this
odd campaign year is the sudden emergence of military readiness as
a hot issue.
</P>
<P>
   A review of our national defense, of course, is inevitably an
essential, underlying element of any presidential competition.
Among other roles, the White House occupant is commander-in-chief
with the burden of sending uniformed men and women into harm's way
if need be.
</P>
<P>
   But in a post-Cold War era of unprecedented peace and
prosperity, military spending is not what most voters are thinking
about.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, arguments about the shape of our armed forces tend
to be too complex for non-expert civilians to understand and easily
subject to distortion and exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush initiated this particular go-around by
declaring during his convention acceptance speech that two of the
Army's 10 divisions were not ready for duty in a major war. It
turned out to be an inaccurate statement based on outdated
information that was quickly disputed by Pentagon brass.
</P>
<P>
   His running mate, Dick Cheney, a former secretary of defense,
conceded the specific error but enlarged the debate with an
accusation that the Clinton-Gore administration had cut defense
spending in general so drastically that ``our military today is
overused and under-resourced.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore promptly countered that our armed forces
remain the world's finest despite minor problems of adjustment to a
changing world in which fresh, scattered peacekeeping tasks outrank
preparation for a traditional full-scale war.
</P>
<P>
   A decline in military spending actually began under Bush's
father, President George Bush, and Secretary Cheney after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, our most dangerous foe. But Cheney
says the cutbacks have gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   He overlooks the fact that Congress and the administration
recently increased military pay and spending on weapons
procurement, the two most criticized areas of budgetary decline
over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Another area of dispute is whether to go ahead with installation
of a missile defense system that would violate a key arms control
treaty and anger both the Russians and our NATO allies. President
Clinton on Friday decided to continue research on the proposed
system but leave the construction of a crucial radar station and
further deployment development up to his White House successor. So
far, the technology has passed only one test and flunked two
others. The thing doesn't work yet and may never do so. So what's
the hurry?
</P>
<P>
   Gore supports Clinton's cautious, temporary delay. Bush,
however, comes down hard on the issue by emphasizing that as
president he would ignore the treaty and barrel full-speed ahead to
build a giant antimissile shield regardless of the diplomatic
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's doubtful that the Republicans can generate enough fear
of a missile attack against America to make this a political
winner. Any remotely possible nuclear threat would come not from
Russia or China but some minor, irresponsible terrorist nation we
could certainly overcome. Who's afraid of big bad North Korea,
which can't even feed its people?
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Republicans have mined the issue of military
preparedness, earning a popular hawkish reputation and painting
Democrats as soft on defense. Ronald Reagan, with his fanciful Star
Wars missile defense, was an expert at that.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few Democrats managed to turn the tables on the GOP, most
notably John F. Kennedy in his 1960 presidential campaign. He
charged that the Dwight Eisenhower administration had created a
``missile gap'' by letting the Soviet intercontinental ballistic
missile stockpile grow much larger than our own.
</P>
<P>
   One month into the Kennedy administration, however, Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara conceded to reporters there really was no
missile gap. Oops, guys! Sorry about that.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans still hold a political advantage on military
spending as a general issue. A recent USA TODAY-CNN-Gallup Poll
showed that 54 percent of those surveyed felt the GOP could best
handle national defense, as opposed to only 38 percent who thought
the Democrats would be best. In a poll taken shortly before the
Democratic convention, Bush held a significant lead over Gore on
only one issue _ that of national defense, where voters preferred
him by nearly 3 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   But other polls show that voters are not as concerned about
national security these days as they are about domestic social
issues. A majority lists health care, education, protecting Social
Security and Medicare and maintaining a strong economy as the most
important issues.
</P>
<P>
   And those are the issues voters want to hear about. Unless we
are suddenly drawn into some terrible armed conflict somewhere,
every minute the candidates spend arguing about military
preparedness is a wasted minute politically. Both presidential
hopefuls are qualified to deal with issues of war and peace. The
subject is important to the country in the long term but not to the
short-range outcome of the campaign.

BAY STATE SEARCHES FOR CLUES IN HIGH DRUG-USE STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA AND RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Blame it on the liberals. Or the New Agers. Or the
college kids. Or New York drug runners.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's the pressures of the dot-com economy. Or rampant
materialism. Or lenient state laws.
</P>
<P>
   A day after a national report found that Massachusetts ranks
near the top of the country in drug use in almost every age group,
drug abuse experts and politicans sought answers. Theories were
floated and fingers pointed, but the only point of consensus was
that tougher, more abundant, drug treatment is needed in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In two dozen interviews, the complexity of the illicit drug
issue _ its myriad causes and potential solutions _ became
apparent. There is the supply side: Massachusetts is on the East
Coast, where most drugs enter the country, and near New York, home
to major drug networks. There is the demand side: money is abundant
and life's pressures are greater for many. And there are the
intangibles: Massachusetts' tolerant reputation and the licentious
bent of its many campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pinpointing the exact factors _ that ain't easy. But the
bottom line is that we need to do more prevention and treatment,''
said Tom Clark, research associate at Health and Addictions
Research Inc., a social policy think tank in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, by the US Department of Health and Human Services,
found that the Commonwealth actually ranked No. 1 in several
categories: 12-to-17-year-olds addicted to illegal drugs and
alcohol; 18-to-25-year-olds who smoked marijuana in the past month;
18-to-25-year-olds using any illicit drugs in the past month; and
those 26 and older using illegal drugs other than marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, drug and alcohol use is down sharply nationwide over a
20-year period, the study found, precipitously falling between 1979
and 1990, then leveling out. But it was the first-ever study of its
kind to compare states, putting Massachusetts in a disconcerting
and troubling light.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci drew attention Friday to the MASSCALL
program he recently launched, which will provide 24 communities
here with $7.5 million over three years to study and combat illegal
drug use.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. David Gastfriend, director of addiction services at
Massachusetts General Hospital and a Harvard psychiatry professor,
said the state's substance abuse problem doesn't invite an easy
solution. He suggested the go-go, cyber-fueled economy in Greater
Boston might be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have stock brokers, venture capital folks and dot-com
developers coming for treatment,'' he said. ``It's not just a good
economy, it's a weird economy. It's a very hard working, long-hour,
highly competitive type of prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that pressure is being felt by college students and high
school students,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a socio-economic world away, Andy Ward, director
of the South Boston Collaberative, which helps poor addicts, said
he noticed an uptick of heroin abuse among his patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heroin has become such an easy drug to get. So you're getting
younger kids addicted to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is at the end of a fast-moving heroin pipeline that
originates in New York City and runs through Providence, noted
several drug abuse researchers. Massachusetts, therefore, has
greater access to heroin and most other drugs than, say, Oklahoma,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The availibilty on the East Coast is simply greater because of
supply routes,'' said Clark.
</P>
<P>
   But the climate in Oklahoma is different, more conservative and
less tolerant of experimention, said a drug counselor that moved
here from the Heartland state only three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma is in the Bible Belt. Everyone in Oklahoma goes to
church on Sunday. I haven't got the sense that people here take the
time out for that,'' said Marie Cecchini, assistant director for
Boston NARCONON, a drug prevention and rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's much more peer pressure here. The expectation here is
to have a nice car, a nice job. You didn't have that as much in
Oklahoma,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cecchini complained about the indirect, New Age-ish, nature of
many of the drug treatment programs here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think only a very few of the programs here deal with basic
education _ what a drug is and what it does to your body,'' she
said. ``They can do all these stress workshops and whatever but
that belongs in stress management class, not drug prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   As thousands of college students descend upon the city, some
drug experts blamed their numbers and experimental ways for spiking
up drug statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have these people from Idaho and New Jersey and Nebraska
who are counted in Massachusetts,'' said Paul Jacobsen, assistant
commissioner of the state Department of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, some people interviewed raised the notion that the
Commonwealth simply has a more liberal atmosphere, radiating out
from Harvard Square, that is relatively tolerant of drug
experimentation. And this might be reflected in lighter punishments
for drug use, they speculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the state is more forgiving in its penalties. I mean,
how hard do you come down on kids who try drugs once?'' said
Matthew Leahy, vice president of laboratory operations for Secon
The Drug Screening Co., which does drug testing for state prisons
and workplaces. ``You can only do so much to lower drug use.''

PLATTERS FOUNDER WINS COURT RULING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH RANALLI

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal judge told singing group founder Herb Reed
Friday that ``only you'' have the rights to the Platters name.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge George O'Toole granted an injunction
keeping the fake Platters from joining The Drifters and Danny and
the Juniors on stage Friday night at the Festival of the Three
Saints in Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, an Arlington resident, has fought for nearly six years for
the exclusive right to represent the group he helped found in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago the First Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed his
sole ownership of the name as the only working performer left from
the group that crooned such hits as ``Smoke Gets in Your Eyes'' and
``Twilight Time.'' The only other member of the original Platters
lineups from the 1950s who is still alive, Zola Taylor, is retired.
</P>
<P>
   Despite court judgments in his favor, Reed is still frustrated
by groups that use the Platters name in shows across the country,
said his attorney, Christopher Donnelly. He filed suit against this
particular group, its New York booking agent and the festival's
organizer, the Saints Alfio, Filadelfo and Cirino Society, because
it hit ``too close to home,'' Donnelly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Reed) feels that his legacy is being misused by these
other groups,'' Donnelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the society and King B Productions, the New York
firm that booked the bogus Platters, could not be reached for
comment Friday. Donnelly, however, said he expected that the other
two groups would take the stage and perform as scheduled.

<P>
   Well, it is the economy. And some academics say you'd be stupid
not to see it as the main force that they believe will elect Al
Gore on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   That's the upshot of a quadrennial high-wire act at the American
Political Science Association convention. Professors from around
the country plug pieces of data _ largely measures of the economy
and consumer sentiment _ into various forecast models and predict
the winner and his share of the national, two-party vote.
</P>
<P>
   With today's strong fiscal picture and Americans' overall belief
that the future looks rosy too, this year those variables strongly
favor the incumbent party in the White House. All seven models
presented point to a Gore victory _ with estimates that the
Democrat will win from 52.8 to 60.3 percent of the popular,
two-party vote.
</P>
<P>
   So why even wait for the national polls that will begin pouring
out this weekend? Historically, the candidate leading in the polls
at Labor Day has a strong shot at winning two months hence, so
they're a good measure. But many of the presidential models have a
better and more exact record than most of the public opinion
samplings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, most academic forecasts were as accurate as public
opinion polls taken the day before the election, and the professors
made their predictions at least three months out.
</P>
<P>
   And don't campaigns matter? Well, yes, but the political
scientists see the campaign as reinforcing the fiscal findings key
to almost all the models.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is the answer to every question,'' said James E.
Campbell of the State University at Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   According to Campbell's data, the ``in'' party has won eight of
the 10 post-World War II presidential elections in which
second-quarter gross domestic product growth, annualized, has been
at least 2.5 percent. This year that was a booming 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions, both narrow losses, held special circumstances _
1968 when Democrat Hubert H. Humphrey lost because of the upheaval
of Vietnam and 1976 when Republican Gerald R. Ford, the unelected
president, faced the wrath of Watergate and his pardon of former
President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't there a special circumstance now, given President
Clinton's status as an impeached president and Gore's position as
No. 2 in a scandal-ridden, two-term administration?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, seemed to be the consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the separate ``time for change'' models constructed by
Alan Abramowitz of Emory University and Thomas Holbrook of the
Univeristy of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, economic factors and the
president's consistently positive job-approval ratings outweighed
any ``Clinton fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a Republican who pointed to his ``Alpha Males for
Bush'' button, couldn't find much hope in the Democratic scandals.
Just in case, though, he urged the Bush campaign to have women
dressed as Buddhist nuns waving bags of money _ or maybe a Janet
Reno look-alike _ at every Gore rally.
</P>
<P>
   As Campbell demonstrates, the academics aren't all pinkos or
``pointy-eared geeks,'' as Republican talking-head Mary Matalin
described the modelers when their predictions first began appearing
in late spring.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell holds out little hope that the unexpected will upset
the forecasts. For some comfort that a last-minute development can
move voters, he reached back to the 1884 campaign, when a
Republican cry of ``rum, Romanism and rebellion'' stirred up enough
Roman Catholics in New York to tip the state _ and the election _
to Democrat Grover Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could happen, but I wouldn't bet on it,'' said Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of betting, Christopher Wlezien of the University of
Houston, said he'd been called by an Oklahoman who apparently is
betting _ perhaps heavily _ based on forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Wlezien, whose model with Columbia University's Robert Erickson
puts Gore at 55.2 percent, conceded that ``uncertainty surrounds
our forecasts.'' But even at that, he said, ``Gore has an
advantage, and it's a pretty good one.''
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Norpoth, of the State University of New York at Stony
Brook, whose model is based on primary election performance of
candidates but comes up with the same ``Gore Wins'' result (at 55
percent) as the heavily economic forecasts, concedes some
nervousness. The group, he said, could become the Misery Loves
Company Panel.
</P>
<P>
   There is an element of the academic parlor game or recreational
political science about the forecasts, but that won't make those
naps in Austin _ or Crawford or Kennebunkport _ any more restful
this weekend.

   NEW YORK _ First, it's Shadow demanding attention, his wee
doggie head banging into a chair leg. ``Arf! Whir. Arf!''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Shadow, I'm coming. Good boy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, across the room, Poo-chi's rearing on his hind legs,
getting into one of his . . . moods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yap! Beep- &UR; beeep &LR; ! Yap!''
</P>
<P>
   Then, most rambunctious of all, it's Tekno, ears flapping up and
down like jackhammers, charging toward an open window.
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Tekno &LR; !'' He stops. (Thank heaven for voice-recognition
circuitry.)
</P>
<P>
   Time to flip some off switches. My 750-square-foot apartment has
become a high-tech kennel as I spent the last week living with a
litter of robot dogs, looking into what may be the future of pet
ownership in places like Manhattan. After Sony's tail-wagging
success with its Aibo robo-dog _ it sold out its entire 45,000-unit
production run of the $2,500 electric critters last winter _ at
least four toy companies are putting their own, less expensive
versions on the market this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real'' dog devotees argue there's no way a battery-powered
clump of circuit boards, motors and silicon chips can match the
heart-warming, life-enriching wonder of a furry, cuddly canine.
Perhaps, but what about a dog that needs no walking, no vet visits,
no extravagant cashmere sweaters to keep up with the other pampered
pooches down the hall but that will sing to you if you rub its
head, make happy sounds when you come through the front door, and
maybe even remind you of the dog you left behind when you moved
away from home. Besides, nowhere is there more need for a pet that
does not have to be chased after with a plastic baggie than New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The electric Fidos come in a variety of sizes, talents and
temperaments. To see which one would best suit my lifestyle, I
tried to break in five different puppies at once, ranging from a
5-inch mutt that couldn't walk to a blue-eyed wonder priced like a
purebred. First came Shadow, made by MGA Entertainment, which sells
for about $60 and which I carried home on the subway from F.A.O.
Schwarz, with children peering in at the furry black bundle, their
eyes widening as if he were a new Lab pup.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as I took this footlong dog out of his cardboard
kennel, I knew I would never warm to him. He's covered in
``plush,'' the cheap fake fur that adorns carnival-prize teddy
bears. And his eyes are dead, made of plastic marble things. Still,
I tried making nice with Shadow, who, to his credit, can walk, sit,
bark and do other things by voice command. I took him out for a
stroll to meet friends for ice cream, but ended up carrying him
most of the way since he walks slower than a dachshund with two
broken legs. When Shadow met my friends, they were cordial, patting
him on the head, but his blank look and painfully stiff movements
didn't win any hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, I left him yapping in the corner while I opened a box
containing dog No. 2, Poo-chi, which sells for $30 and is produced
by Tiger, the company that brought us Furby. It took almost half an
hour's work with a kitchen knife to rescue 5-inch-long, 6-inch-tall
Poo-chi from his cardboard and plastic prison and twist-tie
shackles. Finally, he appeared, looking like a robot _
metal-colored plastic skin, eyes that light up with an array of
LEDs and ears that come in a choice of translucent purple, pink and
other colors. I decided right then that I like my robotdogs to look
like robots. I don't need to pretend my electric pet is made of
flesh and fur to enjoy it. Er, him.
</P>
<P>
   Three AAA batteries in his stomach, and purple Poo-chi sprang to
life, his eyes blinking little heart shapes. I patted his head. He
has a sensor there. Poo-chi likes it when you pat his head and when
you lift his little bone to his mouth. I know this because such
signs of affection make him go up and down and make crunching
noises, and when he's really happy, he'll sing ``Ode to Joy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Poo-chi's got moods. If he feels he's not getting enough
attention, he gets surly and barks, beeps and growls. Oh, and he
can't walk. Tiger plans a more sophisticated robot dog for later
this year, a $150 model called i-Cybie that not only will walk
realistically but also will be able to express six different
emotions, including surprise and sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Being a bachelor in New York, I've more than once heard the
adage, ``Dogs are chick magnets, man.'' Would it be true for robot
dogs, too?
</P>
<P>
   I brought three of my newfangled hounds to the dog run at
Washington Square Park so they could meet some of their kind and I
could meet some of mine. For this outing, I filled my backpack with
my three favorites: Tekno, Rocket the Wonder Dog and Aibo. What I
like about Tekno is he's relentlessly enthusiastic, like a real
dog. The thing is about 8 inches tall and, like a Chihuahua, never
shuts up or stops running around. Made by Manley Toy Quest and sold
for $40, he looks sort of like a silver C3PO. Although he's not as
quick witted as that droid from ``Star Wars,'' Tekno comes with a
set of five playing cards and can learn card tricks. Such talents
didn't go over at the dog run, where a Rottweiler named Junior
thought he'd teach Tekno a thing or two, and bit into the robot's
torso. Tekno barked, wagged his tail and ran away, covered in doggy
drool. Still, he was initiated.
</P>
<P>
   Rocket, by Fisher-Price, fared even better, impressing the other
dog owners with his ability to push himself up onto his head and
bark out a tune. Expected to retail for $100, he's a solid, meaty
dog, 12 inches long, with a thick head and a wide stance like a
boxer. His real charm lies in his astonishing, big blue eyes with
their blinking eyelids and expressive brows. He changes from
looking happy to sad, from plaintive to playful. He gets a lot of
Awww's, which is what puppies should get. Rocket can also sit,
walk, beg and shake hands on command, but this requires his master
to wear a clunky headset that works only indoors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In my eyes, the champion of the dog run was Aibo. About 15
inches long from tail to nose, he moves as fluidly as a real dog _
sitting, laying down, rolling over and nuzzling your hand if you
pet him, reminding me of a small cocker spaniel. Lookswise,
however, he's all robot, with illuminated green and red slashes for
eyes and a torso that resembles a loaf of bread made of metal. He
proved his mettle at the park when the other dogs came over to
sniff him where dogs tend to sniff each other. One snooty French
bulldog wrinkled his nose after discovering Aibo lacked a canine
smell, and decided to give him one. Lifting his leg, he spritzed
Aibo, who never flinched.
</P>
<P>
   After that Aibo became more popular _ and soon, so did I. As a
pack of small real dogs swirled around the robot, which cocked its
head and danced, the Bing sisters from Alberta _ Esther, 24; Lisa,
23; and Sarah, 20 _ came over to admire my pet. ``He's amazing,''
Lisa said, scratching under Aibo's chin and cooing.
</P>
<P>
   At home, after I placed Aibo on his recharging cradle, I phoned
Caroline Knapp, author of ``Pack of Two: The Intricate Bond Between
People and Dogs'' (Delta, 1998), and asked her if she thought there
was any way robot dogs could replace live ones. They lack mystery,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe something wouldn't be missing, some heart, the
capacity to react in a deep way, or to care,'' said Knapp, 40,
owner of a mutt named Lucille. ``The soul would be difficult to
replicate.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but while I'm writing this, Aibo is next to me, sitting,
standing up, emitting soothing tones, sticking his legs out and
making funny shapes with them. Yes, his battery will run out in
about 90 minutes, and he's not, you know, alive.
</P>
<P>
   Sony says I have to send Aibo back in two weeks. So to whoever's
buying me gifts this December: Can I have one? Please? If I promise
to take care of him and recharge his batteries every day? Please?
Can I?

PLATTERS FOUNDER WINS COURT RULING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal judge told singing group founder Herb Reed
Friday that ``only you'' have the rights to the Platters name.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge George O'Toole granted an injunction
keeping the fake Platters from joining The Drifters and Danny and
the Juniors on stage Friday night at the Festival of the Three
Saints in Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, an Arlington resident, has fought for nearly six years for
the exclusive right to represent the group he helped found in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago the First Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed his
sole ownership of the name as the only working performer left from
the group that crooned such hits as ``Smoke Gets in Your Eyes'' and
``Twilight Time.'' The only other member of the original Platters
lineups from the 1950s who is still alive, Zola Taylor, is retired.
</P>
<P>
   Despite court judgments in his favor, Reed is still frustrated
by groups that use the Platters name in shows across the country,
said his attorney, Christopher Donnelly. He filed suit against this
particular group, its New York booking agent and the festival's
organizer, the Saints Alfio, Filadelfo and Cirino Society, because
it hit ``too close to home,'' Donnelly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Reed) feels that his legacy is being misused by these
other groups,'' Donnelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the society and King B Productions, the New York
firm that booked the bogus Platters, could not be reached for
comment Friday. Donnelly, however, said he expected that the other
two groups would take the stage and perform as scheduled.

 &HT;    '46 Bama team is going back to Rose Bowl
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ On Thursday, the Alabama football team that
will play UCLA today in Rose Bowl Stadium boarded a plane in
Birmingham. They arrived here just four hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' said Hugh Morrow of Lookout Mountain, Tenn. ``I guess a
lot has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot, indeed. Morrow was on the last Alabama team to play in
the Rose Bowl, some 54 years ago when the Crimson Tide faced
Southern California in the Jan. 1, 1946, Rose Bowl. The 37 members
of that squad boarded a train in New Orleans on Dec. 23, 1945, and
did not arrive in Pasadena until four days later.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow will be one of several players from that team who will be
in the Rose Bowl today, where UCLA plays its regular-season games.
For most of these men, it will be the first time they have been in
the stadium since that unforgettable afternoon when the Crimson
Tide upset Southern California 34-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be great to see the guys again,'' said Harry
Gilmer, the Hall of Fame quarterback who led Alabama to a 10-0
record as a sophomore. ``It's going to bring back a lot of great
memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Such memories as:
</P>
<P>
   Alabama coach Frank Thomas, also in the Hall of Fame, having to
talk his team into making the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been to the Sugar Bowl the year before, and it had
messed up our Christmas,'' said Gilmer, who influenced a generation
of quarterbacks with his famous jump pass. ``We took a team vote
not to go, but he didn't even listen to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The train trip to California. The Alabama team was given three
club cars attached to a long line of empty cars, which would be
bringing soliders from World War II back from the West Coast. They
ran into several such trains on the way to California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war was winding down, and so trains coming back from the
West had the right of way,'' Morrow said. ``So every time we met a
train, we had to pull off and let them pass. Because of that it
took us four days to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood and its stars, who came out in full force to meet and
greet the team. Among the stars were George Raft, Ida Lupino and
Johnny Mack Brown, former Alabama player turned cowboy star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us had never been anywhere like that, so we were
pretty starstruck,'' said Vaughn Mancha, Hall of Fame center who
lives in Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that Alabama was unbeaten and ranked No. 2
behind Army, the West Coast media gave the team no chance against
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand why,'' Morrow said. ``We were a bunch of
18-19-year-old kids and had not played a national schedule. But we
had beaten Tennessee and Georgia, and those teams were mighty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who played for Knute Rockne and roomed with George Gipp
at Notre Dame, was an offensive genius and had his team
well-prepared _ Alabama led 27-0 in the third quarter before USC
ever made a first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget. (The media) called us the Swamp Rats. The
Alabama Swamp Rats,'' Gilmer said. ``But the old Swamp Rats played
pretty good that day.'' Gilmer would go on to a career in pro
football and was an assistant coach with the Atlanta Falcons under
Norm Van Brocklin.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Crimson Tide's sixth and final trip to the granddaddy
of all bowl games. And no Southern team has played in the Rose Bowl
since. The next year, the Big Ten signed a contract to send its
champion to Pasadena each year.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the number of men who made that memorable trip is
dwindling. The survivors are in their mid-70s. But the bond that
began forming in the summer of 1945 is still very strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to keep up with each other pretty good. When
something happens to one of us, we know about it pretty quick,''
Morrow said. ``Unfortunately, it's getting easier to keep up with
everybody, because there are fewer of us left.''
</P>
<P>
   For a few hours today, the Alabama team of 1945 will bask in the
glory of that special afternoon long ago. And their memories will
be forever young.

ARABS PROTEST PROFILING AT AIRPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At an airline counter at Logan International Airport in Boston,
a clerk asked Samir Hamdan and his 15-year-old son, Tarik, to step
into a private room. A security guard needed to check his bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her why. She told me, `You've been selected randomly
by the computer.' '' Hamdan was miffed, but complied. It was
random, afterall.
</P>
<P>
   But on his way back from Beirut, a clerk at Heathrow
International Airport in London told him he'd been picked again.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he was shocked at what he saw in the security room.
``Almost all the people were either black or had tannish skin,''
said Hamdan, a chiropractor who lives in Northborough, Mass. ``I
don't think it was a coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamdan says he was singled out because he's an Arab Muslim and
fits the stereotype of a terrorist. Count him among the growing
number of Muslims who say they are victims of TWA, or ``Traveling
While Arab.'' And Arab-Americans are calling on the Federal
Aviation Administration to stop what they believe is a form of
racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even as Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore promises to
end police profiling of black motorists, the FAA is quietly
preparing a $1.5 million study to determine whether Arab-Americans
are being similarly targeted at airports.
</P>
<P>
   Arab-American advocates say the targeting is so pervasive that
some Arab-Americans alter their behavior to avoid being searched.
Some don't bring carry-on bags. Men shave their facial hair. Others
arrive early, believing they're more likely to be questioned,
frisked, detained.
</P>
<P>
   But what they can't change is the color of their skin, their
Muslim names, the Middle Eastern countries stamped on their
passports, or women wearing the traditional hijab headress _ any of
which make them stand out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a running joke, that there's a hijab alert button
under the table at airport security checkpoints,'' said Ibrahim
Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an
Islamic advocacy group based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints have risen since 1997, Arab-American organizations
say, when the FAA began using the Computer-Assisted Passenger
Prescreening System which alerts airline clerks to search certain
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Trexler, an FAA spokewoman, said she is not allowed to
disclose what information the screening system looks for, but she
said it doesn't use religious or ethnic identifiers such as name.
She said it does use information relating to travel patterns, but
she declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what's in it because it would be telling the
bad guys what to do to not get picked,'' Trexler said.
</P>
<P>
   But as Arab-Americans increasingly complain, the FAA has been
forced to act. It is preparing a pilot study that will be conducted
in Detroit, the city with the largest Arab-American population in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know if the selection criteria has
disproportionately chosen people of particular minority groups,''
said FAA spokesman Bill Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims say they have been linked with terrorism due to
high-profile cases such as the World Trade Center bombing in New
York in 1993. It is Muslims of the Middle East, rather than Muslims
from Africa, who are more likely targeted, they say. Arabs,
regardless of whether they are Muslim or Christian, say they are
targeted because of their national origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is out and out discrimination, which is rooted in the
stereotype that all Arabs are terrorists,'' said Merrie Najimy,
president of the Boston chapter of the national American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee. ``It's unjust because anyone with a
Western or Anglican name would never have to worry about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Faisal Saleh, 48, president of BeneSoft Inc., a
software company based in Bethany, Conn. Three years ago, while
purchasing a ticket to fly from San Diego to Portland, Ore., a
clerk told him he'd been chosen by the computer for a search.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her what that meant. She said, `We will have to search
all your bags and you have to empty your pockets.' I was
flabbergasted,'' Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
   He told her to cancel the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refused to go along. It's humiliating and degrading. If I
let them search me it's like saying I agree with your practices. I
ended up taking a flight on a different airline.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the federal Department of Transportation keeps statistics
on complaints, many people don't complain to the DOT. They either
don't know which department to call within the vast bureaucracy, or
they don't trust that anything will be done. That explains why so
far this year the DOT has received just six complaints in general
while the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee has received
69.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profile is absolutely discriminatory and constitutes
racial profiling of Arabs,'' said Hussein Ibish, spokesman for the
committee. ``There is hardly an Arab-American who hasn't been
profiled him or herself or has had a close friend or relative who
has been. It has touched all of us, some of us many times.''

RELIGION: A GATHERING OF LEADERS OF DIVERSE FAITHS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For four days this week, the United Nations and then
the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel played host to an unusual assembly of
religious figures from around the globe, who came together for an
event called the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and
Spiritual Leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As a body, these men and women _ 800 of them in all, according
to the event's organizers, with around 1,000 other participants _
made a colorful sight, especially when seated in the United
Nations' General Assembly hall in their robes, turbans and clerical
collars.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of some underlying tensions among some of
the groups, the conference seemed to focus on its declared
objective, getting the leaders to talk about the cause of world
peace. And by Thursday, the closing day, many participants had
signed a declaration pledging themselves to work for just that _
along with combating poverty and pressing for environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
   But what was really accomplished by the conference _ sponsored
by foundations and so not officially a United Nations' event _
remains to be seen, though several participants identified its
primary value as simply allowing people of diverse religious
backgrounds to meet and talk with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest challenge the organizers initially faced
was dealing with strong criticism about the absence of Dalai Lama,
the spiritual leader of Tibet, whose presence at the United Nations
had been blocked by China. But the Dalai Lama's voice was not
entirely absent from the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote a message, delivered to participants, in which he
declared that leaders of different faiths ``can play a pivotal
role'' in creating peace by explaining to their followers the need
to respect the beliefs of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to embrace the spirit of pluralism in the field of
religions as well,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said there would be no peace ``as long as there is
grinding poverty, social injustice, inequality, oppression,
environmental degradation, and as long as the weak and small
continue to be trodden by the mighty and powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   These are issues that religious leaders need to work together to
eliminate, the Dalai Lama said, and ``are the enemies of peace and
true tyrannies of our times.''
</P>
<P>
   His broad plea, for religious leaders to engage in interfaith
understanding and cooperation, was echoed by many others. Rabbi
Jonathan Sacks, the chief rabbi of Britain, said that mass
migrations and new communications technologies had brought people
into close proximity who had previously been strangers to one
another. And therein lay a theological challenge to believers.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has brought us eyeball to eyeball with the diversity of
His world,'' Sacks said. ``And right now He is asking us: Can we
recognize God's image in someone who is not in my image? Can
strangers, even enemies, become friends?''
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi also struck a note that others at the conference
voiced: that religious leaders around the world often have real
influence, much more so than politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the conflict zones in today's world,'' Sacks said,
``and you will see that they coincide almost exactly with zones of
religious tension. The question is, is religion part of the
solution, or is it part of the problem? Let none of us doubt the
difference we can make.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama and Sacks each spoke as leading figures within
geographically far-flung faith groups, Buddhists and Jews, who were
well-represented at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Some smaller faiths had, not surprisingly, far fewer
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The conference drew only a handful of Zoroastrians, for example,
members of an ancient religious tradition that emerged in Persia,
now Iran, nearly 3,000 years ago. One who came was Dastur Firzone
M. Kotwal, a dastur, or high priest, who lives in Bombay, long the
major center for the world's Zoroastrians.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what message his faith could offer the conference, Dr.
Kotwal offered a reply drawn from its ethics: ``Zoroastrianism lays
stress on a very good standard of morality. Do justice, fairness,
honesty and righteousness. When you are standing, lift up the poor.
God has given you wealth in excess, use it to help the
downtrodden.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimated the number of Zoroastrians worldwide at about
135,000, nearly half of them in Bombay. ``We never convert,'' he
said. ``In this time, this is the best policy. We believe you must
follow the religion of your birth and seek salvation from your own
religion.''

   AUSTIN _ George W. Bush isn't the first Texas governor to be
struck between the eyes with a ruling from U.S. District Judge
William Wayne Justice.
</P>
<P>
   He is just the first Texas governor who was running for
president of the United States when the blow came. And the news was
made worse in his case by the sensitivity of the issue, health care
for children.
</P>
<P>
   Bush isn't even the first state official to try to downplay the
significance of Justice's findings by labeling the veteran jurist
as an ``activist, liberal judge.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of state officials _ Republicans and Democrats alike _
have applied that tag to Justice over the years since his
appointment to the federal bench by President Lyndon B. Johnson in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   Justice has been a strong champion of civil rights and on more
than one occasion has found state government in Texas
constitutionally deficient in performing public services.
</P>
<P>
   His best-known decision, handed down about 20 years ago, forced
state government to make extensive improvements in an overcrowded
prison system. State officials widely criticized Justice for that
ruling, but the blame ultimately belonged to the critics _ mostly
Democrats then _ who had not fulfilled their responsibilities to
run a constitutional prison system.
</P>
<P>
   Politically motivated legislators _ and at least one Democratic
governor and a Democratic attorney general _ liked to ridicule
Justice for ordering ``country club prisons,'' but their rhetoric
was pure blather.
</P>
<P>
   Justice may wear the ``activist, liberal'' tag as a badge of
honor. Or he may consider himself a ``strict constructionist'' of
the Constitution, but with a somewhat different view of that
document than Bush and many other elected state officials.
</P>
<P>
   No one, at least, can accuse Justice of ``coddling criminals''
with his latest ruling, which held that Texas was providing
inadequate health care to low-income children in the Medicaid
program.
</P>
<P>
   Justice determined that Texas has failed to comply with some of
the terms of a 1996 consent decree entered in a class-action suit
against the state. Most of the ruling concerned an early screening
and treatment program of preventive care.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is appealing the ruling, but the timing was awful for
Bush. The order gave fresh ammunition to Democrats, who already
were attacking the governor over the health care issue. And it
became public just as the Republican nominee was struggling to
regain the offensive in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Bush didn't learn of the order until it
was two weeks old _ and after it first had been reported in the
media. He and his campaign staff were blindsided while flying
around the Northeast with a planeload of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Since nobody ever said politics was fair, Democrats will use the
ruling to continue to attack Texas' health care record, even though
that record isn't the governor's fault alone.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has historically lagged behind most other states in health
care, education and other social issues, a dubious tradition dating
back to when Democrats controlled state government.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 consent decree in the children's health care suit,
which Justice addressed, was entered into during the Bush
administration. But the suit was filed in 1993, when Democrat Ann
Richards was governor.
</P>
<P>
   That being said, however, the issue of health care _ for
children, senior citizens and the rest of us _ should be addressed
in the presidential race. And Bush may have to continue defending
not only his own record, but that of his state as well.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility comes with the territory. He is the governor
and a presidential candidate claiming credit for a strong economy
and other positive news from Texas. He has to take _ or at least
share _ the blame for the not-so-positive news as well.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential politics aside, Bush and legislators from both
parties cooperated last year in creating a new health-insurance
program for thousands of low-income children who aren't poor enough
for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice's order is a reminder that the need still outpaces
the bragging rights.

OUTLOOK MURKY FOR PIPELINE SAFETY BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES POPE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress returns to work Tuesday bracing for a
furious month-long sprint that leaves Washington state lawmakers
little time or maneuvering room to achieve their highest priority _
a tough and comprehensive pipeline safety bill.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state's lawmakers aren't conceding defeat yet, they
acknowledge that something will have to happen in the next two
weeks if a pipeline bill is to have any chance of becoming law.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a major push for pipeline safety in the wake of last
year's gasoline pipeline explosion and fireball that killed three
people in Bellingham, Wash., and a renewed sense of urgency after a
natural gas pipeline explosion in New Mexico killed 11 people,
legislation is languishing in both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Slade Gorton, R-Wash., are
pushing hard for action. Murray has said she will get ``creative''
in finding a way to push the issue forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise I will be creative in my approach to achieving
meaningful pipeline safety legislation this year,'' Murray told her
colleagues in July.
</P>
<P>
   That vow was reiterated last week by her chief of staff, Rick
Desimone. Murray's words are code language for attaching a pipeline
provision to a must-pass bill. If she resorts to that approach it
improves chances that pipeline safety provision will become law _
but at a price. It would be considerably weaker than if the bill
were passed independently.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's too early to know how it might play out, Congress
historically is hesitant to attach a ``rider'' as sought by Murray
and other advocates that alters federal policy in substantial ways.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Congress often compromises by agreeing to language
calling for an independent study of the issue _ in this case the
need for new pipeline standards _ with the understanding that
Congress will come back to the question once the study is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   That option clearly would not satisfy Washington state lawmakers
who have been working for more than a year to pass a more
comprehensive law.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be the best they can do. The reason for the
uncertainty and maneuvering is that Congress will be focused on two
goals _ dealing with essential legislation, and getting out of
town.
</P>
<P>
   Congress must finish work on the remaining appropriations bills
that keep the government running. There's a lot of work left. Only
two of the 13 bills have been signed into law and all must be
passed by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The second _ and for most members, equally important _ order of
business is to keep things moving fast enough so the session will
end on time Oct., 6 which allows them a full month of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   With only 23 work days scheduled before adjournment and with the
preoccupation with November elections, lawmakers are in little mood
to deal with complex and politically challenging questions such as
overhauling the way pipelines are regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Every member of the state's delegation supports some form of
pipeline safety legislation and many have been outspoken about the
need to enact tougher standards governing the operation and
maintenance of pipelines. The most aggressive changes would would
set specific federal standards and techniques for inspecting
pipelines, allow states to institute more stringent standards than
federal law, and require that employees on duty during an accident
be relieved until an investigation determines a cause.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline industry strongly opposes allowing states to set
tougher standards. They say most pipelines cross state lines and it
would be difficult to abide by such a ``patchwork'' of regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The industry and its allies in Congress also oppose any mandate
that employees be relieved during an accident investigation,
arguing that it would unfairly punish some workers and actually
weaken pipeline safety by removing key personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has been making more progress on pipeline safety than
the House. It has a bipartisan bill ready to come to the floor for
a vote, although Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who controls
which bills come to the full Senate, has not committed to bring it
forward.
</P>
<P>
   And Washington's cause got a boost when New Mexico's two
senators, Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman, called for a pipeline
bill in the wake of the accident in their state.
</P>
<P>
   Murray and Gorton have been working to clear objections and
convince Lott that the bill should come to the floor quickly.
Gorton, who spoke to Lott about the matter recently, remains
hopeful the pipeline bill will come to the floor. ``He was
receptive,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton also said there has been progress in forging a compromise
that would remove much of the remaining opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's concern, however, is that the bill could get bogged down
in debate, siphoning critical time from must-pass bills. ``He has
never been against the substance of the bill,'' Gorton said of
Lott. Opposition comes from the pipeline industry, which fears more
regulation will lead to higher costs, and from oil state lawmakers
who worry jobs could be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton conceded that passing a pipeline bill will take luck,
given congress' other priorities and dwindling amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   But Bellingham Mayor Mark Asmundson, for one, remains
optimistic, and believes there is a better than even chance that
both the Senate and House will take up a pipeline bill. Asmundson
says lawmakers are appearing cautious _ even doubtful _ in public
``because nobody wants to offer expectations they can't fullfill.''
</P>
<P>
   The outlook in the House is considered bleaker than the Senate.
The chairman of a key committee has indicated a willingness to hold
a hearing on pipeline safety but has not set a date. That
uncertainty has frustrated Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., who has
sponsored one of the pipeline bills. ``We have been very
disappointed that the majority party has not scheduled a markup and
floor action on this,'' Inslee said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been pounding on the door for just under a year ... and
we can't even get a vote. That's what's discouraging,'' he said.
``We get paid to pass legislation.''

CUBAN-ISM 
</HEADLINE>
 Daring guitarist starting a 
different kind of revolution 
(For use on or after Sept. 5, 2000, by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When percussionist-band leader Machito moved to New York to
kick-start the mambo craze in the '40s, it's doubtful even he could
have envisioned Los Cubanos Postizos (the Prosthetic Cubans)
guitarist Marc Ribot's rhythmically infectious salute to the
foundations of salsa.
</P>
<P>
   A leading light of Manhattan's downtown avant-garde jazz and
rock scenes, Ribot dedicated his ensemble to the songs of Arsenio
Rodriguez, a late superstar of Latin music known for his skillful
playing of the !ital!tres, a three-stringed guitar central to Cuban
music 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned, Buena Vista Social Club fans. This ain't some kind of
purist approach. Not that he's going expressly for laughs, but
Ribot, widely regarded as one of today's most inventive and
adventurous guitarists, reveals the humor between the !ital!clave
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arsenio was pushing the envelope of what was possible in some
of his soloing,'' Ribot (pronounced !ital!Ree-bow) said. ``But it's
not all about solos. It's about a group sound, group arrangements.
Even though he was the band leader, on a lot of the classic
records, you're lucky if you get three minutes of soloing on the
whole thing. But what there is, is brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Ribot and his ``fake Cubans'' appear in two shows Wednesday at
the Conga Room in Los Angeles in support of the group's second
album, ``Muy Divertido! (Very Entertaining!)'' (Atlantic).
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Cubans who've heard us laugh their heads off,'' said
Ribot, 46, an in-demand session player who has cut multiple albums
with Elvis Costello and Tom Waits. ``This is music that would be
known by any Cuban musician of a certain age. I liken our version
to what would happen if some Australian aborigines found a Duke
Ellington record and came back 20 years later with their own
version of it.''
</P>
<P>
   With a guitar style defined by an edgy and eclectic harmonic
approach and a loose, playful attitude, Ribot formed Los Cubanos
Postizos three- and-a-half years ago, drawing praise from Jazziz
magazine for ``some of the scruffiest, most deliciously different
Cuban music you're likely to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, classic Cuban music has exploded thanks to the
worldwide success of Havana's Buena Vista Social Club and its many
offshoots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to present this as a work of scholarship or make
any claims to authenticity,'' Ribot said. ``This is my usage of
Cuban music. But let me express my dismay at the fact that this
turned out to be trendy even though I think there's a common cause.
A lot of great archival Cuban music compilations became available
in the U.S. starting in the early '90s and it's natural that
musicians would pick up on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's quite beautiful about now is that 20 or 30 years ago,
only musicologists had access to all this sort of world music
material. Now anybody can get it at Tower.'' &QL;

  Domingo's arrival energizes L.A. OPERA 
(For use on or after Sept. 5, 2000, by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
New season, new leader, more performances, the company's first
venture into ancient Egypt ... but no elephants?
</P>
<P>
   You'd think the arrival of world-famous tenor Placido Domingo
taking over the artistic reins of the Los Angeles Opera would
entail a little pageantry. And what better occasion than
Wednesday's opening night performance of Giuseppe Verdi's ``Aida,''
the first staging by L.A. Opera, and a piece for the presence of
live beasts if ever there was one?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, says L.A. Opera executive director Ian White-Thomson. No
creatures. (No Elton John, either. This is Verdi's ``Aida,'' not
Disney's.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw `Aida' in Verona,'' said White-Thomson. ``It was a
big open- air theater, and you sort of hope some livestock is going
to be available. They managed to use a friendly bear for the
Academy Awards once, but getting elephants on the stage? I don't
even want to think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the bow of ``Aida'' and Rossini's ``La Cenerentola''
(which opens Friday), the company will conduct a different kind of
dog-and-pony show next week as Domingo is expected to announce his
plans for the 2001-02 season _ the first he'll program. But until
next Monday's press conference, don't ask Domingo, White-Thomson or
anybody else at L.A. Opera what's on tap for the future. Those who
know aren't saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, like all transitions, particularly in businesses
which have such a long lead time as opera, it doesn't just happen
like that,'' says White-Thomson. ``We don't say, 'OK, here's a new
management and all of these new things.' It's a very interesting
and challenging time.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it is, and opera aficionados both domestically and
internationally are watching closely. Domingo, who has been the
company's artistic adviser and principal guest conductor for
several years, officially took over artistic directorship in July.
</P>
<P>
   Which means attention will be paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Placido is perhaps one of the three to five most visible
people in the music world throughout the world,'' says Edward
Purrington, artistic administrator for the Washington Opera, where
Domingo will continue to serve as artistic director even after he
takes over the reins in Los Angeles. ``When you have Placido
Domingo running your company, the expectations of the audience are
a lot higher than they would be than if anybody else is running it
for reasons that the audience probably couldn't articulate. He's
the man.''
</P>
<P>
   As booked up as Domingo is _ between his conducting and singing
commitments _ opera administrators nationwide are wondering how
he'll make his mark on the Los Angeles scene without the use of a
clone. This year alone, he has engagements in New York; Washington,
D.C.; Madrid; Paris; Vienna; and Japan. He won't sing during the
current L.A. Opera season, except in a series of all-Wagner
concerts conducted by Valery Gergiev with the Kirov Orchestra on
Sunday and Sept. 13 and 15. He'll also conduct four performances of
``Aida'' and most of Puccini's ``La Boheme'' in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say this not as a criticism,'' says Purrington, ``but he is
dividing himself even further than he has. He is already sliced
into so many different pie-shaped pieces that it's very difficult
to find the idea lead time to work with Placido on creating his
great desire for seasons in both Washington and Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Purrington, who estimates that it will be at least three years
before audiences see a ``Domingo stamp'' on the company, also
expects Domingo's presence to cause donors to open their wallets.
His presence may even further advance a marriage of high culture
and Hollywood, said Christopher Hahn, former artistic administrator
of the L.A. Opera under the company's departed founder/artistic
director, Peter Hemmings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it can only be for the good of the classical arts and
voice in the Los Angeles area, which, as we know, traditionally
hasn't poured money in that direction,'' said Hahn, now the
artistic director at the Pittsburgh Opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the proximity to Hollywood and all that money, I
think he's superbly placed to pull off a significant connection.
Not necessarily to popularize opera but to bring it to the
forefront of people's imaginations.''
</P>
<P>
   The current season, the last to be programmed by Hemmings, who
has returned to England, will feature the return of Herbert Ross'
production of ``La Boheme'' (Nov. 29-Dec. 21), Puccini's ``Tosca''
(June 6-27), Donizetti's ``Don Pasquale'' (April 11-29) and
Mozart's ``The Marriage of Figaro'' (Jan. 16-Feb. 3). Following on
the success of last season's ``Billy Budd,'' the company brings
back Britten with ``Peter Grimes'' (Oct. 18-Nov. 4) to be directed
by film director John Schlesinger.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the season, which increases the total number of
performances from 55 to 63, is Handel's ``Julius Caesar'' (Feb.
23-March 10). That brings the tally to four returning productions,
and four that are new to L.A. audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our actual repertoire is not exactly revolutionary or
anything,'' White-Thomson said. ``But I think it has its
exploratory moments. I'd be very surprised and extremely
disappointed if 'Boheme' and 'Tosca' didn't sell out equally. I'd
be amazed and very pleased if 'Peter Grimes' did.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did it take 14 years to stage ``Aida''? ``My guess is
money,'' White-Thomson said. ``It always is.''
</P>
<P>
   Artists lined up include Catherine Malfitano (singing the title
role in ``Tosca''), Jennifer Larmore and Rodney Gilfry (in ``La
Cenerentola''), Elizabeth Futral (Cleopatra in ``Caesar''), Richard
Bernstein (in ``Cenerentola'' and ``Figaro'') and Phillip Langridge
(in ``Peter Grimes'').
</P>
<P>
   Former Orange County resident Deborah Voigt makes her Los
Angeles debut in the title role of ``Aida.'' It's a co-production
with the Houston Grand Opera made possible by a gift from
billionaire opera donor Alberto Vilar. Completing the love triangle
are Nina Terentieva as Egyptian princess Amneris and South African
tenor Johan Botha as Radames, the captain of the guard.
</P>
<P>
   Radames, Botha notes, is a role that Domingo has sung several
times, and he is very much looking forward to working with the
maestro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here basically to learn from him,'' Botha said, ``to learn
how to perfect the part.''
</P>
<P>
   By playing in repertory with `'Aida,'' Rossini's lesser-known
``La Cenerentola'' (aka ``Cinderella'') occupies what White-Thomson
calls ``the dreaded No. 2 position.'' Subscribers not necessarily
wanting to see two operas in a week may opt for ``Aida,'' although
the return of mezzo-soprano Larmore and tenor Gilfry (last season's
Billy Budd) may yet help fill the seats. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
What: ``Aida'' and ``La Cenerentola.'' &QL; 
Where: Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 135 N. Grand Ave., Los Angeles. &QL; 
When: In repertory Wednesday through Sept. 28. Call for dates and
times. &QL; 
Tickets: $65 to $180 for ``Aida''; $28 to $148 for ``La
Cenerentola.'' Call (213) 365-3500. &QL;

LAWYER SAYS SHE'LL FIGHT TO FREE PREGNANT SECT MEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Rebecca Corneau rejects the legal system as a form of
pagan justice and an affront to her god. In repeated court
hearings, representing herself, she has steadfastly refused to
answer any questions about her current pregnancy and spurned a
court-ordered prenatal exam.
</P>
<P>
   Now, whether she likes it or not, the 32-year-old Attleboro
mother _ who is suspected of neglect in the death of her last baby
_ is about to get help from a distinctly non-conservative and
secular group: the women's rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   The first bid to free Corneau from a prison hospital in Boston
is coming from Wendy Murphy, a lawyer who teaches reproductive
rights at the New England School of Law. Hoping for action before
Corneau is expected to give birth in the next few weeks, Murphy is
preparing an emergency petition for the state Supreme Judicial
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unconstitutional to jail her because she refused medical
help,'' Murphy said. ``The only argument thus far is that she may
have done something in the past that led to a baby's death. That's
woefully inadequate. It's speculation and violation of due
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is not filing on behalf of Corneau, though.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, after seeking endorsements from the National
Organization for Women and other women's groups, she'll ask the
state's highest court to overturn Juvenile Court Judge Kenneth P.
Nasif's decision to incarcerate Corneau on behalf of all pregnant
women.
</P>
<P>
   Using a little-known state law called the ``emergency
superintendent provision,'' which allows independent parties to
appeal lower-court decisions for individuals who can't seek relief
for themselves, Murphy hopes the high court won't send her appeal
back to Nasif; if it does, he could spend weeks reviewing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of her impending pregnancy, it's vital the SJC steps
in now,'' she said. Once Corneau gives birth, ``there is no way to
give her back freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Corneau is to appear in court again Thursday, when Nasif will
review the case. If medical tests show her delivery is more than a
month off _ and she allows daily visits from the nurse _ the judge
might allow her to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol County prosecutors, however, said Friday they expect
Corneau to give birth at the Neil J. Houston House, a medical
facility run by the Department of Corrections that cares for
pregnant women serving jail terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that she has not been notably cooperative:
She has not allowed a medical exam,'' said Walter Shea, an
assistant district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``She isn't being put in jail for a crime she might commit,''
Shea said, defending the judge's decision. ``She has been declared
as an unfit mother. The issue is not religious beliefs; we need
someone there capable of saving that baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet rights groups have denounced the decision as a threat to any
woman who might choose a non-traditional birth, such as many
Christian Scientists who generally reject modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question the judge made an errant decision,'' said
Andi Mullin, president of Massachusetts affiliate of NOW.
``Competent adults have the right to refuse medical treatment in
the United States. We might not make the same choices for
ourselves. It's un-American to take away her choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Paltrow, director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women
in New York, said her group is also considering how to fight
Nasif's ruling. For now, she said, Corneau's best hope may rest
with Murphy's petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't presume some one is guilty,'' Paltrow said. ``This
is high-class imprisonment, even if it's ensuring the health of the
fetus.''
</P>
<P>
   In Corneau's defense, Muphy will point to previous rulings in
which judges have overruled lower-court decisions to jail pregnant
women.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, for example, in Taft vs. Taft, the Supreme Judicial
Court overruled a lower court's order to have a pregnant woman's
cervix sewn up against her will to prevent a miscarriage. In that
case, the court ruled the record showed no circumstances ``so
compelling as to justify curtailing (her) constitutional rights.''
</P>
<P>
   In another case in 1990, Commonwealth vs. Pellegrini, a trial
court in Massachusetts found it unconstitutional to penalize a
woman for using drugs during her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   And in Washington that same year, the District of Columbia Court
of Appeals overruled a lower court's order of a Caesarean section
against a woman's will. ``In virtually all cases,'' the court
ruled, ``the question of what is to be done is to be decided by the
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Corneau is looking more toward divine intervention than
legal aid. Her fundamentalist Christian sect, which authorities say
consists of only 13 members, shuns science and medicine as
blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
   Eight adult members of the sect have already been jailed for
contempt after refusing to cooperate in an investigation into the
deaths of two children, including Corneau's infant son, Jeremiah.
The babies may have died from neglect _ including one from
starvation _ and were buried in a state park in Maine, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the sect insist Jeremiah was stillborn, prosecutors say
members' diaries suggest the baby died after his lungs were not
properly aspirated, a routine procedure in hospital births. Samuel
Robidoux, a 10-month-old boy, is believed to have starved to death
after he stopped nursing.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago Judge Nasif declared Corneau an unfit mother,
taking away her three children and removing eight others from the
sect. Officials from the state Department of Social Services are
expected to take custody of Corneau's baby just after its birth.

ARABS PROTEST PROFILING AT AIRPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At an airline counter at Logan International Airport in Boston,
a clerk asked Samir Hamdan and his 15-year-old son, Tarik, to step
into a private room. A security guard needed to check his bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her why. She told me, `You've been selected randomly
by the computer.' '' Hamdan was miffed, but complied. It was
random, afterall.
</P>
<P>
   But on his way back from Beirut, a clerk at Heathrow
International Airport in London told him he'd been picked again.
</P>
<P>
   This time, he was shocked at what he saw in the security room.
``Almost all the people were either black or had tannish skin,''
said Hamdan, a chiropractor who lives in Northborough, Mass. ``I
don't think it was a coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamdan says he was singled out because he's an Arab Muslim and
fits the stereotype of a terrorist. Count him among the growing
number of Muslims who say they are victims of TWA, or ``Traveling
While Arab.'' And Arab-Americans are calling on the Federal
Aviation Administration to stop what they believe is a form of
racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even as Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore promises to
end police profiling of black motorists, the FAA is quietly
preparing a $1.5 million study to determine whether Arab-Americans
are being similarly targeted at airports.
</P>
<P>
   Arab-American advocates say the targeting is so pervasive that
some Arab-Americans alter their behavior to avoid being searched.
Some don't bring carry-on bags. Men shave their facial hair. Others
arrive early, believing they're more likely to be questioned,
frisked, detained.
</P>
<P>
   But what they can't change is the color of their skin, their
Muslim names, the Middle Eastern countries stamped on their
passports, or women wearing the traditional hijab headress _ any of
which make them stand out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a running joke, that there's a hijab alert button
under the table at airport security checkpoints,'' said Ibrahim
Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an
Islamic advocacy group based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints have risen since 1997, Arab-American organizations
say, when the FAA began using the Computer-Assisted Passenger
Prescreening System which alerts airline clerks to search certain
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Trexler, an FAA spokewoman, said she is not allowed to
disclose what information the screening system looks for, but she
said it doesn't use religious or ethnic identifiers such as name.
She said it does use information relating to travel patterns, but
she declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you what's in it because it would be telling the
bad guys what to do to not get picked,'' Trexler said.
</P>
<P>
   But as Arab-Americans increasingly complain, the FAA has been
forced to act. It is preparing a pilot study that will be conducted
in Detroit, the city with the largest Arab-American population in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know if the selection criteria has
disproportionately chosen people of particular minority groups,''
said FAA spokesman Bill Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims say they have been linked with terrorism due to
high-profile cases such as the World Trade Center bombing in New
York in 1993. It is Muslims of the Middle East, rather than Muslims
from Africa, who are more likely targeted, they say. Arabs,
regardless of whether they are Muslim or Christian, say they are
targeted because of their national origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is out and out discrimination, which is rooted in the
stereotype that all Arabs are terrorists,'' said Merrie Najimy,
president of the Boston chapter of the national American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee. ``It's unjust because anyone with a
Western or Anglican name would never have to worry about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Faisal Saleh, 48, president of BeneSoft Inc., a
software company based in Bethany, Conn. Three years ago, while
purchasing a ticket to fly from San Diego to Portland, Ore., a
clerk told him he'd been chosen by the computer for a search.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked her what that meant. She said, `We will have to search
all your bags and you have to empty your pockets.' I was
flabbergasted,'' Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
   He told her to cancel the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refused to go along. It's humiliating and degrading. If I
let them search me it's like saying I agree with your practices. I
ended up taking a flight on a different airline.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the federal Department of Transportation keeps statistics
on complaints, many people don't complain to the DOT. They either
don't know which department to call within the vast bureaucracy, or
they don't trust that anything will be done. That explains why so
far this year the DOT has received just six complaints in general
while the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee has received
69.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profile is absolutely discriminatory and constitutes
racial profiling of Arabs,'' said Hussein Ibish, spokesman for the
committee. ``There is hardly an Arab-American who hasn't been
profiled him or herself or has had a close friend or relative who
has been. It has touched all of us, some of us many times.''

FALL READING, FROM HEAD TO TOE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PENELOPE GREEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Manolo Blahnik says that the secret to toe cleavage, which he
describes as a ``very important part of the sexuality of the shoe''
in ``Manolo Blahnik'' (Harper Collins, this month) by Colin
McDowell, is in showing only ``the first two cracks.'' While I
don't own a pair of Blahnik's famous pointy shoes, I know exactly
what he means. There's something a little vulgar, a little
splayed-looking, about a shod foot with more than three toes
exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The sex-toe connection and other revelations (like Blahnik's
predilection for jam and sugar scarfing, or the character sketches
he concocts for each shoe he makes: ``She's from Jaipur, where she
has a marvelous house, all cool colonnades and superbly polished
tiles'') make this coffee-table biography both delicious and
instructive. Blahnik, who has been making exciting shoes for more
than two decades, is emerging as a kind of polymorphic celebrity: a
bon vivant/shoemaker, whose unabashed eccentricities fascinate.
</P>
<P>
   You can learn a lot from books like McDowell's. Indeed, for the
style-minded reader, fall books have never felt so prescriptive, so
inspirational and so useful. Now I know the new rules of glamour,
the importance of a red bedroom, and what to do with a princess
skirt.
</P>
<P>
   To sort through it all, it's important, stylish reader, to know
who or what you aspire to. ``Bright Young Things'' by Brooke de
Ocampo, a contributing editor at Vogue and ``card-carrying BYT
herself,'' according to the book's introduction, displays a huge
menu of possibilities, and possible settings. This is a book of
terrific apartments in New York City, where de Ocampo's BYTs tend
to live _ a portfolio of photographs and the decorating narratives
of Hearsts and Rockefellers, von Stauffenbergs and Von
Furstenbergs, Laurens and Lauders and Guerrand-Hermeses, with a
couple of wild cards thrown in, like the painter Damian Loeb and
Moby, the musician.
</P>
<P>
   Every BYT included herein has a fabulous job, a witty apartment,
a great piece of art. If I were an editor at House &AMP; Garden, I'd be
tearing my hair out. There are 27 apartments in here, more than two
years' worth of magazine features on leopard-print club chairs
(Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer); plum-colored walls (Plum Sykes) and
Warhol-designed wallpaper (in a panel made by the artist for the
21st birthday of Peter Bacanovic, the lucky banker who lives in the
brownstone apartment where ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' was filmed).
</P>
<P>
   For a richer experience, cross-reference ``BYT'' with ``RSVP:
Menus for Entertaining From People Who Really Know How'' (Clarkson
Potter, November) by Nan Kempner. You'll find offspring in the
former, like Eliza Reed Bolen and Lulu de Kwiatkowski, and their
parents in the latter, including Annette and Oscar de la Renta (mom
and step-father to Eliza), who serve a mean lobster salad, and the
de Kwiatkowskis, of Calumet Farm (mom and dad to Lulu). In distinct
contrast to ``BYT,'' whose ``author,'' Brooke de Ocampo, hasn't
written its narratives, there's a fuzzy, friendly feel to ``RSVP,''
if only because it's offered in Kempner's distinctive voice, well
seasoned with personal pronouns and memories. You will also find
the best recipe for roast chicken in its pages, from Robin Hambro's
Italian cook, Luciana Guarduci.
</P>
<P>
   See if you can guess the identities of the models pictured in
``Vintage Style: Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes''
(Harper Collins, October) by Tiffany Dubin and Ann E. Berman
without looking in ``BYT.'' Dubin, who is the marketing director
for the Auction Channel and who created the fashion department at
Sotheby's, and her collaborator, Ann E. Berman, a writer for Town &AMP;
Country, make the rather trenchant point that since so-called high
fashion right now is directly ``inspired'' by fashion's past, it
would behoove you, stylish reader, to shop from the same vintage
sources as the designers. In other words, why buy Gucci or Prada
for thousands of dollars when you can buy original Giorgio di
Sant'Angelo or Ossie Clark, in pristine condition, for mere
hundreds, or much less?
</P>
<P>
   Like de Ocampo and Kempner, Dubin has collected her pals in her
pages, but she skips the details, so each model seems as
``generic'' as the item she wears. For instance, a
porcelain-skinned brunette in a princess skirt is identified only
as ``Marina, writer'' (though you know from ``BYT'' that she's
Marina Rust, a great-great-granddaughter of Marshall Field III, a
contributing editor at Vogue and the owner of a Sargent sketch). On
closer reading, you learn that the skirt was made by Carolyne
Roehm, in the late 1980s _ it's something of a shock to think of
this period as ``vintage.'' You learn by Rust's example that it's
OK to wear a princess skirt with a white T-shirt and a knotted
denim shirt ``for a morning's shopping in a resort town,'' but that
``on assignment'' you might consider a tiny tank top topped with a
gold bolero jacket trimmed with fringe and crystals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sloan, talk show host'' models a waist-length, pink plastic
bomber jacket, by Courreges. (A quick glance back at ``BYT''
reveals that it is Sloan Lindemann Barnett, a former assistant
district attorney and a co-host of ``SheCommerce,'' a cable show
produced by Oxygen Media, and that she has a husband named Roger
Barnett, a Chagall and a predilection for pink decorating
flourishes like mauve walls and fuchsia ostrich feathers.) Try the
jacket, as Sloan does, with white jeans, or a pleated skirt, or a
little black dress.

 UNDATED: black dress.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If these stylish scrapbooks are making you ache with envy _ the
apartments! the pedigrees! the clothes! _ an evening with ``4
Blondes'' (Atlantic Monthly, this month) by Candace Bushnell will
bring you right down: ``4 Blondes'' is aversion therapy for social
climbers.
</P>
<P>
   Like the characters in Evelyn Waugh's ``Decline and Fall,''
Bushnell's ersatz blondes make it hard to decide which is more
depraved. There's Janey (``Nice 'n Easy''), an over-the-hill model,
who sleeps her way into a summer house in the Hamptons each year;
Winnie (``Highlights''), a not-quite-smart-enough magazine editor,
who loathes her feckless writer husband and for whom a $500 pair of
Manolo Blahniks _ toe cleavage! _ generates a sly plot twist; and
Cecelia (``Snow Angel''), a pill-popping princess-by-marriage, who
may or may not have murdered her best friend. The fourth blonde is
Bushnell's stand-in, a sex columnist on assignment in England;
she's the ``nice'' one, who wins a love interest on the last page.
</P>
<P>
   A more appealing quartet of blondes appears in a rather
startling photograph in ``The Vogue Book of Blondes'' (Viking
Studio, last month) by Kathy Phillips with a foreword by Donatella
Versace, in which RuPaul towers over Kurt Cobain, Courtney Love and
their daughter, young Frances Bean Cobain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't always have the longest legs or the perkiest
breasts,'' Louis Licari, the self-described ``King of Color,'' says
in this cheerful and sort of chaotic encyclopedia of blondness,
which ranges from Jean Harlow to Brad Pitt, ``but being blond is
part of the fantasy you can achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than splitting blond hairs, maybe you should just paint
your bedroom. ``Paint just one wall in your bedroom in a really
great color such as russet, ochre or Venetian red,'' advises
Frederic Fekkai in ``A Year of Style'' (Clarkson Potter; October).
``Red makes you look more beautiful when you wake up.'' Of course,
you learned that already from ``BYT,'' in which Plum Sykes, a Vogue
editor, opines that ``a white room is the most boring thing in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Fekkai, the handsome French hair stylist with salons in New York
and Beverly Hills, Calif., is full of ``Why Don't You's,'' a whole
year's worth. Here are a few. ``By all means wear fabulous
sunglasses, but if you do, be ready to eliminate other
accessories.'' ``Read the latest best-selling biography. Everyone
will be talking about it this fall.'' And my favorite: ``Get a
hands-free, cordless telephone with a headset. Holding the receiver
to your ear is so 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Art of Growing Up: Simple Ways to Be Yourself at Last''
(Clarkson Potter, October) by Veronique Vienne is a nice companion
for ``A Year of Style.'' You'll find it on the ``Self Help:
Happiness'' shelf of your local bookstore, but don't let the label
fool you; this is a style book, too. Vienne, the author of ``The
Art of Doing Nothing'' and ``The Art of Imperfection,'' has
compiled 10 ``New Rules of Glamour,'' which she describes as ``just
another word for a little extra discipline.'' The first of these
is: ``knowing how to choose a hat, clean paintbrushes and
effortlessly negotiate a grand marble staircase in a tight evening
gown.''
</P>
<P>
   Attitude-beautifiers will only take you so far. Style is,
ultimately, visual, as any good BYT will tell you. Flip through
``Obsessed by Dress'' (Beacon Press, October), a book of quotations
compiled by Tobi Tobias, the dance critic for New York magazine and
a vintage-clothing wearer, for razor sharp remarks from social
observers like Jean Rhys, Henry James and Wayne Koestenbaum, who
wrote this one: ``At a now-defunct boutique called Ben's Village, I
bought a pair of cotton tropical-print unisex pants that I named
`fish pants' because blowsy fish swam on them in wallpaper
patterns. A friend had advised when I told him there was no room in
my life for fish pants, `change your life to fit the pants.'''
</P>

   Toe cleavage optional.

 By BILL WALSH 
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vietnam may be the war America would like to
forget, but Vice President Al Gore would like people to remember
one thing this election season about that ugly conflict in
Southeast Asia: He volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   While many of his contemporaries were scrambling to avoid
service, Gore enlisted in the U.S. Army, a fact highlighted at the
Democratic National Convention last month and reinforced in a
television ad campaign airing in 17 states titled simply ''1969.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Vietnam strategy, the political gurus say, is designed to
both contrast himself from Republican rival George W. Bush, who has
had to fend off allegations that his father's political connections
kept him stateside during the hostilities, and President Clinton,
who took pains to avoid military service altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But in invoking the memory of Vietnam, Gore has also ignited
discontent over his own military service. Vietnam veterans, in
particular, have objected to what they see as Gore posing as a
front-line ``grunt'' when he was really, as one of them put it,
safely ``in the rear with the gear.''
</P>
<P>
   They say his five months ``in country'' were far less than the
normal 12-month tour of duty and that his assignment as an Army
journalist attached to an engineering brigade kept him far from the
shooting, something not mentioned in the TV spots.
</P>
<P>
   Many vets give Gore points for signing up at all, since he could
have sought shelter in graduate school or, arguably, used his own
political clout to land a spot stateside in the National Guard. But
others see Gore's enlistment as a calculated risk. They charge that
the Army would never have allowed then-U.S. Sen. Albert Gore's son
to stray into the line of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stinks that Al Gore is using this `I-went-to-Vietnam'
bulls--- when his daddy got him a short tour,'' said retired Army
Maj. Glenn MacDonald of Phoenix. ``I wish he'd shut up about it.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald, a Democrat, said he was inclined to vote for Gore
until he saw the ''1969'' ad and it infuriated him. He said he has
spoken to ``at least 10 other'' veterans who are Democrats who feel
the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, not one of them is going to go for Gore,''
MacDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many of the loudest critics of Gore's service record
are Republican veterans who aren't likely to vote for the vice
president anyway. Years of defense cuts by the Clinton-Gore
administration and Gore's own support for allowing gays to serve
openly in the military have alienated many active-duty and retired
military people alike.
</P>
<P>
   But their skepticism exposes a risk of Gore's Vietnam strategy:
that by touting his service, Gore, who has cast himself as a
modern-day populist fighting for the little guy, leaves himself
open to criticism that he got special treatment as the son of
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not politically connected, so they stuck me with the
Marines and the Navy walking posts in the middle of the night,''
said Vietnam veteran Gary Curtiss of Slidell, La. ``Why didn't Al
Gore come with me?''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his generation, Gore opposed the war in Vietnam.
But he has said he enlisted in August 1969 because ``it was the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, his father was facing a tough re-election battle
complicated by the Tennessee senator's vocal opposition to the war.
The son has rejected the suggestion that his chief reason for going
was to bolster his father's political chances. (Ultimately, the
senior Gore was narrowly defeated.)
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Associated Press in July, the vice
president said that the primary reason he volunteered was because
``if I got out of it, someone would go in my place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Carthage (Tenn.) is a small town and whoever went in my place
would have a face, a name, a family and a fate, and I didn't want
to think about walking down the sidewalk and running into the
family of some boy sent in my place,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans are inclined to take Gore at his word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he had as much clout as George Bush did to stay out
and join the National Guard, but he chose active duty,'' said
Edmund Cournoyer Jr. of Springfield, Mass., who served in the Navy
from 1973 to 1983. ``You had no choice how long you stayed in
Vietnam. It's not how long you were there, it's that you were there
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Tripler Katz of Tabernacle, N.J., who served 13 months in
Vietnam as an Army nurse, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember the line in the Creedence Clearwater Revival
song (``Fortunate Son'') where John Fogerty sings, `I ain't no
senator's son'?'' Katz asked. ``Al Gore could have easily avoided
the draft. Instead he enlisted and did what thousands of his less
politically connected peers had to do. I believe this is a hallmark
of a leader I can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, many of those who criticize Gore's Vietnam service
are willing to excuse Bush's during the same period, along with
that of Richard Cheney, his vice presidential running mate, who got
a student deferment.
</P>
<P>
   Bush never left the United States during the Vietnam War,
serving from 1968 to 1973 as a F-102 fighter pilot in the Texas Air
National Guard. Published reports have raised questions about
whether then-Congressman George H. Bush pulled strings to get his
son a National Guard posting. The Boston Globe recently questioned
whether the younger Bush even showed up for all his assignments.
The governor's campaign insists that he did.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many Vietnam veterans dismiss suggestions of any
political shenanigans. In fact, they insist that Gov. Bush's record
of service was more hazardous than Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anyone who is overly impressed with Gore having
spent five months as a reporter in Vietnam,'' said Joseph Collins,
a retired Army colonel who served in Vietnam and is now a military
scholar in Washington. ``Flying planes, Bush was in more danger
than Al Gore ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   John Wells, a retired 22-year Navy veteran from Slidell, said
Bush's reserve unit could have been called up at any time, much as
reservists were mobilized during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that someone was in the reserves or National Guard
should never denigrate their courage or willingness to fight,''
Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   As a political matter, experts say, fine distinctions over the
candidates' service records are likely to matter little to voters.
</P>
<P>
   Military service has never been a prerequisite for holding the
post of commander-in-chief and the twice-elected Clinton
demonstrated that even actively avoiding service isn't a
disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a guy who did everything he could to get out of the
draft and if he ran today he would probably win,'' said Larry
Berman, a political scientist with the University of California.
</P>
<P>
   Berman says the Gore campaign is betting that most voters will
be impressed with Gore's volunteering for duty and discount details
about his assignment and his length of duty.
</P>
<P>
   He said voters are likely to remember the many young men of the
same generation who faced the gut-wrenching decision of what to do
if their draft number came up. Gore's decision, Berman said, serves
as an effective counterpoint to the ones made by the two political
figures he is battling in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one more way he can distance himself from Clinton and
separate himself from Bush,'' Berman said. ``All of this isn't
really about Vietnam. Vietnam isn't an issue in this election. But
character is an issue. This is about character.''

<P>
   AUBURN, N.Y. _ Ann D'Arcangelo Driscoll was 22 with an infant
daughter when her husband John, a corrections officer, was killed
during the 1971 riot at the Attica Correctional Facility in upstate
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``John went to work and never came back,'' she said this week
from the kitchen of her Auburn home. ``I was absolutely devastated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day, I went to the prison. It looked like a war zone.
They (the prisoners) were chanting, `Kill the pigs.' You could
smell the fires burning.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the corrections employees killed during the riots
did not die at the hands of inmates. Ten of the 11 who died _
including John D'Arcangelo _ were hit by gunshots fired by police
after then-Gov. Nelson Rockefeller ordered an all-out assault on
the prison by state police.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it was friendly fire,'' Driscoll said. ``I hate that
term.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine years later, Driscoll is still bitter about what she
calls the state's disregard for the families of corrections
employees killed or injured during the four-day riot. The state
gave her $36 a week for 16 years (stopping after her daughter
turned 16) as compensation for the death of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday a federal judge announced how an $8 million federal
court settlement will be divided among 502 families of inmates
brutalized by police and corrections officers after the riot.
Driscoll said the news turns her stomach.
</P>
<P>
   A corrections officer who was held hostage and stabbed by an
inmate during the riot said he is more angry than sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they (the inmates) should get a damn thing,''
said Anthony Prave, 62, who also now lives in Auburn. ``They blew
the place apart. They started it and they should get paid for it?
We didn't get anything _ why should they?''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Michael Telesca, in ending a 26-year
lawsuit against the state, said the inmates and their families
should get money because after the riots, police brutalized the
prisoners. The state admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. The
judge's decision, though, spoke of allegations of inmates being
sodomized by nightsticks and brutally beaten as they ran through a
gantlet of troopers and correction officers, of authorities playing
Russian roulette with prisoners in their cells and constant
taunting and racial epithets.
</P>
<P>
   The Attica riot, which grew out of inmates' objections to their
treatment, food, showering procedures and clothes, is categorized
as one of the largest and bloodiest prison riots in history.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the inmates afterward were treated ``like
garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Prave, now retired as a corrections officer, is among those
still haunted by the riot. His only compensation was six months'
disability payment. He tacked on 11/2 months sick-time he was owed
by the state and recuperated for 71/2 months. He said the state
assumed that those held hostage during the riot were sleeping
between the hours of midnight and 7 a.m. and would not pay overtime
for those hours.
</P>
<P>
   While Prave was trying to control the inmates at the onset of
the riot on Sept. 9, prisoners took him captive, stripped him
naked, blindfolded him and bound him at the wrists and ankles. He
was 33 at the time with four young children. He bears the scar of a
stab wound in his stomach from the riot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has flashbacks,'' Sue Prave said. ``He'll never get
rid of them.'' The state will not pay for counseling, Anthony Prave
said.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 30 years, the state is trying make amends with
victims such as Driscoll.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 New York state budget allotted $550,000 for the widows
or children of murdered correction facilities employees, amounting
to $50,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll, a member of the political lobbying group the Forgotten
Victims of Attica, said it's not enough. State Sen. Dale Volker, a
Republican from the Attica district, agrees. He sponsored the bill
to get money for the victims' families, but said they are entitled
to much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair, but it's more than the inmates will get
individually,'' he said. ``How do you put a value on human life?''
</P>
<P>
   The $50,000 offer was modeled after today's state accidental
death policies, which is far better than the standards of 1971,
Volker said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, none of the widows has applied for her $50,000, Volker
and Driscoll said. Driscoll said she just misses the love of her
life and needs closure.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 13, 1971, the day police stormed the prison,
inmate-executioners marched John D'Arcangelo to the roof of the
prison. Police gunned down some of the hostages along with the
inmates. Reporters recorded video footage of the officer's death,
which his wife said sickens her to see over and over again on news
programs and documentaries about Attica.
</P>
<P>
   ``When John graduated college in the '60s he said he wanted to
leave his mark on the world,'' she said. ``I don't think he meant
he wanted to leave his blood on the walls of Attica.''

GORE FOCUSES ON THE DETAILS HE SAYS MAKE HIM BETTER THAN BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore is no doctor, but he
practically played one on the campaign trail this week.
</P>
<P>
   When an elderly woman showed Gore her prescription for Vioxx, an
anti-inflammatory drug, he nodded knowingly and asked about her
arthritis. When another woman asked the difference between Medicare
and Medicaid, Gore walked her through the bureaucracies, explaining
which one she would qualify for.
</P>
<P>
   It was vintage Gore, minutae-oriented and, at times, dull. But
it was also a window onto the central Democratic strategy these
days: Purposely projecting Gore as a wonk, whose ideas alone
qualify him to be president.
</P>
<P>
   By rattling off details _ many of which voters aren't listening
to or can't understand _ Gore is betting the serious image this
projects will overpower the easygoing manner of Texas Governor
George W. Bush, even at the risk of his appearing boring or failing
to move crowds with soaring rhetoric. And for now it seems to be
working. A Newsweek poll released Friday showed Gore with his first
significant lead of the race, beating Bush, 49 to 39.
</P>
<P>
   The poll numbers, collected before the burst of campaign
activity expected to begin Labor Day, could easily shift once
again. But they reflect just how tight the battle is, and suggest
Bush will need to confront Gore's ``details campaign'' more
directly than he originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what Gore says goes over people's heads, but the
general image of Gore will stick,'' said Larry Sabato, a political
science professor at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it fits in with the subtext that most people already
believe, that here is a man who is boring and dull and unattractive
but who really knows his stuff...and Bush is a nice guy and a great
fella to have a beer with, but does not have the depth that Gore
has,'' he continued. ``It's perfect spin.''
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of the Gore approach is that it suits his character,
and on the surface, appears to be anti-spin, several political
analysts said. By simply ``focusing on issues,'' as Gore says he is
doing, the campaign can claim it is rising above politics or
personality _ and imply that Bush is relying on both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the closer we get to election day, the more
people focus on the issues and ask for specifics,'' Gore told
reporters on board Air Force Two on Thursday night. ``And I think
that's to the advantage of Joe Lieberman and me, because we have
spelled out the specifics and are happy to engage on the substance.
And I think that people are responding to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore took a similar, but more limited, approach during the
Democratic primaries, zeroing in on former Senator Bill Bradley's
health care proposal and claiming it would give poor Medicaid
recipients only $150 a month to buy health insurance. The claim was
not entirely true, but Bradley mounted a feeble defense, and the
health care debate was later seen as a big part of his defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gore is applying the same math to Bush, accusing him of
wanting to squander the federal budget surplus on a tax cut rather
than shoring up Social Security or Medicare (even though Bush has
said he could afford to do all three).
</P>
<P>
   But with Bush, Gore has found an even simpler card to play: That
the Texas governor doesn't have any detailed policies at all.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Gore campaign, Bush is ``unable to win on the
issues'' and has ``failed to provide details'' on any number of
topics. In particular, Gore has attacked Bush repeatedly for not
fully explaining how he would provide a prescription drug coverage
to Medicare recipients _ and attacked him so hard that Bush was
forced to say he would release a more detailed prescription drug
plan this week.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic has confounded Bush campaign officials, who note the
Texas governor has laid out several detailed proposals _ only on
other topics, such as education and military readiness. ``I think
what this is a political strategy to hide the fact that Al Gore has
not offered any new ideas or policy proposals,'' Bush spokesman Dan
Bartlett said. ``This strategy is just that _ a strategy. It's an
excuse to recycle old attacks with a new tag line.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet ever since the first real offensive in the Gore
``details campaign'' _ his convention speech, in which he pledged
to be a serious, if dull, president _ Bush's command over the race
has slipped. After losing his double-digit lead in the polls, Bush
then found himself responding to Gore on the health care issue,
rather than setting the terms of the debate himself.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Bush torn apart Gore's policies in detail. Scott Reed, a
Republican strategist who ran Bob Dole's 1996 campaign, said the
Bush campaign should be hammering Gore with the cost of his
prescription drug plan, which would provide every senior drug
coverage under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand it,'' Reed said, when asked why the Bush
campaign had not gone on the health care policy offensive. ``The
Republicans need to do that to Gore, and that's what the RNC
(Republican National Committee) should be doing in their paid
advertising, taking apart the Gore plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the RNC this week launched a negative personal ad
against Gore, opening Bush up to further criticism that he is
running on personality rather than policy.
</P>
<P>
   That could change this week, when Bush plans to emphasize policy
contrasts between his campaign and Gore's. According to Reed, Gore
will suffer when his proposals are laid out next to Bush's and
scrutinized. Additionally, other analysts said, Bush should have a
natural advantage in his stump speech, which is filled mostly with
lofty rhetoric and generalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detail does not inspire in the same way as soaring rhetoric,''
said Marvin Kalb, Washington director of the Shorenstein Center on
the Press, Politics and Public Policy. ``The tendency of most
candidates is to use soaring rhetoric to inspire a crowd, to rally
the troops, and to escape the need to deal with the details of
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalb said that Gore ``has had a good mix of detail and
rhetoric,'' enough to satisfy policy-wonks and inspire regular
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, his strategy seems to be working,'' he said.
``But it's a fragile mix. It can easily come unhinged. Because it's
still, in my judgment, a very volatile election.''

   MISSILE-DEFENSE (Washington) _ President Clinton says he will
not break ground on a national missile defense system, leaving to
his successor the decision on how, or even whether, to proceed on
the politically charged and diplomatically sensitive issue of
building an anti-missile shield. Clinton acknowledges that the
threat of a long-range missile attack from potentially hostile
countries ``is real and growing'' but says he will not authorize
even initial construction of a still unproven system in light of
test failures and objections from Russia, China and our European
allies. By Eric Schmitt. (Eds.: an early version of this story has

where the all-you-can-eat walleye special goes for $4.99. They work
at factories like the Lender's Bagel plant. So more than a few
eyebrows began arching when a handful of people in this small
central Illinois town suddenly seemed to be sitting pretty. A
former police officer built a house with a six-car garage. A
retired electrician started offering people interest-free loans.
This week, federal law enforcement officials gave foundation to
years of Mattoon gossip. They charged 11 Mattoon residents and
eight other people in a bogus financial investment scheme that,
authorities say, hoodwinked more than 10,000 people around the
world out of more than $12.5 million. By Pam Belluck. (Scheduled to

NEW STATISTICS BOOST MARKET HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three new economic reports provide further evidence that the
Federal Reserve's campaign to slow down the economy by raising
interest rates is taking hold.
</P>
<P>
   In the most widely watched report, the Labor Department said
Friday the nationwide unemployment rate inched higher in August,
from 4 percent to 4.1 percent. A survey of analysts earlier in the
week had predicted the number would hold steady.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said 105,000 jobs were lost during the month,
but attributed them almost entirely to a cutbacks at the US Census
Bureau and a strike by workers at Verizon Communications.
</P>
<P>
   In the other reports, the nation's corporate purchasing managers
said their monthly index of manufacturing strength slipped in
August, and the government said construction spending dropped by
more in July than it had in any single month since January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised short-term interest rates six times since
June of last year in an effort to slow the economy and ward off
rising prices. Some analysts think it may have finally finished the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was genuinely good news,'' Jeff Davis, chief investment
strategist for State Street Global Advisors, said of the reports.
``There's still no saying what the Fed will do, but the picture is
becoming clearer and looking better.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks gained slightly in light trading as investors prepared
for the long Labor Day weekend. The Dow Jones industrial average
rose 23.68 points to close at 11,238.78. The Nasdaq Composite
index, which includes many of the nation's big technology stocks,
rose 27.98 points to close at 4234.33.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, though, said the stock market is likely to remain
hypersensitive to all kinds of economic reports and forecasts in
the months ahead _ at least until the Fed makes its intentions
known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every piece of data that comes down the pipe will continue to
get dissected for hints about where we're going,'' he said. ``A lot
more evidence on the upside is needed before you'll see a true
relief rally.''
</P>
<P>
   Fed policymakers voted last week to hold interest rates at their
current levels, citing evidence that the economy was cooling from
the average 6 percent growth of the last four quarters _ a pace
central bankers worried would lead to increasing inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is decelerating from 6 percent to 3 percent
economic growth,'' said Mark Vitner, an economist at First Union
Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. ``It will take some time for that to
translate into lesser inflation pressure. Don't write off the Fed
yet, but they're probably on hold through the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's reports came on top of previous indicators that
consumer spending grew in the second quarter at the slowest pace in
three years, that home resales slumped in July and that factories
reported the largest-ever drop in new orders in July _ a sign
consumer demand is weakening. Auto sales also have cooled; analysts
estimate last month's sales were 1.8 percent below those of August
1999.

BIG FAT MESS IS CAUSING ERROR MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I would have sent this question by e-mail, but
my system is down for the count. Everything was frozen.
Control-Alt-Delete would not work. Now I'm getting this message
after the system starts: ``ScanDisk encountered a data error while
reading the FAT in Drive C.'' I tried to reinstall Windows 98, but
when it finished loading files and rebooted the system, it froze
again. Is there any fix for this that doesn't require me to
reformat Drive C?
</P>
<P>
   _ Critical Condition
</P>
<P>
   DEAR CRITICAL: Yes, but it involves a very large wooden mallet.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had a better answer for you, but look at the bright
side: All that physical exertion will flood your body with
endorphins, and you'll forget your worries in no time at all. Not
buying it, are you? Oh, well. ...
</P>
<P>
   It's normal for ScanDisk to run after an improper Windows
shutdown, like when you hit the reset button or the power suddenly
goes bye-bye. And you didn't do anything wrong. Sometimes,
computers freeze for no apparent reason, and absolutely the only
way to get things running again is to turn them off. When the beast
starts back up, ScanDisk checks your hard drive and tries to repair
any errors the bad shutdown may have created.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's the way it's supposed to work. Unfortunately, it
looks like you've got some errors in your FAT, the file allocation
table. I often compare it to the table of contents of my
comprehensive journalism textbook from college. After I
accidentally ripped out those pages to mop up a spilled beer, there
was no way I could ever find the chapters on ethics and responsible
reporting, so I just gave up looking. That's what your PC is doing,
although there probably wasn't any beer involved. It can't find all
the files needed to make your computer work.
</P>
<P>
   The FAT is such a mind-bogglingly important file that there's
always a backup copy, just in case the real one gets corrupted. One
of the things ScanDisk tries to do is restore a corrupted FAT from
the backup, assuming it can find the thing and it isn't hammered,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Your last hope might be a better disk-repair program, such as
Disk Doctor, part of Symantec's Norton Utilities suite. I wouldn't
bet the farm on it, though. Maybe you should just think of this
whole episode as a wonderful opportunity to make a completely clean
start with your computer. Not buying that either? I didn't think
so. I must be losing my touch.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I bought a computer from a very close and
trusted friend (mistake). I allowed my wife to use said computer
(mistake). She found all the Web sites my trusted friend and his
spouse visited. How can I completely erase everything, or did I
make the third mistake: buying this unit?
</P>
<P>
   _ The Original Novice
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NOVICE: Mistake? C'mon, guy, this is your chance to
blackmail your friend for years to come. Listen, I told you I
didn't read that ethics chapter.
</P>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another clear signal that the economy is slowing in response
to rising interest rates, the United States' private employers
created only 17,000 new jobs in August, the Labor Department
reported Friday, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.1 percent from
4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The slowing was particularly noticeable in manufacturing, where
79,000 jobs disappeared and the National Association of Purchasing
Management, in a separate report, said that its index of
manufacturing activity had turned negative in August for the first
time in 20 months. With consumer demand weaker, manufacturers
appear to be trimming production.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is clearly cooling down,'' said Gary R. Thayer,
chief economist at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons, a brokerage firm based in
St. Louis. Like many other Wall Street forecasters, he said that
economic growth in the second half of the year would be markedly
slower than in the first half, increasing at an annual rate of 3
percent to 4 percent, instead of the 5 percent of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board, as a result, is unlikely to raise
interest rates again before next year, at the earliest, the
argument on Wall Street being that the Fed's six rate increases
since June 1999 have been enough to slow the economy to a growth
rate that the Fed considers noninflationary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data on the economy have got to be music to the Fed's
ears,'' said Richard Rippe, chief economist at Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The steady slowing in job growth is now unmistakable. While job
creation in the private sector averaged 202,000 a month last year _
and 229,000 a month in the fourth quarter _ that pace has fallen to
162,000 on average this year, and only 90,000 a month since May.
</P>
<P>
   There were other weaknesses evident in the August numbers. Total
job growth, covering government as well as private payrolls, fell
by 105,000, after a decline of 51,000 in July as the Census Bureau
continued to shed workers who had been hired temporarily to count
the population. From a peak of 618,000 in May, the census counters
shrank to 41,000 in August.
</P>
<P>
   All of the nation's workers also put in fewer hours in August
than in any other month this summer or spring, particularly in
manufacturing. The average hourly wage of production workers, who
held roughly 80 percent of the 131.5 million jobs in August, rose a
mild 4 cents, to $13.80 an hour. Over the last 12 months, this wage
has risen only 3.8 percent, despite the tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the rise in the pool of unemployed came mainly from
layoffs, dismissals and new people entering the labor force, rather
than people quitting their jobs confident of finding another in a
strong economy. That had been the tendency last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these statistics indicate that the tight labor market
is beginning to unravel; we clearly remain at full employment or
close to it,'' said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the
Economic Policy Institute. ``But they signal a potential reversal
in trend that deserves to be watched.''
</P>
<P>
   In the private sector, the August number was not quite as weak
as the 17,000 new jobs suggested. If not for the strike at Verizon
and a couple of other companies, private-sector job growth would
have totaled 102,000. While that would have been an improvement,
102,000 is hardly robust, said Thomas Nardone, chief of the
division of labor-force statistics at the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are seeing the job slowdown clearly in construction,
manufacturing and mortgage finance,'' he said, pointing to
industries sensitive to rising short-term interest rates. Adjusted
for inflation, interest rates are now at one of their highest
levels in this decade. In a separate report Friday, the Commerce
Department said that construction spending fell in July for the
fourth consecutive month.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market usually responds with enthusiasm to data
suggesting that the economy is weakening and that the Fed therefore
will not raise interest rates. But the Dow Jones industrial average
rose only 23.68 points Friday, to 11,238.78, and the Nasdaq
composite index was up 27.98 points, to 4,234.33.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Clinton administration greeted the latest employment report
with enthusiasm _ as evidence that Americans are still enjoying ``a
Tiger Woods economy,'' said Alexis Herman, the secretary of labor.
Still, she acknowledged that the economy was slowing. ``We have
gone from spectacular to steady and stable,'' she said in a
telephone interview, acknowledging that ``interest rates are having
some impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The one bright spot in manufacturing was in electronics, a
reflection of the heavy spending on computers and
telecommunications, by both consumers and business. Electronics
manufacturers added 4,000 jobs in August and 42,000 since April
1999, although total manufacturing employment keeps declining.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recent job loss in manufacturing reflects a build-up
in inventories. Companies are apparently cutting production until
these stockpiles of unsold merchandise are worked down.
</P>
<P>
   Employment in retailing fell by 34,000 in August after rising by
132,000 in June and July. Still, job growth in retailing has
averaged only 28,000 a month this year, down from 36,000 in 1999.
Department-store hiring has been particularly weak.
Service-industry employment, in contrast, grew by a robust 160,000
after rising only 11,000 in July. The growth came mainly in job
training, management, engineering and temporary workers.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate, rising from 4.02 percent to 4.14 percent
before rounding, reflected slightly higher unemployment in almost
every group, with unemployment among teen-agers and blacks rising
more than others. Teen-age unemployment rose a percentage point, to
14.4 percent, and the rate among black men and women edged up to 8
percent from 7.7 percent, with black men hurt the most. Their rate
jumped to 7.4 percent from 6.7 percent.

   BOSTON _ The woman rushed up to Dr. Philip Nitschke as if he
were a rock star. ``Your speech was the best,'' she said. ``I'm
going to Australia for the Olympics _ do you have a schedule of
your clinics?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' said Nitschke, billed as ``the first doctor in the

short-lived Australian law, and he described a typical ``clinic:''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone'll come in, put six pills on the table and say, `I've
saved all these tablets. If I take them, will I die?' '' Nitschke
then advises them. ``It's very practical advice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australian doctor was mobbed by fans Friday in the hallway
of the Park Plaza Hotel, scene of the World Conference on Assisted
Dying this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering, sponsored by the Hemlock Society, has drawn fire
from the Massachusetts Catholic Conference, the Massachusetts
Medical Society and the Massachusetts Nurses Association. In
addition, the hundreds of participants are bracing for the arrival
of Not Dead Yet, a group of advocates for the disabled who have
chained themselves to doorways at other assisted-suicide gatherings
and vowed to protest.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, conference-goers were looking inward _ greeting old
friends, stocking up on pamphlets called ``The Art and Science of
Suicide,'' and giving an award to Dr. Pieter Admiraal, a leader of
the physician-assisted suicide movement in the Netherlands who, one
speaker affectionately recalled, kissed one dying patient and said,
``Have a good trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any subculture, the movement has its own heroes (Admiraal),
seminal texts (``Final Exit,'' by Derek Humphry), controversial
figures (Dr. Jack Kevorkian) and lively internal debates between
the radical and the less-radical.
</P>
<P>
   The conference even offers a nightly film festival. Samples
include a rerun of Kevorkian giving a lethal injection to Thomas
Youk on ``60 Minutes''; ``One True Thing,'' based on the Anna
Quindlen book about a young woman who may have helped her
terminally ill mother die; and _ remarkably _ ``Soylent Green,''
the Charton Heston cult classic about a nightmare government that
bakes dead people into crackers and offers suicide on demand.
</P>
<P>
   The conventioneers are not a dour, death-obsessed group, said
Mary Gallnor, president of the World Conference. Rather, she said,
they want to ensure that their loved ones _ and eventually, they
themselves _ die with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Groups such as Not Dead Yet ``don't need to be frightened of
us,'' she said, offering to talk with them about how best to ensure
disabled people's rights in assisted-suicide legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say such legislation _ currently in force only in Oregon
_ makes terminally ill people a separate class, ``candidates for
death,'' said Daniel Avila of the Massachusetts Catholic
Conference, the church's public policy arm. He said death with
dignity is best offered through hospice care.
</P>
<P>
   Hospices traditionally oppose assisted suicide. But one
conference speaker, Douglas Aberg, a Northern California hospice
nurse in his 30s, said they should provide it, so that social
workers and chaplains could stay involved. Currently, he said, some
hospice personnel covertly condone it, but are required to ``stop
short,'' watching patients refuse food and water without offering
drugs to hasten the process.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ramage, 76, a hospice volunteer, disagreed. Although he
supports assisted suicide, he said, it could get hospices into
``all kinds of trouble,'' politically and financially.
</P>
<P>
   A similar debate simmered between people such as Nitschke and
Humphry on one side, both of whom teach suicide techniques to get
around prohibitions, and those who fear those techniques inflame
the public against their main goal _ passing legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Livermore, whose husband heads the Michigan chapter of the
Hemlock Society, said she opposes Kevorkian not only because he is
``bad PR,'' but because he provides no safeguards: he often does
not know his patients and gets no second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In case the law comes too late for her, she grabbed Aberg by the
elbow to verify: ``If you stop eating or drinking, how long does it
take, four to five days?'' Longer, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, Ken Haslam, an intensive-care anesthesiologist
who said he has seen ``technology going crazy,'' bought four how-to
pamphlets for $10 each, including ``Helium and the Exit Bag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gases are my business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Haslam, 66, recently bought his own helium tank from a party
store, for demonstrations, and perhaps someday for his own death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I was having a going-away party,'' he said. ``And by
the way, could I have a dozen balloons?''

 &HT;    CLINTON PASSES ON DECISION ABOUT NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE TO
SUCCESSOR
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leaving a critical national security decision for
his predecessor, President Clinton said Friday he would not deploy
a controversial missile defense system, citing technological
deficiencies and objections from the global community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though the technology for NMD is promising, the system as a
whole is not yet proven,'' Clinton said during a speech centered on
the subject at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   While he stressed that no country can dictate U.S. defense
decisions, Clinton also cited concerns raised by U.S. allies and
objections from Russia and China, nuclear powers that threatened to
beef up their arsenals if the United States built the controversial
weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States can't ignore the potential security
implications of a renewed nuclear race that could threaten the
strategic balance of power or undermine the global arms control
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Testing and development of the missile defense system is to
continue, leaving open the possibility that Clinton's successor
could deploy the complex $25-billion system, a combination of
sophisticated radars and rockets, designed to blast an incoming
missile out of the sky on its way toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee,
released a statement supporting Clinton's decision and saying that,
if elected, he would continue to monitor the system's development
with an eye toward making a deployment decision as the technology
matures.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee who has placed
national missile defense near the center of his security agenda,
pounced on the decision, saying it was further evidence of poor
security stewardship by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush promised to deploy a missile defense system ``at the
earliest possible date,'' if elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton and Vice President Gore first denied the
need for missile defense, then delayed. Now they are leaving this
important unfinished business for the next president,'' Bush said
in a prepared statement. ``I welcome the opportunity to act where
they have failed to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and other proponents say the system is needed to protect
the United States against the threat of a missile attack from a
country such as North Korea, Iraq or Iran _ all of which are
believed to be at work on weapons of mass destruction and the
long-range rocket technology required to launch an intercontinental
attack _ or a rogue state or terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   Should the next president decide to deploy the system, it could
be up and running as early as 2006, said Clinton. That's roughly
one year later than earlier estimates suggested it could be ready
if Clinton ordered construction to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, told
reporters that the administration had not delayed action on the
system, but had spent $5.7 billion, to date, on developing it.
</P>
<P>
   But after only three of 19 planned test firings _ two of which
failed _ and in the face of widespread opposition from abroad,
Clinton said the time was not right to begin building the so-called
national missile defense, or NMD, system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply cannot conclude, with the information I have today,
that we have enough confidence in the technology and the
operational effectiveness of the entire NMD system to move forward
to deployment,'' Clinton said. ``Therefore, I have decided not to
authorize deployment of a national missile defense at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is not abandoning the NMD program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made progress,'' said Clinton, who made his decision
over the past two days after consulting Tuesday with Defense
Secretary William Cohen. ``But we should not move forward until we
have absolute confidence that the system will work.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton stressed the system's technological deficiencies,
he made clear that global resistance to NMD, particularly within
former U.S. Cold War foes Russia and China, played a key role in
his decision.
</P>
<P>
   And, said Clinton, as persistent objections from U.S. allies
made clear, far more diplomacy is required before an NMD system
might be deployed without provoking unpredictable reactions among
U.S. friends and foes around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``No nation can ever have a veto over American security,''
Clinton said. ``But we can never afford to overlook the fact that
the actions and reactions of others in this increasingly
interdependent world do bear on our security.''
</P>
<P>
   In measured rhetoric with Cold War echoes, Clinton warned that
Russia's huge nuclear arsenal, the world's largest, remains
dangerous. The United States, Clinton said, can neither ignore
Moscow's sentiments on arms issues nor risk the unraveling of the
arms control treaties that have formed the basis of two generations
of mutual restraint in the deployment of the most devastating
weapons on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are no longer adversaries, we are not yet real
allies,'' he said. ``Therefore, for them, as well as for us,
maintaining strategic stability increases trust and confidence on
both sides. It reduces the risk of confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving forward with a missile defense system would require that
the United States either amend or withdraw from the Nixon-era Anti
Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty, a cornerstone of the U.S.-Russia
arms control regime.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin has so far rejected NMD, saying
it would tilt the U.S.-Russia balance of power in favor of the
United States, and he has refused to negotiate ABM amendments that
would allow the system to be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States to unilaterally walk away from the ABM
treaty, said Clinton, would be a dangerous breach of U.S.-Russian
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategic stability based on mutual deterrence is still
important, despite the end of the Cold War,'' he said. ``Why?
Because the United States and Russia still have nuclear arsenals
that can devastate each other, and this is still a period of
transition in our relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Putin applauded the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision not to take upon
himself the responsibility for deploying the national anti-missile
defense system is seen in Russia as a well thought-out and
responsible step,'' Putin said in a statement. ``Doubtless (it)
will lead to strengthening strategic stability and security in the
whole world, and will raise the United States' authority in the
eyes of the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also cited concerns about China, which threatened to
expand its nuclear arsenal in response to a U.S. NMD system.
</P>
<P>
   If China were to do that, Clinton said, it could raise tensions
in East Asia, including Japan and Taiwan, and could provoke India,
a long-standing rival of China's, into building additional nuclear
weapons. That, in turn, could prompt India's neighboring nemesis,
Pakistan, to expand its small nuclear arsenal, raising the nuclear
stakes across the already volatile Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement took the issue off the front-burner for
important diplomacy next week, when Clinton participates in the
United Nations Millennium Summit, expected to be the largest
gathering of heads of state in history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to meet privately with Putin, as well as
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and a constellation of other world
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Non-proliferation analysts also heaved a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy the right decision was made,'' said Stephen Young,
deputy director of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers, an
alliance of 17 groups devoted to containing the threat of nuclear
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case for going ahead was very weak,'' said Young, whose
group has expressed concern for months that pressing forward with
NMD could push countries like Russia and China into building new
nuclear weapons to try to compensate for any strategic advantage
the new defense system might give to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia and China weren't kidding,'' Young said. ``This was
going to make them very upset.''

TRIATHLON MAKES OLYMPIC DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Julie Moss captivated a 1982 ``Wide World of
Sports'' audience by literally crawling across the finish line,
America discovered triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered an offbeat training exercise for runners, the
sport that requires the ability to swim, bike and run became a
American phenomenon in the `80s.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, triathlon makes its Olympic debut in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Triathlon participation in the U.S. skyrocketed in the '80s and
USA Triathlon has 21,000 members, 27 percent of whom are women.
That's up from 11 percent nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And in what is believed to be a first in the Olympics, a woman,
Michelle Blessing, will coach the American men and women at Sydney.
There is no record of a female coaching men and women in any
Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Olympic competition isn't as intense as the Iron
Man series that began the triathlon boom, swimming 1.5 kilometers,
biking 40 kilometers and running 10 kilometers is still a major
test of endurance.
</P>
<P>
   And the shorter distances should prove to be quite a test of
brains as well as brawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all fast. It's like starting a marathon,'' said Jennifer
Gutierrez, a Pepperdine graduate and one of the top women's
competitors on the U.S. team. ``The beginning to the end is fast.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gutierrez, getting a good start in the swim portion is
paramount to a successful race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so important to be out of the water first,'' said
Gutierrez, a distance swimmer at Pepperdine. ``There's a huge focus
on swimming, but they're all pretty equal.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategic portion of the race is when the participants get
on the bicycles for the 40-kilometer sprint (24.8 miles). Drafting
is a legal technique in Olympic competition, unlike in amateur
races.
</P>
<P>
   Much as in auto racing, slower riders can draft behind a faster
bike to increase their speed. Using the bike directly ahead also
saves energy when pedaling at full speed.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the cyclists will dismount and take off their helmets,
change into their running shoes and begin the final leg - the
6.2-mile run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be strong in each (event) to be successful,''
Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   While triathlon took off because of the Iron Man events in
Hawaii, Australia is a logical choice to host the first Olympic
competition, given the sport's popularity Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   Australia led the way with four women's medals at the 1998
Goodwill Games. The Sydney course figures to be one of the more
scenic of all the Olympic events.
</P>
<P>
   The competitors will swim through Sydney Harbour, exiting the
water in front of the famous Sydney Opera House.

RUSSIANS SEE CLINTON'S DECISION AS DIPLOMATIC VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MISSILE-DEFENSE and related stories) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As European leaders on Friday applauded President
Clinton's decision to defer building a missile defense shield over
the United States, Russian officials expressed satisfaction that
their diplomatic campaign to galvanize opposition against the
American program had influenced Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   A former Russian ambassador to the United States, Vladimir P.
Lukin, who serves as deputy speaker of Parliament here, called
Clinton's decision predictable and rational and said that Russian
President Vladimir Putin had scored a temporary diplomatic victory.
He cautioned, however, that the contentious international issue
would return early next year.
</P>
<P>
   European officials, caught between America's ambitions for
missile defenses and the strident opposition from Russia and China,
seemed mostly relieved. Across the continent, political leaders
said Clinton's decision removed the issue from American
presidential politics and created needed time for increasingly
complex consultations and debate over missile threats and how to
cope with them.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac, one of the most pointed critics
of the American plan, was the only leader to issue a personal
statement Friday night. He said he had been informed of Clinton's
decision by letter Friday, which he said he received with ``great
interest'' given France's view that the project ``risks undermining
the strategic equilibrium and a return to the nuclear arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   Great Britain and Germany praised Clinton's decision. A
spokesman in Berlin, Bela Anda, said the government of Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder had ``understanding and respect'' for the ``wise
decision,'' adding that Germany's ``reservations about this project
are well known.'' Karsten D. Voigt, who coordinates German-American
affairs in the foreign ministry, said the decision was welcome
because it gave more time for consultations inside the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Foreign Minister Robin Cook said Clinton had ``taken
careful account of the views'' of American ``allies and other
international partners'' in pulling up short on the deployment of
missile defenses, which would violate the Antiballistic Missile
Treaty of 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to continuing dialogue on this subject with
the current'' administration in Washington ``and, in due course,
with its successor, and with our NATO allies and others,'' Cook
said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, the leader who worked hardest this year at undermining
American justification for going ahead with missile defenses, was
conspicuously silent Friday night in the face of what was seen
here, for now, as a diplomatic victory of sorts. Still, Clinton's
decision only puts off until some time next year the potential
confrontation between Moscow and Washington over the future of
long-standing arms control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader leaves Moscow this weekend for visits to
Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has said it will not agree to changes in the 1972 treaty,
and has warned that an American decision to break the treaty would
render all arms control agreements signed between Washington and
Moscow during three decades null and void.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Putin undertook an energetic diplomatic
campaign in Europe and Asia against the American plan to erect a
missile shield over the United States, one that would leave Europe
outside the defensive umbrella and that would perhaps incite China
to build up its nuclear arsenal further, thus triggering further
escalation in the arms race in South Asia between India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader even flew to the North Korean capital,
Pyongyang, and secured an as yet unelaborated promise from Kim Jong
Il, the country's reclusive leader, to give up North Korea's
long-range missile program in return for Western space-launch
assistance for North Korean satellites.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting this proposal to the large industrial nations at a
July summit meeting in Okinawa, Putin sought to refute the American
assertion that North Korea's long-range missile program posed such
an acute threat to the United States that early deployment of
missile defenses was warranted. Moreover, a budding rapprochement
between North and South Korea, whose leaders met this summer for
the first time since the Korean War, further deflated any sense of
imminent danger from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Lukin, the former Russian ambassador to the United States, said
he believed Clinton made his decision based exclusively on domestic
political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Any decision by Clinton would have been reassessed as soon as a
new administration took over anyway, Lukin said, and Clinton did
not want to do anything that would be detrimental to the Democratic
Party, like making compromises with Moscow that would subject Vice
President Al Gore to political attacks during the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate, George W. Bush, has
criticized the Clinton-Gore administration for failing to
strengthen America's defenses, and has said that if he is elected
president, he will proceed with a missile defense system at the
earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was able to capitalize on serious concerns in Europe and
Asia that the United States was creating ``an unequal security
system'' between itself, its NATO allies and other major powers
like Russia and China, Lukin observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has unified everyone against the United States, including
your allies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lukin added that it would be ``unwise for Putin to
celebrate any victory'' over Friday's decision because ``it is only
temporary and is connected with internal politics in the United
States.'' As of January 2001, he said, a new American president
will face substantial political pressure to deploy a missile
defense system, if further testing proves the system viable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The timing of Clinton's announcement may spare him some
criticism from world leaders assembling at the United Nations next
week for a Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   China's president, Jiang Zemin, was said to be preparing to
express Beijing's opposition to the American missile defense plan
during a speech to the leaders, according to a senior diplomat in
the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
   Certain countries are still seeking so-called absolute security
for themselves and are speeding up the development and deployment
of advanced anti-missile systems, a senior Chinese diplomat told
reporters in Beijing on Thursday. Jiang had been expected to assert
that American missile defenses would seriously undermine the
positive trend in international disarmament efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The American defense system poses particularly difficult
decisions for European countries like Great Britain and Denmark,
whose territories might be needed to enhance American radar
capabilities to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles from states
like North Korea, Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a House of Commons foreign affairs committee urged
the government to encourage Washington to address the nuclear
threat from rogue states by means other than the proposed missile
shield, which would not be able to stop a nuclear, chemical or
biological weapon delivered in a suitcase, or on a ship, or other
than by missile. The committee said it was not convinced the plan
represented an appropriate response to potential threats.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on Clinton's announcement, Menzies Campbell, a
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party in Great Britain, said,
``The British government must seize the opportunity provided by
President Clinton's decision to make a robust case against
deployment.''

MEXICO HOLDS TWO GENERALS ACCUSED OF AIDING DRUG CARTEL 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM WEINER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Two generals long suspected of corruption have
been arrested and imprisoned by the military on charges of
collaborating with the Juarez drug cartel, prosecutors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects are Gen. Francisco Quiroz Hermosillo, who retired
in July from the army, and Brig. Gen. Mario Arturo Acosta Chaparro,
a counterinsurgency expert with a reputation for repression who is
on active duty. Their arrests on charges of drug trafficking and
bribery on Thursday, on the eve of President Ernesto Zedillo's
final State of the Union address, were an additional blow to the
reputation of the Mexican armed forces in their role as a narcotics
enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada, who takes office on Dec. 1,
has promised to withdraw the military from the drug war after a
decade in which the drug barons bought off the armed forces as much
as the military fought the traffickers. The constitution bars the
military from any role other than national defense.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption at the highest levels became painfully apparent
in 1997, when Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, appointed by Zedillo as
the first military figure to be the government's drug czar, was
arrested on charges that he had been paid off by Amado Carrillo
Fuentes, who led the Juarez cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Though his U.S. counterpart, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, director
of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, had called Gutierrez
Rebollo ``a man with a reputation for impeccable integrity'' before
his arrest, events proved otherwise. The general is now serving a
71-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   One of the arrested officers, Acosta Chaparro, has long been
identified by Mexican human-rights organizations as involved in the
repression and torture of leftists in the state of Guerrero. Army
and police forces based in Guerrero have spent years battling a
small armed insurgency and a larger civilian movement that is
seeking land rights and political freedom. The general has been a
leader in counterinsurgency operations in the mountains and valleys
there for years, according to several authoritative military
histories.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Virgilia Galeana Garcia, a human rights advocate, gave
eyewitness testimony that placed Acosta Chaparro at the scene of
one of Mexico's worst massacres in recent years. In the killings,
which were videotaped, the state police ambushed, shot and killed
17 rural advocates at a roadblock in Aguas Blancas, not far from
Acapulco, in June 1995. Acosta Chaparro denied involvement in the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Quiroz Hermosillo retired in July as a director of army health
services. He had previously held high rank in the intelligence and
military transport directorates.
</P>
<P>
   The generals were implicated by the testimony of at least three
witnesses who are now under government protection, according to
military prosecutors charged with combatting corruption in the
armed forces. The prosecutors said the witnesses tied the generals
to the Juarez drug cartel organized by Carrillo Fuentes, who died
in 1997. The cartel remains a powerful drug-trafficking group,
Mexican and United States counternarcotics officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not specify when the witnesses first implicated
the generals. But both men have apparently been under suspicion for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Acosta Chaparro's name is in the files of investigators from the
United States and Switzerland who have spent years trying to trace
connections between drug barons and the Mexican political and
military elite, according to court records. Published Mexican
documents, dating from 1997, name him as being suspected of
corruption. Other documents, from the attorney general's office and
dating from 1998, name Quiroz Hermosillo as a suspect. One military
prosecutor, Rafael Macedo de la Concha, said both generals had been
the targets of investigations since at least July 1999.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    MIAMI _ A little more than a year ago, things were looking a bit
bleak for the Panama Canal. Drought restricted the size of the
ships the canal could handle. Shipping lines threatened to skip the
waterway because of a rate increase for passage. And some U.S.
hardliners, fearing the Chinese would take over the gateway,
questioned whether to hand over the canal to its Central American
home country.
 &HT;    Well, the Chinese are coming _ and there could be no better news
for the canal. Even before the U.S. Congress signed the historic
legislation to boost trade with China, shipping lines were crowding
the canal with Far East vessels making their way to the eastern
seaboard of the United States.
 &HT;    ``Without a question, there will be more trade going through the
canal going directly to the East Coast of the United States,'' says
Tony Hupfeld, senior vice president for Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, or
the ``K'' Line, one of the shipping lines increasing its service
through Panama.
 &HT;    There are three ways to get cargo from Asia to the U.S. East
Coast _ the all-water route through Panama, transit via the Suez
canal, or a combination of ocean and rail shipping using the U.S.
West Coast train and port connections. But reduced shipping rates _
in combination with U.S. rail service problems and West Coast labor
unrest _ have made all-water shipping fashionable again. And,
because of the emerging shipping networks and trade flows, the
Panama Canal is the logical logistical choice for ships from China
or the Far East. ``All the major carriers will be going this
route,'' Hupfeld says.
 &HT;    The China Ocean Shipping Company and European stalwart P&AMP;O
Nedlloyd, among other major worldwide shipping lines, are also
increasing or adding Panama Canal service. ``We've been seeing the
interest growing for some time now,'' says Mercedes Morris, a canal
spokeswoman.
 &HT;    The incursion into Panama is fueled by the incessant growth in
U.S. imports of Asian goods, most of which are headed for the
distribution centers of the major retailers like Wal-Mart, K-Mart
and Home Depot, located on the U.S. East Coast. But the question is
how the shipping lines get those goods there. Decades ago, the only
practical way was an all-water route such as the Panama Canal,
which took three to four weeks. Then the U.S. rail companies
developed sophisticated and reliable ``land-bridge'' networks that
made it possible to dock the cargo at the Atlantic seaboard in half
the time. By the late 1990s, the West Coast ports were unloading up
to 85 percent of the Asian imports, no matter what the final
destination.
 &HT;    But, about three years ago, a combination of rail congestion and
railroad merger snafus began holding up eastbound cargo on the West
Coast during peak shipping seasons. West Coast waterfront strikes
and other labor problems slowed the cargo even more. Shippers and
shipping lines griped _ and began looking for alternatives.
 &HT;    They found them on the all-water routes where cargo volume rose
65 percent between 1993 and 1999, to 979,000 20-foot boxes,
according to PIERS, the Port Import-Export Reporting Service of New
York.
 &HT;    At the same time, Asian shipping patterns have changed. It used
to be that shipping lines liked to carry South Asian cargo west
through the Suez Canal to combine with their Mediterranean service.
But now more goods are arriving from China and northern Asia _ and
shippers are finding it easier to take cargo from northern Asia
through the Panama Canal. According to the Port of New York and New
Jersey, overall Far Eastern trade increased nearly 20 percent last
year, while Southeast Asia trade grew by only 11 percent.
 &HT;    ``It all depends on where you call in Asia,'' Hupfeld says.
``For North Asia and Hong Kong, it's better to go through Panama.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SIDEBAR: All Choked up
 &HT;    The extra cargo from Asia going to the U.S. East coast is adding
to delays in the Panama Canal, already backed up by maintenance
work. Capt. Johan Bjorksten, who handles operations and equipment
for Germany-based Hamburg-Sud, one of the major shipping lines
using the canal, reports that his company faces long delays going
through the canal _ even after booking a year in advance and paying
three times the normal passage rate.
 &HT;    While the Panama route may take twice as long, most cargo
traveling this circuit is not time sensitive and can be shipped for
about US$500 per box _ less than half the cost of sending it via
the U.S. West Coast and rail. ``It really is a matter of cheaper
costs,'' Hupfeld says. ``The port labor is cheaper using Panama and
the East Coast, and you don't have to pay the high intermodal
costs.''

CLINTON LEAVES MISSILE SYSTEM DECISION TO SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton abandoned his long-stated goal
Friday to become the US leader who launched a national missile
defense system, leaving the decision to his successor because he
deemed it technologically unproven and potentially dangerous to US
national security interests.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at Georgetown University, Clinton said he had
determined there was an emerging threat that countries such as
North Korea, Iran or Iraq could launch a missile at the United
States in coming years. But he said it was wiser to wait until more
work was done on the national missile defense program.
</P>
<P>
   The work, he said, wasn't just with technological wizards in
laboratories, but also among the world's corridors of power where
savvy diplomats needed to persuade US allies as well as Russia that
building such a defense network was in their best interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not move forward until we have absolute confidence
that the system will work and until we have made every reasonable
diplomatic effort to minimize the cost of deployment and maximize
the benefit not only to America's security, but to the security of
law-abiding nations everywhere,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's consideration of a system _ $5 billion has
been already spent on testing _ had caused almost universal
consternation or worse from heads of state around the world. China,
for instance, had warned of an arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted China's fierce opposition, and said that if the
next president decides to deploy a missile defense system, ``he
will need to avoid stimulating an already dangerous regional
nuclear capability from China to South Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite high-level Clinton administration lobbying efforts,
Russia strongly protested a missile defense system, saying it would
violate the terms of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and
raising the specter of the collapse of several historic arms
control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The issue immediately burst into the US presidential campaign,
with Texas Governor George W. Bush criticizing Clinton, saying,
``The administration missed an opportunity to develop a
missile-defense system that would protect all 50 states, protect
ourselves and our allies from an accidental launch, political
blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in Texarkana, Ark., Bush added, ``Should I be
president, I'll seize the moment and develop an effective
antitballistic missile system.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, supported Clinton's decision,
saying it allows more time to be certain of the technologies, costs
and national security ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, at the end of the day, I would not be prepared to let
Russian opposition to this system stand in the way of its
deployment, if I should conclude that the technologies are mature
enough to deploy and are both affordable and needed,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision settled a rift within his administration that
pitted pro-missile defense Pentagon officials against many of
Clinton's senior advisers in the White House, State Department and
National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen met with Clinton on Tuesday
night at the White House to spell out his support for the system.
Cohen, a Republican from Maine, released a tepid statement on the
issue Friday, carefully not saying that he supported Clinton's
decision but that he supports ``this approach'' of having the next
president fully involved in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen _ the lone GOP member on the Cabinet and of whom National
Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger said in an interview earlier this
summer was the ``best team player'' among senior administration
officials _ also refused White House requests to call members of
Congress Friday informing them of Clinton's decision, according to
a US official. That job fell to Berger and Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright; on national security issues, Cohen is the
administration's preferred liasion because of ties gained from 24
years as US senator and congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and several Pentagon officials supported giving a
conditional go-ahead to the national missile defense system in
order that work begin next spring on concrete pads for a radar
station in Alaska next spring, allowing for a possible 2005
deployment of the system. The Pentagon had already solicited bids
for construction of the site, setting Sept. 7 as the deadline for
cost proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because of Clinton's decision, the earliest deployment
would be 2006 or 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the system applauded the decision, saying it
shouldn't have been a close call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president's decision is the only logical one he
could have made given how poorly the program has performed,'' said
Joseph Cirincione, director of the non-proliferation project at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington
think-tank. ``They've had two successive test failings and they
still don't understand why the last shot failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirincione predicted the decision would seriously set back the
program. ``It's been like a balloon and the president's speech just
let out the air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore A. Postol, an MIT professor of science, technology and
national security policy, returned to Boston Friday from a meeting
at NATO headquarters in Belgium with senior European officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the meeting, there was universal concern about the possible
problems this missile defense system would create,'' Postol said.
``They were all rather concerned about where this could take the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Several European countries reacted positively to Clinton's
decision Friday. Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said
his government ``noted with satisfaction'' the postponement, saying
US and Russian negotiators needed more time to talk about
amendments to the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, said a former US official who was part of high-level
discussions on missile defense, the decision was ``a no-brainer for
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The overriding thing was this guy didn't want to be seen as
the president who broke the ABM treaty,'' the former official said.
``Allies also were pushing very hard not to make this decision yet.
The administration had not done enough spade work to allay their
concerns. Should Russia lash out against this project, you would
want to have the allies standing with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton addressed those points directly in his speech,
especially the impact on the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The president said if the national missile defense system was
deployed, the ABM treaty would have to be adjusted, something
Russia is not willing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the US-Russian relationship, he said, ``While we are
no longer adversaries, we are not yet real allies. Therefore, for
them, as well as for us, maintaining strategic stability increases
trust and confidence on both sides. It reduces the risk of
confrontation.

DEBATE COMMISSION TELLS BUSH IT CAN'T CHANGE SCHEDULE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials of an independent commission that organizes the
presidential debates told aides to Gov. George W. Bush Friday that
they will not revise the locations or schedules for three debates
in October that the Bush campaign has sought to modify.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Brown, executive director of the Commission on
Presidential Debates, said the panel's position was spelled out at
a meeting in Washington with Joe Allpaugh, the Bush campaign
manager, and two other Bush lieutenants involved in debate
preparations. She said that she told the officials that the
arrangements are far too advanced and the job of ensuring network
coverage too complex for the process to be tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed the extensive work that has already been done,''
Brown said. ``And we underscored things like the difficulty of this
fall's television schedule, with the Olympics scheduled for so late
in the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign officials have indicated recently that they are
not happy with some aspects of the debates organized by the
nonpartisan commission, which has been supervising the presidential
debates since 1988. They have said that their objections include
the plan to broadcast all three debates in prime time, and to the
holding of the first debate at the University of Massachusetts in
Boston because the location is adjacent to the John F. Kennedy
Library, an institution commemorating a Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday why he was reluctant to agree to the commission
debates, Bush said, ``I'm looking at the options. You know, it
seems like to me that there will be some really interesting formats
other than what we're told will have to be the format.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's resistance is the sticking point in the October
showdowns. Vice President Al Gore has already agreed to the
commission's proposals; in fact, he has accepted invitations to
more than 50 debates, though his campaign chairman, William Daley,
added the stipulation Friday that Bush must consent to the
commission debates before the other offers would be entertained.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Bush, meanwhile, have been exploring other options,
meeting with officials of broadcast and cable networks this week to
discuss debate formats.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the candidates on Thursday, Tom Johnson, chairman
of CNN, proposed Larry King as the referee of a first debate, to be
produced by his network. ``One could not ask for a fairer, more
balanced, more enthusiastic moderator,'' he wrote. Other networks
have made similar approaches on behalf of their news stars.
</P>
<P>
   King might indeed be the gentle sort of inquisitor that the Bush
camp is seeking. Bush is said to prefer formats in which the
candidates can converse, rather than formally debate, an activity
at which Gore is generally thought to be the more skilled. Mindy
Tucker, a Bush spokeswoman, would say only that CNN's proposal was
``one of the many letters that have come in.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is unlikely that one network would get such a coveted
designation, because Gore, who met Friday in Nashville, Tenn., with
Daley and others advising him on debate preparations, says the
commission's debates are his priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the commission schedule is the best way to conduct
debates, so that they are seen by the most people on free
television,'' said Mark Fabiani, the Gore campaign's communications
director. ``Once the Bush campaign agrees to the commission's
presidential debates, we then would be pleased to consider these
other opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that she told Bush's representatives that the
commission has always been open to employing a variety of formats
for the debates, which are to occur on Oct. 3 in Boston; Oct. 11 in
Winston-Salem, N.C., and on Oct. 17 in St. Louis. She added that
the panel would consider Bush's proposal that a second
vice-presidential debate be added.

<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ As Beijing sees it, the reason China's
diplomatic and trade relations with the United States don't always
go smoothly starts with unfair American press coverage and hostile
politicians in Congress. These forces cause Americans to
misunderstand China's efforts to keep ``the motherland'' unified
and stable, the thinking goes. Still believing in the efficacy of
political propaganda, the Communist Party hopes to change things
with the public relations offensive that is currently bringing
high-level visitors to the United States: Li Peng, leader of the
parliament, and President Jiang Zemin to meetings at the United
Nations and Zhao Qizheng, an information minister, to introduce a
touring show of exhibits, lectures and events about China.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing would like to garner some positive press before the
Senate votes on normal permanent trade relations with China. But
there is a larger ailment that this dose of public relations will
not cure, and that is Beijing's anachronistic but stubborn tendency
to see China's national progress as obstructed by foreign
interference.
</P>
<P>
   After the Opium Wars in the 19th century the West did, in fact,
shamelessly prey on China. Anti-foreignism took root and was
confirmed by the Japanese occupation in World War II. It was
codified during Mao's revolution as Leninist anti-imperialism. In
the fever of today's marketplace such revolutionary ideology has
been muted, but China's leaders continue almost automatically to
export blame for China's less-than-perfect global relations,
obscuring two crucial facts: China is no longer being preyed upon,
and the means to solve many of its key international problems are
actually in the hands of the government itself.
</P>
<P>
   To continue suggesting that ``hostile foreign forces'' are the
problem in hot spots like Taiwan, Tibet and Hong Kong is a curious
abdication of the very sovereign power that Chinese leaders aspire
to protect. And externalizing the cause of problems pre-empts
understanding of how Chinese leaders could and should exercise
initiative at home on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Old notions of sovereignty are changing, and to gain permanent
normal trade status with the United States, coexist successfully in
a changed world and win global respect, China needs to look at new
ways of relieving tensions. Instead of trooping over to New York to
engage in transnational propaganda, its leaders might better serve
their country by staying home and seeking ways to reframe its
relations, on its own, with both its own constituent parts and the
larger world.
</P>
<P>
   Because Chinese economic reform efforts have accomplished so
much and because there is now so much to be lost if an
international flash point ignites, finding solutions becomes ever
more urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Far from losing face, China would gain nothing but world respect
and gratitude if, for example, it could see its way to unilaterally
renouncing the use of force in the Taiwan Straits and evince more
respect for the right of Taiwanese to determine their relationship
to the mainland. It would gain similarly if it could grant Tibetans
a greater quotient of real autonomy and then encourage the Dalai
Lama to return to Lhasa, and if it would permit Hong Kong the
political latitude to elect its leaders in a truly democratic
manner.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that most solutions for what internationally
bedevils China will not be found in New York because what needs
fixing is in Beijing. What China needs is not better global
propaganda, but bold new vision and leadership dedicated to
recasting the way it imagines itself in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the present leadership is imaginative or strong enough
to undertake such a reappraisal is another question. But if talks
could be started with the Dalai Lama or the issue of reunification
with Taiwan could be deferred until China has become more
democratic, China's leaders would have accomplished something to be
truly proud of. Moreover, their world stature would soar and they
would find that myriad other tensions, around issues like trade
arrangements with the United States, would dissolve on their own.

THE REFORM-MINDED VOTERS BUSH CAN'T DO WITHOUT

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that it appears the presidential contest will
be a race to the finish, the battle will be intense for the support
of the most dynamic force in the American electorate, the
independent voter. It is these voters, who are not affiliated with
either major political party, who are behind the tremendous
volatility in the presidential polls over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore has aggressively courted the independents by focusing on
issues in which they have shown an interest _ pledging to fight
special interests and move on campaign finance reform _ as well as
by choosing a maverick Democrat, Joe Lieberman, as his running
mate. George W. Bush, by contrast, has made only modest efforts to
appeal to independents on the reform issues that are dear to them.
To swing these voters his way, he should reconsider his failure to
embrace the reform agenda that made Sen. John McCain a viable
opponent to him in the early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The independents include the Reagan Democrats, the Clinton
Republicans, soccer moms and those who rarely vote, as well as the
Perotistas of 1992 who put a former wrestler in the Minnesota
governor's mansion. There is also the Stewart factor, typified by
the ponytailed office clerk in a television commercial who
instructs a middle-aged boss on how to use the Internet to trade
stocks. Stewart is likely to be fiscally conservative, socially
moderate and turned off to politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
   To win the votes of Stewart and the other independents,
Republicans will need more than campaign aesthetics to show Bush as
a ``different kind of Republican.'' He has rejected the harsh
partisan tone of the House Republicans, but he has failed to
embrace the proposals for reform that have energized independent
voters in the past.
</P>
<P>
   First, Bush should find a way to the separate himself from the
special interests that are anathema to many independents. He cannot
afford to remain as close as he has been in the past to
corporations like those he favored with tax cuts in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A great vulnerability of Gore is the fund-raising scandals,
despite his vow to sign a bill reforming the campaign finance
system. Yet unlimited soft money contributions seem to have become
a Republican sacrament, binding big-business lobbyists and the
religious right. Without taking a 180-degree turn on the issue,
Bush could call for the elimination of all corporate, union and
individual soft money in return for raising limitations on
so-called hard money contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are likely to skewer Bush and the other oilman on
the Republican ticket, Dick Cheney, as the J.R. Ewing dream team.
Cheney's lavish severance package from Halliburton further
reinforces that image. To deflect this attack, the Republicans
should take on corporate welfare as discordant with fiscal
conservative principles. Bush should find a corporate sacred cow to
skewer, perhaps the notorious federal sugar subsidy or innumerable
loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Bush campaign should place more emphasis on debt
reduction rather than a huge tax cut targeted to the most wealthy.
In opinion surveys, independents and followers of Ross Perot have
consistently placed debt retirement before tax cuts. Without
walking away from his tax plan, Bush should reassure voters that he
will move to postpone the cuts in the future if revenues were not
sufficient for tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Bush embodies many of the qualities the largely centrist,
fiscally conservative independents are looking for in a president.
It should not be difficult for him to make the logical moves on
political reform that would secure their support.
</P>

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Six miles south of where I live, in a lovely
pastoral setting known as Coyote Valley, Cisco Systems is busy
transforming almost 700 acres of fields, orchards and streams into
a huge office complex that will eventually house 20,000 of its
employees. Such a facility makes obvious sense. When you
concentrate bright, skilled people in the same proximate space,
they energize one another. And given the intellectual nature of the
work, and the brain pool that it will house, it deserves to be
called, in familiar Silicon Valley language, a ``campus.''
</P>
<P>
   If I worked at Cisco, I would probably have endorsed the idea,
but then I would have crossed my fingers and hoped that no outsider
asked the obvious question: After all the talk about the
sufficiency of virtual experience, what has happened to the wired
utopia we were promised? The on-site office was supposed to be the
first to succumb to the ease of Internet communication. When a
high-tech giant sets this sort of example, it's difficult to
believe in the promise of satisfactory virtual substitutes like
telecommuting, online shopping, online entertainment, and _
something that concerns me greatly as a teacher _ online education.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just Cisco. One of its top rivals, Juniper
Networks, recently announced its own 80-acre Silicon Valley
expansion. Juniper's and Cisco's workers are the computer whizzes
trailblazing our digital future. If they don't function better in
the virtual workplace, then how can they sell it to the rest of us?
</P>
<P>
   Several decades into the Information Age, Silicon Valley
freeways are as clogged as ever. Only moguls get to telecommute,
dialing in occasionally from their yachts. The worker bees continue
to slog to work every morning, as their ancestors did.
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies will continue to build campuses because
they know that the intellectually demanding work they do is best
tackled in groups. If it seems hypocritical for them to promote
something different for the rest of us, just remember who is
selling the gear and tackle to construct that wired virtual campus.

   In the ultimate triumph of family-friendly policies, the
white-shoe law firm Chadbourne &AMP; Parke has converted a spare office
into a nursery for the infant of one of its female partners. Now
this mother can visit her baby and still stay on top of what's in
her in box. According to a firm press release, when it's time for
this mother to feed her baby, she is alerted by an e-mail or a
quiet knock on the door from her nanny. The firm has another female
partner who works from home a couple of days a week and still
another who manages its Moscow office while she is on maternity
leave in Washington, D.C. It is receptive to opening more nurseries
in its offices as the need arises (imagine the sitcom
possibilities).
</P>
<P>
   Corporate policies like this are hardly unusual these days, as
companies struggle to make the work environment more amenable to
the needs of people with families. But are families always best
served by such policies?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, for many parents who can't afford nannies and must
work, on-site day care is a lifesaver. And being able to work from
home while on maternity leave is certainly better than having to
cut short one's time off. But such ``benefits'' have also become
yet another device _ like the pager, cell phone and wireless
Internet access _ that shackles us to work while purporting to set
us free.
</P>
<P>
   We are witnessing the transformation of the workplace into the
home _ complete with kitchen, sleeping rooms and baby nursery _ and
the home into the workplace. Vacations aren't vacations anymore,
and coffee shops have become second offices. We measure our value
as employees by the number of e-mails we receive and how often we
are beeped.
</P>
<P>
   Family-friendly policies are not so friendly when they end up
keeping families apart and intruding on space that was once sacred,
both in the home and in the office. The mother who brings her baby
to work is less likely to go home to have dinner with her husband.
The father who can access his e-mail from home is less likely to
read a book to his children. Let's be honest: Isn't that why
companies institute such policies? They want their employees to be
more productive _ to spend more time working.
</P>
<P>
   Being forced to leave the office at 5 p.m. because your baby is
at home, not working weekends, taking a six-month maternity leave
instead of a three-month leave _ these are good things. By making
work easier, companies are actually making home life harder. They
offer us a path of least resistance and help us avoid the hard
choices we should be making. Work or family? Home or office? We
can't have it all. Nurseries are a nice touch to keep the working
parent at work, but they won't replace the real thing _ ankle
restraints.

WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN ALABAMA FANATIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To most, Alabama football - at least when I was growing up in
the northern part of the state in the '60s, '70s and '80s - was
about Bear Bryant stringing together the filling of what would turn
into 323 win during his marvelous coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   It was also about players who excelled in college football like
Major Oglivie, Steadman Shealy and Johnny Musso. And NFL Hall of
Famers Ozzie Newsome, Lee Roy Jordan, John Hannah, Kenny Stabler
and Joe Namath and some others - like Tony Nathan and Richard Todd
- who went on to solid professional football careers.
</P>
<P>
   It was about linebacker Barry Krauss knocking himself silly
while keeping a Penn State runner out of the end zone in the 1979
Sugar Bowl during one of six national championship seasons under
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   It was about Bryant leaning against the goal post while his team
went through pregame warmups and mumbling his waying through his
television show the following day.
</P>
<P>
   It was about a group of players terrified Bryant would come down
from his tower during practice sessions and the same men refusing
to call him anything but Coach Bryant even after they were long
gone from the university.
</P>
<P>
   It was about a big Alabama home game being held in a stadium
that was more than an hour away from the campus in a place known as
``The Football Capital of the South.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about weddings being scheduled around football season and
children learning to say `Roll Tide' about the same time as `Mama
and Daddy.' It was about a father of an acquaintance of mine
telling his son that sure he could consider going to Auburn but if
he decided to take that route then he might as well pack up all his
belongings because he wasn't welcome at home anymore.
</P>
<P>
   It was about Bryant's death bringing grown men to tears and his
funeral virtually shutting down businesses statewide so people
could line the highwayfrom Tuscaloosa to Birmingham as his body was
taken to its resting place.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I don't really expect everyone to understand what it was it
was to be an Alabama fanatic. And there are plenty who don't know
Major Oglivie from Sargeant Slaughter and think that Steadman
Shealy are the first two names of a law partnership.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with not getting it, because, frankly, for
a long time I rooted against the Tide. For some reason - probably
cause I was friends with a couple of obnoxious Alabama fans - I
rooted for Tennessee and there was a time when I felt Robin Weber
was an American hero.
</P>
<P>
   We'll take a minute for a history lesson to tell those who don't
known who Robin Webber is - which is probably most of you not
educated in Alabama or Notre Dame lore. It was Weber, who was a
tight end at Notre Dame, whose catch and 37-yard gain moved the
Irish out of the shadows of their goal post in the final minutes of
the 1973 Sugar Bowl game. Notre Dame ran out the clock to claim the
national championship with a 24-23 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty safe to say that I was the only kid in my
neighborhood that night happy about the outcome. And, I was also
the only kid who showed up at school wearing a USC t-shirt the day
after the Tide was given a share of the national title with the
Trojans in 1979 even though USC had won a regular season
head-to-head meeting.
</P>
<P>
   What's funny is I didn't really become a full-fledged Alabama
fan until Bryant's career - and it turns out his life - was coming
to a conclusion. And it took a guy named Jim Bunch for me to make
the transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Bunch was an offensive tackle at Alabama from 1976-79, a starter
on Bryant's Bryant's last two national championship teams and an
All- American. He was also a co-worker of mine - although I'm sure
he doesn't remember this - at a steak restaraunt in the spring of
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Now, understand, Alabama football players - particularly
All-Americans - were a pretty big thing around Tuscaloosa. Big
enough, in fact, the the guy interviewing for the position used
Bunch working there as a perk in helping me decide whether to
accept the job.
</P>
<P>
   So I show up for my first day ready to meet an Alabama
All-American offensive lineman, who I figured was going to dwarf
everyone. The first person I saw was a guy no taller than me - I'm
about 6-foot - and didn't appear to be a particularly muscular
fella.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ok,'' I quickly reckoned, ``that's not Jim Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, though, I was wrong. It was Bunch and he had been an
All-American, but he didn't look any different than anyone else,
which was pretty cool.
</P>
<P>
   It got me to thinking that Bryant's teams were filled over the
years with guys like Bunch. Oh sure, he had plenty of talent, but
he also had a knack of choosing some outstanding players who
wouldn't have fit in today's combine-filled world of football. And
he turned his players into winners - which was pretty cool.

THE RUDE EYE OF REBELLION

<P>
   The relationship between ``labor'' and management is much more
complicated than the power struggles that erupt regularly in the
headlines. The Verizon strike is ended. But a painful walkout by
3,000 members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers at Raytheon Co. is simmering and now Bridgestone/Firestone
Inc. is facing a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   These hotspots are the result of gambles taken in the ebb and
flow of politics. They have to do with Democrats and Republicans,
the New Economy and the Old, the images of Big Labor and Big
Business. They are attempts to manipulate the narrative on a grand
scale.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the really intimate workplace dynamics between
managers and those whom they supervise? Few topics are more
interesting to us in our own lives, but these topics are not well
covered in the psychology and political science courses we took in
college, business school curricula, or by the constant flow of
inspirational business books. The best way to get at them may be
fiction. Who has written about corporate competition better than
John Le Carre? Or consider the new novel ``Labor Day'' by Floyd
Kemske.
</P>
<P>
   Kemske is familiar to readers of this column. A jack-of-all-
trades who resides in Pepperell, Mass., he makes a living as a
specialist in direct mail advertising, a sometime trade journalist
and a dot-com entrepreneur. Mainly, however, he is an author.
``Labor Day'' is his fourth ``corporate nightmare,'' another in a
series of entertaining parables of the high-tech corporate world.
Kemske catapults entirely believable characters into slightly
fabulous situations and lets them play out their roles with more
than enough angst and lust to keep the story moving along.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Human Resources,' the turn-around artist at a biotech
copmpany turns out to be the very worst kind of asset-stripper. In
``The Virtual Boss,'' it is self-aware software that runs the
company; the omniscient program forces the hero to make a painful
choice between his woman and access to its own expert systems. And
in ``Lifetime Employment,'' the only way to get ahead is to team up
with other Suits to murder the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor Day'' continues the tradition: a union-buster is called
out of retirement by the very union president who earlier had ended
his career in the course of a cataclysmic organizing campaign. The
old-timer's task is to prevent his former antagonist's 53-member
union staff from affiliating with a competitive union. The
illustration on the cover of ``Labor Day'' is of many hands joined
together at one end of a rope in a game of tug-of-war. Its settings
are Edenic: Jolly Jim's Refresh and Refuel, just off exit 39 in
northern New Jersey; the headquarters of the Federation of Office
Workers in the edge city of Forestdale. Employees respect and trust
the managers; managers are fair, well-informed and egalitarian.
</P>
<P>
   Into these situation step a pair of crafty and unethical
entrepreneurs working in the service of lofty goals: a young union
organizer and the old ``prevention and decertification
consultant.'' They search for the malcontents and the de facto
leaders among their target populations. For a long time they remain
unknown to one another. The old man is reading Shakepeare's ``King
John.'' The young man taunts him with a single line, slightly
abridged, from its story of war between England and France:
``Thread the rude eye of rebellion.'' The old man knows that
Shakepeare really wrote ``Unthread the rude eye...,'' but it
doesn't matter. In the organizing battle, as in the play, the two
sides are too hard to tell apart.
</P>
<P>
   The subtext thoughout is betrayal. Both men target the same
memorable union vice president for their skillful lies _ and both
win and lose her trust. The organizer's mentor turns out to be a
person well-known to the union-buster. The idealistic union
president undergoes a thorough transformation. The nice
philanthropic lady from Philadelphia fires the entire staff of
Jolly Jim's _ and then hires them back with many fewer benefits as
contract workers from Preventive Leasing. The Pinkertons who turn
up to resolve the situation at the union office are packing tear
gas and stun guns.
</P>
<P>
   What Kemske is saying in ``Labor Day'' is that the capacity of
idealists to delude themselves and others is very great on both
sides _ that vanity often trumps solidarity, in the workplace and
in the marriage bed. A metaphor that appears more than any other is
of serial killing _ of businesses, not persons. Joint enterprises
work best when there is cooperation and not just division of labor,
he says; organizing too often takes the form of
(itals)disorganizing(unitals) successful enterprises through the
exploitation of rivalries and jealousies.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, there is no doubt that Kemske believes that
labor's struggles are worth it; that organizing attempts are born
to victory even though they are defeated all the time, or make a
desert often when they are successful. That's the point of
insistent allusions to England's King John in ``Labor Day.'' For
all his tiresome wars with France, it was he who nearly 800 years
ago signed the Magna Carta _ the charter which has permitted the
peaceful threading of the rude eye of rebellion ever since.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent weeknight in August, the commotion at Mr.
Chow belied all conventional thinking about what goes on in New
York during the very end of summer. Presumably, nothing goes on _
and the kind of nothing involving no ones _ because all the
someones are busy doing nothing somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   But here's how the somebody map of Mr. Chow, the eatery on East
57th Street, read that night, a Tuesday: Marin Hopper, Elle's
fashion director, stood at the bar waiting for her table just a
foot or two away from John Cusack, the actor, who was seated in the
restaurant's coveted spot above the main dining room, which meant
that if he cared to (but he probably didn't) he could glance over
at James Truman, Conde Nast's editorial director eating with
Samantha Boardman, the socialite, who in turn could wave to her
sister, Serena, seated a few tables away. Cusack was chatting with
two bodyguards, phone cords sprouting out around their ears, who
were minding a young man who looked an awful lot like Wyclef Jean,
the hip-hop performer. As it turned out, the young man wasn't
Wyclef Jean, &UR;  &LR; but the mistake was an easy one to make since he,
like Puffy Combs, has been eating at Mr. Chow quite a lot this
summer; last week, he showed up twice. (Cusack's dinner companion
soon arrived _ Uma Thurman.)
</P>
<P>
   Michael Chow, owner of the three restaurants that bear his name,
never intended to deliver diced squab to the unremarkable. But for
a good portion of the 1990s it was largely the cachet-deficient who
showed up, not only in New York, but also in the Mr. Chows in Los
Angeles and London. ``There were about five years there when you
could have shot a cannon off in the place and no one would have
heard it,'' said Chris Denton, the maitre d'hotel of the Los
Angeles Mr. Chow.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year or so, though, the Mr. Chow here has re-emerged
as a destination for all subspecies of the moneyed and glamorous,
with dumpling connoisseurs from the suburbs there, too. It's in the
pantheon of Manhattan restaurants whose patrons come less for the
food than to be with their own kind _ like Michael's, for the
publishing crowd, and Swifty's, for ladies of a certain position.
But Mr. Chow attracts two kinds, standing out as the theater of
artifice where the worlds of fashion and hip-hop play out their
fascination with each other every night, even if they don't
actually mingle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an incredible mix,'' remarked Marvet Britto, a
publicity agent and Mr. Chow regular, who represents hip-hop and
sports stars, including Foxy Brown and Latrell Sprewell. ``Damon
Dash is having dinner with Harvey Weinstein,'' she said, referring
to a partner of Roc-A-Fella Records and a co-chairman of Miramax,
respectively. ``And Puffy could be having dinner with Diane Von
Furstenberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chow opened his third restaurant, a sleek art-filled room,
in 1979, five years after he got a branch going in Beverly Hills
and 11 years after he established himself with a London spot in
Knightsbridge that catered to the kind of people who would be
parodied in the Austin Powers films decades later.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Michael Chow moved to Manhattan, Tina Lutz, the
model, jeweler and fashion muse, had already become Mrs. Michael
Chow, thanks in part to an introduction made by the British
designer Zandra Rhodes. Tina Chow brought the fashion crowd to
reign at the new restaurant in New York alongside Andy Warhol,
Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Some artists and dealers
remained loyal to Mr. Chow during the '90s slump, a period when
Chow himself, distracted by his interests in art and film, decided
to pay less attention to the business' operations. Following the
death of Tina Chow from AIDS in 1992, the fashion world moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chow recaptured some of its glitz when the hip-hop
contingent discovered it, following the record producers and
industry executives who have their offices nearby. Most say it took
off about two years ago with a flurry of record release parties.
Steven Stoute, president of Black Music Division at Interscope
Records, gave his 28th birthday party at Mr. Chow about two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Combs was already a frequent diner, and in the spring of last
year, when he started his men's clothing line, Sean John, he took
over all of Mr. Chow for a party. It created a setting in which
people like Kal Ruttenstein, the longtime fashion director at
Bloomingdale's, were sharing chicken skewers with people like Heavy
D.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the Sean John party, Paul Wilmot, the fashion
publicity agent, who represents Combs and who had gone to Mr. Chow
on and off for years, reclaimed his status as a regular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are fabulous places in Chinatown,'' Wilmot
said, ``but you have to look in a Zagat's and you have to tell me
how to get there and the lighting is horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a fortunate thing that the lighting at Mr. Chow is not
horrible, because if the restaurant encourages anything, it
encourages you to look, and if fashion types in sheer, strappy
dresses and hip-hop singers slathered in roped gold and mink share
anything, it is the wish not to go unnoticed. The back wall is
mirrored, and the open staircase leading into the dining area _
surely the subject of more discussion than the dumplings _ ensures
that every entrance has a note of Norma Desmond.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Chow occupies an odd place in the New York dining orbit
because it manages to be unusually pretentious and democratic at
the same time. Mr. Chow is a Chinese restaurant in which it is rare
to escape paying less than $100 a person. In the 1980s, the
restaurant, in an effort to seem even more clublike than it already
was, kept a sign-in book. Menus have never been provided; you are
supposed to know enough to have the green prawns, the crispy beef,
the sauteed string beans.
</P>
<P>
   All that aside, Mr. Chow has become perhaps the only expensive
restaurant south of 96th Street with an obvious racial mix. ``You
don't see it anywhere else,'' said Britto, the publicity agent.

   NEW YORK _ As if they did not want to spend a moment longer in
the sauna-like conditions of the U.S. Open Friday, most of the
prominent seeds eliminated their opponents as quickly as possible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Top-seeded Martina Hingis disposed of Tathiana Garbin in a tidy
37 minutes in her third-round match, 6-1, 6-0, at the National
Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Hingis committed
just five unforced errors to earn a fourth-round confrontation with
11th-seeded Sandrine Testud of France, who defeated Kristie Boogert
of the Netherlands, 6-0, 6-1, in 41 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to have an easy day today,'' Hingis said. ``I'll
go have a massage, just take it easy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After top-seeded Andre Agassi's stunning loss to Arnaud Clement
on Thursday, the Open seemed to undergo a cosmic adjustment back to
the predictable Friday. There were a few minor upsets among the
lower seeds, but most of the players who command attention kept
their court appearances to cameos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Magnus Norman, at No. 3 the top seed remaining in the men's
draw, was a model of efficiency in his 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 pummeling of
Cyril Saulnier in the second round. Norman won the Hamlet Cup in
Long Island the week before the Open and said he felt no additional
pressure as the new favorite here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great this week, even though I haven't played a 100
percent yet,'' he said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One high-profile player to struggle was sixth-seeded Monica
Seles, who took the full three sets to defeat Chanda Rubin, 6-3,
4-6, 6-4. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the deciding set, they traded two service breaks each to
leave Seles with a 5-4 lead on serve. A fatigued Seles closed out
the match with a sizzling forehand winner that clipped the line. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to get into long points,'' Seles said. ``I just
did not feel my legs at all today. It was really strange.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seles will play 15th-seeded Jennifer Capriati in a history-laden
fourth-round encounter. Seles defeated Capriati in an epic
semifinal on her way to her first Open title in 1991 when both were
precocious teenagers. Burnout later claimed Capriati, and a fan
stabbed Seles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Seles knocked out Capriati in the fourth round.
Capriati has a 3-6 record against Seles. Most of their matches have
been blistering exchanges of ground strokes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the type of game that I like,'' Capriati said.
``Unfortunately, I have the game that she likes, too.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Capriati was a 6-2, 6-3 winner of Adriana Gersi in 49 minutes,
making brief comments to the press before walking away to see her
boyfriend, Xavier Malisse, defeat Richard Fromberg, 7-6, 4-6, 6-3,
7-6. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other matches involving high-seeded women, No. 8 Nathalie
Tauziat of France beat Janet Lee of Taiwan, 6-3, 6-2, to set up a
match with No. 9 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, a 7-6, 6-0 winner over
Allison Bradshaw. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, eighth-seeded Alex Corretja of Spain swept
Marc Rosset of Switzerland, 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 and 14th-ranked
Nicolas Kiefer of Germany also required the minimum three sets to
oust Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden, 6-1, 6-4, 6-3.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Todd Martin, unseeded and the 1999 Open runner-up to Agassi,
escaped the steamy conditions with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 win over the
baseline veteran Michael Chang. Martin had lost to Chang in five of
six previous matches. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the match gone on, it would have gotten more difficult,''
Martin said. ``I was really on my game. It only helped me and it
hurt Michael.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Moya topped Slava Dosedel, 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a minor upset on the women's side, Magui Serna of Spain beat
13th-seeded Amanda Coetzer of South Africa, 7-5, 7-6 (3).

BUMPER CROP FROM THE MIDDLE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 3) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of these days, or years, advocates of small-capitalization
stocks will be right. One day, the market will again recognize _
and reward _ them as fast-growing companies.
</P>
<P>
   But not just yet. For the time being, advocates of small-cap
stocks must be satisfied that investors are at least starting to
look down the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   Both big-cap and small-cap indexes have had single-digit gains
this year. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 is up 3.5 percent; the Russell
2000 has risen 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But stocks in the middle, the midcaps, have been standouts. So
far this year, the S&AMP;P 400 Midcap index is up 23.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bartlett, a senior vice president and manager of the $2.3
billion Oppenheimer MidCap, a growth fund, recently discussed those
stocks in the middle. Following are excerpts from the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Midcap stocks, which by your definition have a market
capitalization of $2 billion to $12 billion, have been rather
overlooked for the last few years. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. Historically, midcap companies were lost stepchildren. The
main selling point for the group appeared to be as a
diversification tool. That was a hard sell, and rightly so, because
a mixture of large- and small-cap investments effectively did the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   We do not invest in midcaps for diversification. We think the
real opportunity for investing in midcap companies is that you have
a population of companies with revenue and earnings growth rates
that are very similar to smaller companies, but with proven
managements, and which can go through very extended growth phases.
That is the goal and objective of midcap investing.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why are midcaps doing so well now?
</P>
<P>
   A. They were good performers in 1999 as well. Liquidity plays an
important role. When growth was available in large-cap stocks, as
it was in 1997, 1998 and last year, there was very little reason
for growth managers to migrate down the capitalization spectrum in
search of growth. And managers are finding a lot of growth in the
midcap arena.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What characteristics do you look for?
</P>
<P>
   A. We are pure bottom-up growth investors who focus on
exceptionally strong revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue growth is the most sustainable source of earnings
growth. And revenue growth is also the best way to measure, monitor
and evaluate the health of a company. Also, I am not going to sell
a stock just because it reaches some level of market
capitalization. That decision is based entirely on the operating
characteristics of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 70 percent of the MidCap fund is in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue growth for the companies we are invested in is in excess
of 80 percent. The composite earnings growth rate is about 35
percent. And the average price-to-earnings ratio is 54.
</P>
<P>
   That price-to-earnings ratio is more than double what the S&AMP;P
500's is, but the earnings growth rate of the S&AMP;P 500 is roughly 10
percent. So earnings of companies in our portfolio are growing 3.5
times that rate.
</P>
<P>
   Q. For the last year or so, the Federal Reserve has been raising
interest rates to slow the economy. If growth slows, will that have
an adverse effect on your portfolio?
</P>
<P>
   A. A slow-growth economy is a favorable climate for growth
investing over all. That is because if you view growth as a
commodity, when the economy is robust, growth is plentiful, and
many companies have it. It's when growth becomes scarce that
companies that can exhibit strong revenue and earnings growth get
higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   I might add that since we take our cues from the companies we
are analyzing and meeting with, right now we are not seeing any
reason not to be optimistic. We make our decisions based on what is
going on at the companies, not on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You said technology is a big chunk of your portfolio. Which
areas there do you favor?
</P>
<P>
   A. Almost half our technology holdings are in optical components
or networking. JDS Uniphase, which is no longer a midcap stock, is
one of my largest holdings. We also own stocks like Juniper
Networks, Broadcom, Veritas and Ciena. We also own Corvis, which
within the past month was priced as a small cap stock but traded to
a midcap the first day it was public.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which other sectors do you like?
</P>
<P>
   A. We have some exposure in retailing. &QL; 
Tiffany, a company with exceptional growth characteristics, is a
favorite. And we like Radio Shack.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you own any Internet stocks?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not any pure Internet companies. But we do own a tremendous
amount of Internet infrastructure companies like Exodus
Communications. And we have selective positions in contract
manufacturers like Flextronics, Jabil and Celestica. Of those, only
Jabil is still a midcap company.

   Bruce Bartlett, a senior vice president and manager of the $2.3
billion Oppenheimer MidCap, a growth fund, recently discussed those
stocks in the middle. Following are excerpts from the
conversation: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Midcap stocks, which by your definition have a market
capitalization of $2 billion to $12 billion, have been rather
overlooked for the last few years. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. Historically, midcap companies were lost stepchildren. The
main selling point for the group appeared to be as a
diversification tool. That was a hard sell, and rightly so, because
a mixture of large- and small-cap investments effectively did the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   We do not invest in midcaps for diversification. We think the
real opportunity for investing in midcap companies is that you have
a population of companies with revenue and earnings growth rates
that are very similar to smaller companies, but with proven
managements, and which can go through very extended growth phases.
That is the goal and objective of midcap investing.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why are midcaps doing so well now?
</P>
<P>
   A. They were good performers in 1999 as well. Liquidity plays an
important role. When growth was available in large-cap stocks, as
it was in 1997, 1998 and last year, there was very little reason
for growth managers to migrate down the capitalization spectrum in
search of growth. And managers are finding a lot of growth in the
midcap arena.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What characteristics do you look for?
</P>
<P>
   A. We are pure bottom-up growth investors who focus on
exceptionally strong revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue growth is the most sustainable source of earnings
growth. And revenue growth is also the best way to measure, monitor
and evaluate the health of a company. Also, I am not going to sell
a stock just because it reaches some level of market
capitalization. That decision is based entirely on the operating
characteristics of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 70 percent of the MidCap fund is in technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue growth for the companies we are invested in is in excess
of 80 percent. The composite earnings growth rate is about 35
percent. And the average price-to-earnings ratio is 54.
</P>
<P>
   That price-to-earnings ratio is more than double what the S&AMP;P
500's is, but the earnings growth rate of the S&AMP;P 500 is roughly 10
percent. So earnings of companies in our portfolio are growing 3.5
times that rate.
</P>
<P>
   Q. For the last year or so, the Federal Reserve has been raising
interest rates to slow the economy. If growth slows, will that have
an adverse effect on your portfolio? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A slow-growth economy is a favorable climate for growth
investing over all. That is because if you view growth as a
commodity, when the economy is robust, growth is plentiful, and
many companies have it. It's when growth becomes scarce that
companies that can exhibit strong revenue and earnings growth get
higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   I might add that since we take our cues from the companies we
are analyzing and meeting with, right now we are not seeing any
reason not to be optimistic. We make our decisions based on what is
going on at the companies, not on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You said technology is a big chunk of your portfolio. Which
areas there do you favor? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Almost half our technology holdings are in optical components
or networking. JDS Uniphase, which is no longer a midcap stock, is
one of my largest holdings. We also own stocks like Juniper
Networks, Broadcom, Veritas and Ciena. We also own Corvis, which
within the past month was priced as a small cap stock but traded to
a midcap the first day it was public.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which other sectors do you like? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We have some exposure in retailing. &QL; 
Tiffany, a company with exceptional growth characteristics, is a
favorite. And we like Radio Shack.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you own any Internet stocks? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Not any pure Internet companies. But we do own a tremendous
amount of Internet infrastructure companies like Exodus
Communications. And we have selective positions in contract
manufacturers like Flextronics, Jabil and Celestica. Of those, only
Jabil is still a midcap company.  &QL;

 &HT;    CLINTON PASSES ON DECISION ABOUT NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE TO
SUCCESSOR
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leaving a critical national security decision for
his successor, President Clinton said Friday he would not deploy a
controversial missile defense system, citing technological
deficiencies and objections from the global community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though the technology for NMD is promising, the system as a
whole is not yet proven,'' Clinton said during a speech centered on
the subject at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   While he stressed that no country can dictate U.S. defense
decisions, Clinton also cited concerns raised by U.S. allies and
objections from Russia and China, nuclear powers that threatened to
beef up their arsenals if the United States built the controversial
weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   He said the United States can't ignore the potential security
implications of a renewed nuclear race that could threaten the
strategic balance of power or undermine the global arms control
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Testing and development of the missile defense system is to
continue, leaving open the possibility that Clinton's successor
could deploy the complex $25-billion system, a combination of
sophisticated radars and rockets, designed to blast an incoming
missile out of the sky on its way toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee,
released a statement supporting Clinton's decision and saying that,
if elected, he would continue to monitor the system's development
with an eye toward making a deployment decision as the technology
matures.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee who has placed
national missile defense near the center of his security agenda,
pounced on the decision, saying it was further evidence of poor
security stewardship by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush promised to deploy a missile defense system ``at the
earliest possible date,'' if elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton and Vice President Gore first denied the
need for missile defense, then delayed. Now they are leaving this
important unfinished business for the next president,'' Bush said
in a prepared statement. ``I welcome the opportunity to act where
they have failed to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and other proponents say the system is needed to protect
the United States against the threat of a missile attack from a
country such as North Korea, Iraq or Iran _ all of which are
believed to be at work on weapons of mass destruction and the
long-range rocket technology required to launch an intercontinental
attack _ or a rogue state or terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   Should the next president decide to deploy the system, it could
be up and running as early as 2006, said Clinton. That's roughly
one year later than earlier estimates suggested it could be ready
if Clinton ordered construction to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, told
reporters that the administration had not delayed action on the
system, but had spent $5.7 billion, to date, on developing it.
</P>
<P>
   But after only three of 19 planned test firings _ two of which
failed _ and in the face of widespread opposition from abroad,
Clinton said the time was not right to begin building the so-called
national missile defense, or NMD, system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply cannot conclude, with the information I have today,
that we have enough confidence in the technology and the
operational effectiveness of the entire NMD system to move forward
to deployment,'' Clinton said. ``Therefore, I have decided not to
authorize deployment of a national missile defense at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is not abandoning the NMD program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made progress,'' said Clinton, who made his decision
over the past two days after consulting Tuesday with Defense
Secretary William Cohen. ``But we should not move forward until we
have absolute confidence that the system will work.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton stressed the system's technological deficiencies,
he made clear that global resistance to NMD, particularly within
former U.S. Cold War foes Russia and China, played a key role in
his decision.
</P>
<P>
   And, said Clinton, as persistent objections from U.S. allies
made clear, far more diplomacy is required before an NMD system
might be deployed without provoking unpredictable reactions among
U.S. friends and foes around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``No nation can ever have a veto over American security,''
Clinton said. ``But we can never afford to overlook the fact that
the actions and reactions of others in this increasingly
interdependent world do bear on our security.''
</P>
<P>
   In measured rhetoric with Cold War echoes, Clinton warned that
Russia's huge nuclear arsenal, the world's largest, remains
dangerous. The United States, Clinton said, can neither ignore
Moscow's sentiments on arms issues nor risk the unraveling of the
arms control treaties that have formed the basis of two generations
of mutual restraint in the deployment of the most devastating
weapons on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are no longer adversaries, we are not yet real
allies,'' he said. ``Therefore, for them, as well as for us,
maintaining strategic stability increases trust and confidence on
both sides. It reduces the risk of confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving forward with a missile defense system would require that
the United States either amend or withdraw from the Nixon-era Anti
Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty, a cornerstone of the U.S.-Russia
arms control regime.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin has so far rejected NMD, saying
it would tilt the U.S.-Russia balance of power in favor of the
United States, and he has refused to negotiate ABM amendments that
would allow the system to be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States to unilaterally walk away from the ABM
treaty, said Clinton, would be a dangerous breach of U.S.-Russian
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategic stability based on mutual deterrence is still
important, despite the end of the Cold War,'' he said. ``Why?
Because the United States and Russia still have nuclear arsenals
that can devastate each other, and this is still a period of
transition in our relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Putin applauded the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision not to take upon
himself the responsibility for deploying the national anti-missile
defense system is seen in Russia as a well thought-out and
responsible step,'' Putin said in a statement. ``Doubtless (it)
will lead to strengthening strategic stability and security in the
whole world, and will raise the United States' authority in the
eyes of the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also cited concerns about China, which threatened to
expand its nuclear arsenal in response to a U.S. NMD system.
</P>
<P>
   If China were to do that, Clinton said, it could raise tensions
in East Asia, including Japan and Taiwan, and could provoke India,
a long-standing rival of China's, into building additional nuclear
weapons. That, in turn, could prompt India's neighboring nemesis,
Pakistan, to expand its small nuclear arsenal, raising the nuclear
stakes across the already volatile Indian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's announcement took the issue off the front-burner for
important diplomacy next week, when Clinton participates in the
United Nations Millennium Summit, expected to be the largest
gathering of heads of state in history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to meet privately with Putin, as well as
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and a constellation of other world
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Non-proliferation analysts also heaved a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy the right decision was made,'' said Stephen Young,
deputy director of the Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers, an
alliance of 17 groups devoted to containing the threat of nuclear
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case for going ahead was very weak,'' said Young, whose
group has expressed concern for months that pressing forward with
NMD could push countries like Russia and China into building new
nuclear weapons to try to compensate for any strategic advantage
the new defense system might give to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia and China weren't kidding,'' Young said. ``This was
going to make them very upset.''

 &HT;    MEXICAN GENERALS ARRESTED ON SUSPECTED DRUG TIES
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In another scandal to hit Mexico's military, two
Army generals _ one active, one retired _ have been taken into
military custody on suspicions they colluded with the notorious
Juarez-based drug-smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Francisco Quiroz Hermosillo and Gen. Mario Arturo Acosta
Chaparro were arrested Thursday in response to a two-year ongoing
investigation, the military announced Thursday night. Some human
rights activists have accused both generals before of participating
in the violent squelching of leftist rebels in Mexico's Guerrero
state and elsewhere in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very lamentable, difficult situation. But we will
see it through to its final consequences,'' Military Attorney
General Rafael de la Concha was quoted saying in Reforma newspaper
when he announced the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The detentions are reminiscent of the embarrassing arrest in
1997 of Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo _ President Ernesto Zedillo's
anti-drug czar _ who is now serving a 71-year prison sentence for
protecting the Juarez cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Because of police corruption, President Zedillo elevated the
duties of the Mexican military in the interdiction of narcotics and
investigations into smugglers. In spite of scandal, the Mexican
military has improved its ability to intercept shipments of cocaine
from South America and eradicate fields of poppies used to make
heroin, according to Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the U.S. Director of
National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   But many Mexican political figures believe the military's
integrity has been compromised by its anti-drug work and exposed it
to corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican president-elect Vicente Fox has suggested he will review
the role of the military and may curtail its involvement in the war
on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The military provided few details about the careers of the two
generals under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Humberto Toledo, a commentator on national security, said
Acosta is a one-star general who directs an Army section that
oversees fitness of troops. Quiroz directed military transport
until 1998 and was the head of social welfare for the Army until he
retired in June, Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the military said the generals had been
implicated in trafficking by protected witnesses interviewed by
civilian Justice Department officials in 1998. The generals were
arrested in the wake of additional testimony from a witness under
protection in the United States as well as others in Mexico, the
statement said.

CLINTON LEAVES MISSILE SYSTEM DECISION TO SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton abandoned his long-stated goal
Friday to become the US leader who launched a national missile
defense system, leaving the decision to his successor because he
deemed it technologically unproven and potentially dangerous to US
national security interests.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at Georgetown University, Clinton said he had
determined there was an emerging threat that countries such as
North Korea, Iran or Iraq could launch a missile at the United
States in coming years. But he said it was wiser to wait until more
work was done on the national missile defense program.
</P>
<P>
   The work, he said, wasn't just with technological wizards in
laboratories, but also among the world's corridors of power where
savvy diplomats needed to persuade US allies as well as Russia that
building such a defense network was in their best interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not move forward until we have absolute confidence
that the system will work and until we have made every reasonable
diplomatic effort to minimize the cost of deployment and maximize
the benefit not only to America's security, but to the security of
law-abiding nations everywhere,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's consideration of a system _ $5 billion has
been already spent on testing _ had caused almost universal
consternation or worse from heads of state around the world. China,
for instance, had warned of an arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted China's fierce opposition, and said that if the
next president decides to deploy a missile defense system, ``he
will need to avoid stimulating an already dangerous regional
nuclear capability from China to South Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite high-level Clinton administration lobbying efforts,
Russia strongly protested a missile defense system, saying it would
violate the terms of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and
raising the specter of the collapse of several historic arms
control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The issue immediately burst into the US presidential campaign,
with Texas Governor George W. Bush criticizing Clinton, saying,
``The administration missed an opportunity to develop a
missile-defense system that would protect all 50 states, protect
ourselves and our allies from an accidental launch, political
blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in Texarkana, Ark., Bush added, ``Should I be
president, I'll seize the moment and develop an effective
antitballistic missile system.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, supported Clinton's decision,
saying it allows more time to be certain of the technologies, costs
and national security ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, at the end of the day, I would not be prepared to let
Russian opposition to this system stand in the way of its
deployment, if I should conclude that the technologies are mature
enough to deploy and are both affordable and needed,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision settled a rift within his administration that
pitted pro-missile defense Pentagon officials against many of
Clinton's senior advisers in the White House, State Department and
National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen met with Clinton on Tuesday
night at the White House to spell out his support for the system.
Cohen, a Republican from Maine, released a tepid statement on the
issue Friday, carefully not saying that he supported Clinton's
decision but that he supports ``this approach'' of having the next
president fully involved in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen _ the lone GOP member on the Cabinet and of whom National
Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger said in an interview earlier this
summer was the ``best team player'' among senior administration
officials _ also refused White House requests to call members of
Congress Friday informing them of Clinton's decision, according to
a US official. That job fell to Berger and Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright; on national security issues, Cohen is the
administration's preferred liasion because of ties gained from 24
years as US senator and congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and several Pentagon officials supported giving a
conditional go-ahead to the national missile defense system in
order that work begin next spring on concrete pads for a radar
station in Alaska next spring, allowing for a possible 2005
deployment of the system. The Pentagon had already solicited bids
for construction of the site, setting Sept. 7 as the deadline for
cost proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because of Clinton's decision, the earliest deployment
would be 2006 or 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the system applauded the decision, saying it
shouldn't have been a close call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president's decision is the only logical one he
could have made given how poorly the program has performed,'' said
Joseph Cirincione, director of the non-proliferation project at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington
think-tank. ``They've had two successive test failings and they
still don't understand why the last shot failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirincione predicted the decision would seriously set back the
program. ``It's been like a balloon and the president's speech just
let out the air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore A. Postol, an MIT professor of science, technology and
national security policy, returned to Boston Friday from a meeting
at NATO headquarters in Belgium with senior European officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the meeting, there was universal concern about the possible
problems this missile defense system would create,'' Postol said.
``They were all rather concerned about where this could take the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Several European countries reacted positively to Clinton's
decision Friday. Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said
his government ``noted with satisfaction'' the postponement, saying
US and Russian negotiators needed more time to talk about
amendments to the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, said a former US official who was part of high-level
discussions on missile defense, the decision was ``a no-brainer for
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The overriding thing was this guy didn't want to be seen as
the president who broke the ABM treaty,'' the former official said.
``Allies also were pushing very hard not to make this decision yet.
The administration had not done enough spade work to allay their
concerns. Should Russia lash out against this project, you would
want to have the allies standing with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton addressed those points directly in his speech,
especially the impact on the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The president said if the national missile defense system was
deployed, the ABM treaty would have to be adjusted, something
Russia is not willing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the US-Russian relationship, he said, ``While we are
no longer adversaries, we are not yet real allies. Therefore, for
them, as well as for us, maintaining strategic stability increases
trust and confidence on both sides. It reduces the risk of
confrontation.

INVESTING WITH: EDWARD WHITE OF GW&AMP;K EQUITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 3) 
 By CAROLE GOULD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward White is passionate about his golf game. ``Hitting a tiny
ball one-eighth of a mile and having it land where you want takes
incredible skill,'' White said. With a handicap of 12, he is no
Tiger Woods. ``If I weren't so busy managing money,'' he said of
his time-consuming job running the $91.7 million GW&AMP;K Equity fund,
``I could get it down to a 4 or 5.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has certainly beaten par for his investors. The fund
returned 27.37 percent a year, on average, for the three years
through Aug. 31, according to Morningstar Inc., putting it in first
place in its peer group of large value funds, which returned 9.68
percent on average.
</P>
<P>
   White, 56, uses a bottom-up investment strategy, and balances
the fund's big blue-chip companies with lesser-known, smaller
companies with market capitalizations of $250 million to $1.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is less efficient with companies that aren't in the
radar scope of most Wall Street analysts, because their market caps
or revenues are too small,'' White said from his Boston office,
which overlooks the Charles River. ``That's where we find future
all-stars when they're still draft choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Although classified as a large value fund, GW&AMP; K combines value
plays, defined as attractive businesses that sell at discounted
price-to-earnings or price-to-book multiples to the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500, with growth companies, those with rising earnings or
sales. And it holds both large and small companies.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity in styles, sectors and company sizes helps the
odds that the fund will perform well in all types of markets, White
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett, Welsh &AMP; Kotler, the fund's sponsor, manages $3.7
billion, primarily for wealthy individuals. The fund was created in
1996 from a limited partnership the company started in 1991 to
invest clients' annual gifts to their children, grandchildren or
others. In June, it added two more funds: GW&AMP;K Small-Cap Growth and
Large-Cap Growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the Equity fund, White starts by screening the nation's
roughly 10,000 publicly traded companies for those with revenue
growth of at least 10 percent a year and above-average and rising
profit margins in their industry. That whittles his universe to
about 500 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Then he works with four analysts to review company fundamentals
and to pick the fund's 50 or so stocks. His main goal is to
understand why a company is growing consistently and whether it can
keep doing so.
</P>
<P>
   One key is analysis of a company's product. What is its
competitive position? Is its edge based on superior service?
Design? Technology? Or is the company just lucky? To get answers,
White talks to customers, competitors and analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Company management is also important, especially among smaller
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigger companies like Merck and Pepsi-Cola have deep
management teams, and they're constantly quizzed by analysts,'' he
said. ``In the small-cap world, those checks and balances are
missing.''
</P>
<P>
   He examines how companies reflect two modern themes:
Productivity enhancements of the technology revolution, and
transfer of wealth to baby boomers as their parents age.
</P>
<P>
   Technology accounts for the largest percentage of the fund, at
28.4 percent of assets, but White says, ``I've never bought a
dot-com stock.'' He prefers companies that provide Internet
infrastructure, like semiconductor, data storage and fiber optics
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps a sharp eye on prices. While he generally wants a
company to have a price-to-earnings ratio no higher than its
earnings growth rate, he may pay up to twice that rate for a
business that is growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   White buys stocks with the goal of holding them at least five
years, but he may sell if profit margins stop expanding or because
of deteriorating company or industry fundamentals. The turnover
rate is a relatively low 30 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   White likes Equity Office Properties, a real estate investment
trust in Chicago that owns and operates Class A office space
nationwide, mainly in Boston, Washington, New York and San
Francisco, where demand is particularly strong. He bought shares in
June, when its price fell to $24.28 because of rising interest
rates. He got a close-up view of its operations when it bought the
Boston building where he works; he learned, for example, that
management offered tenants good deals from telephone, Internet and
other service providers. In 1999, the REIT's revenue rose 15.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The stock now trades at $29.00, or 10.2 times his 2001 earnings
projection of $2.85 a share. His 12-month price target for the
stock is $36.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is Techne Corp., a science and biotechnology
company in Minneapolis. Techne makes cytokines, blood substances
that help regulate the immune system, he said. It markets them to
biotechnology and drug companies for research, drug development and
drug delivery systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has tremendous potential to help find better drugs and
better ways to get them to the right part of the body,'' he said,
praising the chief executive, Thomas Oland, as a ``deeply committed
scientist.'' The company's revenue grew 35.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   He bought shares in February at about $75.25. They now trade at
$101.88, or 82.2 times his estimated earnings of $1.24 a share for
the year ending in June 2001. His 12-month price target is $180.
</P>
<P>
   He also likes AES Corp., an independent power producer based in
Arlington, Va. He bought shares in 1991 at about $4.50 after
federal deregulation of the power industry.
</P>
<P>
   AES builds relatively small power plants in developing
communities and for isolated manufacturing or commercial
facilities. White likes the company's management, adding that
environmental safety was among its primary concerns. Revenue grew
35.7 percent in 1999. The shares are now at $67.00, or 45 times his
projected 2001 earnings of $1.49 a share.

CLINTON CHOSE FRIENDLY PLACE FOR MISSILE-DEFENSE ANNOUNCEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MISSILE-DEFENSE and related stories) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a well-known member of Georgetown University's
class of 1968, President Clinton has proudly shown his allegiance
to the school during the last eight years, speaking on campus 12
times.
</P>
<P>
   As governor of Arkansas, he spoke on campus four times. He also
appeared on campus the day before his inauguration in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
   So this week, when Clinton and his advisers needed a comfortable
environment to make a major announcement on the future of the
national missile defense program, there was one safe bet.
</P>
<P>
   The president decided on the site during his flight from
Cartagena, Colombia, to Washington on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A White House aide said that Clinton had considered speaking
before one of the many foreign policy organizations here, but was
worried that news of the event might leak to the media. The
president was confident, the aide said, that Georgetown would keep
the engagement quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The president has found Gaston Hall, a large lecture hall with
stained glass windows and vaulting supports, to be a perfect
auditorium: cozy, dignified and easy to fill with a friendly
audience. The auditorium is in leafy Healy Circle, an area on the
front side of campus where students often congregate.
</P>
<P>
   He has taken on serious topics at Gaston Hall, including the
world AIDS crisis, social security reform and youth violence.
Clinton also spoke at the memorial service for Lane Kirkland,
president of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to 1995, at the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, before nearly 800 people, including many students and
faculty, Clinton recalled his early days on campus, where he was
elected president of his freshman and sophomore classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 35 years ago when, as a sophomore, I was in charge of
the freshmen orientation,'' Clinton said. ``So I thought I should
come and help this year's orientation of freshmen get off to a good
start.''

JUDGE AWARDS CONNECTICUT COMPANY $1 MILLION IN MICROSOFT LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to expand and update earlier version.) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Questioning the truthfulness of statements made by Microsoft's
chairman, Bill Gates, a federal judge has awarded $1 million in
punitive damages to a small Connecticut company that brought an
antitrust suit against Microsoft..
</P>
<P>
   The ruling late Thursday in Bridgeport, Conn., was hailed as a
vindication by the plaintiff, Bristol Technologies. Bristol was the
developer of a ``software bridge'' intended to ease the creation of
programs that could run on both the Unix operating system and
Microsoft's industrial-strength counterpart, Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   The company accused Microsoft of an unfair effort to change the
terms of their business relationship after Windows NT gained a
foothold in the market and Microsoft lost its incentive to foster
the use of Unix.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999, a jury found that Microsoft committed a deceptive
act that violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, but
rejected the rest of Bristol's case. And rather than the hundreds
of millions of dollars in damages that Bristol sought, it awarded
the company just $1. Microsoft executives at the time hailed the
jury's finding and minimal fine as a validation of the company's
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Janet C. Hall, who was permitted to award punitive
damages under last year's verdict, ruled Thursday that the
deceptive conduct in which Microsoft had engaged ``rises to the
level of reckless and wanton indifference to the harm it caused
Bristol and others.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she noted that a $1 million penalty against a
company like Microsoft, with $14.5 billion in revenue last year,
would be unlikely to deter it in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Connecticut ruling is another legal problem for
Microsoft, which is appealing the landmark antitrust case brought
by the Justice Department and 19 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given Microsoft's resources, this is an extraordinarily
light-handed sanction,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the
George Washington University law school. ``But it is something that
Microsoft must continue to watch. It's conceivable that the state
courts will pay close attention to her findings.'' Microsoft faces
a number of class-action suits by consumers in the wake of the
federal antitrust decision in April.
</P>
<P>
   Hall specified that the decision in the Justice Department case
was not relevant to the issues at the heart of the Bristol case.
But she was critical of Microsoft's business practices, asserting
that Gates gave an intentionally false statement during a 1996
speech in which he assured other software companies and customers
that Microsoft would continue to provide its latest products for
conversion to Unix programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stripped from the veil of Microsoft's protestations that it
merely engaged in highly competitive behavior,'' she wrote,
Microsoft's deceptive statements ``are, at their core, like a
classic bait-and-switch tactic'' against independent software
vendors, developers and ``Unix users whom Microsoft sought to
convert to Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, Bristol said that when renegotiating the contract
for its link-up software, Microsoft did offer Bristol a new
license, but charged four times the previous price and granted far
less access to Microsoft technology.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials said Friday that the company planned to
appeal the judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Bristol, a small software company based in
Danbury, Conn., said that based on the Bridgeport ruling, the
company planned to ask for a new trial. ``This is a vindication
that we were right,'' said Jean Blackwell, Bristol's vice president
for sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Bristol lawyer said Microsoft might find itself
in a more difficult position in a European Commission antitrust
investigation into the company's business practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling is a brief to the European Commission,'' said the
lawyer, Patrick Lynch. ``It involves exactly the area where they
have focused their investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol entered into a contract with Microsoft between 1994 and
1997 under which Microsoft was to provide Bristol with access to
the programmers' instructions for an early version of Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   But as Microsoft's power in that marketplace began to grow, the
company had less interest in letting companies like Bristol develop
products that would ease the integration between Windows and Unix,
which had gained an earlier foothold.
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling Thursday, the judge cited a 1994 open letter by a
Microsoft manager stating the company's commitment to make its
application program interfaces ``universally available'' for Unix
computer systems. Application program interfaces are the keys to an
operating system that enable programmers to make their software run
efficiently.

<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Late at night, when he hoped nobody was looking, Ong
Chin Guan said, he scouted the scene and hid an old wooden drawer
in the bushes. He had already told his boss he would not be coming
to work Friday. And he had whispered his plans to a few trusted
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, all my friends kept a distance from me,'' said
Ong, 38, who drives a bus for a living. ``They didn't call me the
whole week. Most of my friends, they were afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ong was undaunted. When the sun came up Friday morning, he
pulled his old drawer from the bushes, placed it squarely in the
center of Hong Lim Park, climbed up onto it and began to speak.
</P>
<P>
   His subject was the declining birthrate in Singapore, but that
didn't really matter, even to Ong. What mattered was that _
trembling a little and smiling nervously _ he had become one of the
first citizens of Singapore to speak out legally in public without
a permit.
</P>
<P>
   All day long, as the sun grew hot, then faded again on the other
side of the tiny park, more men climbed onto stools, benches and
plastic milk crates to speak their minds and inaugurate Singapore's
new experiment in free speech: Speakers' Corner.
</P>
<P>
   Some spoke about the issues of the day as small clumps of people
listened: high government salaries, low birthrates, immigration _
and free speech. Some shared with the public their personal
grievances: a contract dispute, a delayed pension payment, an
irritating son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   All knew they were making history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came because I feel proud to be a Singaporean,'' said Ong,
who described himself as ``just a man in the street, a Tom, Dick
and Harry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really opening up,'' he said. ``We are globalizing. And
now we are one of the few countries in the world to have a
Speakers' Corner. Do you have a Speakers' Corner in America?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, though its name suggests the Speakers Corner in London's
Hyde Park, there may not be another public forum quite like the one
in Singapore. From now on, it is to be open every day from 7 a.m.
to 7 p.m., but only to people who show their identification cards
and register first with the police. Their names are posted on the
police station wall and will remain on file for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers are not to use megaphones or microphones or musical
instruments _ though they are free to bring their own boxes to
stand on _ and they are not to touch on sensitive issues of race,
language or religion.
</P>
<P>
   And they must watch what they say. Speakers here will be
subject, just like everybody else, to the Internal Security Act,
under which they can be jailed without trial as threats to national
security, and to the laws against libel and slander that have been
vigorously employed in Singapore to harass and bankrupt opposition
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ong and his timorous friends, speakers here must also
combat one of the strongest weapons Singapore uses to keep its
people quiet: self-censorship.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll conducted last month by the Chinese-language newspaper
Lianhe Zaobao, 9 out of 10 people said that if they disagreed with
any government policies they would not say so in public. One-third
said they wouldn't even tell their family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends see the opposition politicians prosecuted and they
are afraid,'' Ong said. ``After I come here maybe they will say,
`Wow, you can speak and nothing happened to you!'''
</P>
<P>
   Free speech is a difficult issue for Singapore, a tiny,
multi-ethnic city-state of 4 million people that sees itself as a
sort of gravity-defying bumble bee _ surviving and succeeding
through sheer force of effort and inventiveness.
</P>
<P>
   To muffle any ethnic conflicts and build its resource-poor
economy, it has chosen the path of tight government controls on
just about everything, from financial investment to artistic
expression to chewing gum, which is forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of these controls are laws and regulations that
include censorship of film, television, publications, music and the
arts. Access to the Internet is controlled and home television
satellite antennas are banned.
</P>
<P>
   The government controls the only television network and the only
newspaper publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   And if Ong had wanted to speak out in public before Friday _ or
if he wished to speak Friday in any place other than Hong Lim Park
_ he would need a special, hard-to-get permit from the police.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an opposition politician, Chee Soon Juan, was jailed
twice for speaking in public without a permit. Among the things he
said: ``It's time to break the atmosphere of fear, to say it's all
right to criticize the government, to hold it accountable for its
actions.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the divide between the government and its critics is
not a wide one in Singapore. Even dissidents like Chee acknowledge
that the ruling party is responsible for the nation's success and
prosperity and seek only careful, incremental changes.
</P>
<P>
   And even the country's rulers _ who hold 81 of the 83 seats in
Parliament _ acknowledge that Singapore must loosen up and lighten
up in order to stay on the crest of an ever-faster-moving and more
flexible economic future.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in their Singaporean way, they are trying to mandate
(and calibrate) free speech, artistic expression, creativity and
risk-taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next decade, we need to think and act like
revolutionaries,'' said Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in his
National Day speech last month. ``We have to change national and
individual mindsets and attune them to a very different future.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE; OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The future will not be kind to people and nations that play
safe, as Singapore has come to do, he said. The nation and its
leaders will need a change of mindset every bit as daunting as the
one Ong had to undergo when he dragged his wooden drawer out of the
bushes and climbed onto it this morning to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of those who acknowledge the need for more free
expression _ like Singapore's creator, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
_ find it a bit distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, crazy artistes or crazy painters or playwrights who
write trash and pretend that it's art _ we'll just have to put up
with it,'' he said not long ago.
</P>
<P>
   And the authorities will have to put up with Bellamy Cai, 54, a
graphic designer, who stood on a stool at Speakers' Corner Friday,
waved the morning's newspaper and declared, ``What they do in
parliament, they never fight for the bloody issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Antonio Rio, 67, a former prison guard unhappy with his
pension who complained: ``I wrote to the prime minister in June but
no reply! No reply! No courtesy at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Richard Kwek, also 67, a taxi driver, who offered what
sounded like his usual monologue about government misdeeds for free
Friday _ no meter ticking _ and asserted, ``Taxi drivers are 70
percent against the government.''
</P>
<P>
   They will have to contend, too, with a new generation of
political activists who are already working for more openness. One
of these is James Gomez, 35, who recently self-published _ and got
away with it _ a slim book called ``Self Censorship: Singapore's
Shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez arrived Friday at Speakers' Corner as the shadows were
lengthening in the late afternoon, bringing with him several even
younger idealists who are helping him create an on-line discussion
network called Think Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we celebrate Speakers' Corner as a psychological
lightening of the restrictions on free speech, let's keep it in
perspective,'' Gomez said. ``What we need is more opposition in
parliament, a repeal of restrictions on free speech, more
independent institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, he said, he was happy to accept any opening
the government provides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's come here and exercise our right to free speech,'' he
said, ``and get over our fear of public speaking.''

STOCKS AND BONDS RISE SLIGHTLY AFTER LATEST REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock and bond prices rose only slightly Friday, even
after new reports indicated that the economy was slowing enough to
preclude another interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve
Board in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said that new jobs, excluding laid-off
census workers and strikers, were created at a much slower pace in
August and that there was a small rise in the unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Purchasing Management reported a
decline in its factory index.
</P>
<P>
   More important, these reports came on top of other economic data
and warnings of lower profits and slower revenue growth from some
retailers and technology companies that all reflect a slowing
economy. Based on some of this earlier data, Federal Reserve
policy-makers had already decided to leave their benchmark
short-term interest rate unchanged at 6.5 percent when they met a
week and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   While some analysts still disagree, it seems that many investors
now think that the Fed has finished raising interest rates in its
effort to slow economic growth and curb inflationary pressure. This
is the feeling despite the Fed policy-makers having said after
their last meeting that they were still worried about inflationary
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The new data, said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at
Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore, ``just highlighted the idea
that the Fed is out of the market as a factor for the foreseeable
future.''
</P>
<P>
   But because both the stock and the bond markets have rallied as
this view formed over the last few weeks, the reaction on Friday
was muted.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of July, the Nasdaq composite index had climbed
11.7 percent before trading Friday, while the Dow Jones industrial
average rose 6.6 percent and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
increased 6.1 percent. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year
Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction from the
price, had already dropped to 5.72 percent on Thursday from just
above 6 percent at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the bond market closed early for the Labor Day
weekend, and many were watching stocks from the beach _ also
contributing to the muted response. Volume on the New York Stock
Exchange was 768.45 million shares, well below the year's average
of about a billion shares a day. ``You would have expected to have
seen some profit-taking after a good month and a long weekend ahead
of you,'' Cripps said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, which performed best of the major indexes, rose
27.98 points Friday, or 0.67 percent, to 4,234.33. The Dow
industrials climbed 23.68 points, or 0.21 percent, to 11,238.78,
and the S&AMP;P 500 rose 3.09 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,520.77. All
three indexes gave up much of the gains they had made early in the
day. Market breadth was positive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the S&AMP;P is now just under seven points from its all-time
high and the Dow is 484 points below its record. The Nasdaq, which
had suffered most from the technology sell-off earlier this year,
has rebounded somewhat and needs to add a further 814 points to
match its record. For the year, the Nasdaq is now up 4.06 percent,
while the S&AMP;P 500 has climbed 3.51 percent. The Dow is still off
2.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 5.68
percent from 5.72 percent on Thursday _ its lowest since July 1999.
The price rose 10/32, to 100 18/32.
</P>
<P>
   Some technology and oil stocks led the market higher Friday.
Hewlett-Packard rose $4.25, to $125.25, while Texaco climbed 71
cents to $52.21. The telecommunications company Global Crossing
jumped by $5.06, to $35.13, after it raised its sales forecast for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Some financial stocks finished lower, led by J.P. Morgan, down
$7.50 to $159.69. Viant, a Web-site designer, plunged by $5.69, to
$8.19, after reporting that it expects a third-quarter loss because
companies are reassessing their Internet strategies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After excluding the layoff of temporary census workers and those
on strike against Verizon, nonfarm payrolls rose by 140,000 in
August, well below the 222,000 average for the first seven months
of the year. There was a surprising drop of 79,000 manufacturing
jobs, while construction employment remained flat. The unemployment
rate inched up to 4.1 percent from 4.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that
its factory index dropped to 49.5 in August from 51.8 in July.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Berner, the chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, said the data ``has a soft tone to it'' and this indicated
that third-quarter growth was going to be slower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   But he maintained that ``by and large the economy is doing quite
well, despite these numbers.'' And he was not ready to declare that
the Federal Reserve has finished raising interest rates, in part
because of inflationary effects from the sharp rise in energy
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Cripps also warned that if the economy continued to slow,
corporate earnings would become a concern for investors. The first
two quarters of this year have seen extraordinary earnings growth,
of over 20 percent. But ``earnings numbers are going to decelerate
along with the economy,'' Cripps said. ``This fact hasn't hit the
broad market as yet. But it could if the slowdown continues.''

WILLIAMS MIGHT REGRET ALCANTARA MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Red Sox have had a lot of things go wrong this year, but the
worst could turn out to be Jimy Williams stuffing Izzy Alcantara in
the closet for seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Alcantara returned to the scene of his embarrassment Friday
night after ripping the cover off the ball in Pawtucket, while
almost everyone in the Boston lineup was floundering. How ironic
was it that on Wednesday night in Tampa, when the Red Sox were
being humbled by Albie Lopez (a four-hitter), Izzy was knocking
them dizzy with a winning homer for the Pawsox, his 29th home run
of the season in just 299 at-bats. That's one home run for every 10
at-bats. At that pace, if he didn't sit for seven weeks in Boston
while Williams ignored him, Izzy would be on a pace to hit more
than 50 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is the present Red Sox team can't hit and here
you have a guy who can help them sitting in the minors because he
upset the manager when he loafed in a game in Chicago. When he
first came up, general manager Dan Duquette talked to Williams
about the move. Williams agreed with it, saying the club needed
more hitting. However, Duquette told Williams Izzy was out of
options and that he would have to stay in Boston. Duquette did not
want to put Alcantara on waivers and risk losing him to another
team. He said at the time that Izzy had value and he was right.
This is why he wasn't shipped back to Pawtucket when Williams got
mad at him. Instead, he sat for seven weeks until the Red Sox could
send him back with a ``medical rehabilitation'' designation that
protected him until they could bring him back Friday when the
rosters could be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   If the Red Sox miss the playoffs by a game or two, they'll have
to look back at that handling of Alcantara, who can certainly hit
better than several players currently in their lineup.
</P>
<P>

   The vote is unanimous for Indianapolis. The four rival AFC East
coaches pick the Colts as the team to beat in the division this
year, while Jim Mora thinks the Buffalo Bills could be the best
team in the AFC. ``I said at the end of last season that Buffalo
was the best team in the AFC and I meant it,'' said Mora, the
Colts' head coach. ``And I think they will be one of the best teams
in the league again this year. If they hadn't lost that crazy
playoff game in Tennessee, I think they would have gone on to the
Super Bowl. Buffalo has a dominating defense, a good offensive
line, solid running backs, and a good quarterback situation. I
don't think the guys they lost (Andre Reed, Thurman Thomas, and
Bruce Smith) will hurt them. They'll have some other guys ready to
step in and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots coach Bill Belichick thinks that Indianapolis first,
and Buffalo next, have to be considered favorites in the division.
``Those are the two teams that have continuity,'' he said. ``The
Colts won it. They have the same (running) back and the same
players. Buffalo hasn't changed much. The rest of us, here, Miami,
and the Jets, all have new coaching staffs and are in transition.
No one knows what will happen until we start playing. But you have
to like Indy's chances going into the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Groh, Jets: ``The Colts should be favored. They have
tremendous firepower on offense. They have the confidence of
winning it last year and playing sound football the whole season.
It seems, in recent years, a team gets close, misses, and then
comes back even stronger the next year. Buffalo still is strong.
They've made a lot of (roster) changes and have a lot of young
players, but they will be tough to beat. I like our team here. We
should be good on offense, right from the start. How well we do
will depend on how we play defense in the early part of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade Phillips, Buffalo: ``No doubt the Colts are the team to
beat. They won it last year and have the same team back. But I
think we can give them a run for their money. If (quarterback) Rob
Johnson can play the way he did in preseason and play the way we
feel he can, we will be very good. I'm optimistic about our team.
Something like 40 percent of the players on the roster are either
first- or second-year players, but we have a good group of starters
and a winning tradition up here that will help us. I think we'll be
very good on defense and our offense should be better than it has
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he doesn't expect Doug Flutie to be able to play
for another month. ``We have three games and then a bye week. I
think Doug will be back after the bye week. There's no sense in
rushing him. He hurt (his groin) pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie tore the muscle away from the bone and this type of
injury is not corrected by surgery, so Flutie will have to wait
until it heals on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Wannstedt, Miami: ``The Colts have such a great offense you
have to like them. In our division, the strength of every other
team looks like it will be on defense. Buffalo, Patriots, us, are
all better on defense. We've got seven new guys in our offensive
lineup this year so it could take us a while to get going. Injuries
will be a key. All any team has to do, no matter how good they are,
is get a couple of key injuries and that changes the whole
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora says the balance of power has definitely swung to the AFC
and the numbers back him up. ``The AFC is the dominant of the two.
The better teams are over here,'' he said. ``This is the second
year in a row everyone in our division went through the preseason
without a losing record. We're the only division that has done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the '99 season, the AFC beat the NFC in head-to-head
games by a wide margin, plus 17, and added to the trend by whipping
them, 37-14, this preseason.

   He's almost 40 going on 25. Ray Bourque, who has the look of
someone 15 years younger, is preparing to head for Colorado and
what he feels could be ``the'' year with the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very excited about this season because I think we can go
all the way,'' he said. ``It's not one of these situations where
you go into a season and you think, `Well, if we overachieve, we
might have a real good season. This team (Colorado) has the talent
to win the Cup. We just have to play to that talent. So it's
exciting for me to think about that, and get started into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, one of the best-conditioned athletes in any sport, is
giving it everything he has to prepare for the season. In recent
years, he has used Mike Boyle's workout program during the summers.
This year, he is using Boyle, formerly of Boston University, one of
the most respected athletic trainers in this part of the country.
``Ray is unique,'' said Boyle. ``He is in here at 8:30 in the
morning and he wants to do everything a kid 20 years younger than
him can do. There is nothing he won't do. Even at his age, he is
preparing himself to play 30 minutes a game in the National Hockey
League. When he comes to the gym, he never acts like a superstar.
He is always quiet, polite, he doesn't want to be treated any
differently than anyone else. Even after he goes through a real
difficult program in the morning with us, I know he works out again
in the evening at home, riding a bike or doing some cardiovascular
work.'' Bourque still intends to make his home in the Boston area
when he is finished playing, but will take his two sons with him to
Colorado for this season.

   When Donna Harris-Lewis put out the story that she lost more
than $2 million in her first failed trial against Dr. Gilbert
Mudge, we said it was bogus _ and it was. Now comes Bogus II. After
failing for a second time to win a lawsuit against Mudge, whom she
claims was responsible for her husband's death, her attorneys now
claim in papers filed in court that she lost $1.5 million the
second go-round. That's also bogus. Harris-Lewis, who received more
than $12 million from insurance companies after her husband Reggie,
a former Celtics star, dropped dead of a heart attack, must think
people are going to feel sorry for her when they are not. You could
put the expenses of both trials together and they wouldn't come to
$1 million. Both lawyers, Robert Hartley of New York in the first
trial and Neil Rossman of Boston in the second, worked on a
contingency basis. When she didn't win, they didn't win. The court
stenographers walked away with more money than her lawyers, who
both put on great trials. They just didn't win. Harris-Lewis fouled
it up twice herself. Both times she reportedly had the chance to
settle for more than a million dollars and gambled on winning the
bigger bucks. She lost. Now she is at it again, trying to get
permission to put the matter before an Appeals Court, even though
Rossman told her there was nothing to appeal. This is when she went
looking for a third set of lawyers. It would be great to see the
judge who is going to hold the initial hearing ask her to bring in
her financial records to show how she spent all this money on legal
fees.

   Fred Edelstein said in his pro football letter this week that
Drew Bledsoe may be traded to the Seattle Seahawks next year. It's
not going to happen. Edelstein, who is tight with Bledsoe's agent,
Leigh Steinberg, paints this scenario: Bledsoe has just two years
left on his contract and he carries a big salary-cap number ($8.8
million this year and $9.3 million next year), which would lead the
Patriots to trading him. However, as long as Bob Kraft owns the
team, Bledsoe will be with the Patriots. Steinberg is trying to use
the media to leverage a new deal. He tried to work out a new
contract with the Patriots and he wanted too much money. Kraft will
wait it out, and if he can't make what he feels is a reasonable new
deal for Bledsoe, then he will designate him as the ``franchise''
player, which will keep him with the team after this contract
expires.

   Observers of the Pawtucket club can't understand why the Sox
didn't call for Sang Lee earlier. Lee was 5-2 at Pawtucket, struck
out 71 batters in 96 innings, and was untouchable in August with a
0.59 ERA for the month. And he's a lefthander.

ON PRO FOOTBALL: MILLER ASIDE, A WILD YEAR IN THE NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This little tidbit comes from the comedian Dennis Miller, who as
the new analyst for ``Monday Night Football'' has gotten more press
than Al Gore. It definitely falls under the category of too much
information. When asked what's the biggest thing he has learned
since getting his new gig, Miller responded, ``I learned that when
I have to take a whiz, I have to go in a thermos jug.''
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, Dennis. Even my new puppy can hold it for a couple of
hours. Can't you break away from the game during one of those
fifteen television timeouts?
</P>
<P>
   When Miller _ someone who has never played the game, never
coached it, never covered it and can't even figure out a way to
work in a potty break during a measly three-hour telecast _ is one
of the biggest stories of the upcoming NFL year, the season is
either going to be very boring or very interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to your trusty football expert _ it will be the latter.
This might be one of the most exhilarating seasons ever, better
than last year, when the Rams became the first team in league
history to go from last in its division to Super Bowl champion.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 season begins on Sunday, and never has the sport been
so wide open. Any team can win, and an abundance of good stories
are circulating like a Miller joke on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, the best pickup for the Rams was Trung Canidate,
who will spell running back Marshall Faulk. The rookie with the
election-sounding name will end up being one of the defending
champions' most valuable players.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Eagles strongly believe they are a playoff
team. They're right.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos think they will win the AFC West. They're
right.
</P>
<P>
   The Carolina Panthers feel the NFC West can be stolen from the
Rams. They're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson and Terrell Davis, two stars coming off knee
injuries, will each gain more than 1,300 yards. Edgerrin James in
Indianapolis will get 1,500. Stephen Davis in Washington will have
1,800.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins owner Daniel Snyder will explode by Week 5, and coach
Norv Turner will be on the Dallas sideline by next season. Wide
receiver Keyshawn Johnson will be lobbying the Buccaneers' brass to
trade for Jets backup thrower Ray Lucas by the first week of
October.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville's Tom Coughlin will win nine games this year, quit,
and then coach Notre Dame for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets will start 0-2 and then make the playoffs. Despite
their denials, quarterback Vinny Testaverde and Jets coach Al Groh
have already gotten into at least one argument. That's a fact. Bill
Parcells will coach again, probably in Miami. That's a fantasy _
for Dolphins fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' Ron Dayne is privately miffed at fan and media
reaction over his slow preseason start. Tiki Barber will be the
team's offensive MVP. Michael Strahan will have 12 sacks. Kerry
Collins will throw only eight interceptions and coach Jim Fassel
will get a two-year contract extension after making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Ravens' Ray Lewis, who didn't have a pleasant
off-season, will lead all linebackers in tackles, sacks, and
interceptions, and be named the league's defensive MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Plummer remains bitter with Bill Walsh for calling him the
next Joe Montana, saying it is a weight on his shoulders he did not
need or want. Peyton Manning is the next Montana, and Ryan Leaf is
still a dud.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo linebacker Sam Cowart is the best player no one has ever
heard of.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens win the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And what would an NFL season be without a few players in trouble
with the law? Oakland signed Andre Rison this week, despite the
fact the wide receiver faces legal problems in four states. They
include allegedly writing $158,000 in bad checks to a jewelry store
in Missouri, giving police a fake name after a bar fight in
Wisconsin, owing $34,000 in child support to a son which might lead
to garnished wages in California, and a trial on felony charges
that he took $1,000 in recording equipment from a Kansas music
store. One more state and Rison would qualify for frequent flyer
miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a beautiful father, and I've got a beautiful life,'' he
said. ``I'm not saying I'm a saint. I'm not saying I'm perfect. And
I'm not saying I'm wrong. But I am a Raider.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen to that.
</P>
<P>
   This is going to be a good season.
</P>
<P>
   So this weekend when heading for that friend's house to grill,
to the parking lot to tailgate, brace yourself for what will be a
fascinating year, and remember to pack the thermos jugs. Just make
sure they're empty first.

IN A SMALL TOWN, WADS OF CASH, THEN GOSSIP, LEAD TO FRAUD
INDICTMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAM BELLUCK with JO THOMAS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MATTOON, Ill. _ Money has never put in much of an appearance in
Mattoon.
</P>
<P>
   Folks eat in places like Gill's diner, circa 1940, where the
all-you-can-eat walleye special (two sides included) goes for
$4.99. They work at factories like the Lender's Bagel plant,
sponsor of the annual Bagelfest, the town's biggest event.
</P>
<P>
   So more than a few eyebrows began arching when a handful of
people in this small central Illinois town suddenly seemed to be
sitting pretty. A deputy sheriff wound up with a new boat, a
Harley-Davidson and lots of antique cars. A struggling construction
contractor purchased dozens of shiny new trucks in the blink of an
eye.
</P>
<P>
   A retired electrician started offering people interest-free
loans to build nice houses and start new businesses: the sparkly
Bluebird Diner, Our Own Original Bakery, Jimmy John's Sandwich
Shop, Billy Block's Pre School and Day Care, Auctions Buy Us.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, word has it, the post office handled a package so
full of cash that it actually burst at the seams.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people start buying property with cash, opening
businesses with cash, when they have only a job that pays minimum
wage, well then, you start to wonder,'' said Mayor Wanda Ferguson,
a 65-year-old former donut shop worker.
</P>
<P>
   This week, federal law enforcement officials gave foundation to
years of Mattoon gossip. They charged 11 Mattoon residents and
eight other people in a bogus financial investment scheme that,
authorities say, hoodwinked more than 10,000 people around the
world out of more than $12.5 million. Most of those charged in
Mattoon were longtime residents, the deputy sheriff, the former
police officer, a minister, a lawyer and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors describe it in a 91-page indictment, the scheme
was orchestrated by a 66-year-old retired electrician in Mattoon
named Clyde D. Hood, who started a sham investment fund in 1994,
representing himself as an international banker who had worked for
several Fortune 500 companies. (In court on Thursday, Hood said he
could not remember the names of the Fortune 500 companies but
thought they were in ``the New York area or the Florida area,
probably.'')
</P>
<P>
   The fund, called Omega Trust and Trading, promised a 50-to-1
return on each investment and couched its campaign in Christian
terms, with phrases like ``keep the Lord's warehouse full.''
</P>
<P>
   Money flowed in from people in all 50 states and countries
including China and Australia, prosecutors said, with some
investors following quizzical instructions to wrap their cash
contributions in tin foil.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars in cash wound up in Mattoon, prosecutors
say, where Hood began to launder it by setting up businesses with
acquaintances in Mattoon or giving them interest-free loans to
build upscale homes or buy expensive cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you feel bad, like I worked all my life and I'm
driving this old truck,'' said Joe Utley, 56, a custodian at
Washington Elementary School, who like many in Mattoon, started
hearing about the fountain of money a couple of years ago but
figured it was best to steer clear. ``You see all these buildings
going up. Why are all these things happening here, where there is
nothing much that goes on?''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the defendants, who face a range of money
laundering, conspiracy and fraud charges, say they are not guilty.
Stephen R. Ryan, a lawyer for Hood, said the charges are ``based on
misinformation and or misinterpretation of the information that
they have.'' He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   In an especially odd aspect of this unusual case, Hood and two
of the other defendants have apparently tried to assert that the
U.S. government does not exist and therefore cannot try them. As
the federal investigation wound down and a grand jury was convened,
they mailed papers to prosecutors, court clerks, Mattoon police
officers, the county sheriff and the U.S. Supreme Court stating
that ``any judicial proceeding, determination, ruling, order,
decree, entry, penalty, fine or arrest warrants which issues from
these `courts' is null and void.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also found identity cards with pictures and
signatures of Hood and another defendant, Arlene Foust Diamond, a
63-year-old real estate and insurance agent from Los Angeles, who
solicited investments for Omega. The cards identified Hood and
Diamond as ``ambassador and minister of justice for the Free State
of Eden.'' Prosecutors said that Diamond tried to use her card to
claim a kind of diplomatic immunity and get out of submitting
handwriting and fingerprint samples to the grand jury. Hood
testified in court Thursday that he signed the card as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said in court records that they had found bank
accounts for Hood and Diamond in Dubai, and accounts for Diamond in
Belize and other countries. Hood and his wife, Patricia Ann Hood,
64, are also charged with filing false tax returns. According to
the indictment, the Hoods claimed only $9,919 in total income for
1995 and $11,222 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hood, a big man with leathery skin, pleaded guilty to criminal
damage of property and burglary in two separate cases in the 1970s.
Born and raised in Mattoon, he worked for various factories, farmed
and fixed radiators.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hood represented himself to Omega investors as ``one of only
seven or eight persons worldwide who had the knowledge, expertise
and capability to conduct these secret multimillion-dollar
trades,'' the U.S. attorney's office said. The Omega fund
apparently turned him into a jet-setter, traveling to places like
Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Omega started, federal, state and local agencies
began getting complaints from Omega investors and employees, as
well as suspicions from people in Mattoon. Investors in all 50
states and a dozen countries, had sent cashier's checks and money
orders after being told that the money would be invested in foreign
bank debentures, prosecutors say. They were promised that each $100
would net them $5,100 in 275 days, and that if they ``rolled over''
the $5,100, they would receive $255,000.

 MATTOON, Ill.: receive $255,000.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that for years, Hood had an investor phone line
with recorded messages saying the payoff was just around the corner
and blaming the delay on bankers or the government.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a classic Ponzi scheme, where early investors make a
profit so that they will help entice other investors, Omega
investors never made any money, prosecutors say. But, partly
because of the fund's Christian overtones, many investors, some of
whom planned on using the money for charity, apparently still
believe that Omega will pay off, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Stark, of Apple Valley, Calif., said she invested $1,600
in 1998, sending money orders to Diamond for forwarding to Hood.
She thought she would receive $5,100 for every $100 in two months.
She said Diamond told her, `` `Everything is going well and be
patient.' She was very, very nice, always a delight to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   Stark said she knew about 20 people in her community who had
invested with Omega, most of them Christians like her. ``I hold no
animosity,'' she said of Hood and Diamond. ``It saddens me they
have to sit in jail. Their lives are spoiled by their greed.''
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation progressed, Hawaii and Missouri issued
cease-and-desist orders to keep Omega from marketing itself there.
Yet the fund continued to solicit investors in those states,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   In Mattoon, sometimes called Toon Town, people watched the
sprouting of places like the Bluebird Diner, made from three shiny
silver trailers and positively dazzling by Mattoon standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they built the Bluebird Diner, we thought they must have
been doing better than we thought,'' said Shelli Kaczmarek, a
manager at Gill's. ``Me, my husband and 3-year-old paid $20 there
for breakfast. I can feed my whole family, all four of my kids, on
that here.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Chris Engel, a construction contractor whose business is
accused of funneling some $6 million of Hood's money, prospered
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not like New York, where a construction company with a
fleet of 40 or 50 new vehicles, people probably wouldn't think that
much about it,'' said the police chief, David O'Dell, who said the
last time the town faced a scandalous crime was the 1968 murder of
five children by a jilted boyfriend. We're a small town. It was
just obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Mattoon has come down hard on Hood and his
accused co-conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   At Jimmy John's sandwich shop, which prosecutors say the former
police officer and a lawyer bought with Hood's money, Seth
Wilcoxon, the manager, said, ``The owners weren't aware of where
the money was coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   And Melissa Yates, a secretary at Our Own Original Bakery, which
never became a bakery but served as an office for Hood, said, ``All
I know is that he has done a lot for this community. He has helped
hundreds of people around here, even strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jack Morgan, a 52-year-old retired trucker having a chili
mac under the I Love Lucy poster at Gill's, was feeling embarrassed
for Mattoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of hurts the reputation of the community,'' he said.
``Especially people that you've knowed, involved in something like
this. It kind of makes you wonder if you can trust your next door
neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Securities and Exchange Commission warned
investors not to participate in such schemes, called bank debenture
scams, in which con artists exploit suspicions about the government
and financial institutions. The schemers tell investors that there
is a secret banking system open only to the very rich which
provides huge returns but they can participate if they pool their
money with someone who has an ``in.''

</P>
<P>
   After 15 seasons of the wishbone, Army, which lived by the run,
unveils a quick-pass offense.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHWEST
</P>
<P>
   Texas, El Paso (0-0) at No. 19 Oklahoma (0-0)
</P>

midseason.
</P>
<P>
   FAR WEST
</P>
<P>
   Idaho (0-0) at No. 14 Washington (0-0)

   MISMATCHES
</P>
<P>
   San Jose State (0-0) at No. 1 Nebraska (0-0)
</P>

   Central Michigan (0-0) at No. 15 Purdue (0-0)
</P>
<P>
   Drew Brees can pass, but when the opposition gets tough, will
Purdue find a running game?
</P>
<P>
   The Citadel (0-0) at No. 17 Clemson (0-0)
</P>

   Clemson could stay unbeaten until a Nov. 4 game at Florida
State.

   The dream of a defense against ballistic missiles goes all the
way back to the Eisenhower era. But it was in the thunder and flame
of the Gulf War, the world's first antimissile war, that support
grew for the kind of system that the Clinton administration has
been considering.
</P>
<P>
   After the Republicans won control of Congress six years ago,
momentum to field such a weapon grew rapidly. By 1996 the
administration began an effort to ready a limited missile defense
for deployment, its price tag eventually put at $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The range of its nonnuclear warhead was to be much greater than
that of the old ground-based interceptors, because it was
``smart,'' small and lightweight. In theory at least, such
interceptors at a single base could, for the first time, race out
of their silos to defend the whole nation from an attack of up to a
few dozen warheads.
</P>
<P>
   After being launched into space by a rocket, the so-called
Exo-Atmospheric Kill Vehicle was to guide itself toward a target,
using its tiny computer to analyze sensor readings and fire
thrusters.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the big challenge was whether it could ignore
the decoys amid the nuclear warheads that an enemy would inevitably
deploy in a bid to outwit the defense system. The sensor was to be
smart enough to find the real warhead amid the clutter, seeking out
its heat rays. Then, zipping along at about 2 miles per second, the
kill vehicle was to slam into the warhead and demolish it.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including some from the antimissile industry itself,
said the plan would never work.
</P>
<P>
   Test flights began in 1997. Mock warheads were always launched
into space from California and interceptor rockets from Kwajalein
Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The first two tests studied only sensor
accuracy, the interceptors flying nearby to look at mock warheads
among decoys.
</P>
<P>
   Then came intercept tests, the first last October. The Pentagon
hailed the experiment as an unqualified success but later
acknowledged that the kill vehicle had initially drifted off course
and picked out a decoy balloon rather than the warhead.
</P>
<P>
   In the second test, in January, the interceptor missed the
target altogether because of a sensor coolant leak.
</P>
<P>
   The third intercept try, in July, meant to be the last before
President Clinton's deployment decision, was also a disappointment.
The final stage of the two-stage interceptor failed to release the
kill vehicle, and the two tumbled out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement Friday that he had decided to pass the
contentious issue onto his successor is likely to produce very
different results depending on who wins the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Deploying space arms could cost up to hundreds of billions of
dollars. So far all of the efforts over the decades have been
nothing short of colossal and have cost more than $130 billion,
according to the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a
private group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The allure of space arms is that they could, in theory, hit
rising missiles in their boost phase before they release payloads
of warheads, chaff, balloons and other decoys, increasing the odds
of success and offering protection against large strikes. But there
are countermeasures, and global coverage could be hard.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a national missile defense began in the late 1950s
when President Eisenhower, facing the prospect of Soviet missile
fleets, embarked on a secretive crash program of antimissile
research that included ideas for space-based arms and in time
involved thousands of the nation's top scientists.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid 1960s, designers had settled on a less ambitious
approach that involved ground-based interceptors tipped with
nuclear arms. In war, these were to thunder out of their
underground silos and race skyward to battle incoming waves of
enemy warheads, in theory incinerating them in nuclear fireballs.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnson administration, trying to seize a Republican issue
before the 1968 presidential election, proposed plans for deploying
such interceptors.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Nixon administration that actually built them.
Switched on in North Dakota in October 1975, the Safeguard system
was meant to shield nearby missile fields from a disarming first
strike. But the $25 billion weapon was abandoned after just 133
days as strategists concluded that Moscow could overwhelm it with a
rush of new warheads then being fastened atop new missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of just such costly spirals of antimissile action and
reaction prompted Moscow and Washington in 1972 to sign the
Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which in time limited each side to
one interceptor site. No matter how good the interceptors, experts
reasoned, these single sites would be unable to defend large
territories.
</P>
<P>
   The goal in hobbling defense was to reinforce the idea that all
sides would lose in a nuclear war and thus to deter such an
apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan's Star Wars plan, announced in 1983, meant to
see if enemy missiles could be rendered ``impotent and obsolete.''
The program of crash research pursued weapons that were quite
advanced, including lasers and particle beams, and proposed to base
them in space.
</P>
<P>
   That step sought to extend the antimissile reach beyond the
range of ground-based interceptors and to produce many lines of
defense so in theory a shield might be nearly leakproof, even in a
downpour.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989, after many programmatic zigs and zags, and failures, a
less futuristic and more realistic space weapon was proposed.
Called Brilliant Pebbles, it was hailed as being so cheap and small
that up to 100,000 of them could be shot into orbit, always ready
to ruin rising enemy missiles by force of impact.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Cold War ended, political support for such plans
evaporated and all the orbital arms initiatives came crashing back
to Earth after an expenditure of tens of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the Gulf War, when waves of Patriot interceptors
sought to blast short-range Iraqi Scuds out of the sky, did hopes
revive for a missile defense system in the United States. That
fiery duel in the Persian Gulf War helped to build support for more
advanced kinds of ground-based interceptors, including ones for
nationwide defense.

LAST-MINUTE MOVE BLOCKS RELEASE OF SCIENTIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Two federal appeals court judges on Friday
halted the imminent release on bail of Wen Ho Lee, the former Los
Alamos scientist accused of mishandling nuclear weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in Lee's release, which had been scheduled for noon
Friday, was a result of last-minute maneuvers by prosecutors that
provoked charges of deception from defense lawyers at an unusually
emotional court hearing Friday. The prosecutors denied any
deception.
</P>
<P>
   The one-line order from the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
in Denver _ ``Release of appellee Wen Ho Lee is stayed pending
further order of this court'' _ came as a district court judge in
Albuquerque was starting to hear arguments on the prosecution's
request that he further delay the release of Lee.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 24, the district court judge, James A. Parker, reversed
an earlier order in which he had denied bail to Lee based on the
government's assertions that he posed a grave threat to national
security.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent hearing, an FBI agent admitted to having testified
incorrectly on several critical issues, making Lee appear deceptive
when he had not been. Also, defense experts disputed the value of
the secrets Lee is charged with illegally downloading from a
government computer, prompting Parker to order Lee released to home
detention on $1 million bail. The judge had given prosecutors until
noon to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   At the noon hearing Friday, when it was expected that the
government would announce its appeal, a law clerk strode into the
nearly empty courtroom and handed Parker a piece of paper. Upon
reading it, the judge announced that the appeals court had already
issued an order temporarily halting Lee's release, circumventing
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The order, which appeared to have taken the judge and Lee's
lawyers by surprise, was a clear indication of the intensity of the
government's desire to keep Lee imprisoned before his trial, which
is scheduled to begin in November.
</P>
<P>
   John Cline, one of Lee's lawyers, leapt to his feet, and stated,
``If they filed something without telling us, I think it's an
outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Cline explained that he had, as is common, insisted that he
receive advance notice of any filing, to give him time to respond,
and said he had understood the prosecutors would do this. That the
prosecutors had apparently done an end run around the defense and
the district court here was, Cline insisted, an abuse of the normal
process, under which the appeal would have been filed only after
Parker had issued his ruling and the hearing here had ended.
</P>
<P>
   Cline said he had already prepared a response to any government
motion to halt Lee's release. The motion was now all but useless.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the way the system is supposed to work,'' Cline
said, while Lee, sitting a few feet away, grimaced and closed his
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Parker responded with the unusual admission that he had planned
to deny the government's request for any further delay in Lee's
release, but that with the appeals court's ruling, it was out of
his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not clear to me that this is any longer under this
court's jurisdiction,'' Parker said dryly; then he called a recess.
</P>
<P>
   But the hearing reconvened an hour later, and sparks again flew.
</P>
<P>
   The second hearing had been requested by the lead prosecutor,
George Stamboulidis, to clear up, he said, the impression that he
might have misled the defense or the court.
</P>
<P>
   Stamboulidis explained that the stay, issued by Judges Deanell
R. Tacha and David M. Ebel, was made on the appellate court's
initiative as the noon deadline loomed. He suggested that the stay
had taken him by surprise, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government doesn't play dirty pool,'' Stamboulidis said.
</P>
<P>
   Cline responded: ``What I think Mr. Stamboulidis has said is
half-truths at best. It is part of a pattern of misleading conduct
that, I think, is outrageous.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To that, Nancy Hollander, another of Lee's lawyers, explained
that she had just spoken with the clerk of the appeals court in
Denver and had been given a different version of events.
</P>
<P>
   Hollander said she was informed that an official with the
Department of Justice in Washington had called the court earlier in
the day to say that a notice of appeal was being filed shortly in
Albuquerque and Denver along with a request for a stay of Lee's
release until the appeal was heard by a three-judge appeals panel.
The request for a stay was the one that Parker had already said he
was prepared to deny.
</P>
<P>
   Hollander said she had requested and been given an assurance
that she would be informed of any filings by the government and
given a chance to respond. In any case, she said, the appeals court
judges had acted in response to the government's request, not on
their own, as Stamboulidis had suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the government circumventing this court and essentially
not being truthful,'' Hollander said.
</P>
<P>
   Stamboulidis rejected that claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappointment in a result is not justification for taking
shots like that,'' he said. ``There was no sneakiness, no
inappropriateness.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the government has insisted in several hearings that
Lee was engaged in what amounted to one of the most serious cases
of nuclear espionage ever, he is not charged in the 59-count
indictment with spying. He faces a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment if he is convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Later on Friday, Cline and Hollander faxed to the appeals court
a response to the government's actions, noting their anger at what
they said was deceptive behavior that violated some of the court's
own rules. They asked the court to lift the stay.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from the court. The appeals
panel is expected to consider motions by the prosecution and
defense.
</P>
<P>
   After expecting to return home for the first time since
December, when he was imprisoned, Lee returned to prison in Santa
Fe. The prosecution has said his confinement, in harsh conditions,
is essential, because of concerns that he might find a way to
spirit nuclear secrets to a hostile country.

 &HT;    GOP Senate hopeful discloses finances
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With a home on St. Simons Island valued at nearly $1
million and a generous federal pension from years in the U.S.
Senate, NATO and a U.S. ambassadorship, Senate candidate Mack
Mattingly holds assets worth as much $2.9 million, according to
disclosures released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   During the past year and a half, Mattingly, the leading
Republican candidate to fill the unexpired term of the late Paul
Coverdell, supplemented his $69,000 retirement by consulting for
aeronautical giant Lockheed Martin, earning roughly $108,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly has suspended his consulting work for the company in
connection with construction of the F-22 fighter, the C-130J
transport and other aircraft, forgoing a $6,000 monthly salary,
until the Nov. 7 Senate race is over, his campaign said. He's also
taken a leave of absence from a paying board position on
CompuCredit Corp., a credit card marketing company, and resigned as
chairman of the board of the conservative Southeastern Legal
Foundation to conduct the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures filed Friday paint the picture of a successful
businessman with a stock portfolio mingling standards like
Coca-Cola and General Electric with high-tech leaders like Cisco
Systems and Dell Computers.
</P>
<P>
   But while he's lived a comfortable life since leaving the U.S.
Senate in 1986, Mattingly apparently hasn't been as active in
securing board positions as his rival, Zell Miller, who was
appointed to Coverdell's seat following the senator's death from a
brain hemorrhage in July.
</P>
<P>
   Of Mattingly's nine board memberships, five were non-profits,
another is a Census group and one offered compensation of $250. His
assets are worth between $1.3 and $2.9 million, with income during
the past 19 months of just a little more than $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's disclosures, filed last week, show the former governor
earned more than $680,000 in 1999, the year after he left office,
from work for three colleges, an array of corporate boards and a
consulting arrangement with tobacco company Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates must file personal financial disclosures within 30
days of establishing their candidacy _ a threshold they cross,
according to federal standards, by raising or spending $5,000 on
the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wood, one of the five other Senate candidates, a
Realtor/owner of an agency, said he will file disclosures early
next week showing about $375,000 in earned income last year and two
businesses worth about $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats noted Mattingly took a leave of absence from several
positions rather than severing all ties to outside interests, as
Miller did upon his Senate appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he's only suspended his (consulting) tells me
he's not planning on winning the election,'' said Georgia
Democratic Party Chairman David Worley.
</P>
<P>
   But Mattingly campaign spokesman Bill Wood said Mattingly
already has made preparations to leave the paying boards after
victory in the Nov. 7 non-partisan special election.

FOR CHIEFS IN CRISIS, IT'S SURVIVAL OF THE SORRIEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Sept. 3) 
 By JULIE FLAHERTY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems that you cannot turn on the television or open a
newspaper these days without some sober-eyed chief executive
offering a personal act of corporate contrition.
</P>
<P>
   In television advertisements, Jacques Nasser, chief of Ford
Motor Co., explains that he is doing his best to replace the
Firestone tires said by regulators to have led to 88 deaths in the
United States. Masatoshi Ono of Bridgestone/Firestone does the same
in full-page newspaper ads. And James Goodwin, chairman of United
Airlines, a part of UAL, bought commercial time to offer an apology
for the company's recurrent flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   Media analysts said they expected to see these chief executives
step in front of the camera. Such appearances are now part of a
chief executive's job, the analysts say. And they predict that
other leaders whose companies get into trouble will have to do
likewise.
</P>
<P>
   Events of the last few years _ including President Clinton's
taking to the airwaves with a personal mea culpa _ have primed
audiences for this strategy, said Robert Thompson, founder of the
Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madison Avenue has finally realized that deep in the American
heart is this powerful respect for honesty,'' he said, ``and if you
confess to something, you can get away with murder, sometimes
literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be you never wanted them to see you squirm. All of
a sudden, corporate America has recognized the apology as the
quickest way to make bad things go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting a leader's face on a crisis response is almost a
necessity now, whether for potentially fatal product flaws or
annoyances like flight delays, said Sue Parenio, an associate
professor of advertising at Boston University. Americans are so fed
up with poor treatment from large corporate bureaucracies, she
said, that they will accept reassurance only from the top official.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you call up and raise Cain about a product or service
experience you had, the customer service reps say, `yeah, yeah,'
and it's not cutting it,'' Parenio said. ``Consumers have a lot
more choices. If one company disappoints them, they are going to go
somewhere else. They might live with you through a crisis, but only
if they get to hear it from a top guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kopp, an associate professor who teaches marketing and
advertising at Babson College, said, ``People, in their gut, like
to be able to personalize a company.''
</P>
<P>
   But does it work even when the personality is a plain-vanilla
one? Ono's advertisements, which began appearing in newspapers on
Aug. 23, were an unadorned list of Firestone actions that left Kopp
unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the advertisement says that Firestone initiated a
`voluntary safety recall,' anybody who's been following this will
get a chuckle about that,'' Kopp said. ``It was voluntary, with a
gun to your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Ono, who speaks little English, did not appear in Firestone's
television advertisements, which instead featured John Lampe,
executive vice president for the company's United States unit.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines had a more natural spokesman in Goodwin. On the
heels of a print advertisement, United started running a TV
commercial on Aug. 24. It shows Goodwin walking through an empty
airplane, presumably not one that passengers are waiting
impatiently to board. It portrays him as a plain-talking, regular
guy, the kind who could join a company as an accountant in 1967 and
work his way up. It was shot in two hours. ``There was no wardrobe,
no styling, no makeup,'' said Julie Thompson, a spokeswoman for
Fallon Worldwide of Minneapolis, which designed the ad and has
handled United's other ad campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But the straightforward approach failed to persuade Susan
Fournier, an associate professor at Harvard Business School who
specializes in marketing and branding. She had been stuck in
Chicago waiting for a United flight and had spent more than an hour
in a line to get information. When she became aware of the ads, she
was all the more critical. ``The left side of my brain is saying,
`Yeah, right,'`` she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fournier said United could take a lesson from James Burke,
former chief of Johnson &AMP; Johnson, who saved the reputation of
Tylenol during the drug-tampering scare of 1982. Burke not only
appeared on numerous TV interviews, but also gave public updates on
all the company's actions, from removing products from shelves to
introducing tamper-resistant packaging. ``It had a lot of oomph
behind it,'' she said. ``There is the acknowledgment, and then
there is the reparation and recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Kopp agreed. ``I would recommend the CEO's view these campaigns
with some continuity and come back to us with a follow-up'' with
some concrete actions, he said. ``Otherwise, people will think they
are just putting their finger in the dam before it bursts.''
</P>
<P>
   As yet, United has no particular plans to put Goodwin back on
the screen. Ford is similarly unsure of Nasser's future
appearances. Carolyn Brown, a Ford spokeswoman, said that Nasser
had received good reviews for his two television advertisements.
Some 58 percent of focus group members said that after watching the
first ad they had a positive view of Ford's handling of the recall;
the percentage rose to 72 for the second commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching directly to consumers through paid advertising was an
obvious choice, said Matthew Triaca, a United spokesman. ``It was a
great way to reach a large number of customers, direct and
unfiltered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that these executives are always willingly their company's
spokesmen. Nasser initially declined to testify at this week's
federal hearings on the tire recall, saying that others at Ford
were better qualified to discuss specifics. But, accused of being
insufficiently open, he reversed himself during a news conference
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other chief executives usually leave the news
conferences to others. Thompson, the television scholar, called it
part of the strategy. ``The general makes the grand rhetorical
statement, and you send the foot soldiers out to deal with the
arrows slung by journalists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, companies are ultimately accountable for the truth in
their advertisements. Americans find it hard to reject a white
flag, Thompson asserted, but they are more cynical than ever. And
while it's easy enough to put a human face on a company, Thompson
mused, people will ask, ``In the end, can a corporation really feel
remorse?''

   Judge Baltasar Garzon indicted a former Argentine military
officer on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism, acts he said
were committed under Argentina's military government two decades
ago. Garzon, who led a drive to extradite the former Chilean
dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, on human rights charges, acted

<P>
   The derailment of a Paris subway car on Thursday was probably

Notre-Dame-de-Lorette was 19 miles an hour, and the train was going
about 22 mph. A national radio station reported that the driver,
still not identified, had been disciplined several times for

   NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA: ACCORD ON MILITARY TALKS
</P>
<P>
   After extending talks in Pyongyang for a fourth day, North and
South Korea agreed to ease tensions on the divided peninsula by
opening a dialogue among military officials, according to a
statement released in Seoul. With the talks under threat of ending
without a significant agreement, South Korea's unification
minister, Pak Chae-kyu, traveled by train to a remote province of
North Korea to meet its leader, Kim Jong-il, a move considered
pivotal in reaching an accord.

``I deny this false allegation completely and without

   WASHINGTON _ Most White House decisions these days factor in
Vice President Al Gore's campaign for president, and the
announcement Friday that there would be no decision on missile
defense deployment was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to the vice president said that Gore participated
actively in the decision-making process of many months by ``phone,
fax or Leon'' _ referring to the vice president's national security
adviser, Leon Fuerth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president has always been aware of the president's
thinking on this, and vice versa,'' the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides taking into consideration things like unsuccessful tests
on missile interceptors or concerns about a renewed arms race,
Clinton also factored in the presidential election, White House
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way or another this will be an issue in the campaign,''
said a senior Clinton administration official involved in the
crucial meetings. ``We'd probably be criticized for any decision.
We wanted to get this decided early so that everyone knew what the
context was as the campaign unfolds.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and the Republican presidential nominee, Gov. George W.
Bush, each welcomed Friday's announcement, but from different
perspectives. Gore praised the action in a three-page statement
issued minutes after Clinton's announcement, but he took pains to
say that it was ``the president's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore left some uncertainty as to whether a Gore administration
would start building a defensive shield. He said the presumed
threat of a missile attack from North Korea or Iran was by no means
certain, and did not necessarily require the construction of an
elaborate and costly shield.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said he would continue to test the feasibility of such
a system and would go ahead with deployment of a land-based system
if he were ``fully convinced that the technologies are ready.''
Adopting the White House view, he has said he would seek to modify
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which bans such missile
defenses, instead of scrapping it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would welcome the chance as president to make the
decision on deployment, but he wasted no time in criticizing ``the
Clinton-Gore administration'' for the announcement, even though he
had warned the White House earlier in the campaign not to take any
actions that would tie his hands if he wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton and Vice President Gore first denied the
need for missile defenses, then delayed,'' Bush said in a
one-paragraph statement. ``Now they are leaving this important
unfinished business for the next president.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at the airport in Texarkana, Ark., Bush
added, ``The administration missed an opportunity to develop a
missile defense system that will protect all 50 states, protect
ourselves and our allies from accidental launch or political
blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has backed a more extensive system based on land, at sea
and possibly in space that would protect the United States and its
allies in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The Republican platform
adopted in Philadelphia last month backed ``robust missile
defenses'' and criticized the White House for becoming ``hopelessly
entangled in its commitment to an obsolete treaty signed in 1972.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Clinton decided his presidency had too little time
left for such a momentous step as the construction of a missile
shield.
</P>
<P>
   He had grave doubts about the technology. He was concerned about
the overseas response. Most of all, his aides said, he did not want
to be the one who risked scrapping the system that got the United
States through the Cold War for what might turn out to be nothing
more than a wing and a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton punted the decision to his successor and, in the
process, set up a clear point of contrast between the two men
seeking to be the next president.
</P>
<P>
   It might have helped Gore, White House aides said, if linton had
gone forward with such a shield, inoculating him against
accusations of being soft on defense. But it might prove more
beneficial for Gore that Clinton has opted to stay out of the
decision, allowing the vice president to explain his own thinking
on a complicated national security matter that he has studied
extensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows the vice president, in an area he knows a lot about,
to shape the debate,'' said a senior Clinton aide. ``The president
is stepping aside on this. The vice president can now step
forward.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The president's timetable for deciding the issue this fall grew
out of campaign politics _ but it was Clinton's own campaign in
1996, not Gore's current one.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were hammering Clinton for not backing a missile
shield so the president, as he has done on so many issues, adopted
a middle course between those convinced that a missile shield is
the future of U.S. security policy and those who consider it a
sham.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing a multibillion-dollar test of a missile defense,
Democrats sought to neutralize the Republican refrain that they are
soft on defense. Strategists in both parties see the concept as a
winner among voters. Indeed, analysts say, there is a widespread _
but erroneous _ belief among average Americans that there is
already a missile shield in place.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not, and no such shield will be build during the
Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``A national missile defense, if deployed, should be part of a
larger strategy to preserve and enhance the peace, strength and
security we now enjoy, and to build an even safer world,'' Clinton
said Friday. ``I have tried to maximize the ability of the next
president to pursue that strategy.''

 &HT;    Feds: More Firestone varieties pose 'potential safety risk'
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal officials issued a warning Friday that two dozen more
varieties of Firestone tires may fail at higher rates than the 6.5
million tires that the company voluntarily recalled last month.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it was
warning consumers of the ``potential safety risk'' after
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. refused Thursday to expand its Aug. 9
recall to include the additional tires.
</P>
<P>
   The government agency said it had met with Firestone officials
Wednesday to recommend that the recall be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone officials said Friday they disagreed with the safety
agency's analysis, but offered to inspect customers' tires and
replace them for free if they are concerned about their safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we've said all along, public safety and customer
satisfaction is our top priority. Every possible resource of this
company is aimed at those priorities,'' said Firestone spokeswoman
Chris Karbowiak.
</P>
<P>
   The NHTSA said it may order Firestone to recall the tires once
it completes its investigation. The agency has received more than
1,400 complaints about Firestone tires, including reports of 88
deaths that reportedly were the result of blowouts, tread
separation and other defects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although its investigation is not complete, that review
indicated that the rate of tread separations for certain other tire
models and sizes exceed those of the recalled tires, sometimes by a
large margin,'' the NHTSA said in its consumer advisory.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory is available on the NHTSA Web site at
www.nhtsa.gov. The Web site includes detailed listings of the tires
subject to the advisory as well as the earlier recall, and a
database of consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The warning covers several varieties of Firestone ATX, Firehawk
ATX, ATX 23 Degree, Widetrack Radial Baja, Wilderness AT and
Wilderness HT tires in sizes ranging from 14 inches to 16.5 inches.
All but three of the additional tires include the plant code ``VD''
for Firestone's Decatur, Ill., plant that has been a focus of the
earlier recall.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.4 million of the tires subject to the advisory were
manufactured from 1991 to present, but far fewer probably remain in
use, the agency said. Most were sold as replacement tires for a
wide variety of vehicles and not originally installed on new
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors said Firestone ATX tires included in the advisory
were installed as original equipment on fewer than 10,000 of its
1991-model Chevrolet Blazers. ``It would be highly unusual that any
of the original Firestone tires'' are still in use on those
vehicles,'' said Brook Lindbert, director of GM tire and wheel
systems. He said only two complaints in NHTSA's database of almost
1,500 complaints involve 1991 Chevy Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA officials recommended consumers ``consider replacing the
tires'' and retain their receipts, even though Firestone is not
required to pay for replacing the tires unless a recall is ordered.
The agency also warned drivers to take precautions such as
monitoring the tires' condition and air pressure, and avoiding
driving at high speeds, particularly on hot days or in an
overloaded vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone officials estimated that fewer than half of the tires
are still in use, and said it will inspect, fix and replace tires
at its company-owned Firestone Tire and Service Centers or at
authorized dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if there is a problem, we will fix it,''
Firestone's Karbowiak said. ``If a customer is still concerned
about their tires, we will replace the tires at no cost to the
customers. We will use competitors' products if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHTSA advisory comes as a growing number of consumer safety
advocates and attorneys have called for Firestone to expand its
voluntary recall beyond three types of 15-inch ATX, ATX II and
Wilderness AT tires that were installed mostly on Ford
sport-utility vehicles and pickups, as well as on some Mercury and
Mazda vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the 47 million ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT
tires are covered by the recall. Firestone estimates about 6.5
million are still on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The NHTSA said it is investigating all those tires, plus other
models on which it has received complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled models are all P235/75 R15 Firestone ATX and ATX II
tires made since 1991 and P235/75R15 Wilderness AT tires
manufactured since 1996 at Firestone's Decatur plant.

</P>
<P>
   SHAKESPEARE-FIENNES-THEATER (London) _ It is almost a rite of
passage for promising Shakespearean actors to play ``Hamlet.'' More
than most, though, Ralph Fiennes seemed made for the part. To
Jonathan Kent, the slim, ascetic-looking Englishman was born to
play the ill-fated monarch in Shakespeare's ``Richard II.'' To this
fairly obvious choice, however, Kent, an artistic director at
London's Almeida Theater Company, added a more innovative idea. Why
not twin ``Richard II'' with ``Coriolanus,'' another Shakespearean
political tragedy. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   CORIOLANUS-THEATER (New York) _ Among Shakespeare's tragic
heroes, Coriolanus stands apart. The others seduce us. This one _
Rome's greatest warrior turned Rome's fiercest scourge _ scorns
even to try. Perhaps the Almeida Theater Company's production of
``Coriolanus,'' directed by Jonathan Kent, which comes to the
Brooklyn Academy of Music for a limited run beginning September 9,
will challenge entrenched opinion. The title role is entrusted to
Ralph Fiennes, the protagonist also of the Almeida's ``Richard
II,'' that will alternate with ``Coriolanus.'' By Matthew
Gurewitsch.

<P>
   SONGWRITERS-THEATER (New York) _ There are many ways a
songwriter today can be unfashionable. Choosing to write for the
American musical theater is merely one of the surer routes. Though,
even here, different songwriters go about being unfashionable in
entirely different ways. Take Michael John LaChiusa and John
Bucchino. Both write songs in the classic Broadway manner as
descended from the American popular songbook. Beyond this
commonality, however, their work is strikingly dissimilar. Where
LaChiusa's music flouts tradition with incendiary rebelliousness _
both lyrically and melodically, Bucchino's teases it with
reassuring gentleness. By Barry Singer.

</P>
<P>
   BESTMAN-THEATER (New York) _ Gore Vidal wrote ``The Best Man''
in 1959, a time when Joseph McCarthy's legacy endured, when Adlai
Stevenson and Richard Nixon were among the nation's leading
politicians, and when Vidal counted as his friend a young senator
from Massachusetts named John Kennedy. The play drew on these
influences to become a tale of politics that may seem improbable
today: a stark struggle of two men of obvious complexity, set
during a national political convention where decisions of
consequence were actually made. Now ``The Best Man'' is returning
to Broadway. By Adam Nagourney.

   &UR; MOVIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DIE-FILM (Undated) _ One of the great things about having pay
cable is the opportunity it provides for discovering little films
that were denied theatrical release. Films like the awkwardly
titled ``And Then You Die,'' a hard-as-pig iron 1987 gangster drama
that used to pop up on HBO well past the shank of the evening. For
its first five minutes, ``Die,'' which charts the treacherous
skirmishes between warring Quebec mobs, works solely in somber and
gripping imagery, neatly sketching out the conflicts; it was
superbly directed by Francis Mankiewicz. It's an instance where you
can literally see the filmmaker running out of money and the
picture eventually compromised by budgetary shortfalls, though the
director's control is evident throughout. By Elvis Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   MCQUARRIE-FILM (Undated) _ To hear Chris McQuarrie tell it, the
origins of the new film he wrote and directed, ``The Way of the
Gun,'' lay in disgruntlement, frustration and anger. McQuarrie,
author of a screenplay that was nonpareil in its genre, was finding
no one who would let him direct a movie about a 20-year-old who had
conquered the world. This is his tale. By Jamie Malanowski.`

   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DELAY-VIOLIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Rare as great performers are,
even rarer are great teachers of performance. Today, in the field
of violin playing at a supreme virtuoso level, there are only two:
Dorothy DeLay and the rest. By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUNICH-OLYMPICS-TV (Unated) _ If the 1972 Summer Olympics in
Munich had ended on its 10th day, it would have been remembered for
Olga Korbut's pixieish dance along the balance beam or Mark Spitz's
record run of seven gold medals in swimming. But before dawn on the
11th day, eight Palestinian guerrillas scaled an unguarded fence in
the Olympic village and invaded the apartment building housing the
Israeli team. They took 11 athletes and officials hostage and, over
the course of a slow-motion 20-hour siege that riveted the world,
killed them all. If any innocence remained at the Olympics, it
ended that day. Of the eight Black September terrorists, only one,
Jamal al-Gashey, a teen-ager at the time, survives. He is the
subject of ``One Day in September,'' a documentary to be seen on
Sept. 11 on HBO in which he describes his life as a Palestinian
refugee and his pride in what the Black September terrorists did to
the Israelis inside the Olympic village at 31 Connollystrasse. By
Richard Sandomir.

<P>
   PUPPET-DANCE (Undated) _ There are two bloodlines in modern
puppetry: the ``low'' subversive tradition of Punch and Judy, which
is sometimes called ``marketplace puppetry''; and the ``high''
tradition of Asian religious ritual and court ceremony, including
Indonesian shadow puppets and Japanese Bunraku. High puppetry is
gestural and exploits the same kind of control that is meaningful
in ballet: it is a language for the superhuman, for gods and
heroes, for stories told time out of mind to audiences that
frequently know the motion by heart. By Andrew Solomon.

</P>
<P>
   IONIDES-ART (New York) _ Back in the 1920s, the designer Basil
Ionides was one of Britain's brightest aesthetic lights. His books
_ ``Color and Interior Decoration'' and ``The Modern English
Interior'' _ were best sellers, the former chockablock with
watercolor illustrations of his homes, prime examples of a
scientific approach to the play of light on bold but carefully
graded color schemes. Ionides' professional piece de resistance was
the 1929 mirror-and-glass decoration of the Savoy Theater in
London, whose icy glitter still staggers the eye. Ionides was also
an outstanding collector. By the time of his death, in 1950, at 66,
he had helped amass an impressive haul of early Chinese porcelain.
A dish from this cache will be a centerpiece of an exhibition at

<P>
   LAMOS-OPERA (New York) _ Mark Lamos belongs to two worlds, in
more ways than one. First, he seemed headed for a career as a
classical violinist. Then he discovered the theater, where his
acting career lifted off in felicitous fashion, with an early
Broadway appearance as the heartthrob Christian de Neuvillette
opposite the Cyrano de Bergerac of Christopher Plummer and a
subsequent Hamlet at the Old Globe in San Diego. Next, Lamos
settled down as a director, first of straight plays, then also of
opera. Right now, his mind is on Donizetti's ``Roberto Devereux,''
which opens the New York City Opera season at the New York State
Theater on Sept. 12. By Matthew Gurewitsch.

truism, prosper when the market goes up and when it goes down. But
this year the market has gone nowhere _ no major average has moved

done better than ever. And many in Wall Street think that brokerage
shares, despite rich prices and a history of sharp cyclical swings,
have still more room to fly. A major reason, analysts say, is how
they are taking business from banks in a new regulatory landscape
for which the banks themselves lobbied vigorously for decades. By

AFTER HOMETOWN WELCOME, LIEBERMAN TOUTS GORE'S MEDICARE DRUG PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Sen. Joseph Lieberman returned to the warm
embrace of his hometown on Friday, where he criticized Gov. George
W. Bush, telling a group of older residents that Bush would do
nothing to strengthen Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, joined by family members, was welcomed like a
returning son to the Bella Vista retirement home here as he made
his first swing through Connecticut since accepting the nomination
as the Democratic vice-presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Looking drawn at the end of a six-day, cross-country campaign
trip, Lieberman hoisted his 3-year-old granddaughter, Tennessee,
onto his hip _ the first time in weeks he had seen her. He kissed
her cheek and said, ``This is what I missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Millie Shea, 76, kissed the senator's cheek, shook his hand and
then said: ``I'm praying for you all the time. I know God is with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Casotti, 82, told him that when he was nominated, ``I
nearly fainted with joy.''
</P>
<P>
   To the knowing nods of some 300 residents who crowded into a
sweltering community room, Lieberman talked of meeting a retired
veteran this week in Portland, Ore., who must spend a third of his
income on medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unacceptable,'' Lieberman said. ``In the greatest
country in the world, at the time of our greatest prosperity in
history, no one in this generation in particular, who survived the
Depression, fought the Second World War, should have to face
poverty to take the medicine that your doctors tell you you're
supposed to take to stay well.''
</P>
<P>
   He praised Gore's proposal to add a prescription drug benefit to
Medicare, at a cost of more than $250 billion over 10 years, and to
set aside some of the federal budget surplus to extend Medicare's
solvency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our opponents can't do it because they won't have any money
left after they've given it all away in a big tax cut'' that
benefits mostly the wealthy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he cited the words of a Republican, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona, who criticized Bush's fiscal plan during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the Bush plan doesn't have one penny for Social
Security, one penny for Medicare or one penny to pay down the
debt,'' Lieberman said. ``He was right when he said it earlier this
year, he's right today and he'll be right on Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said last week that he would propose a prescription drug
plan under Medicare this week, and he has argued that the surplus
would be large enough to accommodate that goal and his tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Lieberman has his facts all wrong,'' said Dan Bartlett, a
spokesman for Bush. ``Gov. Bush dedicates $240 trillion pennies to
Medicare. His budget doubles Medicare funding over the next 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he is popular among voters in Connecticut, Lieberman's
visit came with a hint of controversy. He is running not only for
vice president but also for a third term in the Senate, which would
leave the seat in Republican hands if he and Gore win because
Connecticut's governor, a Republican, would appoint his
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   That has caused some grumbling among Connecticut Democrats,
though most insisted publicly that they supported his decision. On
Thursday, the Connecticut secretary of the state, Susan Bysiewicz,
a Democrat, said in an interview on WVIT-TV that Lieberman should
give up his Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Lieberman had said for weeks that he expected to run for
re-election to the Senate, and his aides have said it more
forcefully. But it was not until Thursday night that the senator
himself, said definitively, ``I'm staying in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is one of a handful of states that allows a senator
to run simultaneously for re-election and for national office, and
his decision is not without precedent. Lloyd M. Bentsen, in 1988,
and Lyndon B. Johnson, in 1960, both Texas Democrats, ran for
re-election to the Senate while also running for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Democrats hold onto the White House, Lieberman would
have to give up his Senate seat, and Gov. John G. Rowland would
appoint his replacement. Republicans hold a 54-to-46 advantage in
the Senate, and the loss of Lieberman's seat would hurt the
Democrats' slim chances of taking control.
</P>
<P>
   If Lieberman quit the Senate race, officials in both parties
said, any number of prominent Democrats, including Attorney General
Richard Blumenthal, could step in and defeat the Republican
nominee, Phillip A. Giordano, mayor of Waterbury.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said on Friday that he agreed with Lieberman's
decision. ``I believe it is absolutely the right decision for the
citizens of Connecticut,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said that at this late date, the selection of a
candidate to replace him, made by party leaders and not by voters,
would be undemocratic.

WELCOME TO THE NEW NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to the new National Football League, where the road from
ruin to riches can take less than a season to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Where free agency and the salary cap mitigates against great
teams. Where great defenses no longer exist. Where good
quarterbacks are rare, and good defensive backs rarer. Where games
may be closer, but not better. Where anything can happen, and
probably will.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be the old kind of NFL, where brief dynasties
reigned in Dallas, San Francisco, Green Bay and Denver, but it's
working. The NFL big picture shows rabid crowds everywhere (except
Oakland) and a feeling that every team is a few breaks away from
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The late '90s Rams, Falcons, Titans and Colts all went from
nowhere to the top of their conferences without any prelude, so
who's to say the next Super Bowl won't be just as outlandish?
</P>
<P>
   The guys who watch football for a living agree that there's no
great defense around, not even Tampa's. ``They lose (linebacker)
Hardy Nickerson, who called their coverages, and (lineman) Brad
Culpepper, who called their stunts,'' said Fox analyst John Madden.
``I don't think they'll be as good defensively as they were last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   They concur that a quarterback shortage, offense may increase
because there are plenty of good receivers. Some offenses are also
finally taking advantage of mobile quarterbacks rather than trying
to make every quarterback a pocket passer.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many pocket quarterbacks are there? (Troy) Aikman,
(Peyton) Manning, maybe (Drew) Bledsoe,'' said Raiders Hall of
Famer and Fox analyst Howie Long. ``If you can't protect a pocket
quarterback or get the ball out quicker, you're in trouble, so
having a mobile quarterback is the big trend.''
</P>
<P>
   They agree that fundamentals are down and continuity is gone.
``Tackling is at an all-time low,'' said Mike Ditka, now a studio
analyst at CBS after coaching New Orleans last year. ``It's
something you have to want to do. I'm not saying players lack
courage, but it's not something they want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL has become a situational league,'' said CBS analyst
Craig James. ``Teams rotate new players in every down. With the
cap, they're rotating players on the roster every year. The
continuity of the league has changed dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   So dramatic that the Rams can win the Super Bowl with an Arena
League walk-on. Coming next: Super Bowl XXXV, Ryan Leaf's Chargers
against Ricky Williams and the Saints? Never say never.
</P>
<P>
   One man's preview, by division, with an emphasis on schedules
and appropriately written-in-pencil predictions:
</P>
<P>
   AFC East: Miami and New England are in retreat. The Dolphins
have no appreciable running game and choosing between QBs Jay
Fiedler and Damon Huard is like choosing between Gummo or Zeppo as
the funniest Marx Brother. The defense ranked fifth last year, but
it has a sagging pass defense that can't tackle. The Patriots are
short rushing and long against the rush, bad news when Edgerrin
James, Curtis Martin and Antowain Smith are on the schedule. The
early schedule should bury them -- Tampa and Minnesota in
September, Denver and Indy twice in October.
</P>
<P>
   Jets coach Al Groh will work with a 300-pound G.M., Bill
Parcells, over his shoulder. But a healthy Vinny Testaverde and
Curtis Martin should keep the Jets competitive and on the playoff
bubble. Buffalo cut loose Bruce Smith and Thurman Thomas, but a
solid young nucleus. The defense was top-ranked a year ago. Playoff
hopes will depend on four road games in their last six, including
dates at Tampa and Indy.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis has the best triplets in Manning, James and Marvin
Harrison, harkening to the Cowboys Super Bowl era. Manning never
gets sacked (14 in '99) and the offense rarely is stopped. Jim Mora
believes its defense will be better because of last year's
experience, better depth and attention to forcing more turnovers.
The Colts had just 10 picks a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Division champ: Indianapolis, 12-4. Wild card: Buffalo, 9-7.
</P>
<P>
   AFC CENTRAL: It's quite an advantage for Tennessee and
Jacksonville to count six wins against the Bengals, Browns and
Steelers before the opening kick. Cleveland hit a parlay last year,
finishing 31st in offense and defense. The defense should be
better, but there's no backup to quarterback Tim Couch and his
receivers are average. Cincinnati is excited about Akili Smith and
rookie receiver Peter Warrick, but defense, not skill talent, has
always been the Bengals' problem. Pittsburgh's steady loss of
personnel to free agency has finally caught up with them. They're
gasping on both lines and in danger of being non-competitive,
especially with Kent Graham-Kordell Stewart the weakest QB 1-2
north of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore is a hot pick because Brian Bilick's offense played
great late and its defense ranked second. Rookie RB Jamal Lewis and
WR Travis Taylor bring depth and speed to the offense, and the
defense has eight dynamic players. Jacksonville may be in decline
because of losses on the line, the injury-plagued RB Fred Taylor,
and the loss of defensive back Carnell Lake for the year, but they
could make a late run with games against the Browns, Cards, Bengals
and Giants in December.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Fisher's Titans should be improved in '00 with Carl Pickens
adding speed at receiver and a defense that is more steady than
flashy despite the presence of Jevon Kearse. The second half slate
is an advantage: three straight home games in November and December
games versus the Eagles, Bengals, Browns and Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Division champ: Tennessee (12-4). Wild cards: Jacksonville
(11-5), Baltimore (10-6).
</P>
<P>
   AFC WEST: Three teams are in transition. San Diego will try to
win with Ryan Leaf, and it may not be his fault if they don't.
Leaf's not exactly surrounded by great players. Junior Seau's
defense wore down in the second half a year ago. It's a shame
ex-Raider aide Gunther Cunningham inherited Kansas City at a time
when the team's personnel is in decline. Seattle backed into a
playoff spot last season it didn't deserve, and Mike Holmgren can't
rebuild as fast as he'd like because of the cap.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves your Raiders, who lost 8 games by 34 points last
season and haven't been to the playoffs since 1993. Al Davis was
praised for a savvy first-round draft pick of kicker Sebastian
Janikowski, but maybe he was just saving money, since kickers don't
get the same draft money as regular players. The Raiders ranked in
the top ten in offense and defense last year and were in every
game, but it's a mistake to assume they'll get better.
</P>
<P>
   Denver gets a healthy Terrell Davis back, quarterback Brian
Griese has gained experience, and the defense still has a lot of
good parts. By throwing their season finale, they also secured a
fifth-place schedule that gives them games against the three NFC
West dregs and both entries in Ohio. Five wins is a nice head start
for a team anxious to get back on top.
</P>
<P>
   Division champ: Denver (11-5).
</P>
<P>
   First round playoffs: Denver over Buffalo, Jacksonville over
Baltimore. Second round: Indianapolis over Jacksonville, Tennessee
over Denver. AFC title game: Indianapolis over Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   NFC East: Arizona, the team most likely to seek asylum in Los
Angeles, is naturally the dreg of the NFC. They suffer from
personnel malnutrition because of a cheap owner and injuries.
Dallas (Joey Galloway) and New York (Ron Dayne) add potential
solutions in an effort to keep pace with Washington, but they still
look short on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia believes the combo of Donovan McNabb and Duce
Staley can take the Eagles into the playoffs, and while its defense
is small, it gets after people. The Eagles also have a fifth-place
schedule. Washington may be everyone's pick to click, but it also
has the most to lose with owner Dan Snyder micromanaging the club.
The Redskins should open 4-0 and close 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Division champ: Washington (12-4). Wild card: Philadelphia
(8-8).
</P>
<P>
   NFC Central: The best division in football offers five teams
that appear capable of slobber-knocking each other. Chicago's
fast-paced offense will bother some, but opening at Minnesota and
Tampa projects 0-2 and the opportunity for panic. Detroit is
considered a sleeper based on James Stewart filling Barry Sanders'
shoes and early home games with Washington, Tampa, Minnesota and
Green Bay at home early. But they also have a three-game road trip
after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota may overcome the rawness of Daunte Culpepper at QB,
but the defense remains a sieve. The quick hook Green Bay gave to
Ray Rhodes could lead the Packers back, but they're weak up front
on defense and they can't depend on Dorsey Levens to stay healthy.
The Bucs made it to the NFC title game on its defense and added
Keyshawn Johnson on offense, which should be enough to outdistance
the division competition.
</P>
<P>
   Division champ: Tampa Bay (11-5). Wild cards: Green Bay (9-7),
Minnesota (9-7), Detroit (9-7).
</P>
<P>
   NFC West: The Saints eternally fill holes and stumble about.
They play five of seven on the road after the opener and will try
to win with Jeff Blake on offense and six newcomers on defense. The
49ers probably won't be any better than they were a year ago
(4-12), when the salary cap devastated their personnel on defense.
Atlanta's Chris Chandler can't stay healthy and Jamal Anderson
won't be the same back after ACL surgery. Carolina rallied late
last season behind Steve Beuerlein, but it addressed age and injury
concerns by signing a bunch of aging and infirm free agents.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Super Bowl champ St. Louis. Oddly, everyone is
doubting a Rams repeat because Mike Martz is a rookie head coach
and some still think they were a fluke. Well, the schedule's no
fluke. It still includes eight games against a weak division and
only four games against playoff teams. Of their first 10 opponents,
nine were non-qualifiers a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Issac Bruce, Marshall Faulk and Kurt Warner all get hurt,
they should clinch the division before Thanksgiving and play all of
their playoff games on their own rug, until the Super Bowl, which
is outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Division champ: St. Louis (12-4).
</P>
<P>
   First round playoffs: Tampa Bay over Minnesota, Green Bay over
Detroit. Second round: St. Louis over Green Bay, Tampa Bay over
Washington. NFC title: St. Louis over Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Super Bowl: Indianapolis over St. Louis. Just because we don't
want to see Georgia hoist another trophy.

 &HT;    History remembers one family ravaged by deadly hurricane of
1900By Kevin Robbins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON ISLAND, Texas _ The father and his son pose on the log
with their backs to the sea. Behind them, waves lick the beach, but
the water retreats until the next swell comes, racing up the shore
as far as it can before it dies in a puddle of foam. Then it races
back.
</P>
<P>
   These are the Ratisseau men: William Louis Ratisseau and his
father, Pierre.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows when the picture was made, but family history tells
us it was sometime before the late summer of 1900, when the sea
exploded and buried Pierre. William Louis survived, but his wife
died, and so did three of his children, and for that matter so did
most of the Ratisseaus who long ago settled this narrow spit of
sand on the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical cyclone swept into coastal Texas on a September
morning a century ago. Rain fell. Winds whistled. The water of
Galveston Bay pushed one way and the water of the gulf pushed
another and, as evening began to fall, the two met somewhere in the
middle of the doomed island. For almost six hours on Sept. 8, 1900,
there was not a fleck of land left. There were no streets. There
was no beach. There was no Galveston. There was only water.
</P>
<P>
   CITY DESECRATED BY HURRICANE
</P>
<P>
   A bustling port city with aristocrats and elegant bathhouses on
piers, Galveston knew a population of more than 37,000 the morning
of the storm. The fury of the hurricane cut that by a fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Galveston died all day long, but the hurricane
took most of its victims early that night, when a 4-foot surge of
salt water crashed through the streets like something no man had
seen, with the power of wet concrete and the speed of quicksilver.
At dawn the next day, a shimmering morning on the beach, at least
7,000 islanders were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Ratisseau was among them.
</P>
<P>
   His son was not.
</P>
<P>
   William Louis Ratisseau survived the deadliest hurricane in the
history of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his family did not.
</P>
<P>
   The storm erased many lives. Many families suffered. But by the
time the victims of the great storm of 1900 had been burned or
buried or lost forever to the sea, it was likely the Ratisseaus had
lost the most.
</P>
<P>
   So this much is known: The photograph of the old man and his son
was made before the morning the water kept encroaching the shore
and the city of Galveston became the floor of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   CALM BEFORE THE STORM
</P>
<P>
   Heavy swells washed ashore the night before the storm, but there
were few clouds. The constellations burned in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Louisa Ratisseau and her five young children left their home to
walk the few blocks to the beach. The young ones wanted to watch
the waves. The children _ three boys and two girls, all younger
than 12 _ scampered up and down the packed sand, stopping to look
at the horse-drawn buggies clattering along the shore. The beach
hummed. A crowd had gathered to see the seas strengthen. Wave after
wave hammered the shore in the stark light of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere over the gulf, a wall of wind marched toward Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Louisa's husband, a plumber, had been called to Beaumont to
supervise work on a new hospital. William Louis was a respected
tradesman, a man from a large and well-known island family who kept
a shop on Tremont Street and attended Mass at St. Patrick's
Catholic Church. He was known as one of the best plumbers around,
which is why, as his wife and children rose on the morning of Sept.
8 to a bronze sky and a sun with an unsettling ring around it, he
was miles and miles from home.
</P>
<P>
   George Albert Ratisseau was the first to notice the strange
skies.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old boy and his mother stood by the window at their
home on Avenue R, watching the clouds, and the disappearing sun.
Flecks of rain dotted the glass. The breeze freshened from the
northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, observers at the National Weather Bureau Office
studied their data. The barometric pressure had dropped slightly
overnight, noted the chief observer, Isaac M. Cline. He began a
telegraph to bureau headquarters in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually heavy swells from southwest, intervals one to five
minutes overflowing low places south portion city three to four
blocks from beach. Such high water with opposing winds never
observed previously.
</P>
<P>
   The gulf was rising against the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   The highest elevation on Galveston Island stood 8.7 feet above
sea level. But the early settlers knew a good port when they saw
one, so they sailed their ships into Galveston Bay and began to
build their city.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston was founded in 1839, but the 32-mile-long island
already had its reputation. Years before, during the colonization
of Texas, Stephen F. Austin visited the island and declared:
``Galveston is the best natural harbor that I have seen.'' The
island protected the bay from the ornery surf of the gulf. Wharves
were built for the ships. Soon, much of the cotton grown on
American plantations was aboard ocean-going vessels loaded in
Galveston and bound for faraway lands.
</P>
<P>
   And a French-born cattle rancher and stained-glass artisan named
Pierre Auguste Alfred Ratisseau sailed into the bay.
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY TAKEN BY THE STORM
</P>
<P>
   The rain worsened. The wind roared. The needle on the barometer
at the weather bureau slipped, closing on low pressures never
before recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Late that morning at the Ratisseau home, Louisa ordered her two
oldest sons to strip the clothes from the line outside and haul
them downtown, where a Chinese family owned a laundry above their
father's office, so the clothes could dry.
</P>
<P>
   George and his 8-year-old brother Benton, whose nickname was
Lump, obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   The two boys were the great-grandsons of Pierre Auguste Alfred
Ratisseau. When the 1850 census was taken, there were six people
with the last name of Ratisseau in Galveston, and they owned $600
in property. By 1900, the family had blossomed. George and Lump had
many aunts and uncles and many more cousins on the island. Most of
them still lived on the sparsely populated west end, where the
original family established a cattle ranch in the 1830s. Everyone
in town knew the Ratisseau cows: they were branded with the shape
of a French wineglass.
</P>
<P>
   The rain worsened.
</P>
<P>
   As the boys made their way downtown, the west end of the island
was drowning.
</P>
<P>
   The wind screamed.
</P>
<P>
   The northeast gusts rose to storm velocity. The weather
observers hoisted the hurricane flags at the bureau inside the Levy
Building, alerting residents to evacuate at once. Whether the
west-end Ratisseaus ever saw the flags is open to speculation, but
this much is fact: The weather bureau stood more than 50 city
blocks from the Ratisseau ranch.
</P>
<P>
   The barometric pressure sank.
</P>
<P>
   George and Lump splashed through deepening water as they made
their way downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, their mother rounded up the three youngest children.
They had to go. Their house was flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Their grandfather had a plan. He loaded everyone into a skiff.
Then Pierre Ratisseau, 69, pulled his grandchildren and their
mother to a larger home in the neighborhood, one with three
stories.
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived, the first floor was full of seawater.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre began handing the children to other refugees through a
second-story window.
</P>
<P>
   He lifted Bessie, who was 6. Then came Kyle, 5. Then Alecia, who
was 18 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother made it inside the house, too.
</P>
<P>
   The grandfather did not.
</P>
<P>
   When his family last saw him, Pierre was groping the foamy water
for the child of the family's housekeeper, a little girl who also
had been on the boat. He dove for her and never came up.
</P>
<P>
   Today, far from coastal Texas, a woman pauses to settle herself
as she tells that story.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Ratisseau never knew her great-grandfather Pierre. She
only knows what her father told her about him.
</P>
<P>
   She knows he wore an earring. That was how the men who found him
knew who he was after the water went down.
</P>
<P>
   She knows he was the old man in the picture she owns, the man
sitting next to her grandfather on the log on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   She knows that moments after he died, the water forced her
grandmother and her children to the third story. She knows that, in
a rush of water and wind, the house then disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Ratisseau also knows the family lore, which is this: As
the hurricane destroyed the three-story house, her grandmother
Louisa held Bessie, Kyle and Alecia as high as she could, so their
heads were above the water. Then, according to a refugee in the
house who survived, Louisa said to her children: ``I'll see you all
in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley is sobbing now. She is on the telephone at her home in
California.
</P>
<P>
   She is thinking of her grandfather, William Louis Ratisseau.
</P>
<P>
   The plumber was far from home that night, when the water
swallowed his island.
</P>
<P>
   ``You understand,'' Shirley, 71, is saying, ``I don't think he
ever stopped mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows this. Because the storm of 1900 became part of her,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``IT WAS EVERYTHING WE HAD AND WOULD BE.''
</P>
<P>
   As the gales blew harder, as the sea rose higher and as more of
their family died, George and Lump Ratisseau waited inside the
laundry for the storm to clear. But the worst was on its way.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:15 p.m., the weather bureau recorded 84 mph sustained
winds, with gusts of 100.
</P>
<P>
   Then the wind gauge vanished.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 p.m., according to the weather bureau's official report,
the gulf flooded Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   The water swelled four feet in four seconds.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 p.m., the bureau logged a barometric pressure of 28.48.
</P>
<P>
   It was the lowest reading ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Water and wind toppled house after house. The flooding gulf
pushed a wall of debris _ timber, brick, mortar, sand _ that buried
people in its path. Oyster shells scored the air like shrapnel.
Pieces of roof slate cut people like sawblades. Telegraph lines
snapped. Lightning fired above. And the Ratisseau family was being
dismantled, one soul at a time.
</P>
<P>
   On the west end of the island, one of William Louis' sisters
perished with her family when the water sprang her home from its
foundation and spun it around on a ghostly, invisible axis.
</P>
<P>
   One of William Louis' brothers and his family sought refuge on
their roof. The swells battered them. Everyone slid in and
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, William Louis' sons, George and Lump, were safe in the
sturdy laundry building.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere else, the hurricane was taking his family.
</P>
<P>
   His cousin Charles Ratisseau died in the storm. So did his wife.
So did their seven children.
</P>
<P>
   His brother John Baptiste Ratisseau died. So did his wife and
their four children.
</P>
<P>
   His brother August Ratisseau died, with his wife and three
children.
</P>
<P>
   His sister Anna Stillman died. So did her husband. So did their
children.
</P>
<P>
   Just as no one knows how many Texans died in the storm of 1900,
no one knows how many Ratisseaus _ and people related to the
Ratisseaus _ were lost. So many were never found. Others were
burned in funeral pyres before they could be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Early estimates suggested 43 relatives of William Louis
Ratisseau died.
</P>
<P>
   His son George _ Shirley's father _ later calculated 78.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Shirley Ratisseau thinks her family was reduced that day by
204.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just people,'' she says. ``It was everything we had
and would be.''
</P>
<P>
   FATHER RETURNS TO RUIN
</P>
<P>
   William Louis Ratisseau got home as soon as he could. He left
Beaumont after the storm, and at the coast found there no longer
was a bridge to cross the bay.
</P>
<P>
   The family lore blurs here. Some versions of what happened next
suggest William Louis got to the island in a rowboat shared by
newspaper reporters from New York. Others say he swam.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Ratisseau tells this story:
</P>
<P>
   Her grandfather found ice tongs near the shore. He pulled them
apart. He straddled a railroad tie lying nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Using the sharp ends of the tongs to dig through the debris, he
pulled himself across Galveston Bay.
</P>
<P>
   He found the body of a child in the water, ``as though God had
put her right there,'' Shirley says.
</P>
<P>
   It was his daughter Bessie.
</P>
<P>
   Later, on land, he found the body of one of his sisters. He
walked up and down the ravaged beach, searching for the rest of his
family. He fell to his knees and dug with his hands through the
piles left by the water. He found some Ratisseaus. He never found
others. He dug until he tore his fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time my father saw him, his hands were just
bleeding,'' Shirley says.
</P>
<P>
   George, Lump and their father were reunited on the island. Their
home was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The storm leveled more than 3,600 houses on Galveston Island.
Many more structures were ruined. The wind sheared the tower at St.
Patrick's Catholic Church, for example, causing it to crash through
the roof of the sanctuary where William Louis Ratisseau once knelt
and prayed his petitions at Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He never found his wife.
</P>
<P>
   William Louis told George one day: We're never going to find
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``He accepted that,'' Shirley says.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a steamship picked up a man afloat on a raft fashioned of
timber and castnet line. It was one of William Louis Ratisseau's
brothers. The man had lost his wife, his children and his eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   Days passed. All over the island, horses pulled wagons piled
with bodies, funeral pyres smoked and bagpipes cried for the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Some islanders vowed to stay. Others looked elsewhere to start
over. William Louis sent George and Lump to live with relatives in
Mansfield because there were so few relatives left in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Then, broken by the weight of his loss, he left.
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY HISTORY DOCUMENTED
</P>
<P>
   Shirley can still hear the voice of her grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want,'' he would say, ``to tell you about your
grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley was about 12, she remembers. ``If nobody came into the
room, he would just kind of go systematically. He would tell me
about his grandfather. He would tell me about the children, how
they named them.'' William Louis would tell his granddaughter about
his wife, Louisa, how she came from a family of Virginia
aristocrats named Maclin, and he would show her pictures of Louisa
when she was young. ``He would smile,'' Shirley says.
</P>
<P>
   Then he would tell her about the storm. The smile would vanish,
as his relatives vanished in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone,'' William Louis Ratisseau would say, reciting the names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone. All of them, into the Gulf of Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley wrote about the ordeal much later, for the newspaper in
San Antonio. The year was 1964. Her story, which summarized the
family research she had done over the years, was published the day
after Hurricane Hilda slammed coastal Louisiana, killing 25.
</P>
<P>
   William Louis Ratisseau died at the age of 86.
</P>
<P>
   His son George owned a hunting and fishing lodge in Rockport
until he died the night before Shirley was to graduate from high
school. After Shirley married, she and her family operated the
lodge until Hurricane Carla demolished it in 1961. Then Shirley
moved away from the coast forever _ first to inland Texas,
including many years in Austin, where her two children, Darin
Ratisseau and Leiane Alden still live, and then to California.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane followed her. Long ago, before he died, her father
took Shirley aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very ill,'' Shirley says he told her. ``I want to find out
exactly _ and prove _ the history of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   She has done that ever since. She has researched her family for
four decades, as far away as the National Archives in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only monument I could build to my people,'' Shirley
says.
</P>
<P>
   Her people: The Ratisseaus of Galveston. There were many a
century ago. After that September day, when the sea swallowed the
island and the wind ripped through town and everything changed
forever, there were few. Now the 100th anniversary of the storm
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   And there is one.
</P>
<P>
   STARTING OVER
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Ratisseau sits on the sofa in her dark home wheezing.
</P>
<P>
   Her hair is pulled neatly back, but she has trouble talking for
long stretches. The bronchitis keeps her inside most of the time.
The metal storm shutters on her windows keep out the light. At her
age, in her health, Evelyn has little interest in venturing outside
on this sticky Galveston morning in August. She is 86, after all,
born on a January day in the middle of Tennessee, two years after
the plumber William Louis Ratisseau celebrated the birth of a son
he and his new wife named Roger.
</P>
<P>
   His family in ruins, William Louis traveled to New Orleans after
leaving Galveston island. He married his second wife there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1902, William Louis and his new wife returned. They started a
new family in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had sand between their toes,'' Evelyn says now. ``They
couldn't stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   Their Galveston changed over the years. A seawall was built to
baffle future storms, and it did just that when the hurricane of
1915 battered the Texas coast. The seawall saved the island. So did
the fact that after the storm of 1900, the elevation of the entire
city was raised (the effort took six years) to protect it from
floods.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn married Roger Ratisseau in 1938, at his family's home.
</P>
<P>
   Roger became a plumber like his father. He and Evelyn lived in
LaMarque for a time, but moved back to Galveston in 1950. They
never left again. They raised five children. Roger died years ago.
All of his children are grown. None of them live in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Only his widow is left: Evelyn, the last Ratisseau on the island
where it all began.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks south of her home, where the palm trees are bent to
the north by the constant and staggering wind, the caramel surf
pounds the beach in a fury of foam. Red flags at the lifeguard
stations snap in the gulf breeze: heavy swells. A storm is near. It
is hurricane season.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn knows. She tracks tropical storms on a newspape map
under the coffee table, marking their movements with a blue ink
pen. She has been watching this one because she, a Ratisseau,
understands the force the weather exacts on the open water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, it was 120 miles from Brownsville,'' she says of
the storm. ``It could come up the whole coast.''
</P>
<P>
   The barometer on her wall reads 31. The sky is as clear as
glass.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the waves roll up the beach. It is the week before
school starts. Hundreds of families are vacationing in Galveston.
They are out there splashing in the surf, getting a sunburn.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere over the gulf, the winds swirl. The waves roll up the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   Then they roll back.

 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Cosby has a jet named Camille, for his wife, and
even Oprah got a jet,'' Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. said recently over
lunch at City Hall, a restaurant near his law office in Lower
Manhattan. ``She wanted a plane just like Bill Cosby's. It's, like,
amazing. He goes to sleep on the plane. It's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly dazzled by the luxury of personal transportation,
Cochran has studied the subject. He is now getting a jet, too.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran, who broke into the top-level national law leagues when
he successfully defended O.J. Simpson against charges that he
murdered his former wife, is now hitting the major money leagues as
well, and he has the status-symbol issue down pat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not getting a GII,'' he conceded, his voice showing a
tinge of disappointment that he is not buying a Gulfstream model
favored by many chief executives. ``My plane won't be that big _
more like a Hawker or a Citation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cochran, showing his newfound financial prudence, will not
make the purchase rashly. His law firm, which is building a
national practice, is still deciding whether to buy or lease the
plane. ``We are going to see how often we would use it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Success is hardly new to Cochran, who is now 62. Long before his
disciplined, relentless cross-examination and his flamboyant attire
became a daily staple of the grueling O.J. Simpson murder trial, he
was a prominent lawyer with a busy criminal and civil practice. His
performance at the televised trial, however, made Cochran, a member
of the ``dream team'' defense, a celebrity in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not leave him as rich as it left him famous. Now he
is trying to close that gap, adopting a new money-management
philosophy that includes putting more money into the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   His success ``allowed him to move up the lawyer food chain,''
said his accountant, John Baiardi, a partner at Mitchell &AMP; Titus,
the nation's largest minority-owned accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran no longer takes criminal cases, but he has a thriving
personal practice that includes intellectual property,
personal-injury and business lawsuits. And last year, in a move
that leverages his brand name, he merged his firm with Schneider,
Kleinick, Weitz, Damashek &AMP; Shoot, a personal-injury firm based in
New York. Partners share the legal fees in cases they win together.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran says his net worth is more than $5 million _ in
retirement plans, private investments, a sprinkling of stocks and
his major holding, real estate. His properties include homes in Los
Angeles, including beach homes in Marina del Rey for himself and
his parents, a new condominium in Manhattan where he now spends
one-third of his time, and two apartment buildings in West
Hollywood that he bought as an investment. That net worth figure
does not include the value of his law firm.
</P>
<P>
   But he may be about to make a quantum leap.
</P>
<P>
   Within five years, his net worth could soar to $25 million or
even $50 million, Baiardi said, as fees roll in from the exploding
demand for his legal services.
</P>
<P>
   To which Cochran replied, ``I hope we will do that well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester Brickman, a law firm compensation expert and a professor
at the Benjamin N. Cardoza School of Law, agreed that the
personal-injury fees could contribute to a bump-up in Cochran's net
worth. Lawyers in that area are very selective about the cases they
take on, have a high success rate and often reap big financial
rewards. But maybe not as high as Baiardi suggested. ``It is in the
realm of possibility that Cochran can net over $10 million a
year,'' Brickman said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Cochran was earning $1 million or so annually by
the time the Simpson trial ended in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I was interested in earning money,'' Cochran said.
``Now, I'm interested in what happens to it. I don't want to be
haphazard _ I want a team I can count on.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of people like Earl G. Graves Sr., the publisher
of Black Enterprise magazine and leading black entrepreneur, whom
he had met through some business dealings, he is tapping into the
African-American financial establishment in New York. The goal is
to help build that dream team and to create a network of
relationships in the financial sphere, much as he once did in the
legal establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran's new focus on finances started in early 1997, when he
decided that he had been spending so much time in Manhattan for his
program on Court TV that he ought to put down roots. So he bought a
pied a terre on West 57th Street in Midtown for about $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   After settling in, he called Graves. ``He is one of my gurus,''
Cochran said. ``Earl is into wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves said Cochran peppered him with questions. ``He said,
`Tell me what I need to know in town,''' Graves recalled. First, he
steered him to Carver Bancorp, the largest black-run bank in the
country, where Cochran's personal-injury clients could borrow
money. ``Then Johnnie told me, `The way you look is the way I ought
to look.''' So I sent him to the John Atchison hair salon on West
56th Street. He told me it was too expensive, so I sent him a gift
certificate.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Cochran's finances, ``I asked him, `What are you going to
do about your own money?''' Graves added. ``And he asked me who I
should invest with.'' Graves introduced him to Bert N. Mitchell of
Mitchell &AMP; Titus and other black financial leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has been a real eye-opener for me,'' Cochran said.
``Most of the people in L.A. who have money are entertainers. And
L.A. is more spread out _ here you talk, you find out what other
guys are doing. In New York, everything is geared to business.''
</P>
<P>
   The team that Cochran has assembled is ethnically diverse.
Guided by Baiardi, who is white, and Jeri Norris, a black financial
consultant and a stockbroker at Merrill Lynch, Cochran is educating
himself about more sophisticated investing strategies. ``We didn't
grow up on Wall Street, but we should move there now,'' he said,
remembering something that Jesse Jackson said while trying to
encourage blacks to invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have gotten into the stock market earlier,'' Cochran
said over the recent two-hour lunch of seafood and creamed spinach.
</P>
<P>
   Norris is seeing to that. Wanting to preserve Cochran's capital,
she said, ``we want a mix of old-economy and technology stocks.''
Among her picks for his portfolio are Sun Microsystems, J.P. Morgan
and the American International Group. Her long-term goal for him is
70 percent equities, 20 percent bonds and 10 percent cash.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran said he preferred to leave the decisions to Norris: ``My
wife and I don't want to wake up worrying about the market,'' he
said. But he did make one choice: Last year, he bought about
$150,000 worth of Time Warner stock. He knew the company because it
owned Court TV, where for two years he had a talk show on legal
issues, but he does even know today what the value of that
investment is _ except that the stock has gone up.
</P>
<P>
   Though he does not want the final responsibility of making
investment decisions, Cochran wants to know the issues and speaks
often to Norris. To cement the relationship, he and his wife
recently took Norris and her husband to the theater and to dinner
at Aquavit in Midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran is also listening to advice about his real estate and
about the kinds of deals in which he invests. Gone are the days of
jumping into deals heard about at cocktail parties. Cochran says
future deals will be more carefully vetted by Baiardi, ``who is my
sounding board.''
</P>
<P>
   if Cochran cannot resist gambling in venture capital and private
equity, Baiardi wants him to go only with blue-chip
recommendations. ``It is one thing if your brother-in-law
introduces you to someone who has a deal,'' Baiardi said. ``It is
another thing when you go to an investment bank and they do some
private equity.''
</P>
<P>
   Baiardi would also like Cochran to sell the two apartment
buildings in West Hollywood. ``If you are in real estate, you have
to collect your own rents,'' Baiardi said. ``It's one thing to own
commercial property that Trump manages. It is another thing to own
rental properties and collect rent.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Baiardi is not having a problem convincing Cochran. Though real
estate had represented his main investment for years, the risks
became apparent in the late 1980s. ``You never thought about the
stock market when I started buying real estate,'' he recalled.
``You just assumed real estate was stable and would keep going up.
Then it went down, so that was unsettling.''
</P>
<P>
   A Merrill Lynch team suggested that Cochran borrow the entire
purchase price of his new condominium against his existing real
estate, rather than raising cash to make a large down payment. The
move let him deduct all the interest and reduce taxes. ``His first
instinct was to pay off as much as possible,'' Norris recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. ``My first thing is always to pay things off,''
Cochran said. But he said he had learned that ``you can get
deductions and it does not always pay to pay it off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to get good tax advice,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran is even toning down his lifestyle a bit _ to be less
showy. No more Rolls-Royces, like the one he drives around Los
Angeles. Today, he said, he likes ``stealth wealth _ Jeeps, all
that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think now, where I am, I would not drive a Rolls in New
York,'' he added. ``But as a young man, it was a sign of success.
My clients wanted to see that. Driving a Toyota or a Mazda was
terrible. If you didn't have a Rolls, you weren't very
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   He has given up his Rolexes, too. ``After a period of time,
that's not as important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran has also become more pragmatic about his personal life,
which was once in disarray. The other night, he said, he and his
wife of 15 years, Dale, a marketing executive who is now starting a
new business, were watching an episode on HBO's ``Sex and the
City'' that dealt with prenuptial agreements. ``I mentioned a
prenup and we laughed about it,'' he said. ``But absolutely I would
have one now. My estate has gone up, and I think in this world,
that's the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran's current life is a far cry from a childhood that began
in Shreveport, La., where his father was once a sharecropper. But
the family was ambitious. By the time he was 6, his father and
mother had packed up their four children and moved to California,
where the elder Cochran eventually became a successful insurance
salesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Cochrans were also determined that their children receive a
good education. They sent Cochran to Los Angeles High School, which
had a far better academic reputation than the school closer to his
home.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting the homes of wealthy white friends whom he met at
school was a revelation for Cochran, who grew up without television
or other entree to that world. ``I had no way to know how they
lived before that,'' he said. ``Remember, there was a big class
thing. How would you know unless you worked for them?'' he added,
speaking of his friends' families.
</P>
<P>
   And though Cochran made friends at the school whom he has kept
until this day, he said he did not bring them to his house.
</P>
<P>
   His parents encouraged him to become a professional. His mother
wanted him to be a doctor, but Cochran thought that law would suit
him better, letting him use his skills of persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, after graduating from Loyola Law School in Los Angeles,
he became the first black law clerk in the Los Angeles city
attorney's office, making $608 a month. His job involved
prosecuting people, primarily black, who were charged with avoiding
arrest. But that, he came to believe, was aimed at keeping them
from filing civil suits against the city for compensation for their
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   By 1965, he and Gerald Lenoir, a seasoned criminal lawyer, had
started a practice together. Their first windfall came fast. When
rioting exploded in Los Angeles' poor, mainly black, Watts
district, Cochran was alone in the office. As the rioting escalated
and the police began making arrests, clients came to the office
until 11 or 12 at night, putting retainer fees on his desk _ in
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first time I became aware: `Geez, you can make a
lot of money doing this,''' Cochran said. ``People would come with
$3,000 or $4,000. It was sad. You had a weird feeling. The city was
going up in smoke. But it was the first time I knew the practice of
law could be remunerative.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran learned quickly that criminal defense lawyers need the
money up front. ``They used to say, `Get the money while the tears
are falling,''' he recalled. Otherwise, he added, an acquitted
client would say, ``I was innocent anyway,'' and a convicted one
would ask, ``What did you do for me?''
</P>
<P>
   His practice expanded to civil cases, including police brutality
suits. ``Later, I started getting the big fees from contingency
cases,'' he said. ``You get one-third after you win, so you got to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   In those years, Cochran worried a lot about the cash flow, often
asking whether any checks had come in while he was in court.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he set parameters. When a known drug dealer showed up
with a suitcase filled with $600,000 in cash, Cochran refused to
represent him. ``It was the most money I had ever seen,'' he said.
``But I knew drugs were killing kids in the black community, and I
didn't take the case. I knew where the money had come from.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, as word spread about his successes, the money poured
in. And Cochran was not shy about spending his earnings on his
family and personal luxuries. ``I would buy clothes and nice
cars,'' he said. At one point, he had six fancy cars. ``It wasn't
always wise,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He spent money on a handful of deals, involving oil, a supper
club, radio stations and other things, with mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   He also spent a lot of money on an extramarital relationship,
according to ``Life After Johnnie Cochran,'' a 1995 book by his
former wife, Barbara Cochran Berry. In 1965, he started a
relationship with Patricia Sikora, who would become the mother of
his only son, Berry wrote. In 1973, according to Berry, he took out
a loan to help pay for a house he was buying for Sikora, and he
tried to get Berry to sign an agreement that she had no rights to
the house, an accusation that Cochran has denied. In the view of
Berry, with whom he has two daughters, he used his money as a form
of manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money and the gifts it bought were the sum and substance of
what a woman had a right to expect from a man,'' she wrote,
interpreting what he conveyed to her. ``This need of women for
money and security were tools to be used in their control, to keep
them in their place.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran said: ``This is ridiculous. My poor dear ex-wife _ it is
not true. She saw a chance to write a book and to try to make some
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Cochrans divorced in 1977 and Cochran married his
current wife in 1985, he continued to send Sikora $4,000 a month,
according to a palimony suit that Sikora filed in 1995 after, she
said, Cochran cut her off.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran said he sent the money because ``I was supporting my
son.'' Now 27, the son, Jonathan Cochran, is on his own, working
for the California Highway Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was dismissed and is on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran's financial contributions extended to other family
members as well. For years, he helped his parents and a brother;
his widowed father now lives with him in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He even sent his first wife a television set as a wedding
present when she remarried. He has also given money away, most
recently creating the Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. Art Fund, financed
with several hundred thousand dollars to help minority artists.
</P>
<P>
   Though he spent his money liberally, his investment strategy was
conservative. (He agrees with a friend who once told him that his
ties were more flamboyant than his investing style.) He stuck with
real estate and he avoided the stock market _ a strategy that
several experts say is common among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market is still the easiest way to get into the
wealth game,'' said Brooke Stephens, author of ``Talking Dollars
and Making Sense: A Wealth-Building Guide for African-Americans.''
``But many blacks don't trust it and don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran said his conservatism was in part a result of memories
from childhood that left him worried about taxes. ``You would hear
stories about Joe Louis and Sammy Davis Jr.'' he recalled. ``They
took Sammy's house away from him. And I would think: I am never
going to be like that. I want to pay my taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You grow up with certain fears,'' he added. ``You want to be
secure. If you have been poor, you understand that if you worked
real hard, you don't want to go back and be there anymore. Tax
problems have always been a big problem for people who became
successful in our community. I vowed that would never be a
problem.''

<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., struggling to cope
with a large recall and strained relations with its biggest
customer, received another blow Friday when federal regulators
warned of safety problems in many Firestone tires sold as
replacements for factory-issued tires on sport utility vehicles and
pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Friday
that Firestone had rebuffed on Thursday a request from regulators
to broaden its current tire recall. The agency took the rare step
Friday of issuing a ``consumer advisory'' suggesting that people
buy new tires at their own expense anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The agency found that 1.4 million more Firestone tires were even
more prone to failure than tires recently recalled on Ford
Explorers and other Ford models.
</P>
<P>
   The safety agency's review, ``indicated that the rate of tread
separations for certain other tire models and sizes exceed those of
the recalled tires, sometimes by a large margin,'' the consumer
advisory said. It added that, ``We are continuing our
investigation, which may result in an order directing Firestone to
recall these tires and any other defective tires. However, in view
of the potential safety risk, NHTSA believes that it is important
to alert the public of its concerns now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone said in a statement that it disagreed with
the agency's analysis of the data. But Firestone dealers will
provide free inspections of tires and will, if customers insist,
replace tires covered by the advisory with other Firestone tires,
or with tires from other manufacturers, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many Firestone dealers are already struggling to cope with
thousands of owners of Ford Explorers and other sport utility
vehicles, who are still seeking replacements for tires covered by a
recall on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer advisory could cause considerable confusion at
Firestone dealerships and auto dealerships across the country over
Labor Day weekend, and perhaps a lot of canceled road trips, as
millions of Americans try to figure out whether the tires that they
bought for their sport utility vehicles and pickups are covered by
the regulators' warning.
</P>
<P>
   Determining whether a tire is covered by the advisory requires
parking the vehicle on a level spot away from traffic and then
crawling under it with a flashlight to read a code embossed on the
interior sidewall of each tire. The code must then be matched with
a list issued Friday by the regulators.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Firestone, a unit of Bridgestone of Japan faces a possible
strike on Saturday by union workers, although the company expressed
optimism that it could reach a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ford Motor Co. cited the advisory as evidence that
scores of fatal crashes involving Explorers were the result of tire
problems, not vehicle defects.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has said that it alerted Firestone to problems in Venezuela
in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona state officials said in interviews Friday that they
had contacted Firestone in the summer of 1996. Robert Descheemaker,
the commodities unit administrator of the state's purchasing
office, said that he sent a letter to Firestone in late July 1996,
alerting the tire maker that the Arizona Game and Fish Department
was having trouble with Firestone tires on its light trucks.
Firestone sent experts out to examine the tires and ended up
sending some of the tires back to its research laboratories for
analysis in early 1997, Descheemaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone concluded that the tires had been improperly
maintained, Descheemaker said. The tire maker continued to say that
Friday about many of the crashes that have occurred. Catherine
Babonis, the bureau chief for support services in the game
department, said that the department had received some credits from
Firestone for new tires.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia McCafferty, a Firestone spokeswoman, said that while she
was not aware of the company's relations with Arizona officials,
Firestone has tried to satisfy all customers with concerns.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Friday's consumer advisory is the strongest action that the
government can take if it has some indications of a problem, but
not the extensive body of engineering and statistical analysis
needed to justify forcing a company to carry out a recall against
its will. While the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
frequently issued such advisories during investigations in the
1970s, it has very seldom done so since then except in a handful of
cases involving child safety seats, said Clarence Ditlow, the
executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer group
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The safety agency's staff and budget were cut in half at the
beginning of the Reagan administration, as part of an effort to
reduce the weight of government regulation on businesses, and the
agency has never regained the size and influence it had in the
Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the replacement tires listed in Friday's advisory have
the letters ``LT'' in their code. This means that they are light
truck tires, often designed for off-road use, and are not passenger
car tires, which have the designation ``P'' in their code. Light
truck tires have been subject to different regulations from car
tires since the 1960s. The light truck tires are designed to carry
more weight but are also not designed to be driven as fast as car
tires.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen R. Kratzke, the safety agency's associate administrator,
said in an interview two weeks ago that the government tested light
truck tires at a top speed of 80 miles per hour, compared with 85
miles per hour in the car test. The government is considering a
requirement that light truck tires meet the same standards as car
tires, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the tires covered by the recall on Aug. 9 were passenger
car tires, which can be used on sport utilities and pickups that
are mostly driven on paved roads.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tires listed in Friday's advisory were original
equipment on sport utility vehicles. Regulators said that these
included some tires on 1991 Chevrolet Blazer sport utility
vehicles, 1991 to 1994 Nissan pickup trucks and 1996 to 1998 Ford
F-150 pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   GM said that fewer than 10,000 of the 211,450 Blazers that it
sold in the 1991 model year had the tires cited in the advisory.
These tires have an excellent safety record, said Brook Lindbert,
GM's director of wheels and tires. Out of more than 1,400
complaints that regulators have received about Firestone tires,
only two involve 1991 Blazers, but one of these complaints said
that a death occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that only 500 tires covered by the advisory had been
installed at the factory on F-150 pickup trucks. Nissan said that
fewer than 20,000 pickups had been equipped with tires mentioned in
the advisory. GM, Ford and Nissan all said that they would do
whatever necessary to satisfy customers with complaints about
factory-issued tires, including possibly replacing the tires.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The recall on Aug. 9 covers 14.4 million 15-inch tires produced
as original equipment for sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks
from 1991 until January of this year, but Ford and Firestone
estimate that only 6.5 million of these tires are still in use.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's consumer advisory said that many of the 1.4 million
tires are probably no longer in use either.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tires covered by the consumer advisory Friday were
manufactured in Decatur, Ill., a factory that Ford has cited as
having quality problems. The Ford pickup tires in the advisory are
P235/70R16 Wilderness tires, which means that have a 16-inch
diameter. All of the tires covered by the current recall are
15-inch tires, but plaintiffs' lawyers have called for 16-inch
tires on Explorers and other sport utility vehicles to be included,
and regulators have been reviewing the 16-inch tires as well since
they began their investigation in early May.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has said repeatedly that the 16-inch tires are safe.

LOOKING TO REGAIN GROUND, BUSH TURNS UP THE HEAT ON GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  By   JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAFAYETTE, La. _ Undaunted by a blistering sun, Gov. George W.
Bush delivered a fiery denunciation of Vice President Al Gore's
credibility on Friday, telling more than 2,000 sweaty but
boisterous supporters that the Clinton administration had
repeatedly failed to fulfill its campaign pledges of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on a theme likely to be a central part of his fall
strategy, Bush mocked his Democratic opponent for making pledges
this year that sounded like ones he made in 1992: to cut taxes on
the middle class and create a prescription drug benefit for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its kind of like an echo from the past,'' Bush said. ``They're
having to campaign on it again. But our message is: You had your
chance, you have not led, and we will.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the Republicans began broadcasting a tough new
commercial attacking Gore's character, Bush continued to vow that
he would elevate political discourse in Washington if elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's better days are ahead when we have leadership that
will work to change the tone in our nation's capital,'' he said
from a podium on the airport tarmac here.
</P>
<P>
   Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, said of Bush's
remarks, ``It's hypocritical of Bush to talk about a change of tone
in Washington while launching a negative personal attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The two weeks since the end of the Democratic convention have
not been particularly good for Bush, who has seen his lead in most
national polls evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a morning news conference aboard his campaign plane, Bush
expressed few concerns and said he felt that the campaign was ``in
excellent shape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do I feel we're in good shape, by looking at the
polls, I feel our team is unified and enthused, and I'm very
pleased with where we are in the campaign,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides often point to the size of his crowds as evidence
of his momentum. He has drawn thousands of energized supporters in
the last few days. And while Bush often seemed subdued early in the
week, on Thursday and again on Friday, he looked loose, confident
and animated.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Gore of being unable to work with Republicans, Bush
praised a Democratic senator from Louisiana, John B. Breaux, who
has co-authored a bipartisan plan for revamping Medicare that Bush
broadly supports. Gore opposes the plan, which calls for
introducing more private competition into the Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to bring Republicans and Democrats together to make
sure the promise of Medicare is kept to our seniors,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the audience here were pleased with the
Republicans' tougher tone this week, saying they were worried that
Bush was slipping a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he has to go on the offensive,'' said Elaine Curry,
55, a secretary to an oil company who met Bush on Friday. ``Dang,
it's a campaign, and you have to fight.''

ACLU LEADER TO LEAVE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION FOR A FRIENDLIER ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, Ira Glasser clams up. For several entire nanoseconds,
he is embarrassed and fumbling for words.
</P>
<P>
   He has waxed on for three hours, impossible to turn off, a
logorrheic torrent full of aggressive pride about the people he
associates with professionally: skinheads, Nazis, pornographers,
cultists, fascists, Communists and any additional species of -ists
that might offend the public.
</P>
<P>
   No question has come close to wobbling him. Did he suppress the
free-speech rights of his children? Is it awkward for a nice Jewish
guy from New York City to sit down with neo-Nazis? Does he ever
defend nice people? It is hard enough to get a question in, and he
grabs each one _ almost literally, his arms flailing over his desk
_ and answers it easily, with the calm assurance of a major league
hitter facing a Little League pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Then he is asked a question that stops him: Where is his
computer? The rush of words halts, and for an eighth of an instant
he has no idea what to say. ``You have discovered my Luddite
secret,'' Glasser admitted. Ruefully, he picked up a pen in one
hand and a yellow pad in the other and explained that he used them
rather than a computer, adding: ``They never crash. They never get
viruses.''
</P>
<P>
   Glasser, who is 62, has ushered the American Civil Liberties
Union into the new century, helping to transform it in his 22 years
as executive director, and yet, it turns out, he left himself
behind, at least in technological terms. But he will have time to
catch up and get his first cell phone and desktop computer, for the
ACLU will announce next week that he is retiring on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement will be a milestone for the 300,000-member
organization, and a nationwide search for a successor is already
beginning. But one of Glasser's legacies is that after having taken
over at a time of financial crisis, in the aftermath of the group's
defense of the right of Nazis to march in the heavily Jewish
community of Skokie, Ill., he leaves a smoothly running,
financially strong organization that he says (with the faintest
hint of regret) will get along just fine without him.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues say Glasser, for all his own lack of intimacy with
anything more technical than a pen and paper, will be remembered as
a modernizer _ as a 1960s rebel who turned himself into a
fund-raiser, manager and chief executive and who turned the ACLU
from a chaotic group of young lawyers in threadbare offices with
pizza crusts lurking under broken chairs into a quasi corporation
whose 18th-floor headquarters in Lower Manhattan have the hushed
feel of a law firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ira Glasser changed,'' mused Samuel Walker, a professor of
criminal justice at the University of Nebraska who is the author of
a history of the ACLU. ``He was an issue-driven person, and never
in his wildest dreams _ or nightmares _ would he have thought of
becoming a manager. Now he can talk to you about mailings and their
response rates for two hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Glasser plans to devote his retirement not to grand new crusades
but to family, basketball and beaches. In a fund-raiser recently,
family members bought him the opportunity to play one-on-one for 10
minutes with the former Knick Walt Frazier _ and he nearly bursts
with pride as he relates that the game ended in a tie, 12-12.
</P>
<P>
   Glasser, born and raised in New York City, was an odd leader for
the ACLU, in that he never studied law. Until diverted by the
1960s, he was a math professor at Queens College and Sarah
Lawrence. It was good training: of all the audiences he has faced,
he says, none have been so hostile as college students in required
freshman calculus. Glasser joined the civil liberties union's New
York affiliate in 1967 and ever since has been energetically
defending the rights of people to express sentiments that he
abhors. One fond moment came in 1968, when George C. Wallace, whose
segregationist views were the opposite of Glasser's, was running
for president and was denied use of Shea Stadium to hold a rally.
Glasser went to meet Wallace's lieutenants and introduced them to
the lawyer he had arranged to defend their right to use the
stadium: Eleanor Holmes Norton, a black woman who is now the
District of Columbia's delegate to the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Nadine Strossen, the law professor who serves as ACLU president,
a nonmanagerial position, said Glasser's greatest legacy was to
have helped forge the group into a truly nationwide organization,
with 53 offices around the country. Another of his legacies, one
that annoyed some members, is that he developed a broader agenda
that not only emphasizes free speech, but also underscores gay
rights, legalized abortion, affirmative action, free expression on
the Internet and hostility to racial profiling. In addition, he has
put less emphasis on litigation and much more on cultivating public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if Glasser is not a lawyer and has helped move the ACLU
away from its traditional focus on the courts, callers trying to
reach him around midday are sometimes told that he is away because
of ``a very important court appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   That means he is off playing basketball.

 &HT;    Fast start a must for Falcons
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. _ When the Falcons open their season Sunday
at the Georgia Dome against the 49ers, it will count as just one of
16 games on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But the game is far more important than that; openers almost
always are.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves knows that better than most.
</P>
<P>
   As an NFL player, assistant and head coach, he is 26-8 on
opening day, 11-8 as a head coach. Of the 26 times he has been on
the winning sideline, his team has gone to the playoffs 22 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back through history . . . very few times has a team
lost their opening game and made the playoffs,'' he said. ``It sets
the tone for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, of the 12 teams that ended up in the playoffs, eight
won their openers, and three of the other four _ Buffalo, Seattle
and Washington _ lost to eventual playoff teams.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, with more youth than perhaps any team in the league,
aren't likely to end up in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the eight times Reeves has been on a losing sideline in
an opener, that team failed to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, when he was coach of the Broncos, Denver went 11-5 and
missed the playoffs. If his team had not lost its opener, the
Broncos would have made the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Falcons are 17-17 in opening games but have put
together just eight winning seasons. In those eight, however, they
won the opener six times.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just about the effect in the standings. It's also about
the attitude that victory fosters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all mean the same in the end record,'' quarterback Chris
Chandler said, ``but in the momentum you can build, and with it
being a division game with the 49ers, it's kind of like birdieing
the first hole to get your round off to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's good that the Falcons are playing a division foe
right away. Atlanta is 11-4 in openers when the opponent is from
the NFC West, including 2-0 against the Niners.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were 4-1 in the preseason, and made earnest efforts
to address Reeves' chief concerns of improving the running game and
run defense, but concerns remain.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the last time the Falcons had a winning preseason, in
1990, they followed up a 4-0 mark with a 5-11 regular season.
</P>
<P>
   More important, after five mostly injury-free weeks, they have
been hit with a number of problems. The team is light in personnel
on both lines and at linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   But defensive tackle Travis Hall, who will start at end because
of Brady Smith's pulled groin, said he thinks the preseason was
positive enough to build on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can carry over the way we've been playing, and start out
with a bang and get rolling, I think it's a huge, huge
difference,'' Hall said. ``If you don't win your first game, you're
always reeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were reeling last season after a season-opening
17-14 loss to the Vikings in a game they had chances to win. Before
they knew it, they were 0-4.
</P>
<P>
   This game is even more important because the next two are on the
road, at Denver and Carolina. Then comes a home game against the
defending Super Bowl champion Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Denver is stout at home, and Carolina is widely picked to finish
ahead of the Falcons in the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   So three of the first four games will be against division
rivals, and the other played in a stadium difficult on visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Denver also will be jacked up for Reeves' first return as a head
coach since he was fired eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``How we start is really important,'' Reeves said. ``If you
don't do well in your division, you usually don't make the
playoffs. The first four games are really crucial for us.''

U.N. PARLEY TO BRING TRAFFIC CRUSH, TIGHT SECURITY AND PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEAN E. MURPHY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Forget, just for a moment, that some of the
weightiest world issues are up for discussion next week during the
Millennium Summit at the United Nations, the biggest gathering of
heads of state and government ``in human history,'' as the United
Nations says. Poverty. Global warming. AIDS. Illiteracy. Urban
decay.
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk New York weighty _ in-your-backyard weighty.
</P>
<P>
   Unspeakable traffic snarls and some 175 curb-skipping motorcades
around Kennedy International Airport in Queens and the United
Nations Plaza on the East Side. Several thousand U.S. Secret
Service agents elbowing their way through 36 hotels and countless
restaurants in pursuit of their 245 ``protectees,'' from President
Clinton to Prime Minister Ionatana Ionatana of Tuvalu.
</P>
<P>
   Police lookouts at major bridges and tunnels in Manhattan, 6,000
additional officers patrolling the streets and a knot of road
closings between 30th and 59th Streets and between Franklin D.
Roosevelt Drive and the Avenue of the Americas. Ninety-one
scheduled public protests with a crush of demonstrators. Even
mountains of garbage, piled on barges destined for the Fresh Kills
landfill on Staten Island, left rotting upstream because of
precautions against terrorism on the East River.
</P>
<P>
   All of this will be dumped on a testy citizenry slogging back to
work after the Labor Day finale to a summer that mostly did not
happen, and on a city already besieged by the tennis crowds at the
U.S. Open in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me thank in advance the good people of New York, our
neighbors in New York, for their patience,'' said Louise Frechette,
the deputy secretary-general of the United Nations, the other day
in announcing the details of the three-day summit conference, which
begins on Wednesday. ``We know their patience will be tried in the
course of the summit conference week, but we would like to invite
them to be patient and to reassure them that this is really for a
good cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience is not a characteristic generally associated with New
Yorkers. Add an expected 159 world leaders and 86 first spouses to
the 7 million or so people here who already consider themselves
very important, and the United Nations is looking at a titanic
clash of egos and schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Frechette knows that. So does Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
most everyone else who works at the U.N. headquarters. (After all,
they live here as well, one official pointed out.) That is why New
Yorkers are witnessing what the United Nations calls another first
in human history: the world organization's effort to sell itself to
the city as a worthy neighbor through a $700,000 promotional
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 49 years since the 39-story Secretariat building on
First Avenue opened as the United Nations' official home, but it
seems it is never too late for an introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always cared, but this is part of the new U.N., trying
to be more inclusive and transparent and reaching out to
everyone,'' said Susan Markham, chief of promotion and planning for
the United Nations' department of public information. ``The public
relations campaign is trying to get across to people the importance
of this millennium meeting so that they won't feel so bad sitting
in traffic jams.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also the closest the United Nations will come to
apologizing for the world-class mess coming New York's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be pretty much a nightmare,'' Markham said. ``It is
hard getting around on a regular day, let alone when something like
this is happening. Saying, `Sorry you are in a traffic jam,'
doesn't really help very much. Hopefully, New Yorkers will realize
what is going on at the summit will affect their lives too.''
</P>
<P>
   In televised public service announcements, Harry Belafonte talks
about the serious tasks facing the U.N. gathering. Advertisements
in subway trains, on Metropolitan Transportation Authority maps and
at bus shelters pronounce, ``History will be made here.'' There
will even be a Batman-style beacon of light, flashing a
still-undisclosed message over the crush of drivers and pedestrians
near United Nations Plaza, to remind the vexed and vanquished that
good shall prevail (starting, presumably, in some meeting room on
the East River).
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is being donated by Brand Buzz, a division of Young
&AMP; Rubicam Inc. John Partilla, managing director of Brand Buzz, says
the United Nations has ``an overall positioning and identity''
problem in New York which is only going to get worse with the
anticipated fallout from the Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are quick to judge and say, `We are inconvenienced,'''
Partilla said. ``We need to remind people that they are not selling
shoes or soda pop over at the U.N. They are really working to solve
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Once that connection is made, he said, the strategy calls for
New Yorkers to spontaneously proclaim their affection for the
United Nations: Yes, there is some inconvenience, but I am proud to
be in this city, the imagined self pep talk goes, Partilla said.
Brand Buzz intentionally avoided direct references to traffic and
other problems in its promotional materials because that would
``just play up the negative,'' he said. (Yes, there is some
inconvenience, and curse this blasted place, is not the monologue
Partilla has in mind.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a little bit of faith that the world is not
all half empty out there,'' he said. ``But there is a leap there, I
admit.''
</P>
<P>
   The test may be in how difficult things really get next week.
New York is a place where the extraordinary can seem ordinary, but
this time, the authorities say, the disruption will really be one
of a kind. The upheaval is expected to begin Sunday, when the first
foreign dignitaries arrive; reach its worst stage on Thursday, when
the biggest U.N. meetings are held; and ease sometime next weekend
as everyone skips town.
</P>
<P>
   The three days of meetings are being described as a working
summit conference, not a celebration or commemoration. There will
be no formal banquets or ceremonial toasts; the only ``nod to
tradition,'' Frechette said, will be a group photograph. The heart
of the summit meeting will be a series of small, informal
round-table discussions, which are intended to encourage the
world's leaders to speak frankly about many problems. At the end,
they are expected to adopt a declaration renewing their moral and
political commitment to everything from preventing conflicts to
expanding the Internet in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At its simplest, the problem can be explained with arithmetic:
the larger the number of heads of state and government in
attendance, the larger the number of possible threats. The larger
the number of possible threats, the larger the number of security
people. The larger the number of security people, the larger . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one thing when the president comes into town and you
have one motorcade,'' said Lt. Stephen Biegel, a spokesman for the
New York Police Department, which started planning for the summit
conference a year ago. ``But now you are talking about having all
of the major players in the world coming into New York. It is going
to be a difficult week.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Friday that the city had budgeted $8
million in police overtime for the summit-conference week. That
could mean up to 6,000 extra officers on the street, which he said
were enough to deal with any chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Groups including adherents of the Chinese spiritual movement
Falun Gong and Iranians living in exile have announced plans to
join the spectacle. The authorities have identified the Cuban
Mission on Lexington Avenue as a particular place to avoid for
those who do not like their toes stomped or the contents of their
handbags thoroughly scrutinized. Fidel Castro is expected there
with noisy crowds to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is also not taking any chances with the West Nile
virus. He said that the United Nations Plaza and the rest of
Manhattan north of 23rd Street would be sprayed for mosquitoes
before the summit meeting began. Giuliani announced Friday that a
dead bird infected with the virus was discovered at the United
Nations' doorstep at 42nd Street and First Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember, this illness is potentially the most
dangerous for elderly people, and some of the people coming are
elderly,'' Giuliani said. ''So we want to make sure the U.N. is
clear and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Spriggs, the assistant director for protective operations
at the Secret Service, said the only event that compared to the
Millennium Summit in terms of VIP protection was the 50th
anniversary celebration at the United Nations in 1995. But even
then, there were only about 150 people who needed Secret Service
protection, compared with the 245 now on the Secret Service roster,
he said. Eighteen have been classified as particularly high
security risks, according to police, and President Clinton is
scheduled to stay for three days, a visit that on its own is enough
to turn much of Manhattan inside out.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service would not disclose details of its security
arrangements, but Spriggs said the demand for agents is so great
that vacations have been canceled and personnel are being drawn
from most of the service's 100 field offices, as well as from the
IRS, the Customs Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an overwhelming challenge to say the least,'' Spriggs
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the East River, the Coast Guard will be bogged down in
debris, not diplomacy. With a watchful eye on the river-facing
rooms of the United Nations complex, the Coast Guard will regulate
the downstream flow of city trash toward Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the city Department of Sanitation sends four barges,
each loaded with 620 tons of waste, from a transfer station in
College Point, Queens, to the Fresh Kills landfill every day. But
the river will be off-limits for such deliveries when summit
participants are using riverfront rooms because of vulnerability to
a possible terrorist attack. (Untidy views are a less pressing
issue.)
</P>
<P>
   The city has added a tugboat and three barges to its garbage
fleet to accommodate the expected backup, though no one can say for
sure how much trash will be affected and for how long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work on tides, so if the window of opportunity is available
at the time when the tide is low, we won't be able to navigate the
waters,'' said Peter Fenty, deputy commissioner of sanitation. ``If
the material can't be shipped down the river, it will be held there
until it can be shipped. We've added the extra barges because we
might have to stack.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Cmdr. Michael McAllister, chief of the Coast Guard's marine
response division, said the Coast Guard would also limit access to
the river for pleasure boats from East 35th Street to the
Queensboro Bridge at 59th Street. No boats will be allowed within
175 yards of the eastern Manhattan shoreline throughout the summit,
and at particular times, the entire width of the river will be
closed.
</P>
<P>
   About three dozen boats from the Coast Guard and the New York
Police Department will patrol the river and its bridges, as well as
the waterways near Kennedy Airport, where most of the summit's
dignitaries are scheduled to arrive and depart. A floating command
center will be set up on the Coast Guard cutter Bainbridge Island.
</P>
<P>
   What happens if, Hollywood style, an errant garbage barge
crashes through the barriers and sets course for the United
Nations?
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our Coast Guard units have crew members armed and
trained with general law-enforcement procedures,'' McAllister said.
</P>
<P>
   And the hoped-for marketing response? Yes, there is some
inconvenience, but New Yorkers always enjoy a good show.

 &HT;    Mayfield's run of bad luck ends with pole
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARLINGTON, S.C. _ Jeremy Mayfield's car at Darlington Raceway
was almost as fast as his recovery from an injury he suffered last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield won the pole position for Sunday's Southern 500 with a
qualifying lap of 169.444 mph, narrowly edging runner-up Johnny
Benson (169.409). Ward Burton, who won the spring race at
Darlington, was third quickest in Friday's opening round of
qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   The last four races have been tumultuous for Mayfield. He
wrecked in practice the day before the Brickyard 400 and was
diagnosed with a head injury. He missed the Indianapolis and
Watkins Glen races. Mayfield then climbed back in the car at
Michigan and had a poor finish. He was wrecked by Bobby Hamilton at
Bristol last Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Missing the two races has refreshed Mayfield's racing desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the toughest part of my whole career,''
Mayfield said. ``You think it's hard getting (to Winston Cup) and
then when you get here, it's even tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``About the time we've got the No. 12 car where it needed to be
_ running good every week, then I got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I never had a headache, never got dizzy or
(anything), so I think I'm OK. The doctor is saying `You better not
race,' and you start thinking about a lot of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield was so frustrated about not being able to drive in the
two races that he elected to stay at his home rather than be an
observer at the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two weeks seemed like two years to me. When I did get
back in the car at Michigan, I wasn't sure what was going to
happen. It was probably the most nervous I have ever been in my
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the wreck at Indianapolis, Mayfield was one of the hottest
drivers in the Winston Cup Series. He had won at California and _
in possibly the season's most memorable finish _ bumped Dale
Earnhardt aside on the final lap to win the first Pocono race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I got hurt, my confidence was higher than it's ever
been,'' Mayfield said. ``Then when I got back in the car at
Michigan, I felt like I was starting all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it is important for me to come here . . . and sit
on the pole. It has boosted my confidence back up to where I think
it needs to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield's teammate, Rusty Wallace, has won three out of the
last five Winston Cup races and finished runner-up in another.
Wallace, who has never won at Darlington, qualified for the 16th
position.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Friday that he did not
believe that the technology was ready yet for an effective national
defense system, and passed the decision on moving ahead with the
politically charged and diplomatically delicate project to his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted that the threat of future missile attacks from
states like Iraq or North Korea ``is real and growing'' and that
the United States had to search for new defenses. But after several
failed tests and strong resistance from Russia, China and America's
closest allies in Europe, the president announced that he would not
authorize even initial construction on the missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made progress, but we should not move forward until we
have absolute confidence the system will work,'' he said,
announcing one of his most important foreign policy decisions in a
speech at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Clinton laid out an articulate case, both in
politics and substance, for why it was dangerous to plunge headlong
into a $60 billion program that would violate a landmark arms
control treaty with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``A national missile defense, if deployed, should be part of a
larger strategy to preserve and enhance the peace, strength and
security we now enjoy, and to build an even safer world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision comes just before the Labor Day holiday
weekend, while Congress is still in summer recess, and just days
before he is to meet world leaders in New York at the United
Nations. He has taken off the table an issue that otherwise might
have soured his scheduled meetings with other leaders, including
President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is also likely to open up much broader debate on
the issue between the presidential contenders, who have adopted
starkly different approaches toward missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, has
largely embraced the administration's stand of building a limited
land-based system without withdrawing from the Antiballistic
Missile Treaty of 1972. The Republican nominee, Gov. George W.
Bush, favors a broader system that could include sea- and
space-based arms.
</P>
<P>
   On May 23, Bush signaled his support for Clinton's leaving the
decision to the next administration rather than committing the
country to a course based on incomplete information, saying, ``No
decision would be better than a flawed agreement that ties the
hands of the next president and prevents America from defending
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Bush adopted a much sharper tone, criticizing the
administration's handling of the missile defense program. ``I
welcome the opportunity to act where they have failed to lead by
developing and deploying effective missiles to protect all 50
states and our friends and allies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Gore said he supported Clinton's decision, one
that aides said he had discussed with the president, and implicitly
criticized Bush's plan, which would require the United States to
withdraw from the ABM treaty. The accord bars Washington and Moscow
from building national missile defenses, unless Moscow agrees to
changes, which so far it has steadfastly refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, I would oppose the kinds of missile defense
systems that would unnecessarily upset strategic stability and
threaten to open the gates for a renewed arms race with Russia and
a new arms race with China,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, leaders throughout Europe, who had been caught
between America's ambitions for missile defenses and the strong
opposition from Russia and China, applauded Clinton's decision,
though they seemed mostly relieved. And Russian officials expressed
satisfaction that their diplomatic campaign, mainly by Putin, to
galvanize opposition against the American program had apparently
helped persuade Clinton to abandon it.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate upshot of Clinton's decision is that the
Pentagon's 2005 target date for having an initial, limited means of
defending all 50 states against attack by a small number of
ballistic missiles has been scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   To stick to that ambitious schedule, Clinton would have had to
authorize the Pentagon by December to award contracts for initial
construction on Shemya Island in Alaska of a powerful new radar
that would provide the missile-tracking ability needed for an
effective missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   But an independent panel led by a retired Air Force general,
Larry D. Welch, determined earlier this year that because of the
program's enormous technical complexity and the likelihood of
technical glitches and other delays, a deployment date of 2006 or
2007 was more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seized on that analysis to assert that his decision
``will not have a significant impact on the date the overall system
could be deployed in the next administration if the next president
decides to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, Clinton's decision probably means that work on
the Shemya radar cannot begin before 2002, which insures that a
national missile defense could not be completed before 2006 at the
earliest. The decision gives the next president leeway to
restructure the program or reorder its priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen, the lone Republican in
Clinton's Cabinet, was the administration's most forceful advocate
of fielding national missile defenses as soon as possible. Cohen
recommended to Clinton last week and in a meeting at the White
House on Tuesday that he go ahead with that initial construction.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse, three-paragraph statement, Cohen said, ``I have
noted on many occasions that several emerging threats warrant the
deployment of an effective missile defense program as soon as
technologically feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had previously said the final decision
to field a missile defense system would rest with Clinton's
successor.
</P>
<P>
   But even the preliminary step of breaking ground and pouring a
concrete foundation at the Alaska site could have been interpreted
as a violation of the ABM treaty, according to some legal analyses
prepared by administration lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Russia has refused to permit the United States to change the
treaty, a cornerstone of cold war-era arms control policy, and
Clinton was loath to have his name in the history books as the
president who withdrew the United States from the landmark accord.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the diplomatic repercussions, Clinton's national
security adviser, Sandy Berger, as well as Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and her deputy, Strobe Talbott, the chief
American negotiator with Russia, opposed permitting the initial
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Berger telephoned several Congressional leaders late Thursday to
alert them to Clinton's decision. Albright also called several
world leaders and lawmakers Friday, and Clinton called President
Jacques Chirac of France.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Democrats, scores of whom had urged Clinton to
defer all decisions on the system, applauded the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's decision gives us time to perfect our
political approach to the ballistic missile threat, as well as our
technology,'' said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the
ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican reaction was mixed, with some of the program's
biggest backers decrying another delay. ``Because of the
president's misguided decision, our children will remain completely
unprotected against the weapon of choice for rogue nations and
terrorist groups _ the missile,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Penn.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, said, ``This is
yet another example of the Clinton-Gore administration's legacy of
missed opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   But two prominent Republican members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Gordon H. Smith of Oregon and Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska, praised Clinton's choice. ``The president made the right
decision today,'' Hagel said. ``There will be dangerous
consequences for America and the world if we rush to meet arbitrary
decision deadlines.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton said American security was based on the
three pillars of diplomacy, deterrence and defense. ``No one
suggests that NMD would ever substitute for diplomacy or for
deterrence,'' Clinton said, using the abbreviation for national
missile defense. ``But such a system, if it worked properly, could
give us an extra dimension of insurance in a world where
proliferation has complicated the task of preserving the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and his top advisers established four criteria to
judge whether to move the system ahead: threat, cost, technology
and impact on American security, including arms control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a balancing act that has to be taken,'' Berger told
reporters after Clinton's speech. ``The way I ask the question is,
will we be more secure or less secure?''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials did not quarrel about the reality of
the threat, even though Clinton noted that North Korea had
refrained from testing new, long-range missiles. And while the cost
of the system's initial phase, consisting of 100 missile
interceptors and a system of early-warning radars, had increased by
about $4 billion in recent months to a total of $25 billion,
growing federal budget surpluses had eased concern about that.
</P>
<P>
   But the system had run into a number of technical problems.
After a largely successful first test last fall, the next two tests
failed, including the latest on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that crucial elements of the program, like the
booster rocket for the missile interceptor, were behind schedule
and had yet to be tested. Experts still had concerns whether the
interceptors could adequately distinguish enemy warheads from
decoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply cannot conclude, with the information that is
available to us today, that we have enough confidence in the
technology and operational effectiveness of this entire system to
move ahead with deployment,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, China, Russia and European allies all voiced fears that
even beginning the initial construction could violate the ABM
treaty and trigger a new arms race, especially in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Given the potential diplomatic consequences, administration
officials said, there was little reason to push ahead with even the
preliminary construction when chances that an effective system
could be up and working by 2005 were slim.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several months, the domestic politics changed as
well. With Republicans like Hagel and Smith, among others, calling
for Clinton to defer, Gore was shielded to some extent from any
political fallout if the administration decided to leave the
deployment decisions to the next president.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has always been ambivalent about a
limited missile defense system, arguing for years that the threat
did not warrant spending billions of dollars on unproven
technology, which had its origins in the vaunted Star Wars proposal
of the Reagan years.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House did an abrupt about-face in mid-1998 after
two things happened. First, a bipartisan commission headed by
Donald H. Rumsfeld, a Republican and former defense secretary,
warned that within five years North Korea and Iran could
conceivably reach the United States with long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Then, six weeks later, as if on cue, North Korea took American
intelligence experts by surprise by testing a three-stage missile
with perhaps enough range to hit North America.
</P>
<P>
   By early last year, the White House was pledging its conditional
support and $10.5 billion over six years to a limited system. Last
summer, Clinton signed into law the National Missile Defense Act,
which requires the United States to field a national defense
against a limited strike when technologically feasible. An original
sponsor of the legislation was Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, a
Connecticut Democrat who is now Gore's running mate.

 &HT;    NHL teams get look at rookies
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. _ Next week, the Thrashers are expected to
bring nearly 60 players to their second training camp. The fact
they are having a pre-camp for prospects to see who even makes it
there presumably is a sign of progress.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers brought 24 rookies to a six-team, four-day camp
and tournament beginning today. The stakes might not seem high to
some, but as Thrashers right winger Brad Tapper, the NCAA's top
goal scorer last year, said, ``I don't know how my play here will
affect Atlanta's decision. But I'm not taking anything for granted.
I know it's only a rookie camp, but I'm only a rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers general manager Don Waddell helped form this camp
three years ago when he was Detroit's assistant GM. The idea,
hatched by Red Wings GM Ken Holland, was to have extra time to
evaluate prospects before training camp. By the time the camp began
two years ago, Waddell had taken the Thrashers' job. A four-team
tournament with Detroit, St. Louis, Chicago and Nashville has
expanded to six with the Thrashers and expansion Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Thrashers' prospects at the camp, Waddell expects eight
to 12 to be invited to training camp in Duluth, beginning next
Saturday. Though some, including Tapper and 1999 draftees Zdenek
Blatny and Luke Sellars, are obvious, Waddell said, ``I'm not
making any decisions, yet. We're not going to reward guys based on
bad play at the camp.''
</P>
<P>
   As to what this camp means to this year's team, that depends on
Tapper and Blatny, the two players given the best chance to make
the NHL roster. Blatny, a 6-foot-1 center from the Czech Republic,
was a third-round pick a year ago who evolved into one of the
scoring forwards in the juniors. He finished with 47 goals and 44
assists for 91 points for Seattle and Kootenay of the WHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who goes to training camp hopes to make the team,''
Blatny said. ``All I can do is try to play like I did last year and
see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Blatny is 19 with remaining junior eligibility, the
Thrashers must either sign and keep him or send him back to
juniors. The same rules don't apply to Tapper, who is older (22)
and has played four years at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He
led the nation with 31 goals in 37 games.
</P>
<P>
   POSITION FILLED
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers will announce the hiring of long-time NHL
executive Jack Ferreira later this week. Ferreira, who has been the
general manager of three teams (Minnesota North Stars, San Jose and
Anaheim) and last season was vice president of hockey operations
for the Mighty Ducks, will be the Thrashers' player personnel
director, a newly created position. Ferreira will run the team's
pro scouting department and provide input on personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   BUZEK NOT CLOSE
</P>
<P>
   Waddell said Friday that negotiations with restricted free agent
Petr Buzek are getting worse, saying, ``We're a long ways apart.
But I assure you that come (reporting day) Sept. 7, our training
camp will begin, with or without Petr Buzek.'' A contract proposal
from Buzek and agent Rich Winter earlier this week wasn't close to
the three-year offer from the team. Waddell has countered by
pulling his original deal off the table and tendering a one-year
offer.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Friday that he did not
believe that the technology was ready yet for an effective national
defense system, and passed the decision on moving ahead with the
politically charged and diplomatically delicate project to his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted that the threat of future missile attacks from
states like Iraq or North Korea ``is real and growing'' and that
the United States had to search for new defenses. But after several
failed tests and strong resistance from Russia, China and America's
closest allies in Europe, the president announced that he would not
authorize even initial construction on the missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made progress, but we should not move forward until we
have absolute confidence the system will work,'' he said,
announcing one of his most important foreign policy decisions in a
speech at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Clinton laid out an articulate case, both in
politics and substance, for why it was dangerous to plunge headlong
into a $60 billion program that would violate a landmark arms
control treaty with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``A national missile defense, if deployed, should be part of a
larger strategy to preserve and enhance the peace, strength and
security we now enjoy, and to build an even safer world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision comes just before the Labor Day holiday
weekend, while Congress is still in summer recess, and just days
before he is to meet world leaders in New York at the United
Nations. He has taken off the table an issue that otherwise might
have soured his scheduled meetings with other leaders, including
President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is also likely to open up much broader debate on
the issue between the presidential contenders, who have adopted
starkly different approaches toward missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, has
largely embraced the administration's stand of building a limited
land-based system without withdrawing from the Antiballistic
Missile Treaty of 1972. The Republican nominee, Gov. George W.
Bush, favors a broader system that could include sea- and
space-based arms.
</P>
<P>
   On May 23, Bush signaled his support for Clinton's leaving the
decision to the next administration rather than committing the
country to a course based on incomplete information, saying, ``No
decision would be better than a flawed agreement that ties the
hands of the next president and prevents America from defending
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Bush adopted a much sharper tone, criticizing the
administration's handling of the missile defense program. ``I
welcome the opportunity to act where they have failed to lead by
developing and deploying effective missiles to protect all 50
states and our friends and allies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Gore said he supported Clinton's decision, one
that aides said he had discussed with the president, and implicitly
criticized Bush's plan, which would require the United States to
withdraw from the ABM treaty. The accord bars Washington and Moscow
from building national missile defenses, unless Moscow agrees to
changes, which so far it has steadfastly refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, I would oppose the kinds of missile defense
systems that would unnecessarily upset strategic stability and
threaten to open the gates for a renewed arms race with Russia and
a new arms race with China,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, leaders throughout Europe, who had been caught
between America's ambitions for missile defenses and the strong
opposition from Russia and China, applauded Clinton's decision,
though they seemed mostly relieved. And Russian officials expressed
satisfaction that their diplomatic campaign, mainly by Putin, to
galvanize opposition against the American program had apparently
helped persuade Clinton to abandon it.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate upshot of Clinton's decision is that the
Pentagon's 2005 target date for having an initial, limited means of
defending all 50 states against attack by a small number of
ballistic missiles has been scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   To stick to that ambitious schedule, Clinton would have had to
authorize the Pentagon by December to award contracts for initial
construction on Shemya Island in Alaska of a powerful new radar
that would provide the missile-tracking ability needed for an
effective missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   But an independent panel led by a retired Air Force general,
Larry D. Welch, determined earlier this year that because of the
program's enormous technical complexity and the likelihood of
technical glitches and other delays, a deployment date of 2006 or
2007 was more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seized on that analysis to assert that his decision
``will not have a significant impact on the date the overall system
could be deployed in the next administration if the next president
decides to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, Clinton's decision probably means that work on
the Shemya radar cannot begin before 2002, which insures that a
national missile defense could not be completed before 2006 at the
earliest. The decision gives the next president leeway to
restructure the program or reorder its priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen, the lone Republican in
Clinton's Cabinet, was the administration's most forceful advocate
of fielding national missile defenses as soon as possible. Cohen
recommended to Clinton last week and in a meeting at the White
House on Tuesday that he go ahead with that initial construction.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse, three-paragraph statement, Cohen said, ``I have
noted on many occasions that several emerging threats warrant the
deployment of an effective missile defense program as soon as
technologically feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had previously said the final decision
to field a missile defense system would rest with Clinton's
successor.
</P>
<P>
   But even the preliminary step of breaking ground and pouring a
concrete foundation at the Alaska site could have been interpreted
as a violation of the ABM treaty, according to some legal analyses
prepared by administration lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Russia has refused to permit the United States to change the
treaty, a cornerstone of cold war-era arms control policy, and
Clinton was loath to have his name in the history books as the
president who withdrew the United States from the landmark accord.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the diplomatic repercussions, Clinton's national
security adviser, Sandy Berger, as well as Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and her deputy, Strobe Talbott, the chief
American negotiator with Russia, opposed permitting the initial
construction.
</P>

   Berger telephoned several Congressional leaders late Thursday to
alert them to Clinton's decision. Albright also called several
world leaders and lawmakers Friday, and Clinton called President
Jacques Chirac of France.
</P>

defer all decisions on the system, applauded the move.
</P>

political approach to the ballistic missile threat, as well as our
technology,'' said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the
ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.

   But two prominent Republican members of the Senate Foreign

Nebraska, praised Clinton's choice. ``The president made the right

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a speedy closed-door trial in Nablus on Friday
evening, a Palestinian state security court sentenced to 12 years
an Islamic militant whom the Israelis failed to capture in a
botched raid on a West Bank house last week.
</P>
<P>
   The militant, Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, 33, a leader of the Hamas
organization's military wing in the West Bank, was convicted of
forming and arming a military cell that acted at cross-purposes
with the Palestinian Authority, the Palestinian attorney general,
Khalid Kidra, said.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Hanoud has been wanted for years by Israeli authorities, who
said he played a crucial role in terrorist attacks that killed at
least 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian court did not consider the Israeli charges.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, an elite undercover unit of the Israeli army
staged a raid on his house without coordinating the operation with
the Palestinian police. Three Israeli soldiers were killed by fire
from other Israeli soldiers during the raid, the army said.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Hanoud, who was shot in the shoulder, escaped. He later
turned himself in to the Palestinian authorities.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In declaring that his administration would not
deploy a national missile defense, President Clinton made the case
Friday that the United States could pursue an arms control agenda
but must also explore ways to meet the post Cold War missile
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Among arms control experts, this is known as ``having your cake
and eating it too,'' or more specifically, keeping the landmark
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty by amending it to allow for a
limited national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Republican presidential nominee, George W.
Bush, has said that the ABM Treaty, in which the two superpowers
sought to prevent nuclear war by agreeing to remain equally
vulnerable to the other's attack, is an anachronism of the Cold
War. His top foreign policy advisers believe the treaty should be
scrapped, paving the way for a sea- or space-based missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else Clinton did Friday, temporarily at least, he took
the missile defense decision out of the realm of election-year
deadlines and test schedules _ and returned the discussion to the
fundamental question of whether the United States wants to preserve
or tear up the ABM treaty, a cornerstone of superpower arms
control.
</P>
<P>
   He said that America's security in the 21st Century depended on
deterrence, diplomacy and defense. And he added that strategic
stability required that all three of these concepts be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that America and the world will be better off
if we explore the frontiers of strategic defenses while continuing
to pursue arms control _ to stand with our allies and to work with
Russia and others to stop the spread of deadly weapons,'' Clinton
said in his speech at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   In making this argument, Clinton was acknowledging the
opposition to a limited missile defense from every important corner
of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with Washington's closest ally, Britain, the uneasiness
about a national missile defense has been constant among NATO
members, and was only slightly muffled after the administration
made efforts this year to better explain its reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, which was to be the base for an upgraded radar
necessary for a national missile defense, tentatively accepted the
administration's calculation that North Korea presented a threat.
But France and Germany never agreed with this assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, said in an
interview earlier this year that a missile defense would be
disruptive to the Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are members of the alliance who wonder if this won't
lead to unequal security,'' he said. ``If there is a real threat,
why are you protecting only yourselves?'' In any event, said
Vedrine, North Korea was a country that harmed its own population
more than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the allies were troubled by the opposition from
Moscow. Consistently, the British said they would cooperate with a
national missile defense only if it was done in agreement with the
Russians and in the context of the ABM Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, despite nearly a year of negotiations by Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who tried to convince them
otherwise, the Russian leaders did not believe that the missile
defense system was designed just to counter North Korea. Rather,
the Russians believed the plan would start a new arms race to
deploy anti-missile defenses, which their broken economy and
beleaguered military forces would be unable to match.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Chinese refused to accept that the proposed
limited missile defense plan was geared against North Korea, a
country they knew to be far poorer than themselves. The Chinese
said they viewed missile defense as aimed at them because it would
destroy China's ability to deter nuclear attack by neutralizing its
relatively small force of nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Chinese said, the Clinton plan would initiate an arms
race and they would have no choice but to expand their own nuclear
forces in response.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton appears to have listened hard to all those
arguments, candidate Bush and his defense experts, as well as some
conservative Democrats, have brushed many of them aside.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the intensity of the subject and the stature of those
who have participated in it _ including former secretaries of
states George Schultz and Henry Kissinger _ those who have promoted
a more muscular national missile defense than Clinton are part of
the mainstream debate.
</P>
<P>
   Broadly, the Bush camp argues that the ABM Treaty is an outmoded
piece of security architecture that does not fit the needs of a
world where a handful of countries _ North Korea, Iraq, Libya, Iran
_ have or will have the capability of using nuclear blackmail
against the United States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some experts argue that the ABM Treaty should be unilaterally
scrapped, if necessary. R. James Woolsey, the Clinton
administration's first director of the CIA, believes the treaty is
illegal because it has not been resubmitted to the Senate since the
breakup of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In a widely noticed article earlier this year, Henry Kissinger
wrote: ``In the existing strategic environment the ABM Treaty
constrains the nation's defense to an intolerable degree.'' He
accused the Europeans of being stuck with outdated slogans, saying
they should understand that a system that protected America against
limited nuclear attacks would ``enhance rather than diminish our
willingness to defend our allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush picked up on this theme in a speech last May in Washington.
Answering a question, he said that the ABM Treaty was an
obstruction ``that makes it hard for us to fully explore the
options available.''
</P>
<P>
   The starkest declaration for the need to do away with the ABM
Treaty came from Bush's senior foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza
Rice, who was a Soviet expert on his father's National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote in Foreign Affairs in February that her first option
would be to ``engage the Russians'' in a discussion on the advent
of the new threats and the changed strategic environment. ``The
United States should make clear that it prefers to move
cooperatively toward a new offense-defense mix, but that it is
prepared to so unilaterally,'' Rice wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In another difference with the Clinton approach, Rice has said
that a Bush administration would want to make an anti-missile
system available to America's European allies, ensuring that the
defense of the European allies was not separated from the defense
of the United States.

EMPLOYER'S ENGLISH-ONLY POLICY BRINGS SETTLEMENT OF $192,500
</HEADLINE>
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A St. Louis manufacturer agreed on Friday to pay
$192,500 to settle a civil rights suit brought by the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of eight Hispanic
workers who were required to speak only English while on the
assembly line. The settlement was the largest involving an
English-only policy since the agency began tracking the practice
among employers four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The eight workers, employees of the Watlow Electric
Manufacturing Co.'s radiator plant in Batavia, Ill., a Chicago
suburb, will share the settlement, which provides back pay for
seven who either quit or were fired as a result of the policy, as
well as punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   There is no federal law specifically prohibiting businesses from
adopting English-only rules. Rather, the EEOC has sued to overturn
some by invoking Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a
provision that bars employment discrimination based on national
origin.
</P>
<P>
   While the agency deems some such policies to have a sufficient
basis _ to help maintain job safety by ensuring clear
communication, for instance _ the suit against Watlow said that its
employees had been unfairly disciplined for speaking Spanish to one
another. One woman, it said, was fired simply for greeting another
employee in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are finally learning a lesson about what they can
and can't do with respect to requiring workers to speak English,''
said Jose J. Behar, the agency's main lawyer on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Watlow conceded no wrongdoing, saying it was settling to avoid
costly litigation. Ed Jepson, a lawyer for the company, said that a
third of the Batavia plant's workers were Hispanic and that the
English-only rule had been adopted to improve communication on the
assembly line. It never applied to any worker who was away from the
line, Jepson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company was having trouble with productivity and quality
control because people weren't talking to each other,'' he said.
``This is a company that values diversity and encourages
diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed in March 1999 and stemmed from a 1997 staff
meeting where management distributed a two-page ``performance
initiative,'' said Behar, of the EEOC. Among ways to improve
productivity, the document listed a ban on employees' speaking
anything but English while working.
</P>
<P>
   The move provoked instant opposition from a handful of
employees, three of whom were suspended and eventually fired for
refusing to comply, Behar said. Eventually, he said, all but one of
the eight workers involved in the suit left the company.

CHENEY, TRYING TO REMOVE ISSUE, PROMISES TO FORFEIT STOCK OPTIONS

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential
candidate, said Friday that if elected, he will forfeit stock
options worth about $3.5 million in the energy services company
that he left to run for office.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney had been challenged by the Gore campaign for inviting a
conflict of interest if he owned the options while in office. He
was precluded from selling the options, which he was awarded for
his service as chief executive of the Halliburton Co., until 2001
at the earliest, and their value by then would be affected by the
company's profits, which are sensitive to the price of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney on Friday released tax returns and financial disclosure
forms showing his income skyrocketing, from $258,394 in 1992, his
last year as secretary of defense, to just over $2 million in 1993
and then to $4,423,289 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief accompanying statement, Cheney said, ``In order to
avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest, I am fully
prepared to forfeit any options that have not vested by the time I
assume office.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement said that the forfeiture also covered 3,000
previously unreported stock options in Procter and Gamble, a
consumer products company, which also cannot be sold until after
the next administration takes office. But Procter and Gamble's
price is now below what it would cost him to exercise the options,
so it is no loss to Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Cheney had declined to make a pledge to forfeit his
options, saying only that he would do whatever he must to avoid a
conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's financial disclosures, which he was required to file
with the Federal Election Commission within 30 days of his
nomination, also showed that when he was picked by Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas as his running mate, Cheney received hundreds of
thousands of dollars from EDS, and that his wife, Lynne, has been
paid as a director of the Lockheed Martin Corp., a major defense
contractor, since 1995. Cheney was on the board of EDS, which was
founded by Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Cheney's decision to forgo the Halliburton options,
his press secretary, Dirk Vande Beek, said that Cheney and his
advisers had consulted with the Office of Government Ethics, which
reviews the finances of federal officials, and with the Internal
Revenue Service, and had determined that there was no way to turn
the options over to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Vande Beek said, Cheney ``will forfeit the unvested
options.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of the stock options depends upon the price when the
options are exercised, but for example, if Halliburton's stock were
to rise by $10 a share from about $53 Friday, the options would
have been worth $6.1 million when exercised.
</P>
<P>
   However much the decision might cost Cheney if elected, the Gore
campaign was not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said:
``Cheney got caught with his hand in the cookie jar, and now he is
trying to put the cookie back. It's a last-ditch attempt to
separate the Bush-Cheney ticket from big oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cheneys' tax returns not only showed a very sharp increase
in adjusted gross income from 1992 to 1999, they also disclosed
total contributions to charities of $209,832, or just over 1
percent of their 10-year income of $20,677,742.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to put a more generous face on those figures, the
Bush-Cheney campaign press release said Friday that $442,152 went
to charity.
</P>
<P>
   That total was reached by adding $89,500 in honoraria that
Cheney had to decline and therefore redirected to charity and
$142,820 in grants from corporations on whose boards either Cheney
or his wife served that matched the Cheneys contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheneys were under no legal obligation to release their
income tax returns, although many candidates, including Vice
President Al Gore, have done so.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Bush released information about his taxes, but not the
actual returns, for which an extension to file had been requested.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, a Bush spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said,
``Traditionally the governor has made his tax return available in
October.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cheney financial disclosure forms showed that Cheney
remained a director of Procter &AMP; Gamble and Union Pacific, and that
his wife served as a director of Lockheed Martin, the Union Pacific
Resources Corp., the Reader's Digest Association, the Exide Corp.
and the AXP Mutual Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest items on the form were two categories of
Halliburton stock options, each valued at between $1 million and
$25 million, in the ranges specified by the federal form.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that some of Cheney's stock options could not be
exercised until after inauguration was first reported by The New
York Times last month.

BICHETTE TRIES OUT GREEN MONSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Before entering the batting cage at Fenway Park, Dante
Bichette shook hands with the man who traded for him.
</P>
<P>
   After depositing a number of baseballs over the Green Monster,
off the wall behind the center-field bleachers, and into both
bullpens, Bichette exited and shook hands once again with Red Sox
general manager Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   Happy to be in Boston, Dante?
</P>
<P>
   You bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's thrilled to be here,'' said Duquette Friday night.
``There's a mutual admiration society between him and Ted Williams,
and he's a .366 lifetime hitter at Fenway. Those are all positive
reasons to indicate he can help us this year and next year.''
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime .300 hitter, Bichette was acquired from Cincinnati
Thursday for minor league pitchers John Curtice and Chris Reitsma.
In exchange for those promising prospects, the Red Sox got a
36-year-old slugger with 255 homers and 1,078 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   And a man who always wanted to wear a Boston uniform _ even if
his initial fitting wasn't exactly tailored to his 6-foot-2-inch,
236-pound body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little tight and a little short,'' said Bichette, who
donned No. 19 before the series opener against Seattle. ``I'll go
back in and try a few more on so I can get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a perfect fit career-wise for Bichette, whose only
postseason appearance was spectacular: In 1995 for Colorado, he hit
.588 (10 for 17) with a homer, three doubles, and three RBIs
against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the place where I really wanted to play,'' said
Bichette, a four-time All-Star with Colorado. ``Ted Williams was my
favorite guy, I met my wife here, and a lot of good things happened
to me in Boston. I'm glad to have this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   And Duquette is glad to give it to him. ``He's one of the best
RBI men in the big leagues the last six or seven years, he's proven
that,'' Duquette said. ``His strength is his bat. He's a pro
hitter. He'll give us another presence in the lineup and he's a
good pull hitter. He can drive in a run when it counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Batting practice pitcher Bill Moloney said, ``(Bichette) has a
real quick bat. You can see that right away. There were some balls
that were a little off the plate and he had no trouble getting the
head of the bat on them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bichette, despite his practice barrage, didn't want to
speculate about where he hopes to hit the baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get too caught up about that green wall.
That's probably something you have to fight here as a righthanded
hitter. Pitchers aren't going to let you do that as easy as you
might think. I just want to be consistent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette, who batted fourth as the designated hitter, batted
.295 for Cincinnati with 27 doubles, 16 homers, and 76 RBIs. In
August, he hit .319 (29 for 91) with 17 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners manager Lou Piniella said the addition of Bichette
gives Sox manager Jimy Williams more options. ``He's already
batting Nomar Garciaparra in that second spot tonight and that
could give (Garciaparra) an extra at-bat late in the game,'' said
Piniella. ``Bichette is a good hitter, no question about that. He's
a tough out.''
</P>
<P>
   And an even tougher one with men on base. With runners in
scoring position, he has a career .311 batting average (514 for
1,655). Over the course of the last six seasons, he has hit .341
(351 for 1,029) and driven in 537 runs with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, he has 1,100 hits, the most in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be in the middle of the lineup where I think I
can help out. That's fine,'' said Bichette. ``If they want me to DH
the rest of the games, that's fine, too. I can fit in and help
these guys reach their goal this year, that would be great.''

ZEDILLO SAYS HE TAKES PRIDE IN IMPROVEMENTS FOR MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In a State of the Union address delivered with
solemn nostalgia, President Ernesto Zedillo declared Friday that he
was leaving Mexico a better country than when when he took office
six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   True to his typically guarded and technocratic style, Zedillo, a
Yale-educated economist, extolled the measures that he took to save
Mexico from financial ruin, and he boasted about the transparent
elections that have propelled the nation on a seemingly
irreversible course toward democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans now have all the ingredients of a modern democracy,''
Zedillo said in his prepared remarks, ``individual guarantees,
civil liberties, a multiparty system, free elections, pluralism and
now, as a result of the determination of our citizens, the
alternation of parties in power.''
</P>
<P>
   The address, known in Mexico as the Informe, was also a painful
final rite for the one-party dynasty that has controlled Mexican
politics for most of the last seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party was
defeated in the most open and competitive presidential elections in
Mexican history. The man who will take office on Dec. 1, Vicente
Fox Quesada, will be the first president in 71 years to be chosen
by the people, rather than by his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Fox chose not to attend the ceremonies in the Legislative Palace
so as not to distract attention from Zedillo's address. But Fox's
electoral victory permeated the atmosphere, and Zedillo
respectfully acknowledged the president-elect in his address.
</P>
<P>
   For Zedillo, 48, whose term began in 1994 with a devastating
peso devaluation and civil unrest in Chiapas, the speech was a
triumphant political finale.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo did not mention his Institutional Revolutionary Party by
name. Its leaders are still rankled by their defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with sentimental appreciation and praise for the
government _ for the public schools, health centers and scholarship
programs that helped him move from a gritty working-class childhood
to Yale and onto the presidency _ Zedillo offered the PRI a veiled
farewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe all of us, absolutely all of us, have to acknowledge
one fact,'' he said. ``Mexico has completed its journey toward
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo arrived unexpectedly at the presidency after the
assassination of the PRI candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, in 1994,
an event that thrust him into presidency. And on Friday night he
offered personal reflections about his time in office and his faith
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably absent were references to the litany of unpopular
policies, unfulfilled promises and scandals that have plagued his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Zedillo's former tourism minister and campaign
finance manager, Oscar Espinosa, disappeared after facing charges
that he had embezzled $45 million in government money in his years
as regent of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the director of a vehicle-registration program, hired by
the administration, was detained by international law enforcement
agents on charges of torture during Argentina's military
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   The president tried to explain his commitment to the unpopular
economic programs that he initiated at the start of his presidency,
including a $100 million bailout to save Mexican banks and to
secure loans to some of the wealthiest business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crisis severely damaged people's living standards in
1995,'' Zedillo said. ``Yet I am certain that the damage would have
been much greater and longer lasting had we not adopted the
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper polls show that many people have accepted that hard
reality and that Zedillo is enjoying the highest popularity ratings
of his presidency. Seven out of 10 Mexicans polled by the newspaper
Reforma said they approved his performance as president, compared
with three out of 10 five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that popularity is generally attributed to the
democratic reforms instituted in the Zedillo administration,
reforms that led to the creation of the autonomous Federal
Electoral Institute, to the election of the first opposition-led
Congress and, ultimately, to Fox's election.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently ignoring a recent political riot in the state of
Mexico in which at least nine people were killed, Zedillo added,
``We can attest that suspicions, recriminations and electoral
conflicts have been resigned to history.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has been receiving much colder treatment from his
own party's leaders. They who fault him for the party's losing the
presidency, although the PRI keeps a narrow majority in both houses
of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential loss has thrown the party into the worst crisis
of its history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that the president's relationship with the party is
fragile,'' said a PRI senator, Humberto Roque Villanueva. ``There
is a certain feeling of injustice that the PRI paid the political
costs of the policies, while the government enjoys prestige.''

 By FRANK BRUNI and ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush on Friday defended a new
advertisement that challenges the credibility and character of Vice
President Al Gore and signaled that his frequent pledge to ``change
the tone'' of politics would not prevent him from raising questions
about Gore's truthfulness and leadership abilities in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In an extended interview on his campaign plane, he repeatedly
remarked, almost as if intoning a mantra, that the Democrats had
now run $30 million in ads against him. And he cast the new
Republican commercial ridiculing Gore and bringing up the vice
president's 1996 fund-raising appearance at a Buddhist temple as a
way to undermine public confidence in Gore's own accusations
against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is what's going to happen in the campaign, we've got
to lay the groundwork: This is a fellow that will say anything,''
Bush said, referring to Gore. ``The point is, this is a way to help
inoculate me about what has come and is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   He later added that ``the Republican party is putting people on
notice that he is willing to exaggerate in order to win, to curry
their favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke, for nearly 45 minutes, at a pivotal moment in his
campaign. He was not only heading into the Labor Day weekend and
the final two months of the race, but also trying to emerge from a
bumpy two weeks on the campaign trail, during which he was often
thrown off his chosen message and put on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there have been accumulating signs that Bush's
sustained advantage over Gore in the polls has vanished. In recent
days, several nationwide polls have shown the race to be a dead
heat, and a Newsweek poll released Friday found Gore with a lead of
10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Even on Friday, on his campaign plane, Bush was pelted with
questions that had nothing to do with his designated themes of the
week. During an impromptu news conference, reporter after reporter
sharply questioned him about how the attack commercial, which is
being run by the Republican National Committee, with the approval
of the Bush campaign, squared with his promise to take the high
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was tongue-in-cheek,'' he told reporters. ``This
ad came up after about $30 million of advertisements that had been
attacking me and my record, and I'm glad they came to my defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was raising questions about Gore's
truthfulness, he said, ``No, I'm just saying this is a man who'll
say things like he's for campaign-funding reform and then
conveniently forgets he went to the Buddhist temple.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the subsequent interview, Bush projected a demeanor that
was alternately intense and jocular, cutting and funny, and that
never showed any fissures of worry.
</P>
<P>
   He went out of his way to assert that he was pleased with the
state of the race. ``I just want to tell you what my mood is, if
you don't mind,'' he said, unprompted. ``I feel great. I do. I feel
comfortable. My spirits are high.''
</P>
<P>
   But he exhibited subtle, fleeting flashes of irritation when the
topic turned to questions about the finances of his running mate,
Dick Cheney, and, earlier, when a grilling about the Republican
National Committee's ad went on for more than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this interview on one ad?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Told that there were more subjects to come, he said, ``Then keep
going, will you?''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of Cheney's retirement package, which includes
lucrative stock options in Halliburton, an energy services company
that could be affected by federal policy, Bush said he had known
about the package when he picked Cheney as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will deal with the options issue in a way that is
comforting to the people,'' Bush said. ``He'll deal with it. Dick
Cheney's an honest man and when he says he'll do something, he'll
do something.'' (Later in the day, Cheney announced that if
elected, he would forfeit the stock options he had not yet been
able to exercise.)
</P>
<P>
   At another moment, his eyes grew wet as he reflected, in an
almost elegiac tone, on the ``amazing experience'' of running for
president. ``I am so honored to be one of two coming down the
stretch _ I am,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he was suddenly teary, he said: ``I'm not teary. I'm
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   He also referred several times to his father's presidential
campaigns, drawing comfort from the lessons of the past and the
perspective it gives him. He acknowledged that many political
analysts believe he cannot beat an incumbent administration in
peaceful prosperous times.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that a different kind of conventional wisdom proved
wrong when his father defeated Michael Dukakis in 1988. He recalled
how pundits at the time cited the ``Van Buren factor,'' which was
the idea ``that no sitting vice president could possibly be
elected, because it had never happened since Martin Van Buren.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``Therefore George H.W. Bush could not possibly
win,'' and added that each campaign brings ``a historical certainty
that always seems to get defeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush provided some insight into how his campaign would engage
Gore over the next few weeks, making clear that he would keep
trumpeting the charge that Gore and President Clinton had
squandered their time in the White House and failed to do what they
had told Americans they would.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it amazing _ and I think America will, too _ that some
of the same campaign issues they ran on in '92 are issues they run
on in the year 2000,'' Bush said, lumping Gore and Clinton
together. He mentioned Medicare reform, Social Security reform and
a middle-class tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would convince Americans that the Democratic
administration bore the blame and not the leaders of the Republican
Congress, he said, in reference to Gore, ``It sounds like this is a
campaign where they're going to be willing to say, `Give me credit
for things that went well, but let's blame others for failure.' And
to me, I think Americans will realize that's not what a leader
does.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He brushed aside any suggestion that voters might decide that
his engagement of Gore contradicted his promise to ``change the
tone,'' a claim so central to his candidacy that it was the
designated theme _ printed on banners _ for the week after the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is politics,'' Bush said. He then drew a distinction
between campaigning and governing _ between ads and his
willingness, if he is elected, to work with Democrats like Sens.
John Breaux of Louisiana and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska on issues such
as Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In much the same manner that he used in dealing with questions
about the ads, Bush dismissed any idea that voters were paying
attention to the debate over presidential debates and the fact that
he had not agreed to the three forums proposed by the bipartisan
commission on presidential debates. Gore has accepted those
invitations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that this was a familiar replay of his campaign for
governor in 1994, when the then-incumbent, Ann Richards, accused
him of dodging debates.
</P>
<P>
   Mocking the Richards camp, he said: ``I remember it clearly. `He
won't debate! He won't debate! He won't debate! He won't debate!'
And we debated, and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks about the Republican attack ad, Bush made clear
that he did not like Gore's frequent assertions that the Texas
governor was not offering specific enough policies on matters like
prescription-drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the Republicans had chosen to run the ad now, he
referred to $30 million in Democratic commercials and then added,
``The rhetoric started getting a little harsh _ `Put up or shut
up.''' Gore has been using that refrain to goad Bush to give more
specifics on his policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush now plans to release a Medicare prescription-drug plan next
week. Until now he had outlined some broad principles and spoken
positively of one bipartisan bill in the Senate. He insisted Friday
that he had ``always planned'' to provide more detail. He said he
also planned to return next week to the issue of military
preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that he did not intend to provide more particulars
of his call to divert some of the Social Security payroll tax to
individual investment accounts. ``My Social Security position is
where it is,'' he said, adding that he thought voters understood
the fundamentals of what he was proposing.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, Bush said that despite his and Cheney's
criticisms of the Clinton administration's peacekeeping missions,
he would not pull U.S. troops out of Bosnia and Kosovo immediately
if elected, ``because I understand the commitment to which we are
bound.'' He added, ``But I will work with our allies to lay the
groundwork for them to take up more of the peacekeeping role in
Bosnia and Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Bush acted so confident about winning that he
spoke of the importance of using the campaign to build up a
governing mandate. ``I believe I'm going to win, and when I win I
want to get some things done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at another point he seemed to look back on the campaign
almost from a nostalgic distance. ``It's been a great journey,'' he
said. ``I'm going to look back on these days. It's an amazing
experience.''

BRADSHAW WRITES HISTORY IN LOSS TO SANCHEZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Long Way Baby's baby is sweating it out on the
humid Grandstand court. Her name is Alison Jean Bradshaw,
19-year-old daughter of a once-upon-a-time rebel who had done time
on the same asphalt landscape of Flushing Meadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exciting beyond anything I could have dreamed,'' says
the ex-rebel, Valerie Ziegenfuss, in a courtside seat. ``My kid in
the US Open at the same age as my first, '68. Oh, I know all moms
think their kids are the greatest, but this is pretty remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   And then some. What are the odds that one of Billie Jean King's
original Long Way Babies _ the breakaway pioneers of the Virginia
Slims circuit _ would produce an offspring to spring onto the tour
that she helped build decades ago?
</P>
<P>
   Mom a pioneer? The child isn't very interested. Maybe someday.
Well, did kiddies in 19th century California want to hear about the
old lady's covered wagon ride? Those intrepid Long Way Babies,
trying to establish professional tennis for women in 1970, might as
well have traveled to Houston on the Mayflower as far as Alison
Bradshaw is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   On this Friday she's got her new career to think about, and an
all-timer of a problem across the net named Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario. They're both rookies: Alison, the fugitive from Arizona
State University just turned pro, and Arantxa, the just-married
refugee from spinsterhood. Is this any way to spend a honeymoon _
slaving over a stove-hot tennis court?
</P>
<P>
   A maiden in the big league, Alison, tall, sturdy, redheaded, is
in on a gimme _ a wild card _ as an up-and-coming San Diegan. But,
ranked No. 268, she has exceeded expectations, beating Nos. 46 and
75, France's Sarah Pitkowski and American Marisa Irvin, to crash
the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Humiliation looms, however, as Sanchez Vicario races ahead, 3-0.
Mom Valerie remains outwardly stoic. So do the kid's grandparents,
83-year-olds Jean and George Ziegenfuss, as they did when their
Valerie played. They needn't have worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Alison will say later, after acquitting herself
favorably in a 7-6 (7-2), 6-0, defeat, ``it was hard to stay calm
and relaxed with my family and a lot of friends here, and playing
(1994 champ) Sanchez Vicario. A lot of people watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowds and tender phenoms are nothing novel to Arantxa, the
Barcelona Bumblebee. A onetime prodigy herself, winner of the first
of her three French Open titles at 17 in 1989, and a sure-fire Hall
of Famer, she was surrounded by almost as many people at her
wedding in Barcelona. Nearly 1,000 people attended the social bash
of the season, including the president of Spain, a sister of the
king, and a representative of the pope (who presumably brought the
pontiff's prayer for Arantxa's inconsistent forehand).
</P>
<P>
   Though Alison was in with a meat grinder, she pulled herself
together. ``I had to get used to the situation and seeing someone
I'd watched on TV as my opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing off a poised selection of early-struck groundies, a
penchant for the forgotten art of volleying, and a sound serve and
smash, she rebounded to a 6-5 lead. Whereupon the thick
encyclopedia of Arantxa's experience and resolve fell on her like
an anvil.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, ``when Alison wants to know the history of her
profession,'' says mom, ``I'll give her the details. But I tell
her, `This is your time.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, a handful of revolutionaries _ the Houston
Nine _ spearheaded by crusading Billie Jean King, defied the US
Tennis Association by setting up a female prize money event in that
city. Masterminded by Gladys Heldman, then publisher of World
Tennis Magazine, and bankrolled by Joe Cullman's firm, Philip
Morris, it was won by Rosie Casals over Judy Dalton, and embraced
as well King, Ziegenfuss, Kristy Pigeon, Kerry Melville, Julie
Heldman, Peaches Bartkowicz, and Nancy Richey.
</P>
<P>
   All were suspended _ Melville and Dalton by the Australian
Association, the rest by the USTA. ``That didn't last long. We were
on our long way; the Slims circuit started the following year,''
recalls Valerie. ``Was I nervous about taking the chance? No. We
had the product. Women's pro tennis. With Billie Jean, Gladys, and
Joe behind us we couldn't miss. Look at what my kid is going into
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Nine cut up a pot of $7,500. Alison Bradshaw
collected $35,000 out of the Open's $4,385,000 female kitty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom never pushed me,'' she says. ``She took me to the club
where she was teaching, and I watched. It looked fun, and I started
at 6. It is fun,'' her blue eyes gleam like the silver rings in her
ears. ``It's my life. I knew I wouldn't finish at Arizona State
when I started, and the coach understood that. I've always wanted
to be a pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``But two years of college were great. I needed that to mature.
I can't imagine going on the tour at 16 like some of these kids.
Now I have to get into the gym, work hard on conditioning.
Everybody out here is in better shape than college.''
</P>
<P>
   Mom, ranked as high as No. 7 in the US in 1970, now works as a
western regional USTA coach for 14-year-olds. She says, ``Alison's
on her own. No coach. If she asks for help, I'll oblige. She's a
late bloomer, and that's good. She got as far in the Open this year
as I ever did. But I had some good wins: Billie Jean, Virginia
Wade, Francoise Durr. I'm proud I represented my country in
Federation Cup, and I hope Alison can.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a turning-pro present I gave her a cell phone so she can
keep up with her friends. I told her she won't make many friends
out here. This is a job. But,'' smiles the pioneer, ``Alison's got
game.''

 &HT;    Digital gap seen in South
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To overcome disadvantages, the South must act quickly
to improve education, increase digital literacy and spread the
``new economy'' prosperity of cities like Atlanta to the rest of
the region, says a major economic study being released today
(Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   The latest biennial State of the South report from Chapel Hill,
N.C.-based MDC Inc., an economic research firm, urges aggressive
action by business, educational, political and philantrophic
leaders, despite ``all that the South has accomplished over the
past 20 years to improve its competitiveness'' in economic
development and public schooling.
</P>
<P>
   A technological disadvantage is among the obstacles that MDC
says imperils small towns and rural areas across the South.
</P>
<P>
   Those places have an opportunity to benefit from the ripple
effect prosperity of what MDC calls ``new-economy cities'' such as
Atlanta, Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, Orlando and Nashville _ but
only if they're digitally connected to the cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are really going to move the region to a higher plateau
economically, we have to move more people into the information
economy,'' said Ferrel Guillory, a senior fellow at MDC.
</P>
<P>
   An example of what the report suggests can be found here _ in
remote and mountainous Madison County, N.C. _ which is so
economically distressed that half the schoolchildren eat free or
discounted lunches. Eighth-grade entrepreneurs have set up 22
make-believe lemonade stands in a nationwide virtual business on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   One day last week, 13-year-old Casey Wilson's stand in Miami
``sold'' seven cups, for a profit of $6.60. Valisha Sutton, 14,
lost 55 cents, but still had $5.70 to keep afloat her virtual
business in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's things like this that bring education to life for kids,''
said teacher Carolyn Franklin, whose rural school's embrace of
technology illustrates what, according to the MDC report, too much
of the South is lacking in the fast-emerging digital age.
</P>
<P>
   The improving technology at Madison Middle School is part of an
educational initiative in southwestern North Carolina. Over the
next few years, a consortium led by Mars Hill College, Western
Carolina University, Montreat College and Brevard College will
train more than 250 teachers to enhance their lessons with the
Library of Congress' vast digitized collection of historical
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the possibility of what it can do in the classroom,''
said Kathryn Zimmerman, the middle school's principal.
</P>
<P>
   But the school's remote location, tucked in a creek bottom
surrounded by hayfields and barns 20 miles northwest of Asheville,
points to one of the worst digital hurdles for rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Much of North Carolina's mountainous region remains unconnected
to high-speed fiber optics cable, which is increasingly becoming a
necessity for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Atlanta, to be connected is not such a big issue because of
the concentration of communications companies,'' Mars Hill College
President Max Lennon said. ``But here we do not have the same
quality of connection and, when we do, it is more expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report, MDC reaches beyond its traditional advocacy of
rural areas to urge the bolstering of new-economy cities like
Atlanta, which are grappling with smog, water shortages, traffic
congestion and a lack of affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continued prosperity of new-economy cities _ and indeed,
the prosperity of their states and the entire region _ depends on
their remaining livable as they cope with rapid growth,'' the
report states.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many years ago, the suggestion that thriving cities need
to be nurtured might have drawn protests from the rural South and
its politicians. But that appears to be changing with the arrival
of the digital age and its promise of economic and educational
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were sitting inside the city limits of Atlanta, we would
not have any greater (digital) access than we have right here in
Douglas,'' said Max Lockwood, mayor of the Coffee County, Ga., town
210 miles southeast of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, where Gov. Roy Barnes is pushing technology in
education, economic development and state government, a rising
number of initiatives is reaching beyond Atlanta to outlying
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since LaGrange officials decided to wire the Troup
County city with fiber-optics cable, it is reaping the digital
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   LaGrange, 60 miles southwest of Atlanta, recently won an
international award from the New York-based World Teleport
Association for its broadband infrastructure. Among other services,
it provides free Internet service to residents through cable.
</P>
<P>
   Next, LaGrange plans to provide residents with access to online
college classes through Georgia's Global Learning Online for
Business and Education and the Georgia Virtual Technical College,
said Joe Maltese, the city's director of community and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
   Yamacraw, the public-private initiative to make Georgia a leader
in the design of broadband communications systems, devices and
chips, last week recruited San Jose, Calif.-based Cypress
Semiconductor Corp. to join its design center, proposed for midtown
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Years from now, Yamacraw chief executive Jim Foley said,
products designed by the center could be manufactured in Georgia,
probably in outlying areas where labor is cheaper and more
plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some of Georgia's rural areas have catching up to do.
Only in recent months has Stewart-Quitman High School in Lumpkin,
near the Alabama state line, been connected to the Internet, said
state Sen. George Hooks (D-Americus).
</P>
<P>
   ``I see very vividly the benefit that Atlanta gives to the
economy of Georgia,'' said Hooks, chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee. ``But there needs to be balance. You have
to strengthen the weakest parts of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the South, leaders are embracing the promise of
technology to bridge educational and economic gaps that have eluded
decades of traditional fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's report of college-entrance SAT test results by the
College Board highlighted the South's enduring educational
shortcomings. Although better than a year earlier, Georgia's
average combined score of 974 out of a possible 1600 on the math
and verbal tests left Georgia 50th out of 51 in the rankings. Only
South Carolina was lower in the rankings of the 50 states and the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Improving education is even more critical in what MDC reports as
``the transformation of the Southern economy. . . .from low-skilled
blue-collar work to higher-skilled white-collar work. Today more
Southerners than ever work in jobs that required postsecondary
education and training.''
</P>
<P>
   MDC's Guillory says the fastest-growing job sectors involve
``knowledge workers.''
</P>
<P>
   National employment in information technology industries grew
from 4 million in 1994 to 5.2 million in 1998, the MDC report said,
quoting Commerce Department figures.
</P>
<P>
   But only two Southern states _ Virginia and Georgia _ ranked
above the U.S. average of 19.6 information sector workers per 1,000
jobs in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where we're lagging,'' Guillory said. ``We need to
invest in our universities to create more knowledge workers. We're
still behind the curve.''

EXCERPTS FROM INTERVIEW WITH BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (with BUSH)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from an interview with Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, as recorded by The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   Q. How does the new RNC ad fit in with a changed tone?
</P>
<P>
   A. This is politics. The idea of working with John Breaux and
Bob Kerrey and concerned Democrats about doing what's right for
Medicare is, in my judgment, a different issue. It's a
tongue-in-cheek ad. It is a way to defend, for Republicans to
defend me, against $30 million of negative advertising or whatever
you want to call it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Those ads stuck to your record and issues, though.
</P>
<P>
   A. But there are some interesting implications to it. If this is
what's going to happen in the campaign, we've got to lay the
groundwork. This is a fellow that will say anything. They went
after my education record. Objective people have said the education
record in Texas is superlative. The point is, this is a way to help
inoculate me about what has come and is coming.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So it's a defense against specific claims of a guy who you
say will distort?
</P>
<P>
   A. Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But what about your campaign's promise to ``change the
tone''? Won't this potentially alienate the very nonpartisans,
women, swing voters you need?
</P>
<P>
   A. If they do, then _ I read where someone said this is going to
cost me the election, this ad. Let's let the public judge. The
public will judge. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. You've said this will be close. As close as the Nixon and
Kennedy race in 1960?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know. It's hard to tell right now. But I think it's
going to be a close race. And if you had asked me a year ago: ``The
economy's strong, we're at peace, you're running against an
incumbent,'' basically running against an incumbent, willing to
wear the mantle, except in times where it didn't go so well, and
you say, ``You're even with 60 days to go or however many, 65 days
to go, would you take it?'' Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you defeat a guy like this? How do you convince voters
to change administrations during good times?
</P>
<P>
   A. Because they realize there are failed opportunities. Failed
opportunities. They have not led. We will.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You've said you sometimes get tired, and these next weeks are
going to be exhausting. So how do you get through them without
slips, bloopers and the like?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm going to concentrate and focus. But I'm in good physical
condition. I'm upbeat. And part of how I, what I do on the stump is
how I feel and I feel good. Obviously, this is a long, long pull.
It's been an interesting experience. It's going to be really
fascinating coming down the stretch . . . It's been a great
journey. I'm going to look back on these days. It's an amazing
experience. I understand what's coming up, but I've been in tough
races before. '94. I understand the pressures. And, you know, I've
got great faith in the American voter. I do. I've got faith in the
voters. They are going to discern. They are going to make a
judgment call as to who best to lead this country, and that
includes changing the tone in Washington, that includes setting the
right goals for the country, that includes watching us all,
watching both of us, as we head toward the finish line. And I trust
the judgment of the people. I don't necessarily like their judgment
at times. I didn't like it in '92, obviously. But I trust them. And
it's like on this ad, I told you, there's a filter and that's your
job, that's your purpose, but the American people will judge
whether this is harsh or not. I trust the people's judgment. I do.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And if they judge for Gore?
</P>
<P>
   A. Seriously, I would respect that. I'm not going to like it.
But this is democracy. I love the system and I love the country. I
love what America stands for. I don't want to sound Pollyanna-ish
about it, but I do. This is an important country and an important
process. And it's long and it's exciting and you've got to grip all
of that, hours on the plane, policy, it is an important part, an
important part of what this country's about. I am so honored to be
one of two coming down the stretch. I am. And I think Americans can
see my enthusiasm for what this country stands for.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why are you getting teary?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not teary. I'm tired.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How important are debates? Sway undecideds?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think they're a very important part of the process.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think they'll sway a lot of votes?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think they'll confirm votes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Undecided people will watch and decide?
</P>
<P>
   A. They may. Listen, ask the debate experts. I view debates as
part of the process.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why not just end the debate over debates?
</P>
<P>
   A. Because I think there may be some better formats. I want to
explore all options.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Better how?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's hard for me to say until I hear what all the different
options are ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. You and Cheney have been making an issue of military
preparedness. If you become president, would you pull troops
immediately out of Kosovo and Bosnia?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, I wouldn't. I've said that publicly. I would not. Because
I understand the commitment to which we'll be bound, but I will
work with our allies to lay the groundwork to begin to take up more
of the peacekeeping role in Bosnia and Kosovo. The model that I
thought made a lot of sense was the East Timor model where the
United States provided needed logistical support to, in this case,
Australian troops, to help keep the peace. We need to review all
the missions. I think Haiti was a failure _ $2 billion. And our
point is that the mission needs to be focused and Clinton, the Gore
campaign, is trying to say we're the strongest military in the
world. Yeah. That's not the question. I think people recognize
that. The question is, will we be the strongest in the world to the
point where we can keep the peace. I look forward to this debate.
I'm going to continue bringing up the issue. It is a real issue. It
is an important issue. And it's not only what the military looks
like today, it's what the military will look like tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is a good opportunity for us to refashion the military.
It'll help bring some fiscal sanity to the defense budget if we
have a strategic plan that redefines, begins to define, what the
military will look like in the long term. There are some very
difficult decisions that have to be made about aircraft and the
missions and how we move combat troops. Those decisions would
better be made, best be made, in the context of a larger strategic
plan, and one of the first things I'm going to do is work with the
secretary of defense, military planners, to develop a cohesive
long-term strategy as to where to spend research and development
money. This is an important issue for me. . . . Q. Are you
concerned about perception problems regarding Cheney and the terms
of his retirement compensation?
</P>
<P>
   A. I looked at them prior to picking him.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So this attention to his retirement package, his stock
options and finances didn't take you by surprise?
</P>
<P>
   A. Of course not. As he said publicly, he will deal with the
options issue in a way that is comforting to the people. He'll deal
with it. Dick Cheney's an honest man, and when he says he'll do
something, he'll do something.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you wish he hadn't have taken those options in Halliburton
as part of his retirement?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, he took the options way before he was being considered
to be vice president. It's part of his executive compensation
passage. This is a part of how executives are compensated.

   GENERAL-ELECTRIC (Undated) _ In a few months, John Welch will
step down as chief executive of General Electric Co., ending a
remarkable 20-year run of earnings growth and near cultlike
devotion. The three front-runners to succeed this 20th-century
business icon fit a pattern: All are gung-ho results-getters for
the company _ and all are white men. Where are the women? The
blacks? The Latinos? The Asians? Together, these groups make up
about 40 percent of GE's domestic workforce, but they are not easy
to find in the executive corps of GE, which is regarded as
America's most admired corporation. By Mary Williams Walsh. (With

   OLY-BUSINESS (Undated) _ Despite scandal and huge expense,
Olympic sponsorships remain hugely popular, with revenues from them
setting new records this year. No matter what happens on the track,

Olympic comeback in 2000 than the one the IOC has pulled on the
sponsorship front. By Randall Lane. (With photo and graphic)

   FIVE-QUESTIONS-BANKRUPTCY (Undated) _ A decade ago, a trio of
scholars destroyed the myth that most of those seeking refuge from
creditors were blue collar workers. People in every occupation go
bankrupt in rough proportion to their numbers, Elizabeth Warren,
Teresa Sullivan and Jay Lawrence Westbrook found in a widely
praised study of Bankruptcy Court records. Now they have refined

   SHAKESPEARE-FIENNES-THEATER (London) _ It is almost a rite of
passage for promising Shakespearean actors to play ``Hamlet.'' More
than most, though, Ralph Fiennes seemed made for the part. To
Jonathan Kent, the slim, ascetic-looking Englishman was born to
play the ill-fated monarch in Shakespeare's ``Richard II.'' To this
fairly obvious choice, however, Kent, an artistic director at
London's Almeida Theater Company, added a more innovative idea. Why
not twin ``Richard II'' with ``Coriolanus,'' another Shakespearean

``Coriolanus,'' directed by Jonathan Kent, will challenge
entrenched opinion. By Matthew Gurewitsch. (With photo)

<P>
   PUPPET-DANCE (Undated) _ There are two bloodlines in modern
puppetry: the ``low'' subversive tradition of Punch and Judy, which
is sometimes called ``marketplace puppetry''; and the ``high''
tradition of Asian religious ritual and court ceremony, including
Indonesian shadow puppets and Japanese Bunraku. High puppetry is
gestural and exploits the same kind of control that is meaningful
in ballet: it is a language for the superhuman, for gods and
heroes. By Andrew Solomon.

<P>
   IONIDES-ART (New York) _ Back in the 1920s, the designer Basil
Ionides was one of Britain's brightest aesthetic lights. His books
_ ``Color and Interior Decoration'' and ``The Modern English
Interior'' _ were best sellers, the former chockablock with
watercolor illustrations of his homes, prime examples of a
scientific approach to the play of light on bold but carefully
graded color schemes. Ionides was also an outstanding collector. By
the time of his death, in 1950, he had helped amass an impressive

  FEDERAL REGULATORS WARN OF MORE FIRESTONE TIRE ILLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of Firestone's parent company, Bridgestone of Japan, have
declined to 1,288 yen as the tire maker struggles with a large
recall. It received another blow when federal regulators warned of
safety problems in Firestone tires sold as replacements for
factory-issued tires on sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said
Firestone on Thursday had rebuffed a request from regulators to
broaden its current tire recall. The agency then took the rare step
of issuing a ``consumer advisory'' suggesting that people buy new
tires at their own expense anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said 1.4 million more Firestone tires were even more
prone to failure than tires recently recalled on some Ford models.
Bridgestone/Firestone said in a statement that it disagreed with
the agency's analysis of the data.
</P>
<P>
   CHENEY SAYS HE WOULD SELL OPTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential candidate, said
that if elected he would forfeit stock options worth $3.5 million
in the energy services company that he left to run for office.
Cheney had been challenged by the Gore campaign for inviting a
conflict of interest if he owned the options while in office. He
was precluded from selling the options, which he was awarded for
his service as chief executive of Halliburton Co., until 2001 at
the earliest, and their value by then would be affected by the
company's profits, which are sensitive to the price of oil.

   FLAWS FOUND IN WIRELESS STANDARD

<P>
   Two researchers at Lucent's Bell Laboratories have found flaws

or to determine the identity of a user of the technology. Lucent is
one of nine corporations developing the standard to permit
communication between all kinds of portable handheld devices.

   SEAGRAM READIES SALE OF DRINKS UNIT
</P>
<P>
   Seagram opened its books this week to prospective buyers of its
drinks business in the first stage of a sale that may run through
mid-October. Already the biggest spirits companies are jockeying
for position. Most analysts expect just one outcome: Allied Domecq
has been considered the front-runner since Seagram first announced
plans to sell its wine and spirits business, including Absolut
vodka, in June as part of its plan to merge with Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
   Working to Allied's advantage is its ability to bid for the
business independently, thanks to its financial muscle and lack of
regulatory conflicts _ two issues that could handicap competitors.
But Allied is facing stiff competition from Diageo of Britain,
which is flush with cash, and could easily match Allied in a
bidding war that threatens to inflate the price to $9 billion _ a
value at which analysts said most companies would be hard pressed
to make the deal pay off.

Production could slow further in months ahead: The orders index
fell to 49.7 from 49.9, the second consecutive month of declining
orders. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction of activity. The
survey supports other data indicating that the economy's torrid
growth has been dampened somewhat by six interest rate increases by
the Federal Reserve Board.

2 MORE WACO PROSECUTORS SAID TO BE AT RISK OF CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Two federal prosecutors who helped send several
Branch Davidians to prison may face prosecution themselves on
charges that they withheld information about government actions in
the siege at the group's compound near Waco, a lawyer involved in
the case said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors, Ray Jahn and his wife, LeRoy Jahn, assistant
U.S. attorneys in San Antonio who in 1994 won convictions against
eight Branch Davidians in the group's deadly 1993 standoff with
federal agents, have been told that they may be indicted by John C.
Danforth, the special counsel investigating the government's
actions, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kennedy, a lawyer for the former U.S. Attorney Bill
Johnston, another Branch Davidian prosecutor and the official whose
charges of a possible government cover-up led to the Danforth
investigation, said on Wednesday that Danforth's prosecutors
planned to indict Johnston on charges of perjury, obstruction of
justice and making false statements.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Diltz, a spokesman for Danforth, declined to comment on any
aspect of the investigation or potential indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's recent preliminary report on the Waco matter largely
absolved federal officials of wrongdoing. The report said that Jahn
had acknowledged knowing that pyrotechnic tear gas rounds had been
used in the FBI's final assault on the Branch Davidians' home but
had not revealed that information when he submitted a written
statement to Congress in 1995. The report said Jahn admitted that
his statement to Congress was ``false'' but that Jahn ``claims that
he was merely `negligent' in not disclosing'' that the pyrotechnic
rounds had been used.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the Jahns had not disclosed the use of
pyrotechnics to defense lawyers in the criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   The pyrotechnic rounds have become an important element in the
continuing controversy over the siege because they could have
contributed to the fire that consumed the compound. For years,
Justice Department officials denied the devices had been used at
the site, but last year the agency was forced to admit that some
were used when they were found in evidence collected at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   After the devices were found by the producers of a documentary
about the standoff, Johnston wrote to Attorney General Janet Reno
to say that Justice Department officials may have withheld
information about their use. Those accusations led to the
appointment last year of Danforth as special counsel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gerald H. Goldstein, a lawyer representing the Jahns, would not
comment on the case, saying only, ``Unlike the Danforth commission,
which issues press releases and interim reports even before they
finish their inquiry, we would prefer to do our talking in the
courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of indictments is the latest development in the
continuing investigation into possible government wrongdoing during
and after the standoff between the Branch Davidians and federal
agents outside of Waco that ended with a fatal fire on April 19,
1993, killing some 80 Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of Danforth's efforts appears to be focused on Johnston
and what he knew about the FBI's use of the pyrotechnic rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the case say that investigators are
focusing on a memorandum saying that Johnston attended a meeting
with other Justice Department officials, in 1993 or 1994, at which
the use of rounds was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also looking at some of the handwritten notes
Johnston made before the 1994 trial of the Branch Davidians. One
page includes the note ``incind,'' apparently short for incendiary,
which may indicate Johnston knew something about the use of the
devices that he did not reveal.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston later withheld his handwritten notes from Danforth's
investigators because he feared they would be used against him by
his enemies within the Department of Justice, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston has appeared before Danforth's grand jury twice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, during the 51-day siege, he wrote Reno to complain that
FBI agents had altered important evidence found at the compound.
The letter he wrote to Reno last year ended his career with the
federal government. He resigned his post in February.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of an indictment against Johnston appears to have
caused a rift between Danforth and Judge Walter Smith Jr. of U.S.
District Court in Waco. Judge Smith, who is a friend of Johnston's,
is overseeing the Branch Davidians' $675 million wrongful death
lawsuit against the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   When the judge heard that Johnston might be indicted, he quickly
told investigators who were working for Danforth inside the federal
courthouse in Waco that they could no longer carry their guns into
the building, officials in the courthouse said. If the
investigators tried to do so, the officials say the judge warned,
they were to be arrested.

 &HT;    Cemetery feud stirs some old ghosts
 &HT;    By Mae Gentry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Ga. _ J.P. Godfrey Jr. thought he had left ``separate
but equal'' behind when he joined the Air Force in the 1950s. But
upon returning home decades later, he found vestiges of segregation
in Oxford, 35 miles east of downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Newton County town is home to 2,000 people, including the
600-plus at Oxford College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been quite fond of this old place,'' said
Godfrey, 63, whose grandparents cultivated corn and cotton there.
``My grandfather was proud of the fact that he owned property. He
used to say, `When you own a foot of land, you own something.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Soon after arriving six years ago, Godfrey searched for his
grandparents' graves at Oxford's only cemetery. ``I couldn't find
them,'' he said, so he began making inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey's questions stirred ghosts from Oxford's past,
entangling the city in a debate over the sins of a bygone era, the
cemetery's future and a pile of money.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford Historical Cemetery had been segregated by law and
custom for more than 150 years. Whites were buried in the
southeastern section; blacks were buried on the north side. After
the civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s ended racial
separation throughout the South, Oxford held fast to tradition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, the city signed an agreement for a private foundation
to maintain the cemetery. But by the time Godfrey returned in 1994,
the foundation had allowed the northern section to grow wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was literally a jungle up there,'' said Virgil Eady Jr.,
65, a fourth-generation Oxford resident.
</P>
<P>
   Trees and underbrush obscured the graves of blacks buried in the
cemetery. In stark contrast, the ``white'' southeastern section was
immaculate, its green spaces manicured, flowers adorning the
headstones.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the foundation's 35-year agreement has expired. If the city
fails to renew it, the foundation stands to lose its authority and
nearly $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city has said, `We are not comfortable renewing this
agreement under the present circumstances,' '' Eady said. ``We have
only one cemetery in this town, and we need to have the same
standard for the maintenance of all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Godfrey, Oxford takes pride in its rich heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1839 as the site of a seminary that later became
Emory University, the town is a shrine of the United Methodist
Church. It is on the National Register of Historic Places. The
bones of Methodist ministers, college presidents and the slaves who
built Oxford lie moldering in its graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of inequality were sown decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1965, little old ladies in the community decided that the
cemetery was not well taken care of,'' said historian Marshall
Elizer, 88. ``They raised money by donations _ cake bakes and that
sort of thing.'' They incorporated the nonprofit Oxford Historical
Cemetery Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Elizer, the foundation's president, contends the group never
intended to care for the entire 10-acre cemetery. ``They meant the
southeastern part,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the foundation has amassed nearly $200,000. The
interest from that endowment goes to maintain the graves.
</P>
<P>
   Spending that money on the historically black part would be
unfair, Elizer said. ``The money that we have accumulated was
gotten from the white (residents) because they were the only ones
who bought lots.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1968 to 1978, the City Council gave the foundation $600 a
year in taxpayer money. Though the practice ended when Godfrey
began raising a ruckus, the city still has a separate contract with
a landscaper for the rest of the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Elizer has accused the city of ``trying to get ahold of the
(foundation's) money,'' a charge officials deny.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to arrange is to continue the foundation.
That's the whole objective,'' said city Councilman Roger Gladden,
who is crafting a proposal he hopes will be acceptable to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all live here, and we're all concerned about this thing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Virgil Eady cares deeply about the cemetery. His mother was one
of the foundation's founders, but he cannot imagine that she would
have envisioned today's dichotomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember that in 1965, there was a different
climate than there is today,'' he said. ``So I think rather than a
conscious decision not to take care of the northern section, it was
a matter of taking care of their family plots.''
</P>
<P>
   Eady credits Godfrey, who was elected to a City Council seat in
1997, with generating interest in the northern side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sort of became the conscience of the town,'' Eady said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary McLurkin, a septuagenarian, knows the cemetery well. She
buried her husband, Samuel, four months ago and asks a visitor to
take her there.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping lightly over trees roots and gravel, she pads across
the northwest section.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the Bryant family,'' she says, pointing with her
wooden cane. ``They're all gone now.''
</P>
<P>
   McLurkin bends to pick up a rusted grave marker lying
helter-skelter on a patch of hard red clay, wonders where it
belongs, then tosses it back to the ground. She has been attending
burials in Oxford since she was a child and used to know,
literally, where the bodies were buried.
</P>
<P>
   Because the city kept poor records, funeral directors have been
known to consult McLurkin before burying Oxford's dead.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, workers digging a hole for a 4-year-old's casket
discovered an occupied grave, Godfrey said. And, according to
McLurkin, the city has resold three plots in the potter's field
where people already are buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of straightening out needs to be done there, I know
that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, McLurkin was involved in a disastrous effort
to reclaim the African-American side. She was a member of one of
two black churches that asked the city for permission to take care
of the northern section.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, without the city's knowledge, a pulpwood company was
called in to clear the northeast quadrant. Backhoes and bulldozers
devastated graves, leaving headstones broken or buried.
</P>
<P>
   About five years ago, concerned citizens began working every
other Saturday to clean the grounds. The city launched a plan to
identify graves. And it began to make things right, selling plots
without regard to race.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the northeast quadrant is a green field with a few
monuments. In the center sprouts a colorful flower bed, planted
this spring by Oxford College and Emory University students and
faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers were donated by the Emory Research Center for Myth
and Ritual in American Life, which is researching rural Georgia and
African-American family life, said Oxford College professor Mark
Auslander. Auslander, who calls the situation ``a painful scar for
the community as well as the college,'' said his students were
disheartened to see the cemetery's north side. ``The college was
built by blacks, slave and free,'' he said. ``African-Americans had
been involved with the life of the college.''
</P>
<P>
   The students began working with community members in the
northern section. They raked leaves, cleared brush and repaired
erosion damage.
</P>
<P>
   They also began collecting genealogical information about people
interred there and organized an exhibit, ``Tragic Beauty: Exploring
the Oxford African-American Cemetery,'' dedicated to Godfrey and
the city's black community.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey has made progress in his crusade. A few months ago, he
discovered the foundation's contract had expired. Since then, the
council has extended the agreement month by month while Gladden
seeks a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal would require the foundation to reconstitute
itself, with representatives of the city's four churches, the City
Council and the college as well as two or three at-large positions.
</P>
<P>
   If the foundation agrees to accept responsibility for the entire
cemetery, the city will allocate funds for its upkeep, Gladden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gladden has high praise for Elizer's efforts. ``We were lucky,
in one way, that we had the cemetery foundation to maintain a
portion of the cemetery for the last 35 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objective is to try to make it palatable for the foundation
to take on the whole cemetery for perpetuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizer seems resigned to the inevitable but slightly embittered.
After 17 years as president of the foundation, he plans to step
down when his term expires.
</P>
<P>
   Although a new agreement is not likely to be reached before
Sept. 11, when the council meets, Elizer believes a compromise is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we'll be able to come to an agreement by which
there'll just be another group that will maybe rewrite bylaws so
that this foundation will perhaps continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not, another will be formed. And I hope this damn cemetery
can lie in peace now.''

DISPUTE SPLITS BANGLADESHI EVENT INTO TWO
</HEADLINE>
  (Also filed in ``i'' category)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has been a strange month for many
Bangladeshi-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   First, five Bengali-language newspapers received a mysterious
white powder in the mail, with threatening notes alluding to an
annual cultural convention that was the subject of a simmering
dispute. Then, two Bangladeshi groups each claimed to be the
official host of that convention. The two groups, both calling
themselves Bangladesh League of America and contending the other
was an imposter, took each other to court.
</P>
<P>
   The cases are still pending. But after the judge in the case
said there was not enough time to settle the dispute before this
weekend, each group withdrew their motion to block the other's
event. Their decision to withdraw was first reported on Friday in
Newsday.
</P>
<P>
   So the 14th annual convention of the Federation of Bangladeshi
Associations of North America, known as Fobana, is being held in
two places, at Madison Square Garden and at a catering hall in
Astoria, N.Y., in Queens County.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of trouble were planted at last year's Fobana
convention in Atlanta, when New York City was selected as the site
of this year's meeting. Sayeed Rabb, editor of Thikana, a
Bangladeshi newspaper based in New York, accepted the designation
as convention host for the event this year. Shelley E. Mubdi, a
real estate broker, who was absent from the Atlanta event, says
Rabb falsely represented himself as a member of his organization
when he accepted the designation.
</P>
<P>
   Both events began Friday night and were to feature Bangladeshi
artists and cultural seminars and continue through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is still looking into who sent the letters with the
white powder to the Bengali-language newspapers. James Margolin, an
FBI spokesman, said Friday that tests on the powder showed ``no
indication of any chemical agent,'' in the powder, but would not
say what the substance was.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Taher, executive editor of The Weekly Bangla Patrika, one of
the newspapers that received an envelope containing white powder,
recalled that the enclosed letter began, ``Fobana Alert: Take the
sweet taste of nerve gas.''
</P>
<P>
   As he was preparing for his event yesterday, Rabb said he feared
that all the controversy surrounding this year's convention would
keep people away from his convention, at Madison Square Garden,
which he initially said would draw as many as 15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to destroy us,'' he said of Mubdi's group.
``They are misleading and lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Mubdi could not be reached yesterday, but his lawyer, Helen
Lukievics, said Rabb and the woman he says is president of the
Bangladesh League of America, Rani Kabir, were ``identity
thieves,'' who were trying to usurp the leadership of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   According to state records, the Bangladesh League of America was
first incorporated in 1947 under the name the Pakistan League. Both
Mubdi and Rabb claim to be members of that group. But Rabb formed
another organization, called the Bangladesh League of America, New
York, last year, after the Atlanta convention.
</P>
<P>
   Rabb's lawyer, Andrew Moulinos, said Friday that the New York
group was formed as a chapter of the original group. But Mubdi
contended in court papers that Rabb formed the group when Mubdi's
group refused to recognize Kabir as the president of the original
League and ``apparently frustrated,'' went on to create a new group
with a similar name just to confuse matters.
</P>
<P>
   After the conventions are over, the two groups will go back to
court to resolve the question of who are the legitimate leaders of
the Bangladesh League of America.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, all this strife has some Bangladeshi-Americans
wondering if the Fobana convention, once a symbol of Bangladeshi
pride and unity, is causing more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirit of Fobana was to get united all the Bangladeshi
living in the United States and Canada,'' said Taher, of The Weekly
Bangla Patrika. ``Now it's a symbol of enmity, a symbol of
division, a symbol of all the bad things.''

 &HT;    Seles keeps her win streak alive
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They talk about Venus Williams' winning streak, which
stands at 21, but Monica Seles has something going that's just as
amazing if not as impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the U.S. Open quarterfinals for the eighth straight
time Friday, Seles defeated Chanda Rubin 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 for her 58th
consecutive win against players not currently ranked in the top
four.
</P>
<P>
   So when Rubin broke serve for 3-all in the third set, there was
really no reason to worry. Rubin double-faulted, hit a pair of
groundstrokes in the net, then netted a high volley, ruining what
had been an inspiring effort for the former top-10 player from
Lafayette, La.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to serve well because my return game was nowhere
where it should be against a player like Chanda if you want to win
the match comfortably,'' said Seles, who faced only three break
points.
</P>
<P>
   Seles hasn't lost to a player of Rubin's stature since Mirjana
Lucic beat her in the round of 32 at Wimbledon 1999. She's 45-0
this year against everyone but Williams, Martina Hingis, Lindsay
Davenport and Mary Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Seles hasn't played No. 5 Serena Williams since last year's U.S.
Open quarterfinals. If Seles can fend off Jennifer Capriati in the
fourth round, she'd likely play Serena Williams here again. No
reason to be optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be tough for Monica to come up and win, but
like I said, shes a champion,'' Rubin said. ``You can never count
her out.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's field lost 13th seed Amanda Coetzer, beaten by Magui
Serna 7-5, 7-6. That leaves Venus Williams with no potential seeded
opponent until the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's draw, Todd Martin, last year's runner-up, routed
Michael Chang 6-4, 6-2, 6-4. Martin won an astounding 43 of his 44
first serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect, he made it pretty easy on me,'' Martin
said. ``He stood on the baseline the whole match, and I served body
serve after body serve, which is the easiest serve to hit.''

   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ They coached together, jogged together, even
caught a livestock show or two together while calling College
Station, Texas, their home and the Aggies their team. Now Texas A&AMP;M
coach R.C. Slocum and Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie will face each
other Saturday in an emotional opener.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum, in his 12th season at the helm of the Aggies, has heard
rumblings about his job security grow louder after an 8-4 season in
1999. It does not matter that he has won 100 games faster than
anyone except Oklahoma's Barry Switzer and Nebraska's Tom Osborne,
or that his 102 victories represent an average of nine a season.
Aggies fans do not like their team getting shut out in secondary
bowls, as Texas A&AMP;M was by Penn State in the Alamo Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if he's under fire, I'm under ashes,'' said Davie, who
was Slocum's defensive coordinator before joining Lou Holtz's staff
at Notre Dame in 1994. ``I'm already burned and toasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie, in his fourth year as head coach, is indeed feeling the
pressure after a disappointing season. The Irish lost their final
four games to finish 5-7, their most losses since 1963. The NCAA
handed Notre Dame its first penalty _ probation for two years and
the loss of two scholarships _ because of gifts accepted by players
from a convicted embezzler in the Holtz years.
</P>
<P>
   The combined trauma was enough for the university to hire Kevin
White from Arizona State as its new athletic director and to
realign the department so that the athletic director reports
directly to the university's president, the Rev. Edward A. Malloy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the reality is we lost our last four games last year,
and regardless of the reasons, that's not acceptable here at Notre
Dame,'' said Davie, who is 21-16 as head coach. ``I can certainly
see why there may be a perception on the outside that I need to win
X amount of games to save my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people will be tuned to marquee games like Alabama, ranked
No. 3 in the Associated Press news media poll, at UCLA, and No. 22
Southern Mississippi at No. 13 Tennessee. Many more will watch
Davie and the Irish begin what could be a march toward oblivion.
Notre Dame's first five games feature tough opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this year playing Texas A&AMP;M, this is probably even
bigger, not just because of how we finished last year, but we have
so many personal ties when it comes to this football game,'' Davie
said. ``We have 20 players on our team from Texas, seven of them
starters, two of them captains.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies are ranked No. 25 in the AP poll. Like the Irish,
Texas A&AMP;M will start an unproven quarterback, Mark Farris, who is a
25-year-old former minor league baseball player. The Irish will
counter with Arnaz Battle, a junior, who has thrown only 35 passes
in the past two seasons as a backup to the departed Jarious
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But Grant Irons, one of Notre Dame's captains, said that critics
should understand that the Fighting Irish spent a focused
off-season reminding themselves of one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come to Notre Dame to be 5-7,'' said Irons, a senior
defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum understands his former assistant's precarious position.
But Slocum's response about the stakes of Saturday's game shows he
is confident Davie can overcome it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come late Saturday afternoon,'' Slocum said, ``one of us will
feel pretty good and the other is going to be miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie refuses to look past the Aggies to No. 1 Nebraska next
week in South Bend, or No. 15 Purdue the following week, or
Michigan State and Stanford after that. He also does not want his
team to be distracted by the discussion of his job status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think we made progress as a football team, and I'm not
going to spend a second thinking about how many wins this football
team has to have for me to be back here as the head coach,'' said
Davie, who received a five-year contract extension last year. ``I'm
going to focus on each game, and let it rip, and let's go play.''

 &HT;    President will leave firm as part of shuffle
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Friday was a rough day for Midtown-based iXL
Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The company issued a warning that its third-quarter earnings
would miss second-quarter numbers by more than 15 percent, trading
on its stock was halted in the afternoon but not before it hit a
52-week low, and a major executive restructuring was announced that
included the resignation of Bill Nussey, president and director of
iXL Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Nussey's resignation comes three months after Consulting
magazine named him ``consultant of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Nussey, 34, will be replaced by company founder and Chairman
Bert Ellis, 46. Chief People Officer Barry Sikes, 47, will return
to his previous role as chief operating officer. Sikes will replace
Niraj Shah, 26, who will also return to his previous post as
executive vice president of worldwide operations.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by phone on Friday, Nussey sounded upbeat and said his
departure from the company had been in the works for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a mutual decision among all the executives at iXL, so
it doesn't come as a surprise to me,'' he said. ``It's part of the
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Nussey said it was difficult to leave the company he
helped to build for the past 2 1/2 years. ``It's unfortunate that
I'm leaving,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nussey acknowledged that iXL had some challenging financials,
but that the company's reorganization demonstrated iXL's serious
commitment to returning value to its investors. ``We've got great
clients and great people,'' he said. ``The changes we are making
are great for the company now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nussey said Ellis and Sikes are the right people to move iXL
through its difficult times and on to better things. ``The ultimate
challenge facing the company is one Bert and Barry are best suited
for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nussey says he's already accepted another position but wouldn't
say what or where the job was. He hinted that it probably wouldn't
be in the consulting arena. Short-term plans include getting
reacquainted with his 8-week-old baby. ``I'm going to teach him he
has a father,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nussey's resignation coincides with an announcement from the
company late Friday that revenue for the third quarter will be
approximately 15 percent to 20 percent below second-quarter revenue
of $119.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   IXL's woes are part of an overall downturn in the Internet
professional services sector. Companies such as iXL and competitors
such as Viant, Sapient and others are experiencing slowing growth
as the big, ``old economy,'' brick-and-mortar companies that make
up the bulk of their client rosters are feeling less threatened by
upstart dot-com companies and slowing their decisions about Web
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite continued strong demand for our services, larger
clients are focusing on bigger, more complex projects, which has
resulted in extended sales cycles,'' Ellis said in a prepared
statement. Ellis also said iXL was returning to a ``more senior
management team'' that would aggressively reduce costs and realign
the organization to address market and customer demands.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq trading on iXL shares was halted at $8.38 after several
Wall Street firms downgraded the entire professional services
sector. Among those rethinking the company's earnings potential was
Merrill Lynch, the company that led iXL's initial public offering
last year.
</P>
<P>
   BB&AMP;T Capital Markets' Thomas Neuhaus also cut his rating on iXL
Enterprises, lowering it to ``hold'' from ``long-term buy.'' He
also cut his ratings on the entire e-business professional services
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Neuhaus said he ``previously assumed Global 2000 companies would
continue with their e-business initiatives,'' even though they now
see dot-coms as ``less of a threat.'' For iXL Enterprises, which
has targeted Global 2000 companies ``from day one,'' according to
Neuhaus, that slowdown could present problems.

who is 62, has ushered the American Civil Liberties Union into the

 &HT;    Museum's financial straits no laughing matter
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Mizner Park isn't exactly Camp Swampy, but it
has become a morass for Mort Walker's International Museum of
Cartoon Art.
</P>
<P>
   After a promising start when it opened in Boca Raton four years
ago, the museum ran into fund-raising problems and is now ready to
leave town if things don't get better, Walker said. The museum has
even identified a possible site for the collection in midtown
Manhattan. If the building can be sold for the right price _ it's
worth $10 million, according to Walker _ the board is ready to
move.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the museum is still trying to find a partner to share
space and expenses after several proposals fell through, including
a nearly done-deal with the Florida Atlantic University Foundation.
Walker said he's currently sifting through a half-dozen new offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to leave Boca Raton,'' Walker said. ``We love
the city, and we have a beautiful buiIding. But it's a great
disappointment that we've received little financial support from
this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker initially opened the museum in Greenwich, Conn., in 1974
to house his growing collection of cartoon art. The museum then
found new quarters in suburban New York. The vintage collection
grew to more than 150,000 pieces of art and animated film, and the
museum was offered the Mizner Park site by the City Redevelopment
Agency for $1 a year. The museum moved to Boca Raton in 1992, and
broke ground in 1994 on the first phase of its $15 million project.
</P>
<P>
   The building's first floor opened in 1996, but lack of money has
prevented the museum from completing work on the second and third
floors. At roughly 70,000 visitors a year, attendance is fair but
nowhere near the 150,000 people anticipated. The museum is behind
on roughly $1.1 million in mortgage payments but won a small
victory when a Palm Beach County Circuit Court judge recently ruled
that SunTrust bank couldn't take physical possession of classic
Mickey Mouse drawings that the museum had put up as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the early fund raising came from the publishing
industry. With roughly $7.5 million in cash and pledges, the
museum's board decided to begin construction. ``We thought if we
had a building up and the art to show, local individuals would
become as enthusiastic about the project as we were. It didn't
happen, and I don't know exactly why. In retrospect, we probably
made a mistake opening too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we had two directors who didn't raise any money,'' Walker
added. ``We probably lost two years there. We need somebody to make
us an offer that would give us some security. But we feel we're
going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Board president Joseph D'Angelo, retired president of King
Features Syndicate, said the museum needs ``$5 to $10 million in
fund raising, which isn't that much for a incredibly wealthy area
like Boca Raton and Palm Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the money isn't raised? ``We'd move to New York in a
heartbeat,'' said D'Angelo. ``As much as it would really disturb us
to have to leave.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential
candidate, said Friday that if elected, he will forfeit stock
options worth about $3.5 million in the energy services company
that he left to run for office.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney had been challenged by the Gore campaign for inviting a
conflict of interest if he owned the options while in office. He
was precluded from selling the options, which he was awarded for
his service as chief executive of the Halliburton Co., until 2001
at the earliest, and their value by then would be affected by the
company's profits, which are sensitive to the price of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney on Friday released tax returns and financial disclosure
forms showing his income skyrocketing, from $258,394 in 1992, his
last year as secretary of defense, to just over $2 million in 1993
and then to $4,423,289 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief accompanying statement, Cheney said, ``In order to
avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest, I am fully
prepared to forfeit any options that have not vested by the time I
assume office.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had kept the stock options, any decision in a Bush-Cheney
administration would have been scrutinized for whether it was
helping Halliburton's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said that the forfeiture also covered 3,000
previously unreported stock options in Procter and Gamble, a
consumer products company, which also cannot be sold until after
the next administration takes office. But the Procter and Gamble
price is now below what it would cost him to exercise the options,
so it is no loss to Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Cheney had declined to make a pledge to forfeit his
options, saying only that he would do whatever he must to avoid a
conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's financial disclosures, which he was required to file
with the Federal Election Commission within 30 days of his
nomination, also showed that when he was picked by Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas as his running mate, Cheney received hundreds of
thousands of dollars from EDS, and that his wife, Lynne, has been
paid as a director of the Lockheed Martin Corp., a major defense
contractor, since 1995. Cheney was on the board of EDS, but
resigned to run for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Cheney's decision to forgo the Halliburton options,
his press secretary, Dirk Vande Beek, said that Cheney and his
advisers had consulted with the Office of Government Ethics, which
reviews the finances of federal officials, and with the Internal
Revenue Service, and had determined that there was no way to turn
the options over to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Vande Beek said, Cheney ``will forfeit the unvested
options.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of the stock options depends upon the price when the
options are exercised, but for example, if Halliburton's stock were
to rise by $10 a share from about $53 Friday, the options would
have been worth $6.1 million when exercised.
</P>
<P>
   However much the decision might cost Cheney if elected, the Gore
campaign was not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said:
``Cheney got caught with his hand in the cookie jar, and now he is
trying to put the cookie back. It's a last-ditch attempt to
separate the Bush-Cheney ticket from big oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cheneys' tax returns not only showed a very sharp increase
in adjusted gross income from 1992 to 1999, they also disclosed
total contributions to charities of $209,832, or just over 1
percent of their 10-year income of $20,677,742.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to put a more generous face on those figures, the
Bush-Cheney campaign press release said Friday that $442,152 went
to charity.
</P>
<P>
   That total was reached by adding $89,500 in honoraria that
Cheney had to decline and therefore redirected to charity and
$142,820 in grants from corporations on whose boards either Cheney
or his wife served that matched the Cheneys' contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheneys were under no legal obligation to release their
income tax returns, although many candidates, including Vice
President Al Gore, have done so.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Bush released information about his taxes, but not the
actual returns, for which an extension to file had been requested.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, a Bush spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said,
``Traditionally the governor has made his tax return available in
October.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cheney financial disclosure forms showed that Cheney
remained a director of Procter &AMP; Gamble and Union Pacific, and that
his wife served as a director of Lockheed Martin, the Union Pacific
Resources Corp., the Reader's Digest Association, the Exide Corp.
and the AXP Mutual Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest items on the form were two categories of
Halliburton stock options, each valued at between $1 million and
$25 million, in the ranges specified by the federal form.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that some of Cheney's stock options could not be
exercised until after inauguration was first reported by The New
York Times last month.

UMPIRES SIGN A NEW DEAL BUT 22 ARE LEFT UNCOVERED
</HEADLINE>
  By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without so much as a threat of a work stoppage, the new umpires'
union has negotiated a new five-year labor agreement and has
apparently forged a new relationship with Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regard it to be a very positive agreement for both sides,''
Rob Manfred, baseball's chief labor relations executive, said
Friday. ``It really lays the foundation for a real good, solid
working relationship with this union, something we haven't had in a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, representatives for baseball and the World
Umpires Association completed work on the agreement, which must be
ratified by the umpires and the club owners, after an intense week
of talks at baseball offices in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, the first negotiated for umpires by someone other
than Richie Phillips, the ousted leader of the former union, does
not cover the 22 umpires who lost their jobs a year ago Saturday as
a result of Phillips' failed resignation strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for the new union had worked out a settlement under
which 10 to 13 of the umpires would have regained their jobs as
part of the new agreement and the others would have received
retirement or severance packages.
</P>
<P>
   But the unemployed umpires rejected the plan, preferring instead
to await the outcome of their arbitration hearing, most likely
later this year. The umpires would have had to withdraw their
grievance under terms of the proposed settlement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement includes two elements that are new to umpires'
labor contracts: an annual escalation in pay and a neutral
fact-finder for disciplinary cases.
</P>
<P>
   In past agreements, the negotiated pay scale remained in place
for the life of the deal. In the new agreement, salaries will rise
each year. Details were not disclosed in the announcement of the
agreement, but one person with knowledge of it said the salary of
the most senior umpires would rise from $225,000 in the contract
that expired last Dec. 31 to about $250,000 for this year to about
$340,000 in the fifth year, 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment of a neutral fact-finder gives the umpires
some recourse if they are fired, suspended for more than seven days
or fined more than $2,000. Although not on the same level as the
impartial arbitrator who decides player challenges to disciplinary
action, the fact-finder will determine the underlying facts in a
disputed case and report them to a baseball official.
</P>
<P>
   Findings on dismissals will go to Commissioner Bud Selig and
findings on suspensions and fines will go to Sandy Alderson,
executive vice president for baseball operations.
</P>
<P>
   Selig and Alderson will then decide whether the dismissal or
discipline was justified. The union had sought the adoption of the
arbitration system but settled for the fact-finder.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, the result of six months of negotiations, also
includes the creation of a joint committee to establish a new
system of training umpires and evaluating them when they work in
the major leagues. Evaluation has long been a sore practice with
umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long process,'' John Hirschbeck, the union
president, said. ``But with the outcome I couldn't be happier for
the profession, for all umpires and the working relationship we've
established with Major League Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck and the union's other top officials, Joe Brinkman and
Tim Welke, were joined in negotiations by two lawyers, Joel Smith
and Larry Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck and Brinkman led the group of umpires who worked to
oust Phillips and the Major League Umpires Association and install
a new union. The new union prevailed in a vote conducted last
January by the New York office of the National Labor Relations
Board.

(EDS NOTE: The complete text of President Clinton's speech is
available from The New York Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com) By
ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Friday that he did not
believe that the technology was ready yet for an effective national
defense system, and passed the decision on moving ahead with the
politically charged and diplomatically delicate project to his
successor.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted that the threat of future missile attacks from
states like Iraq or North Korea ``is real and growing'' and that
the United States had to search for new defenses. But after several
failed tests and strong resistance from Russia, China and America's
closest allies in Europe, the president announced that he would not
authorize even initial construction on the missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made progress, but we should not move forward until we
have absolute confidence the system will work,'' he said,
announcing one of his most important foreign policy decisions in a
speech at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Clinton laid out an articulate case, both in
politics and substance, for why it was dangerous to plunge headlong
into a $60 billion program that would violate a landmark arms
control treaty with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``A national missile defense, if deployed, should be part of a
larger strategy to preserve and enhance the peace, strength and
security we now enjoy, and to build an even safer world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision comes just before the Labor Day holiday
weekend, while Congress is still in summer recess, and just days
before he is to meet world leaders in New York at the United
Nations. He has taken off the table an issue that otherwise might
have soured his scheduled meetings with other leaders, including
President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is also likely to open up much broader debate on
the issue between the presidential contenders, who have adopted
starkly different approaches toward missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, has
largely embraced the administration's stand of building a limited
land-based system without withdrawing from the Antiballistic
Missile Treaty of 1972. The Republican nominee, Gov. George W.
Bush, favors a broader system that could include sea- and
space-based arms.
</P>
<P>
   On May 23, Bush signaled his support for Clinton's leaving the
decision to the next administration rather than committing the
country to a course based on incomplete information, saying, ``No
decision would be better than a flawed agreement that ties the
hands of the next president and prevents America from defending
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Bush adopted a much sharper tone, criticizing the
administration's handling of the missile defense program. ``I
welcome the opportunity to act where they have failed to lead by
developing and deploying effective missiles to protect all 50
states and our friends and allies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Gore said he supported Clinton's decision, one
that aides said he had discussed with the president, and implicitly
criticized Bush's plan, which would require the United States to
withdraw from the ABM treaty. The accord bars Washington and Moscow
from building national missile defenses, unless Moscow agrees to
changes, which so far it has steadfastly refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``As president, I would oppose the kinds of missile defense
systems that would unnecessarily upset strategic stability and
threaten to open the gates for a renewed arms race with Russia and
a new arms race with China,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, leaders throughout Europe, who had been caught
between America's ambitions for missile defenses and the strong
opposition from Russia and China, applauded Clinton's decision,
though they seemed mostly relieved. And Russian officials expressed
satisfaction that their diplomatic campaign, mainly by Putin, to
galvanize opposition against the American program had apparently
helped persuade Clinton to abandon it.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate upshot of Clinton's decision is that the
Pentagon's 2005 target date for having an initial, limited means of
defending all 50 states against attack by a small number of
ballistic missiles has been scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   To stick to that ambitious schedule, Clinton would have had to
authorize the Pentagon by December to award contracts for initial
construction on Shemya Island in Alaska of a powerful new radar
that would provide the missile-tracking ability needed for an
effective missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   But an independent panel led by a retired Air Force general,
Larry D. Welch, determined earlier this year that because of the
program's enormous technical complexity and the likelihood of
technical glitches and other delays, a deployment date of 2006 or
2007 was more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seized on that analysis to assert that his decision
``will not have a significant impact on the date the overall system
could be deployed in the next administration if the next president
decides to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, Clinton's decision probably means that work on
the Shemya radar cannot begin before 2002, which insures that a
national missile defense could not be completed before 2006 at the
earliest. The decision gives the next president leeway to
restructure the program or reorder its priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen, the lone Republican in
Clinton's Cabinet, was the administration's most forceful advocate
of fielding national missile defenses as soon as possible. Cohen
recommended to Clinton last week and in a meeting at the White
House on Tuesday that he go ahead with that initial construction.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse, three-paragraph statement, Cohen said, ``I have
noted on many occasions that several emerging threats warrant the
deployment of an effective missile defense program as soon as
technologically feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had previously said the final decision
to field a missile defense system would rest with Clinton's
successor.
</P>
<P>
   But even the preliminary step of breaking ground and pouring a
concrete foundation at the Alaska site could have been interpreted
as a violation of the ABM treaty, according to some legal analyses
prepared by administration lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Russia has refused to permit the United States to change the
treaty, a cornerstone of cold war-era arms control policy, and
Clinton was loath to have his name in the history books as the
president who withdrew the United States from the landmark accord.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the diplomatic repercussions, Clinton's national
security adviser, Sandy Berger, as well as Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and her deputy, Strobe Talbott, the chief
American negotiator with Russia, opposed permitting the initial
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Berger telephoned several Congressional leaders late Thursday to
alert them to Clinton's decision. Albright also called several
world leaders and lawmakers Friday, and Clinton informed President
Jacques Chirac of France.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Democrats, scores of whom had urged Clinton to
defer all decisions on the system, applauded the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's decision gives us time to perfect our
political approach to the ballistic missile threat, as well as our
technology,'' said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the
ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican reaction was mixed, with some of the program's
biggest backers decrying another delay. ``Because of the
president's misguided decision, our children will remain completely
unprotected against the weapon of choice for rogue nations and
terrorist groups _ the missile,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Penn.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, said, ``This is
yet another example of the Clinton-Gore administration's legacy of
missed opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   But two prominent Republican members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Gordon H. Smith of Oregon and Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska, praised Clinton's choice. ``The president made the right
decision today,'' Hagel said. ``There will be dangerous
consequences for America and the world if we rush to meet arbitrary
decision deadlines.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton said American security was based on the
three pillars of diplomacy, deterrence and defense. ``No one
suggests that NMD would ever substitute for diplomacy or for
deterrence,'' Clinton said, using the abbreviation for national
missile defense. ``But such a system, if it worked properly, could
give us an extra dimension of insurance in a world where
proliferation has complicated the task of preserving the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and his top advisers established four criteria to
judge whether to move the system ahead: threat, cost, technology
and impact on American security, including arms control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a balancing act that has to be taken,'' Berger told
reporters after Clinton's speech. ``The way I ask the question is,
will we be more secure or less secure?''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials did not quarrel about the reality of
the threat, even though Clinton noted that North Korea had
refrained from testing new, long-range missiles. And while the cost
of the system's initial phase, consisting of 100 missile
interceptors and a system of early-warning radars, had increased by
about $4 billion in recent months to a total of $25 billion,
growing federal budget surpluses had eased concern about that.
</P>
<P>
   But the system had run into a number of technical problems.
After a largely successful first test last fall, the next two tests
failed, including the latest on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that crucial elements of the program, like the
booster rocket for the missile interceptor, were behind schedule
and had yet to be tested. Experts still had concerns whether the
interceptors could adequately distinguish enemy warheads from
decoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply cannot conclude, with the information that is
available to us today, that we have enough confidence in the
technology and operational effectiveness of this entire system to
move ahead with deployment,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, China, Russia and European allies all voiced fears that
even beginning the initial construction could violate the ABM
treaty and trigger a new arms race, especially in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Given the potential diplomatic consequences, administration
officials said, there was little reason to push ahead with even the
preliminary construction when chances that an effective system
could be up and working by 2005 were slim.
</P>
<P>
   In the past several months, the domestic politics changed as
well. With Republicans like Hagel and Smith, among others, calling
for Clinton to defer, Gore was shielded to some extent from any
political fallout if the administration decided to leave the
deployment decisions to the next president.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has always been ambivalent about a
limited missile defense system, arguing for years that the threat
did not warrant spending billions of dollars on unproven
technology, which had its origins in the vaunted Star Wars proposal
of the Reagan years.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House did an abrupt about-face in mid-1998 after
two things happened. First, a bipartisan commission headed by
Donald H. Rumsfeld, a Republican and former defense secretary,
warned that within five years North Korea and Iran could
conceivably reach the United States with long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Then, six weeks later, as if on cue, North Korea took American
intelligence experts by surprise by testing a three-stage missile
with perhaps enough range to hit North America.
</P>
<P>
   By early last year, the White House was pledging its conditional
support and $10.5 billion over six years to a limited system. Last
summer, Clinton signed into law the National Missile Defense Act,
which requires the United States to field a national defense
against a limited strike when technologically feasible. An original
sponsor of the legislation was Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, a
Connecticut Democrat who is now Gore's running mate.

RUSSIANS SEE CLINTON'S DECISION AS DIPLOMATIC VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change `Millennium Summit' to `global summit meeting' in
first graf of optional material.)  
(With MISSILE-DEFENSE and related stories) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As European leaders on Friday applauded President
Clinton's decision to defer building a missile defense shield over
the United States, Russian officials expressed satisfaction that
their diplomatic campaign to galvanize opposition against the
American program had influenced Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   A former Russian ambassador to the United States, Vladimir P.
Lukin, who serves as deputy speaker of Parliament here, called
Clinton's decision predictable and rational and said that Russian
President Vladimir Putin had scored a temporary diplomatic victory.
He cautioned, however, that the contentious international issue
would return early next year.
</P>
<P>
   European officials, caught between America's ambitions for
missile defenses and the strident opposition from Russia and China,
seemed mostly relieved. Across the continent, political leaders
said Clinton's decision removed the issue from American
presidential politics and created needed time for increasingly
complex consultations and debate over missile threats and how to
cope with them.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac, one of the most pointed critics
of the American plan, was the only leader to issue a personal
statement Friday night. He said he had been informed of Clinton's
decision by letter Friday, which he said he received with ``great
interest'' given France's view that the project ``risks undermining
the strategic equilibrium and a return to the nuclear arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   Great Britain and Germany praised Clinton's decision. A
spokesman in Berlin, Bela Anda, said the government of Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder had ``understanding and respect'' for the ``wise
decision,'' adding that Germany's ``reservations about this project
are well known.'' Karsten D. Voigt, who coordinates German-American
affairs in the foreign ministry, said the decision was welcome
because it gave more time for consultations inside the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Foreign Minister Robin Cook said Clinton had ``taken
careful account of the views'' of American ``allies and other
international partners'' in pulling up short on the deployment of
missile defenses, which would violate the Antiballistic Missile
Treaty of 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to continuing dialogue on this subject with
the current'' administration in Washington ``and, in due course,
with its successor, and with our NATO allies and others,'' Cook
said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, the leader who worked hardest this year at undermining
American justification for going ahead with missile defenses, was
conspicuously silent Friday night in the face of what was seen
here, for now, as a diplomatic victory of sorts. Still, Clinton's
decision only puts off until some time next year the potential
confrontation between Moscow and Washington over the future of
long-standing arms control agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader leaves Moscow this weekend for visits to
Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has said it will not agree to changes in the 1972 treaty,
and has warned that an American decision to break the treaty would
render all arms control agreements signed between Washington and
Moscow during three decades null and void.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Putin undertook an energetic diplomatic
campaign in Europe and Asia against the American plan to erect a
missile shield over the United States, one that would leave Europe
outside the defensive umbrella and that would perhaps incite China
to build up its nuclear arsenal further, thus triggering further
escalation in the arms race in South Asia between India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader even flew to the North Korean capital,
Pyongyang, and secured an as yet unelaborated promise from Kim Jong
Il, the country's reclusive leader, to give up North Korea's
long-range missile program in return for Western space-launch
assistance for North Korean satellites.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting this proposal to the large industrial nations at a
July summit meeting in Okinawa, Putin sought to refute the American
assertion that North Korea's long-range missile program posed such
an acute threat to the United States that early deployment of
missile defenses was warranted. Moreover, a budding rapprochement
between North and South Korea, whose leaders met this summer for
the first time since the Korean War, further deflated any sense of
imminent danger from North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Lukin, the former Russian ambassador to the United States, said
he believed Clinton made his decision based exclusively on domestic
political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Any decision by Clinton would have been reassessed as soon as a
new administration took over anyway, Lukin said, and Clinton did
not want to do anything that would be detrimental to the Democratic
Party, like making compromises with Moscow that would subject Vice
President Al Gore to political attacks during the presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate, George W. Bush, has
criticized the Clinton-Gore administration for failing to
strengthen America's defenses, and has said that if he is elected
president, he will proceed with a missile defense system at the
earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was able to capitalize on serious concerns in Europe and
Asia that the United States was creating ``an unequal security
system'' between itself, its NATO allies and other major powers
like Russia and China, Lukin observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has unified everyone against the United States, including
your allies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lukin added that it would be ``unwise for Putin to
celebrate any victory'' over Friday's decision because ``it is only
temporary and is connected with internal politics in the United
States.'' As of January 2001, he said, a new American president
will face substantial political pressure to deploy a missile
defense system, if further testing proves the system viable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The timing of Clinton's announcement may spare him some
criticism from world leaders assembling at the United Nations next
week for a global summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   China's president, Jiang Zemin, was said to be preparing to
express Beijing's opposition to the American missile defense plan
during a speech to the leaders, according to a senior diplomat in
the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
   Certain countries are still seeking so-called absolute security
for themselves and are speeding up the development and deployment
of advanced anti-missile systems, a senior Chinese diplomat told
reporters in Beijing on Thursday. Jiang had been expected to assert
that American missile defenses would seriously undermine the
positive trend in international disarmament efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The American defense system poses particularly difficult
decisions for European countries like Great Britain and Denmark,
whose territories might be needed to enhance American radar
capabilities to shoot down incoming ballistic missiles from states
like North Korea, Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a House of Commons foreign affairs committee urged
the government to encourage Washington to address the nuclear
threat from rogue states by means other than the proposed missile
shield, which would not be able to stop a nuclear, chemical or
biological weapon delivered in a suitcase, or on a ship, or other
than by missile. The committee said it was not convinced the plan
represented an appropriate response to potential threats.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on Clinton's announcement, Menzies Campbell, a
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party in Great Britain, said,
``The British government must seize the opportunity provided by
President Clinton's decision to make a robust case against
deployment.''

 &HT;    MEXICO'S ZEDILLO TRUMPETS 'MARCH TOWARD DEMOCRACY', DESPITE
PARTY'S DEFEAT
 &HT;    (750&AMP;ADD)

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In his final State of the Nation address Friday
night, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo acknowledged the historic
defeat of his party in July but said Mexico can be proud that ``she
has completed her march toward democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexicans voted with freedom and in secret. Each vote counted,
and as in any democracy, the majority decided,'' Zedillo said in a
speech laced with personal observations about democracy and his own
struggle to reverse an economic crisis he inherited when he took
office in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Yale-educated economist also spoke of his work with other
Mexican political parties to reform this country's electoral laws
and end years of fraud and unfair advantage for his party, the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common purpose that I expressed on Dec. 1, 1994 has been
fulfilled,'' Zedillo said to applause from the Mexican Congress.
``We were all satisfied with the way in which the election was
held, independent of the results . . . Election day was marked by
tranquility and a high degree of participation, and it was preceded
by the most intense and competitive campaign in our history. At the
end of that day, some won and some of us lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, whose six-year term ends Dec. 1, is the last Mexican
president representing the 71-year presidential reign of the PRI,
which was born from the tumult of the 1910 Mexican Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI lost Mexico's July 2 election to Vicente Fox Quesada of
the National Action Party, or PAN, who ran on a platform calling
for change and an end to the PRI's monopoly on power.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Zedillo's greatest legacy when he leaves office in
December may be his party's defeat. He has been praised both at
home and abroad for gracefully acknowledging Fox's victory and
promising to work toward a smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's presidency was born from tragedy, after he was
reluctantly drafted to be the PRI's presidential nominee after the
assassination of candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio.
</P>
<P>
   He came into office after Mexico tried to rush headlong into
free-market economic reforms. The over-valued peso was slashed in
half, prompting a crisis that still affects Mexicans today.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo is credited with stabilizing the economy, sparking
growth and turning Mexico into a world-class export nation. But
critics say Mexico's poor and middle classes suffered most from his
fiscal discipline.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Zedillo defended his public spending cuts and
devaluation, saying the crisis would have been worse without
decisive measures. But left-wing members of Congress held up signs
declaring ``Lies _ 60 million in poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo promised to break a 30-year cycle of fiscal crisis in
Mexico that has followed the last five PRI administrations. Because
of careless spending, corruption and other mismanagement by
previous presidents, Mexicans saw the peso's value cut cyclically
and their buying power eroded.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Zedillo has vowed that ``the Mexican economy will
have no jolts or setbacks in connection with the change of
government. It can count on the right conditions to keep growing in
the coming years.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo was given a 69 percent approval rating in a poll
published Friday by Reforma newspaper. That contrasts sharply with
the 60 percent disapproval rating published in December 1995, a
year after he took office.
</P>
<P>
   But Zedillo's legacy still includes some low points that proved
embarrassing and politically damaging. Before he spoke Friday night
opposition orators in Mexico's Congress lashed out, reminding
listeners of a long chain of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   During Zedillo's administration Mexicans took on a bank bailout
of more than US$60 billion that has been marked by reports of
corrupt bankers taking advantage of the program. His own campaign
is under scrutiny for allegedly benefiting from illicit
contributions from a banker accused of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   His tourism secretary, Oscar Villarreal, has disappeared after
being accused of embezzling funds while Mexico City mayor several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the anti-drug czar Zedillo had appointed, Gen. Jesus
Gutierrez Rebollo, was charged with colluding with one of Mexico's
most wanted traffickers. And for several years now, vows from
Zedillo's administration to arrest the leaders of a violent
Tijuana-based drug cartel have gone unfulfilled, drawing criticism
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And in December that year, 45 people in a pro-Zapatista rebel
village were massacred by PRI loyalists in the state of Chiapas.
Zedillo expanded the military presence in Chiapas in response,
deported some foreign human rights observers and has faced
criticism for failing to resolve the original conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zedillo: You go with your hands stained with Indian blood,''
said one sign held up in the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Before the July 2 election, election officials here accused
Zedillo of helping his party's presidential candidate by refusing
to pull pro-government ads off the air boasting of achievements
during his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on election night Zedillo was the first to congratulate
Fox, and action that calmed markets but enraged some PRI
hardliners. His willingness to acknowledge defeat won admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernesto Zedillo is going to leave office with a great public
legitimacy. I think few Mexicans have much to criticize. Those who
are criticizing him are a small group of PRI insiders who probably
don't number more than 1,000,'' said political analyst Jaime
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who thought the president could still
engineer fraud to win elections,'' Gonzalez added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zedillo has been unusually stubborn and obstinate,
fundamentalist, and politically, quite clumsy,'' wrote Milenio
magazine columnist Raymundo Riva Palacio. ``But Zedillo is
finishing his term as a president acclaimed throughout the world
for having ushered in the end of a closed system . . . These are
the paradoxes of public life.''

 WINERIES ARE RIPE FOR THE PICKING  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California's wine industry uncorked an
unprecedented number of mergers and acquisitions this week, and
vintners anticipate many more deals as wineries combine to gain
financial and marketing clout.
</P>
<P>
   Darwinian forces are shaking up one of the most prestigious and,
at $13 billion a year, one of the biggest industries in California.
The wine business, just like banking and telecommunications, is
becoming a global endeavor in which size does matter.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Wine Group, a San Francisco firm best known
for its inexpensive bag-in-the-box Franzia wines, agreed to buy the
bulk of Sonoma's Sebastiani Vineyards in a deal estimated to be
worth more than $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, Australia's Foster's Brewing Group said it
would purchase Beringer Wine Estate Holdings, one of Napa's most
venerable vintners, for $1.5 billion. The same day, Canada's Vincor
International announced a deal for R.H. Phillips of Esparto,
Calif., worth $92 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mergers, consumers still enjoy a multiplicity of
choice. California is home to about 1,060 wineries at last count.
And wine prices are not expected to increase as a result of this
latest wave of consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, said San Francisco wine industry consultant Eileen
Fredrikson, ``mergers tend to stabilize prices.'' Big vintners with
lower production costs per bottle and more marketing muscle should
help provide consumers with easy access to reasonably priced
premium wines from around the world, she says.
</P>
<P>
   With a strong economy and premium demand for prestigious
vineyard properties along the California coast, more mergers are on
the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Two other major Australian wine companies, Southcorp and BRL
Hardy, have been scouting the states for winery acquisitions,
sources say.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps coincidently, Robert Mondavi Corp. CEO Michael Mondavi
is in Australia visiting BRL Hardy, according to several sources.
Wine Business Insider Editor Cyril Penn suspects Mondavi may be
talking about a distribution deal with the Australians, not a
merger.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Britain's Diageo, owner of various liquor brands
including Smirnoff and Johnnie Walker, is interested in buying
Seagram's wine and liquor brands, according to industry reports. So
is Britain's Allied Dome, which already owns several California
properties, including Atlas Peak, Callaway and Clos du Bois, and
New York's Canandaigua Brands, which produces Almaden and
Inglenook.
</P>
<P>
   As another sign of the international nature of the wine
business, Canandaigua, the largest U.S. winemaker after
California's E&AMP;J Gallo, said this week that it is changing its name
to Constellation Brands to better reflect its global reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are buying California wineries to strengthen their
brands and international presence,'' said WR Hambrecht wine
industry analyst Kristine Koerber. ``Given the limited supply of
grape-growing land in Napa and Sonoma, acquisitions may be the only
way to get into the California premium wine market.''
</P>
<P>
   Some producers also see this as an opportune time to sell out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wine business is booming right now and prices for wineries
have never been higher,'' said St. Helena wine consultant Vic
Motto. ``Some owners and investors read about the high prices and
say maybe this is the time for an exit strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly traded companies such as Beringer and R.H. Phillips
have no doubt felt particular pressure because their stock prices
had been stagnant.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently ``winery stock prices haven't done much,'' said
Traci Mangini, a wine industry analyst at Van Kasper &AMP; Co. in San
Francisco. For example, the shares of R.H. Phillips have been stuck
in the $3 to $4 a share range for the past three years despite
growing revenues and profits. Vincor offered $7 a share for
Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Beringer's stock jumped 50 percent, to $55.31 from $36.75, as a
result of its deal with Foster. Growing investor enthusiasm about
vineyard values and expectations of additional mergers helped drive
up the shares of other California producers including Robert
Mondavi and Golden State Vintners.
</P>
<P>
   Although growing grapes and making wine sounds like a dream
business and has attracted hundreds of wealthy entrepreneurs and
retirees, historically it is not necessarily an easy way to make
money.
</P>
<P>
   Return on investment is lower in the wine industry than in many
others because of the huge cost of vineyard land and production
machinery that is used only a few months a year. In addition,
inventory must often be stored for years in costly oak casks and
air-conditioned cellars before it is ready to sell.
</P>
<P>
   On top of high costs, add production risks. Wine is essentially
an agricultural business, which makes it difficult to precisely
predict production or profits. A bountiful crop is anticipated for
this harvest season. But depending on the weather, production might
be up or down 20 percent one year to the next.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, there is the danger of insect invasions. A
decade ago, the Phylloxera root louse laid waste to vineyards.
Today, Pierce's disease, spread by the glassy-winged sharpshooter,
threatens to sap healthy vines throughout California.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all these risks, wineries do make money, especially
efficient producers of high-quality wines. ``Premium wine is a
double-digit (annual percentage) growth business and that makes it
attractive,'' said Mangini. Last year, California wine shipments
reached a record 446 million gallons.
</P>
<P>
   California vintners account for 72 percent of all wines consumed
in the United States, which makes well-established producers
logical takeover targets for foreign companies like Foster's and
Vincor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to gaining a foothold in the United States, they and
the larger domestic producers are intent on getting bigger to grab
shelf space in stores and restaurants and attract the attention of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, smaller wineries face barriers too steep to surmount:
One is the complex state and federal laws governing the sale of
alcoholic beverages in the United States. Another is a distribution
system that often requires wine producers to sell to wholesalers
rather than directly to retailers or consumers.
</P>
<P>
   However, size has not always translated into success in the wine
industry. Coca-Cola, Beatrice Foods and Nestle all bought large
California wine holdings in the past but ended up bailing out.

   ``Food companies didn't always understand the wine business or
the marketing difficulties,'' said Fredrikson. ``Companies like

 ADVERTISERS PAY BIG BUCKS TO BASK IN OLYMPIC GLOW  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Olympic flag is being hoisted high in
Sydney, Australia, and so are the hopes of 11 corporate sponsors
that are spending tens of millions of dollars each for an
Olympic-size halo effect.
</P>
<P>
   Mega-corporations from Coca-Cola to IBM have ponied up an
average of $55 million each for four years as the Games' global
sponsors, a whopping sum that doesn't even include airtime for ads.
The primary benefit is the use of the Olympic name and rings in
advertising, plus ``category exclusivity'' _ FedEx can't advertise
during the games, for example, because UPS is a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The event's estimated television audience of 3.7 billion people
worldwide _ the largest ever for a single event _ is certainly an
attraction for advertisers. But another big motivator _ which is
less obvious but no less unique _ is the unparalleled reverence the
Olympics inspire among people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Games, with their history and association with
heroic figures such as Jesse Owens, are held in as high esteem by
the public as the humanitarian institutions UNICEF and the Red
Cross, according to a survey conducted for the International
Olympic Committee by Edgar, Dunn &AMP; Co., a San Francisco brand
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The main qualities associated with the Games include
``friendship,'' ``peace,'' ``global'' and ``fair competition,''
according to the poll of 5,500 people in the United States,
Senegal, China and eight other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Other highly ranked attributes include ``being the best,''
``determination,'' ``trustworthiness'' and ``honor'' _ qualities
that most commercial brands would love to be associated with.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most popular commercial sporting events, such as the
World Cup soccer tournament and National Football League's Super
Bowl, don't come close to the esteem of the Olympics _ which even
the Salt Lake City bribery scandal has not tarnished, according to
Jonathan Parker of Edgar, Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   The trick for advertisers is to make the connection in
consumers' minds between qualities of the Olympics and corporate
brand attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Foster City, Calif.'s Visa, for example, reinforces the image
that its credit cards are accepted ``Everywhere you want to be'' by
sponsoring Olympics in far-flung cities and heavily promoting the
fact that other cards aren't accepted in the Olympic Village.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy seems to work _ most Americans believe Visa is more
widely accepted than Mastercard, although the two are nearly
identical.
</P>
<P>
   Other key brand attributes Visa believes have rubbed off from
the Olympics include leadership, winning, quality and reliability,
said Tom Shephard, senior vice president for sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming a sponsor in 1986, Visa's market share has jumped
by one-third in the United States while the number of consumers who
consider it the ``best overall card'' has more than doubled to a
commanding 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While part of this improvement can be attributed to other
marketing _ Visa also sponsors Nascar, the NFL and even a bass
fishing tournament _ image surveys show improved consumer
perceptions of the credit card marketer during the Games. Those
perceptions never fall completely back to pre-game levels, Shephard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence: Purchases rung up on a Visa card increase by
15 to 25 percent when a Visa sign featuring the Olympic rings
appears near the cash register.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they see that sign, (Visa's support of the Olympics) is top
of mind and top of wallet,'' said Shephard.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co. of Atlanta has been an Olympic marketer since
1928, when Coke was served aboard the ship that transported the
U.S. Olympic team to Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic Games give us a unique opportunity to go into 200
countries around the world and build a relationship with those
consumers, connecting our brands to something they're very
passionate about,'' said Scott McCune, vice president of worldwide
sports marketing for Coke. ``There just aren't many sponsorships
that allow you to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Big themes in Coke's Olympic marketing include refreshment,
connection, the best of humanity and global unity, McCune said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other Olympic sponsors, Coke markets its Olympic
association in targeted promotions that vary from market to market.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Aquarius sport drink, for example, is a sponsor of
Japan's Olympic swim team. ``That's front and center in all of our
marketing there and plays to the strong sense of national loyalty''
Japanese people have toward their teams, McCune said.
</P>
<P>
   Coke is also giving each Olympic athlete free pins featuring the
Games' ring logo and the athlete's national flag. The sodamaker has
set up three tents in Sydney where the athletes can meet and
exchange pins, creating positive associations with the Coke brand.
</P>
<P>
   For IBM, headquartered in Armonk, N.Y., the Games provide a
perfect platform for promoting itself as a global ``e-business
solutions provider.'' IBM technologies undergird every aspect of
the Games, from its hotel reservations system to score-keeping to
several Olympics-related Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But IBM has learned over the years to make its message personal
and human, rather than dry and technological.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 in Atlanta, the company's Summer Olympics advertising
focused largely on its high-tech products and failed to make an
emotional connection with the Games. Since then, the company has
chosen to feature individual athletes in its ads, thereby linking
its brand to qualities such as ``valor''and ``glory.''
</P>
<P>
   The same ads direct consumers to the official Olympics Web site
( &LR; www.olympics.com &LR; ), which IBM designed and hosts, to learn more
about each athlete.
</P>
<P>
   In the ads ``we're not talking about all the servers we're
using, we're really making it meaningful for the fan sitting at
home,'' said Rick Singer, vice president of Olympic marketing.
``It's passion marketing, in essence.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, similarly emotional
ads produced a bump in consumer perceptions of IBM in areas such as
leadership and competence, Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   But doesn't such blatant commercialism turn off consumers? Not
as much as one might think, according to Edgar, Dunn's Parker. In
fact, Olympics fans seem to cut sponsors slack because of the
companies' financial support for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   In the Edgar, Dunn survey, 57 percent of consumers around the
world agreed with the statement ``I look favorably towards a
company if it is associated with the Olympics.'' Twenty-three
percent disagreed and 20 percent were neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Fully 75 percent of respondents agreed with the statement ``I
welcome commercial association with the Olympics if it keeps them
going'' and 60 percent said, ``It's only right that Olympic
sponsors use their associations with the Games to help sell their
products.''
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the sponsorship fee represents only a
fraction of sponsors' spending, noted Bill Chipps, senior editor of
the newsletter IEG Sponsorship Report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule of thumb is that for every dollar a company spends on
a rights fee, to maximize the sponsorship they spend another $2 to
$3 on leverage'' such as advertising, Chipps said. That means as
much as $165 million is spent on Olympic promotions by each global
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The global sponsors for the Sydney summer games, which begin
Sept. 15, are Coca-Cola, IBM, John Hancock, Kodak, McDonald's,
Panasonic, Samsung, Sports Illustrated/Time magazine, Visa, UPS and
Xerox.

FOR CSUN, PLAYING DIV. 1-A TEAMS HAS POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It will take just a few hours for the Cal State
Northridge football team to play its season opener today at the Air
Force Academy. In that time, the operating budgets of five CSUN
sports programs will be covered for the season.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN makes $125,000 in guaranteed revenue by playing the
Division I-A school. Last season, the Matadors earned $300,000 from
games against Kansas and SMU.
</P>
<P>
   The positives - the financial windfall being the biggest - of
playing Division I-A opponents are plenty. And the negatives - such
as humiliating losses and costly injuries - are obvious.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is certain: CSUN will continue to play Division
I-A teams and cash the checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we are the cash cow a little,'' CSUN football
coach Jeff Kearin said. ``We are the window to the athletic
department and the university. We're exposed nationally. So is
basketball and baseball. People see this university through those
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN athletic director Dick Dull doesn't mind playing one
Division I-A team each season but two is overdoing it. Dull doesn't
believe the extra money - something CSUN could definitely use -
offsets the negatives.
</P>
<P>
   That's why only one Division I-A team is on its schedule this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there's a monetary dimension,'' Dull said.
``Division I-AA teams all over America are relegated to playing one
or two or several games against Division I-A opponents in order to
assist in balancing the budget. I think it should be balanced -
probably one game but no more than two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to get in a situation where we play too many.
I've seen institutions play Nebraska, Oregon and Arizona all in the
same year and come away with $900,000. They also came away with
three major losses and a beat up football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That does a disservice to the institution, as well as the
student athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, CSUN suffered its share of major losses to Division
I-A teams. Dull, who was in his first season at CSUN, didn't make
the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas clobbered CSUN 71-14 and SMU cruised to a 58-16 victory.
In 1997, CSUN played three Division I-A teams - Boise State, Hawaii
and New Mexico State - and lost by an average of 17.7 points per
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good experience playing Kansas but we got beat up
on,'' quarterback Marcus Brady said. ``You know who can perform. Of
course, you always think you can (win).''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN played nine Division I-A opponents in the 1990s and won
once, 33-0 over New Mexico State in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It's an opportunity of a lifetime for some players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love `em,'' Rodriguez said. ``To me, it's a privilege to go
play in a big stadium in front of a big crowd at a big school.
Playing against those guys is a privilege and you have to take
advantage of it to the fullest. I think it's wonderful. It shows
who has heart. Last year, unfortunately, we didn't have a lot of
guys with heart. This year, it'll be a lot different.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Division I-A teams exploit weaknesses of Division
I-AA teams, which are usually found on the line. And most Division
I-A players are bigger, stronger and faster, perhaps increasing the
the possibility of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Is the money, exposure and experience worth risking injury?
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, we played Kansas and SMU and I don't think we lost
one guy in either of those games,'' Kearin said. ``Sure, Air Force
is a Division I team and they have 85 scholarships compared to our
55. My biggest concern is that they're an option team and they do a
lot of cut blocking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors won't prepare for the option the rest of year
because they play in the pass-happy Big Sky Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're preparing as best we can,'' defensive lineman
Levi Line said. ``From conditioning to doing pushups
</P>
<P>
   it's for one reason: to beat the snot out of Air Force.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's also the possibility of doing the unthinkable:
winning.

 MICROSOFT SERIOUSLY IN GAMES  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Microsoft unveiled a slate of 18 companies
Friday, including two Bay Area studios, that will develop video
games for its upcoming Xbox, the software juggernaut's first foray
into the console market.
</P>
<P>
   The company said two subsidiaries of Lionhead Studios _ the
British firm behind the highly anticipated computer game Black &AMP;
White _ will create titles for Xbox. Others include Stormfront
Studios, which makes a popular line of NASCAR games, and Totally
Games, both of San Rafael, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about the hardware a lot, but we thought it was
time to talk about the software, because without that, the console
means nothing,'' said Ed Fries, vice president of games publishing
at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deals, Microsoft will publish and market
the games. The company did not disclose the financial terms or
titles, although Stormfront President Don Daglow said his firm is
developing an ``action-combat'' game for the machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making all the right moves now,'' said Electronic
Gaming Monthly editor Joe Funk. ``But how it translates into good
games, that remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Xbox, due out next fall, is Microsoft's bid to challenge
established game-systemmakers Sony, Nintendo and Sega. The Xbox and
Sony's PlayStation 2, which ships in the United States next month,
are considered Trojan horses. The two companies hope their
machines, both equipped with broadband support and DVD players,
become entertainment hubs of the home.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft hasn't released details of the Xbox's design, but
Fries said Friday that the company is ``tweaking the space between
the fins.'' He declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it will announce other game development
partnerships, including some with Japanese firms, later this year
and early next year. Pacts with those companies are key, Funk said,
because the lucrative Japanese market has often proved elusive to
U.S. and European gamemakers. And, the other game-hardwaremakers _
all based in Japan _ have strong ties with Japanese game
developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is the X-factor for Microsoft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daglow, whose firm makes games for PCs, PlayStation and
PlayStation 2, said Microsoft stands a good chance of winning
market share away from the big three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised (when Microsoft announced its plans to make
the Xbox), because it's outside of their normal business, but if
anyone's going to take on the big guys, they're a contender,''
Daglow said.

 &HT;    The evolution of an American layabout
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ On Sept. 4, 1950, a college layabout named
Beetle debuted in a dozen newspapers. He was the star of the last
comic strip approved by legendary publisher William Randolph
Hearst. Six months later, however, the struggling strip had grown
to only 25 papers, and there was talk of cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   Then Beetle Bailey joined the Army _ and hasn't left Camp Swampy
in half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Monday is the 50th anniversary of ``Beetle Bailey,'' which now
appears in more than 1,800 newspapers around the world. It's read
by an estimated 200 million people. Its creator, Mort Walker, of
Boca Raton, is billed as the most widely syndicated cartoonist in
history, with nine comic strips to his credit, along with more than
100 books and 50 animated films.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Beetle flunk as a lazy college boy but succeed as the
Army's oldest private?
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, only about 5 percent of Americans had gone to
college,'' said Walker, who turns 77 today. ``Most people couldn't
relate to a comic strip about college life. College boys were even
resented a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Korean War heated up in early 1951, an editor of the
Philadelphia Bulletin gave Walker some advice. ``He said that
Beetle is a goof-off college kid, and those are the kids being
drafted,'' Walker recalled. ``The minute I put Beetle in the Army,
the strip just took off.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartoonist Jerry Dumas, who helps Walker with gags, understands
why. ``'Beetle Bailey' isn't about warfare. In a way, it's not even
a military strip. It's about human beings and human nature. The
military is a good place to have a bunch of characters in conflict
with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumas has worked with Walker for more than four decades, and he
knows the boss. ``Like any good cartoonist, Mort views any
situation from an odd angle, always looking for the possibilities
of humor. He often wakes up in the middle of the night and writes
down gags in bed in the dark. His mind never rests.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker has dreamed up the unthinkable to celebrate Beetle's 50th
anniversary. In strips leading to the big day Monday, he's had Sgt.
Orville P. Snorkel retire from the Army. ``I thought it might be
fun to see how Sarge does if he doesn't have Beetle to kick around
anymore,'' said Walker, who splits time between his home and studio
in Stamford, Conn., and Boca Raton, where he moved his
International Museum of Cartoon Art in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Will Sarge stay retired? Walker, who says he has a compulsion to
blurt out an honest answer to any question, wouldn't talk about
Sarge's future. So check out today's funny pages. One thing,
however, is certain _ ``Beetle Bailey'' isn't going anywhere.
``I've got 10 kids, and the strip is their life-insurance policy,''
Walker said. ``Besides, old cartoonists never retire. They just
erase away.''
</P>
<P>
   SELLING CARTOONS AT AGE 11
</P>
<P>
   Mort Walker always wanted to be a cartoonist. Born in 1923 in
the oil-boom town of El Dorado, Kan., he had a hardscrabble youth.
His father was a builder who hopscotched about the Midwestern oil
fields. He built churches, schools and houses. But his own family,
including two boys and two girls, lived in humble abodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no heat or plumbing,'' Walker recalled. ``We had
outhouses and took baths outside in a galvanized tub.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was a terrible businessman with a big heart. He never
charged enough, so we never had enough. We always had somebody down
on their luck living with us. We had old people from the church.
He'd pick up hobos and bring them home and feed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker joked that he formed his philosophy _''poverty sucks'' _
very early.
</P>
<P>
   But his parents had talents. His father was also a painter,
musician and the poet laureate of Kansas. His mother was a
part-time newspaper illustrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had a radio, so we'd amuse ourselves by drawing and
writing around the kitchen table,'' Walker said. ``I started
keeping a diary when I was 5. When I was a little boy, I told
myself I was going to be a millionaire, a hotshot cartoonist.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker was 11 years old when he sold his first cartoon to a
Kansas City newspaper. It depicted vegetables and fruits attacking
a cup of coffee. Later, he had to borrow $25 to pay his first
year's tuition at Kansas City Junior College. He got a night job in
the shipping division of Hallmark Cards, then called Hall Brothers.
``I'd bring two lunches,'' he said. ``One for school, and then I'd
stop at the park on the way to work and have the other for
dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, Walker answered an ad looking for an artist. It turned
out to be a Hallmark greeting. ``They asked me how I liked their
cards. I said they stink. I wouldn't send one to my grandmother.
They were all soupy and syrupy. Anyway, I was brash, but they hired
me. You could say I moved upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker didn't draw roses or cute critters. His taste tended more
toward funny cars and gags. ``I think I did the first humorous
greeting cards, because I don't remember any before we started
them. Today, that's all you find.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker continued to draw cards (75 a week, earning a buck a
card) at the University of Missouri, where he'd gone to study
journalism. Before finishing school, he was drafted in 1943 during
World War II. He entered the Army as a private and left it as a
lieutenant. The Army also left him with a cast of characters he
would draw on years later.
</P>
<P>
   One was Sgt. Octavian Savou, who became Sgt. Snorkel. ``He was a
big, burly guy. Always yelling at us. We'd run and hide from him.
But, like Sarge, he was really sentimental. One day he left a poem
on our bunks addressed to `my boys.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the war, Walker was a lieutenant guarding an
ordnance depot in Naples, Italy. He was 21. He watched the Army
destroy tons of inventory rather than ship it home. Binoculars and
watches were smashed by tanks. Walker's job was to make sure nobody
stole anything before the stuff was officially destroyed. ``I
realized then that Army humor writes itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Walker returned to the University of Missouri,
graduating with a degree in humanities. In 1948, he headed for New
York _ ``the mountain'' _ to make his fortune as a cartoonist.
</P>
<P>
   He shared a room in a condemned building for $7 a month. He got
a job editing magazines for Dell publishing. One was a joke
magazine, and cartoonists would come to him with their ideas. He
learned a lot about the business. Eventually, after some 200
rejections, magazines began publishing his cartoons, although The
New Yorker passed, saying Walker ``drew too funny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told I was the best-selling magazine cartoonist of
1950,'' he said. ``I made $8,000. My wife said, `If you're a top
seller at $8,000, maybe you should find another line of work.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his cartoons featured a lanky college kid named Spider.
Walker based his appearance on a college buddy _ a lovable goofus.
The name Spider came from a fraternity brother who was so drunk one
night that he had to crawl home like a spider. It took Walker only
a week to come up with sample sheets for editors. The Saturday
Evening Post published the cartoons, which Walker eventually turned
into a strip picked up by King Features Syndicate, owned by the
Hearst empire.
</P>
<P>
   All the characters except Spider were dropped for the comic
strip. Spider was renamed Beetle, and then Beetle Bailey _ the last
name of the editor who suggested it. Then one day, Beetle ducked
into an Army recruiting office on a dare _ and an anti-hero was
born.
</P>
<P>
   `RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME'
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mort started out in the early '50s, he had a product that
was in the right place at the right time,'' said Lucy Caswell, a
professor and curator of the Cartoon Research Library at Ohio State
University. ``He wrote from the postwar perspective, and the
simplicity of his graphic style was well-suited for the shrinking
space that comics experienced in the '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Caswell also noted that Walker came to strips as a gag
cartoonist. ``He had an understanding of what was funny from a
reader's perspective.'' Gag strips are still popular, she said, and
``Beetle Bailey `` may have grown old, but not out of style.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has a ``genius'' for creating concepts and characters,
but the writing is what keeps the strip alive, agreed Joseph
D'Angelo, retired president of King Features Syndicate and Walker's
longtime friend. ``In terms of a strip's longevity, it's more
important to find the writers who can keep the concept going,'' he
said. ``It's not hard to find someone who can draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to evaluate his own talents, Walker said he likes to draw
funny-looking characters, but he stressed simplicity. ``I don't
overwrite. I think the strip is easy to read and understand. You
have to do two things. You have to create certain shticks for your
characters that people recognize. Beetle asleep. Sarge beating up
on him. People have to quickly pick up on familiar themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you have to come up with universal truths about humanity.
If I see something that everybody does, or talks about, I try to
make a gag out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beetle Bailey'' has about 20 characters. ``You can't have an
Army with two people in it,'' Walker said. They've changed over the
years. Sarge got considerably fatter. Beetle changed from a string
bean to a more normal size. Sarge originally had a wife and kids,
but Walker dropped the idea as too complicated. As for Camp Swampy,
he tried to give it a more identifiable character, but it simply
wound up an ``amorphous mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker has gotten into a few messes with the strip over the
years, from trouble with the PC Brigade to even the Army's Stars
and Stripes. In the early '50s, the newspaper's Tokyo edition
dropped the strip because it allegedly fostered disrespect for
officers. Civilian publications played up the incident, and
``Beetle'' added 100 papers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, when Walker introduced the African-American Lt. Jack
Flap, the paper thought the character might stir racial animosities
and dropped the strip for a time. So did some civilian papers, but
another 100 papers signed up.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists went ballistic over Gen. Halftrack's ogling of his
secretary Miss Buxley in the '80s. ``It was an innocent thing, but
I got jumped all over by the vociferous 10 percent,'' Walker said.
``The general never harassed her. It was just a case of an older
guy who is over the hill but not over the thrill.'' The general was
sent to sensitivity training, but some women's groups still grumble
over his long-distance infatuation with the sexy blonde.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beetle Bailey `` didn't lose popularity during the Vietnam
War, despite widespread anti-war sentiment, Walker said. ``People
who didn't like the military thought I was ridiculing it. Others
thought I was reflecting their experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker's characters are distinct individuals. They are his
``repertory company,'' Caswell said. ``He was able to take these
characters and build reader identification with them,'' she said.
``Now, we immediately understand something will be funny because
Beetle says it, or Sarge does it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there always has to be that surprise in the last panel.
``Charles Schulz once said that a good cartoonist must do the same
thing every day without repeating himself,'' she added. ``Mort has
done that.''
</P>
<P>
   THE NEXT GENERATION
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his initial success with the strip, Walker and his
first wife, Jean, moved to Greenwich, Conn. It was close to New
York, the publishing mecca, and dozens of cartoonists and
illustrators made their homes in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cartoonists are like little children,'' Walker said. ``They
like to play tricks on each other. But they're a lovable bunch.''
He recalled one night when about 30 cartoonists plotted to show up
at different times at a colleague's house, and order a different
drink from the flabbergasted host.
</P>
<P>
   Walker and his first wife had seven children. After a divorce,
he married his wife Cathy, who brought three children to the
household from a previous marriage. They recently celebrated their
15th wedding anniversary. Walker is up at 6:30 a.m. and at his desk
by 8:30. He's a prolific worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that first impressed me about Mort was his
work ethic,'' said gag writer Dumas, who also produces the ``Sam
And Silo'' strip created with Walker. ``When Mort has a job to do,
he simply stays in his chair and gets it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker had the habit of doing his Sunday strips around the
kitchen table so his kids would know what he did for a living. ``I
just took it for granted that everybody's father worked at home,''
recalled his son, Brian Walker.
</P>
<P>
   It must have made an impression. Brian, 48, and brother Greg,
50, now help their father with ``Beetle Bailey `` and write the
``Hi and Lois'' strip, which appears in more than 1,100 papers.
Lois is Beetle Bailey's sister, by the way. Mort Walker got the
idea for the strip when Beetle took Sarge home on furlough. Walker
and the late Dik Browne produced the strip for years. Browne's son,
Chance, now draws ``Hi and Lois.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumas, Walker and the two sons lunch once a month at a ``gag
meeting'' at Walker's house. ``When I first worked for Mort, we'd
each do 10 gags a week, and check them out on each other,'' Dumas
said. Some were too naughty for the strip. Others were filed away
for a rainy day. More than 10,000 are collected in a safe at
Walker's ``laugh factory'' in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Always an admirer of his colleagues' work, Walker also began
collecting vintage comic strips and cartoons around 1960. By the
early '70s, he had an ample collection and decided to open a museum
in Greenwich, Conn. The collection continued to grow from gifts,
and moved to suburban New York and then Boca Raton. Numbering more
than 150,000 objects, the museum may be the largest of its kind.
``We were simply trying to maintain a heritage that no one else was
looking after,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker views laughter as medicine, and the comic strips as
social balm. ``I'm a big believer in the print media and the future
of comic strips,'' he said. ``As people move around from town to
town these days, with families living far away from each other, I
think comic strips fill a void. . . . People can turn to the funny
pages and find old friends and shared experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   A BUSY YEAR
</P>
<P>
   This anniversary year has been busy for Walker. His
autobiography is being published this fall by Andrews, McMeel
Publishing. The cartoon museum is doing a Mort Walker retrospective
in November. He's helping raise money for the National World War II
Memorial Campaign. And he has received numerous awards. The French
Embassy in Washington made him a ``chevalier,'' or knight, and the
U.S. Army gave him The Decoration for Distinguished Civilian
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Pentagon ceremony, Walker joked to Secretary of the
Army Louis Caldera that the French had kissed him on both cheeks.
``The secretary shot back, `Well, in today's Army, we don't ask and
we don't tell.' I thought that was pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Army humor does write itself sometimes _ with a little help from
Mort Walker and friends.

   THE DEMOCRATS STUMP AROUND THE CLOCK
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is planning a round-the-clock Labor Day
tour of several battleground states to emphasize the ticket's
dedication to workers. Gore and Sen. Joseph Lieberman, his running
mate, start on Sunday in Philadelphia, where they will meet with
construction workers, then fly to Flint, Mich., for an 11 p.m.
visit with hospital workers. Then they are off to Tampa, Fla., for
a 5 a.m. visit to a diner and breakfast with firefighters. The two
split at that point, with Gore flying to Pittsburgh for an
afternoon Labor Day rally which will include John Sweeney,
president of the AFL-CIO. Lieberman breaks off for Detroit. Gore
and his entourage move on to Louisville, Ky., where they finally
hit pillows Monday night after a rally at the Louisville Motor
Speedway. The rest of the week includes visits to Cleveland,
Detroit, New Orleans and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   THE SENATE SHOO-INS IN FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   Florida holds a Senate primary on Tuesday but the outcome is not
in doubt: Democrat Bill Nelson and Rep. Bill McCollum, a
Republican, should trounce unknown challengers to move on to the
general election with independent candidate Willie Logan, a state
legislator. Neither Nelson, the state insurance commissioner, nor
McCollum appears particularly nervous. Nelson goes into the fall
campaign with a double-digit lead in public opinion polls and a $1
million financial edge, prompting Democrats to rate this race as a
top opportunity to pick up a Republican seat now held by Sen.
Connie Mack, who is retiring. The combative tone of the campaign is
certain to strain the relationship between the two men, who had
sleep-overs during their days in high school government and
represented adjoining congressional districts. They have something
else in common _ Bill is neither's first name. McCollum is actually
Ira William while Nelson is Clarence William. ``It's Ira vs.
Clarence,'' said one campaign aide.

 &HT;    AT HOME WITH THE PRACTICAL MAN
 &HT;    Let our guru of good sense help you take the labor out of Labor
Day weekend
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Sweet mother of God!
</P>
<P>
   The practical man has lost his bearings. Here he is in the Home
and Garden section, with misguided readers who spend hideous hours
hoeing bean rows, hanging curtains and hauling hedge clippings to
the curb.
</P>
<P>
   Yikes! What are you guys thinking?! Who cares what color your
house is, as long as the roof doesn't leak? How many weeds are you
going to yank before you realize the weeds will win? And _ good
lord! _ don't you know the living room doesn't get any bigger just
because you rearrange the furniture?
</P>
<P>
   But OK, the practical man didn't come to criticize. He's here to
help _ and he has the credentials. Yes, he too has tried to grow
vegetables in the sand. It's a season he still remembers ruefully
as The Year of the $500 Green Bean. He too built a backyard shed _
now a lizard lounge jammed with kid junk he calls The $1,000 Trash
Can. Indeed, the practical man has laid enough tile, built enough
furniture, hung enough wallpaper and painted, planted and pounded
enough to perceive the painful truth: Home improvement is where the
heartache is.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't all in vain. He's distilled his lifetime of labor
around the house into a handy handbook, which he now offers for
homeowners everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   THE PRACTICAL MAN'S GUIDE TO HOME IMPROVEMENT
</P>
<P>
   Cut no grass: The practical man does not mow lawns. He deduced
years ago that this hopelessly futile misery is better left to
kids, for only they can profit from battles with Mother Nature. Not
only do they get cold cash (after a job, the practical man
typically hoses them down and flings them a fiver), they also
experience the frustration of a losing battle, which will soon
prompt them to give up their childish nonsense and become practical
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The practical man understands, however, that not everyone has
children. Thus, to his barren brethren, he recommends the next best
thing: A goat.
</P>
<P>
   This bold move may shock some at first (especially neighbors),
but its brilliance will become obvious when Billy begins munching
every blade and branch he can reach, freeing your yard of
aggravation for the very practical price of feed and water.
</P>
<P>
   Build no shed: Expensive garden implements are the tools of
fools, for no matter how carefully you tuck them into your shed
after first use, they soon will migrate _ usually assisted by a
child or spouse _ to a rusty residence against the fence. Thus, the
practical man says skip the shed. Instead, buy the cheapest
possible shovels, hoes, wheelbarrows and the like and leave them
scattered about the yard. This brilliant stroke saves cash, for not
only will you be spared the time and expense of shed construction,
you'll never again be tempted to pay $30 for a spade whose handle
is doomed to rot in six months. As a bonus, it keeps the practical
man's blood pressure in check, for he's less likely to bellow when
Junior hauls a shabby shovel off-site to conduct a requiem for Red
Robin.
</P>
<P>
   Plant no palms: The practical man has a soft spot for trees, for
most require little upkeep and create shade that both cools the
house and kills high-maintenance and meaningless ornamentals such
as grass, flowers, hedges, etc. But one specimen is an exception:
the palm. This pathetic puke of a tree finds no quarter in the
practical man's yard for two reasons: First, a streetlight casts
more shade. Second, it's the enemy of man.
</P>
<P>
   A full-grown queen palm fouls the yard with innumerable seeds,
which, if not immediately dispatched, become a tangle of tenacious
sprouts at Momma's feet. The queen protects her babes by dangling
death-dealing dried up fronds over them _ immense and seemingly
inaccessible _ until you stoop to slaughter her children, whereupon
she drops one on your head.
</P>
<P>
   The queen's cousins are equally egregious. Areca palms create a
wild and unruly hedge that harbors all manner of cockroaches,
snakes and other hideous beasts. Palmetto fronds can slice through
slabs of sweaty flesh. Cabbage palms cunningly tempt tots to climb,
then rip legs wide open on the way down. Coconut palms can kill a
man.
</P>
<P>
   The Amish are right: The practical man doesn't believe in paint,
nor in any cosmetic improvements that create work but serve no
purpose. If he had his way, he'd slap waterseal on the fascia,
primer on the awnings and let the stucco fend for itself.
</P>
<P>
   The practical man, however, is no slave to his own philosophy.
He is aware his position is often not worth maintaining in the face
of unenlightened neighbors and spouses, whose ignorance in these
matters is typically vast and wrathful.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, as a compromise, he paints his house Amish style _ white
with black trim _ and sticks with it. The combination is a winner
for several reasons, among them: 1) It never goes out of fashion,
thus eliminating costly makeovers when pink suddenly becomes passe.
2) Touch-up paint is easily purchased _ with the following words:
``I'll take a gallon of black and a gallon of white.'' Never again
will you find yourself thumbing through color charts in a desperate
but doomed bid to match Sumptuous Sorbet and Concupiscent
Cranberry.
</P>
<P>
   To heck with the deck: The dream: Friends and family gather
round on your beautiful backyard deck, where lemonade is served,
steaks sizzle on the grill and kiddies skedaddle in the sweet
summer breeze. The reality: Blow a grand on lumber, spend a month
sweating, swearing and hammering nails, hold one party to
celebrate, then turn your masterpiece over to the rats, 'coons,
possums and toads that will take up residence beneath it while you
beg and cajole your family to pleasepleaseplease let's eat outside
just this one time tonight _ I swear, it's only 95 degrees and the
bugs aren't even that bad!
</P>
<P>
   Cheer up my brother, live in the sunshine: For the love of God,
people, make a decision and go with it. If you have something to
hide, shame on you but plaster over your windows and be done with
it. If you don't, live in the sunshine and like it. Only mealy
mouthed mulletheads and liberal arts majors are so on-the-one-hand
hobbled that they'll waste money and endure the constant
aggravation of verticals, mini-blinds, curtains and other
cockamamie contraptions designed to keep windows in a perpetual
state of indecision. Rip those suckers down, NOW! You'll save
thousands, and you'll never again curse God's green earth when a
vertical clangs and bangs and slithers a slat to the floor, or a
blind breaks free and brains you, or her cat claws its cuddly way
up the curtains.
</P>
<P>
   Papier touche: Wallpaper is wonderful for couples considering
divorce, for nothing can deliver a swifter, sharper and more
certain coup de grace to love than an afternoon wedged in a
bathroom, working shoulder to shoulder with your betrothed at such
a deliciously doomed venture. Trust the practical man: Harsh words,
evil eyes and perhaps even subpoenas will be exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The practical man avoids wallpaper at all costs and goes one
step further: He paints all ceilings, baseboards, doors, window
frames, closets and walls white _ forever. The genius of this
gesture is immediately apparent, for white is not only tasteful and
a perfect match for all shades of furniture, countertops and
cabinets. It also eliminates trim work. No more masking tape. No
more cheesy edging gadgets that never work. Paint the whole house
with one roller and one brush, and don't wash them out till you're
through.
</P>
<P>
   Wood you, or woodn't you: Single folk can floor as they will,
but carpet is crucial for couples with kids. Dainty decorators
declare tile and wood look prettier, but with them come noises
you'd rather not hear. The sickening splat when a nipper's noggin
knocks marble, for instance. The thunderous thunk when noodle plows
parquet. Even worse are the riotous reverberations that trail a
toddler's every move in a manse unmuffled by a nice, cheap Berber.
Trust the practical man, a tile floor under a vaulted ceiling is no
place to premiere the ``Sonata for Pot and Pan.''

 &HT;    The practical man's toolbox
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   10 ITEMS NO HOMEOWNER SHOULD BE WITHOUT
</P>
<P>
   1. WD-40: The single most practical product on the planet. The
only thing this spray oil won't unstick is your teenager's behind
from the couch. For that, you'll need a less versatile item with an
equally cool name: the M-80.
</P>
<P>
   2. Axe: Don't have the back to be a lumberjack? Bah! When that
tree gets too intimate with your sewer line, roots are going to
roll. And trust the practical man, with a house full of stopped-up
toilets, you'll be chopping like a champ.
</P>
<P>
   3. Broom handle: Perfect for planting corn, beans, radishes and
other vegetable seeds. Even better for thwack-thwack-thwacking
tubby toads, slippery serpents and neighborhood cats that don't
know a lily bed from a litter box.
</P>
<P>
   4. 1 hoagie (in case of pangs) and 1 stogie (in case of pains _
like biting flies, and critical wives).
</P>
<P>
   5. Chain saw: Oh, the simple life, where Pa bores holes with a
hand drill, smooths lumber with a plane and trims trees with his
pappy's crosscut saw _ Fie! The practical man will trade that
sweat-soaked fuddy-duddy foolishness any day for this blessed
beast. Don't have a banyan to decapitate? Turn the stanky, snarling
son loose on the cherry hedge every now and then just for the rush.
</P>
<P>
   6. Caulk: Not a pro? Neither is the practical man. That's why he
loads up on this goop. Caulk not only protects your house against
moisture. It also protects your handywork from undue criticism, for
it fills the gaps between any number of miscut boards.
</P>
<P>
   7. Spackle: And plenty of it, if you want to patch things up
with minimal fuss after somebody buys a copy of that evil tome,
Metropolitan Home, and runs you through this wringer: Hang the
picture there. (Drill, molly, screw.) Oops! Nope, wouldn't it look
better over there. (Drill, molly, screw.) On second thought, there!
</P>
<P>
   8. Plumbing kit: Pipe tape, check. Pipe wrench, check. Bucket to
hold repulsive crud extracted from drain trap, check. Wait,
something's missing. Oh yeah. Ear muffs to shield the wee ones from
the stream of profanity that will begin spewing from your mouth
approximately 47 seconds after sticking your head under the sink.
</P>
<P>
   9. Electrical kit: Wire nuts, yep. Wire snips, yep. Electrical
tape, yep. Bucket to hold odious ooze that begins pouring from your
pores the instant you kill the main breaker and the A.C. dies? See
Item 8.
</P>
<P>
   10. 20-pound sledge: A sure and swift remedy for all sorts of
suburban snafus. That aluminum shed that shed its beauty within a
year? CLANG! That chipped Chattahoochee that came with the house?
WHOMP! That palm stump that's just a little too in touch with its
roots? THUD! Also effective as a prom-night prop when meeting
daughter's date.

 &HT;    The big apple for small change
 &HT;    By Luma Muhtadie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you've ever wanted to visit New York City but
never thought you had the means, think again. Whether you're headed
uptown, midtown or downtown, there are tons of inexpensive and even
free activities that let you take Manhattan without taking yourself
to the cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, lodging tops the list of expenditures in New York
City. However, if you're ready to go hostel-style in lieu of a
hotel, then yu're well on your way to experiencing New York on the
cheap. A hostel does not necessarily mean overcrowded and
institutional. The Big Apple Hostel in upper west Manhattan offers
rooms that sleep two people ($80 per room) or four people ($30 per
person). If you're making the trip with a few friends, then you
won't have to compromise your privacy and you'll pay a fraction of
the price of a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving money on accommodations, the Big Apple
Hostel also has a kitchen and backyard BBQ. This means that you
won't have to spend heavily on dining out for every meal.
</P>
<P>
   UPTOWN: CENTRAL PARK
</P>
<P>
   In 1857, Frederick Law Olmsted drew the ``Greensward Plan'' for
the park. Its ``one great purpose,'' Olmsted wrote, ``is to supply
to the 100s of thousands of tired workers, who have no opportunity
to spend their summers in the country, a specimen of God's
handiwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Olmsted's mission seems to have succeeded: Spanning upper
Manhattan from 59th to 110th streets, the park is an 843-acre oasis
that provides a haven not only from hard work, but also from heavy
spending _ because some of the most interesting things to see and
do in Central Park are absolutely free.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry Fields is a 2 1/2-acre, tear-shaped garden just off
the park entrance at 72nd Street that was paid for by Yoko Ono. It
is just one of the sites in the park honoring John Lennon, who was
killed in front of the Dakota apartment building nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Park Summer Stage at Rumsey Playfield hosts daily
performances all summer. Everything from concerts to poetry
readings, all performed by professional artists, can be enjoyed for
free.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare and other plays are performed at the open-air
Delacorte Theatre each summer by the New York Shakespeare Festival.
Tickets are required to attend these performances, but they can be
obtained for free.
</P>
<P>
   Die-hard Shakespeareans can also walk through the Shakespeare
garden around 79th Street, which contains half the plants mentioned
in his plays.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd simply like to picnic, sunbathe, or throw a ball
around, the Great Lawn is the place to be. Located behind the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, you can relax the day away in a setting
where the tips of the city skyscrapers peek around the edges of the
richest green grass and trees. While in the area, you may also want
to scoot over to the Metropolitan Museum to catch the free summer
concerts given by the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan
Opera.
</P>
<P>
   MIDTOWN: ROCKEFELLER CENTER, GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL, MOMA,
BROADWAY
</P>
<P>
   Spanning 11 acres of midtown Manhattan (from 49th to 52nd
streets) the Rockefeller Center is a city within the city. The
centerpiece, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, is the home of the NBC studio
where ``Saturday Night Live,'' ``Late Night with Conan O'Brien''
and ``NBC News'' are taped. Outside the building, there is a list
of all the tapings that can be attended, along with details on how
to get tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefeller Center Arcade, on Fifth Avenue between 49th and
50th streets, is another must-see. The famous statue of Prometheus
looms over beautiful gardens that lead to an outdoor restaurant.
This subground area (which turns into the skating rink depicted on
many Hollywood films during the winter months) is encircled by
flags of all the nations of the world. A variety of art-deco works,
nouveau murals and mosaics grace the walls throughout the
Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   For starving artists or frugal art aficionados, the Museum of
Modern Art (MOMA) on West 53rd Street lets you ``pay what you
wish'' to enter the museum between 4:30 p.m. and 8:15 p.m. Fridays.

   Grand Central Terminal, at East 42nd Street and Park Avenue,
offers a perfect venue for people-watching, an activity some find
as intriguing as art. A $175 million renovation that was completed
only four years ago has transformed this train station into a
shrine to transportation. The 120-foot ceiling of the main
concourse is covered by a sublime celestial map. The sound of
musicians pleasantly intermingles with the bustle of commuters.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun goes down, neon signs and billboards illuminate
Times Square. The streets become crowded as locals and tourists
come out to play. While there are plenty of crowded bars, cozy
pubs, restaurants, shops and movie theaters to choose from, the
truly ``playful'' won't want to miss the opportunity to catch one
of many Broadway shows. A discount ticket vendor at the north end
of Times Square offers half-price tickets to the shows. Get there
soon after it opens.

<P>
   BETWEEN MIDTOWN AND DOWNTOWN: GREENWICH VILLAGE
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich Village, which New Yorkers simply call ``the
Village,'' is one of the most vibrant parts of the city. Ever since
New York University was planted next to Washington Square in 1831,
Greenwich Village has been largely inhabited by students. NYU is
known for its radical politics and tolerant attitudes, which might
explain the influx of writers and artists into the village since
the mid 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Allan Poe, Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Hart Crane, Norman
Rockwell, Jack Kerouac, Bob Dylan, and many others have chosen to
live and work in Greenwich Village. The brick townhouses and low
rises, the tiny green parks and courtyards and the tree-lined
streets give the area a certain charm at once both serene and
surreal.
</P>
<P>
   DOWNTOWN: THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT
</P>
<P>
   Now that you know a thing or to about how to save money in
Manhattan, you might as well find out a thing or two about how it's
made. Whether you're interested in economics or not, the financial
district is fascinating .
</P>
<P>
   At the New York Stock Exchange, on the third floor of 20 Broad
St., you can view 3,000 companies trade more than 253 billion
shares of stock, valued at more than $11 trillion. The NYSE
Interactive Education Center offers free tours that help to make
sense of the pandemonium on the trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the World Trade Center at Two World Trade Center,
Suite 1520, is the highest point from which to view New York City
(yes, higher than the Empire State Building). At 110 stories, it is
actually the highest open-air deck in the world. While the view
comes at a cost ($13 for adults, $11 for students, $10 for
military, and $6.50 for children) the view at sunset, when the city
lights up as the sun disappears, is worth every penny.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to dine like a New York banker, but don't have the
means to finance a costly dinner at the World Trade Center
restaurant, consider heading down to 160 Broadway, one block east
of the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   You will find yourself at the poshest McDonald's ever. There are
fresh flowers on every table, a stock ticker with a 30-second
delay, servers in tuxedos and a baby grand piano played between 11
a.m. and 3 p.m. every day.
</P>
<P>
   BEYOND DOWNTOWN: STATEN ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   From Battery Park, the Staten Island Ferry travels to the St.
George terminal on Staten Island. The ferry provides fantastic
views of the New York skyline and scoots right past the Statue of
Liberty. Best of all, it is only 50 cents round-trip!
</P>
<P>
   Once you get to Staten Island, there is an outdoor paradise that
can scarcely be envisioned from the rusty environs of the ferry
terminal. The Greenbelt is a park nearly three times the size of
Central Park where you can spend another afternoon enjoying the
outdoors.

 &HT;    Life behind the scenes for child actors
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I've always wondered why any parent would let
their child go into show business. Sure, the potential for huge
paydays is tempting. But is the price that must be paid for that
possible fortune worth it? On Monday, A&AMP;E will air ``Child Stars:
Their Story'': 9-11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Child Stars: Their Story `` attempts to reveal what it's
really like being a young star. The two-hour documentary, narrated
by Hayley Mills, assembled an impressive array of talent (over 30
in all) from five generations. Patty Duke (''The Patty Duke Show'')
talks about being forced to go to her dad's funeral in her
character's costume and makeup. David Faustino (''Married...with
Children'') remembers what it was like drinking at Hollywood's
hottest nightclubs at 14. Melissa Gilbert (''Little House on the
Prairie''), one of ``Child Stars''' executive producers, recalls
crying, sweating and breaking out in a rash after forgetting her
lines. Diana Serra Cary (''Baby Peggy'') recalls feeling like a
``senior citizen'' at age 15.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to several interviews, ``Child Stars'' also features
a roundtable during which eight former stars, including Kim Fields
(''The Facts of Life''), Jerry Mathers (''Leave it to Beaver'') and
Sara Gilbert (''Roseanne'') talk openly about drugs, rejection and
the pros and cons of having a sexy image.
</P>
<P>
   Child stars are often robbed of a normal childhood. Growing up
is hard enough. Imagine having to do it in front of millions of
people watching your every move or snickering about every
goofy-looking pimple you get. The pressure to perform is also
insanely intense. Many adult actors can't even take the heat and
often resort to drugs and alcohol to cope. Just think what it's
like for a kid to overhear a producer angrily talking about low
ratings and possible cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   And in a business where rejection is the norm, just what kind of
toll does that take on a child's psyche?
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, child stars seem to have it all. They make great
money. Get invited to glamorous parties and have adoring fans
screaming their names. But when the cameras stop rolling and the
director yells, ``Cut!'' the bottom line is, many are just sad,
lonely and scared little kids.
</P>
<P>
   When you hear the term ``former child star,'' most people, I'm
sure, immediately think of such troubled actors as Todd Bridges
(''Diff'rent Strokes''). Bridges' brushes with drugs and the law
are now legendary. In the special, he says he always felt more at
home on the ``Diff'rent Strokes'' set because his real dad was a
raging alcoholic who acted like a ``pit bull'' at home.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the stories are tales of woe. Some are downright
hilarious. Bill Mumy (''Lost in Space''), for example, remembers
shooting an ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents ``episode when he was 7.
Mumy kept fidgeting during his scene, which drove the intimidating
director nuts. So, Hitchcock finally told a terrified Mumy that if
he didn't stop moving, he'd nail his feet to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the blood,'' Hitchcock intoned, ``will come pouring out
like milk.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's the always delightful Danny Bonaduce (''The
Partridge Family'') who loved his time as a child star. ``I was
short, fat with red hair and freckles,'' he says, ``and I took two
cheerleaders to the prom...life was wonderful.''

 &HT;    Panel unites TV, PC on 1 screen
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you can't decide whether you want to watch
television or work on your computer, Samsung offers a pair of
thin-profile monitors that lets you do both things at once.
</P>
<P>
   SyncMaster MP flat-panel monitors are liquid crystal monitors
for your computer but they also have built-in television tuners and
input jacks to accept programming from VCRs, camcorders, DVD
players and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   Using the monitors' picture-in-picture feature, users can
reserve a corner of the monitor screen to watch Olympic broadcasts
or recorded movies while using the rest of the screen to run
spreadsheet programs or surf the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The monitors come in two sizes: the 15-inch SyncMaster 150MP
with a manufacturer's suggested price of $1,119, and the 17-inch
SyncMaster 170MP, which sells for about $1,769.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung spokesman Michael Ingalls said the monitors have
built-in stereo speakers and can be used as stand-alone television
sets. They can be connected to cable or satellite television
services or they can be used with an antenna to pick up local
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The video screen has a digital zoom feature that allows viewers
to magnify images on the screen up to 64 times their normal size.
</P>
<P>
   Samsung is shipping the monitors to retail outlets, but they
aren't available yet in Dayton stores.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about the products, call Samsung at (800)
726-7864 (SAMSUNG) or visit the Web site at www.samsungmonitor.com.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush on Friday defended a new
advertisement that challenges the credibility and character of Vice
President Al Gore and signaled that his frequent pledge to ``change
the tone'' of politics would not prevent him from raising questions
about Gore's truthfulness and leadership abilities in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In an extended interview on his campaign plane, he repeatedly
remarked, almost as if intoning a mantra, that the Democrats had
now run $30 million in ads against him. And he cast the new
Republican commercial ridiculing Gore and bringing up the vice
president's 1996 fund-raising appearance at a Buddhist temple as a
way to undermine public confidence in Gore's own accusations
against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is what's going to happen in the campaign, we've got
to lay the groundwork: This is a fellow that will say anything,''
Bush said, referring to Gore. ``The point is, this is a way to help
inoculate me about what has come and is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   He later added that ``the Republican party is putting people on
notice that he is willing to exaggerate in order to win, to curry
their favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke, for nearly 45 minutes, at a pivotal moment in his
campaign. He was not only heading into the Labor Day weekend and
the final two months of the race, but also trying to emerge from a
bumpy two weeks on the campaign trail, during which he was often
thrown off his chosen message and put on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there have been accumulating signs that Bush's
sustained advantage over Gore in the polls has vanished. In recent
days, several nationwide polls have shown the race to be a dead
heat, and a Newsweek poll released Friday found Gore with a lead of
10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Even on Friday, on his campaign plane, Bush was pelted with
questions that had nothing to do with his designated themes of the
week. During an impromptu news conference, reporter after reporter
sharply questioned him about how the attack commercial, which is
being run by the Republican National Committee, with the approval
of the Bush campaign, squared with his promise to take the high
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was tongue-in-cheek,'' he told reporters. ``This
ad came up after about $30 million of advertisements that had been
attacking me and my record, and I'm glad they came to my defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was raising questions about Gore's
truthfulness, he said, ``No, I'm just saying this is a man who'll
say things like he's for campaign-funding reform and then
conveniently forgets he went to the Buddhist temple.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the subsequent interview, Bush projected a demeanor that
was alternately intense and jocular, cutting and funny, and that
never showed any fissures of worry.
</P>
<P>
   He went out of his way to assert that he was pleased with the
state of the race. ``I just want to tell you what my mood is, if
you don't mind,'' he said, unprompted. ``I feel great. I do. I feel
comfortable. My spirits are high.''
</P>
<P>
   But he exhibited subtle, fleeting flashes of irritation when the
topic turned to questions about the finances of his running mate,
Dick Cheney, and, earlier, when a grilling about the Republican
National Committee's ad went on for more than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this interview on one ad?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Told that there were more subjects to come, he said, ``Then keep
going, will you?''
</P>
<P>
   On the question of Cheney's retirement package, which includes
lucrative stock options in Halliburton, an energy services company
that could be affected by federal policy, Bush said he had known
about the package when he picked Cheney as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will deal with the options issue in a way that is
comforting to the people,'' Bush said. ``He'll deal with it. Dick
Cheney's an honest man and when he says he'll do something, he'll
do something.'' (Later in the day, Cheney announced that if
elected, he would forfeit the stock options he had not yet been
able to exercise.)
</P>
<P>
   At another moment, his eyes grew wet as he reflected, in an
almost elegiac tone, on the ``amazing experience'' of running for
president. ``I am so honored to be one of two coming down the
stretch _ I am,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he was suddenly teary, he said: ``I'm not teary. I'm
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   He also referred several times to his father's presidential
campaigns, drawing comfort from the lessons of the past and the
perspective it gives him. He acknowledged that many political
analysts believe he cannot beat an incumbent administration in
peaceful prosperous times.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that a different kind of conventional wisdom proved
wrong when his father defeated Michael Dukakis in 1988. He recalled
how pundits at the time cited the ``Van Buren factor,'' which was
the idea ``that no sitting vice president could possibly be
elected, because it had never happened since Martin Van Buren.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``Therefore George H.W. Bush could not possibly
win,'' and added that each campaign brings ``a historical certainty
that always seems to get defeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush provided some insight into how his campaign would engage
Gore over the next few weeks, making clear that he would keep
trumpeting the charge that Gore and President Clinton had
squandered their time in the White House and failed to do what they
had told Americans they would.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it amazing _ and I think America will, too _ that some
of the same campaign issues they ran on in '92 are issues they run
on in the year 2000,'' Bush said, lumping Gore and Clinton
together. He mentioned Medicare reform, Social Security reform and
a middle-class tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would convince Americans that the Democratic
administration bore the blame and not the leaders of the Republican
Congress, he said, in reference to Gore, ``It sounds like this is a
campaign where they're going to be willing to say, `Give me credit
for things that went well, but let's blame others for failure.' And
to me, I think Americans will realize that's not what a leader
does.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He brushed aside any suggestion that voters might decide that
his engagement of Gore contradicted his promise to ``change the
tone,'' a claim so central to his candidacy that it was the
designated theme _ printed on banners _ for the week after the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is politics,'' Bush said. He then drew a distinction
between campaigning and governing _ between ads and his
willingness, if he is elected, to work with Democrats like Sens.
John Breaux of Louisiana and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska on issues such
as Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In much the same manner that he used in dealing with questions
about the ads, Bush dismissed any idea that voters were paying
attention to the debate over presidential debates and the fact that
he had not agreed to the three forums proposed by the bipartisan
commission on presidential debates. Gore has accepted those
invitations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that this was a familiar replay of his campaign for
governor in 1994, when the then-incumbent, Ann Richards, accused
him of dodging debates.
</P>
<P>
   Mocking the Richards camp, he said: ``I remember it clearly. `He
won't debate! He won't debate! He won't debate! He won't debate!'
And we debated, and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks about the Republican attack ad, Bush made clear
that he did not like Gore's frequent assertions that the Texas
governor was not offering specific enough policies on matters like
prescription-drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the Republicans had chosen to run the ad now, he
referred to $30 million in Democratic commercials and then added,
``The rhetoric started getting a little harsh _ `Put up or shut
up.''' Gore has been using that refrain to goad Bush to give more
specifics on his policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush now plans to release a Medicare prescription-drug plan next
week. Until now he had outlined some broad principles and spoken
positively of one bipartisan bill in the Senate. He insisted Friday
that he had ``always planned'' to provide more detail. He said he
also planned to return next week to the issue of military
preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that he did not intend to provide more particulars
of his call to divert some of the Social Security payroll tax to
individual investment accounts. ``My Social Security position is
where it is,'' he said, adding that he thought voters understood
the fundamentals of what he was proposing.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, Bush said that despite his and Cheney's
criticisms of the Clinton administration's peacekeeping missions,
he would not pull U.S. troops out of Bosnia and Kosovo immediately
if elected, ``because I understand the commitment to which we are
bound.'' He added, ``But I will work with our allies to lay the
groundwork for them to take up more of the peacekeeping role in
Bosnia and Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone of Bush's remarks during the interview meandered from a
serene confidence about his chances of victory to an almost
nostalgic distance from the race.
</P>
<P>
   He talked for a minute or two at one point about how important
it was to use the campaign to build a governing mandate for the
first 100 days of a Bush presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I'm going to win, and when I win, I want to get some
things done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also talked about the privilege of being a part of
history, no matter what the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great journey,'' he said. ``I'm going to look back
on these days.''
</P>
<P>
   He said repeatedly that he trusted the judgment of the American
people, although he did not always like it, mentioning his father's
failed 1992 re-election effort as an example.
</P>
<P>
   And if voters ultimately decided against him, as well?
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously, I would respect that,'' he said. ``I'm not going to
like it.''

FLAWS IN DIGITAL WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY SAID TO ALLOW EAVESDROPPING
</HEADLINE>
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
   Two researchers have found that a widely heralded new wireless
technology contains flaws that could permit an eavesdropper to
listen in on a digital conversation or determine the user's
identity.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The researchers are from Lucent Technologies, one of nine
corporations developing the technology, known as Bluetooth, whose
backers say it will make possible a new era of effortless and
untethered communication between all kinds of hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies have recently begun shipping sample quantities
of the Bluetooth technology, which has been expected to be widely
available in the first half of next year, and more than 1,000
companies are backing the standard.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kan, a member of the Bluetooth technical standards group
and a Lucent marketing manager, said he expected that the problem
could be fixed ``relatively quickly'' and would not seriously delay
the technology's deployment.
</P>
<P>
   The Bluetooth system is intended to permit cellular phones,
portable computers, headsets and other mobile devices to exchange
digital information easily without cords or wires. It has a
potential range of 30 feet to 300 feet, but is initially planned
for devices in relatively close proximity.
</P>
<P>
   The flaws were discovered by Markus Jacobson and Susanne Wetzel,
researchers in the secure systems research department at Lucent's
Bell Laboratories unit.
</P>
<P>
   One shortcoming would have permitted an eavesdropper in a
cybercafe to place a bugging device in such a way that the
encryption key used by the Bluetooth devices could be obtained,
Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining the key would let the intruder listen in on a
conversation between two Bluetooth devices.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also discovered that it was possible to obtain
the identity of a Bluetooth device, making it traceable and
potentially compromising the security of a user.
</P>
<P>
   An independent security expert said that the Bluetooth security
model was still untested and that other flaws were likely to be
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably dozens of vulnerabilities,'' said the
expert, Bruce Schneier, founder and chief technical officer of
Counterpane Internet Security. ``The basic problem is that you're
building a system that allows devices who don't know each other to
communicate. I believe there are too many things that can go
wrong.''

 &HT;    Turnover of CFOs increases sharply
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You can probably name baseball players that have stuck
with one team longer than the CFO of your favorite company has been
with that organization.
</P>
<P>
   Get used to it. Job-hopping has become a career path for chief
financial officers. So far this year, 43 of Georgia's 244 publicly
traded companies have replaced their chief financial officers.
</P>
<P>
   The turnover trend is national in scope. It is being driven, say
executive recruiters and chief financial officers, by openings at
new companies, in addition to retirements, promotions, burnout and
firings.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Executives Institute surveyed chief financial
officers in September and found 27 percent of those polled had
changed jobs within the last two years. A quarter of the executives
said they planned to switch jobs within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of a chief financial officer, for whatever reason,
is akin to a key player leaving a baseball team, and it grabs the
attention of investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always concerned; they kind of think of (the CFO)
as the second in command,'' said Roy Vogeltanz, spokesman for
Marietta, Ga.-based CryoLife, one of the companies that changed
chief financial officers this year. Analysts and investors wonder,
he added, ``How long is it going to take him or her (the
replacement) to learn the business?''
</P>
<P>
   In CryoLife's case, the answer was not long, since the new chief
financial officer, Ashley Lee, had been the company's controller
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors are more concerned with why a chief financial
officer leaves than who the successor is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would probably be a mistake to rush out and sell every time
a CFO quits, but it is a red flag,'' said Atlanta money manager
Scott Satterwhite of Artisan Partners. ``What you fear when one of
these things is announced is whether the CFO is cooking the books
or he sees something in the company that looks bad to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Satterwhite's worst fears are seldom borne out, he added. But
that doesn't keep him from worrying. ``It may be a low probability,
but the consequences are high,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human nature is always going to fear the worst,'' said Edwin
Cordell, who left the chief financial officer's post at CryoLife
this year. His resignation ``to pursue other career opportunities''
was announced on April 19, and he promptly received phone calls
from a couple of analysts who follow the company.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts, Cordell recalled, were surprised at the news.
``They were trying to find out if there was a disagreement between
the CEO and CFO; if there is a problem with the technology'' at
CryoLife, which preserves tissue for surgical use and makes heart
valves and surgical glue.
</P>
<P>
   Cordell said the analysts' concerns were eased when he let them
know he was headed for another company. The next day, Novoste, a
Norcross company that developed a device to keep arteries from
reclosing after they have been unblocked, announced it had hired
Cordell as chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Cordell is not the only executive to move from one metro Atlanta
company to another. The opportunities in the area are such that a
chief financial officer can switch jobs without changing home
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really have to leave (Atlanta) if you don't want
to,'' said Michael Casey, chief financial officer of iXL
Enterprises since late July.
</P>
<P>
   Casey was chief financial officer at RedCelsius before joining
iXL Enterprises. Prior to that, he was chief financial officer at
metro area companies Manhattan Associates and Colorocs Information
Technologies, and vice president of finance at the since-acquired
IQ Software. He helped take Manhattan Associates and IQ Software
public.
</P>
<P>
   The demand by IPO-minded high-technology companies for chief
financial officers has accentuated the turnover among his
colleagues, according to Casey. His viewpoint is supported by Peter
Crist, founder of Crist Partners, a Chicago-based executive search
firm that's now part of Korn/Ferry International.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've had hundreds and hundreds of new companies formed in
the last 12 months,'' noted Crist. He added that new companies
planning to go public want to have a chief financial officer on
board who has public company experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``That manifests itself in being constantly bombarded by the
premier executive recruiting firms,'' Casey said.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of demand, it's no surprise chief financial
officers are making much more than they did just a few years ago.
According to Business Week, the median pay for a chief financial
officer last year was $1.1 million, almost double the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
   But with more money comes more responsibility and pressure,
according to executive recruiter Crist.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have is a kind of new strategy where you have a
partnership between the CEO and the CFO,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in general the CFO role has moved beyond tabulating
and communicating (financial) results to adding value in the
operating area,'' suggested Casey.
</P>
<P>
   Chief financial officers now are involved in mergers and
acquisitions, risk management, information technology and research
and development, in addition to tracking and reporting on
financials and serving as a key contact for Wall Street analysts
and institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   All of that really puts them in the spotlight _ and at higher
risk _ according to Chris Allen, spokesman for the Financial
Executives Institute in Morristown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boards and CEOs,'' he said, ``expect consistent results and
have little patience for anything but that.''

COMMENTARY: GOT A RHYME FOR NAFTA, OR PINK SLIP? 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So Labor Day is upon us, a good time to play those
rousing union songs about the steel-driving John Henry and the
scabbing Casey Jones and the martyred Joe Hill, who I dreamed I saw
last night, alive as you and me.
</P>
<P>
   Hang on hang on hang on.
</P>
<P>
   Great as they are, those numbers have more whiskers than your
granddaddy. Where are the new labor tunes? Where are the lyrics
that speak to a micro-chipped, dot-commed, cell-phoned,
video-crazed, Starbucks-bloated world?
</P>
<P>
   Funny you should ask, because it turns out that there has been a
flowering of musical creativity in recent years, inspired by issues
like globalization, child labor, downsizing, safety in the work
place and jobs heading south thanks to the North American Free
Trade Agreement. These songs may not have a mass market, but they
are around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that nowadays, you probably get more singing than
was ever done except maybe in the days of the Wobblies,'' said Joe
Glazer. He is known in union circles as ``labor's troubadour,''
having written and performed songs about workers since the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Glazer is chairman of the Labor Heritage Foundation, a group
based in Washington that supports the union movement through the
arts. The foundation's executive director, Peter Jones, said
college campuses are especially friendly territory for today's
songwriters. There, you find many who agree that ``society is being
divided into the super-rich and those having trouble getting past
the minimum wage,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   What are the new songs about? Not Harlan County coal miners,
that's for sure. Try repetitive stress injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Physical pain in the meat-packing industry inspired John
O'Connor, an organizer for the New York State Nurses Association,
to come up with a number called ``Carpal Tunnel.'' It starts like
this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the morning at the start of the day/I force my
fingers 'round the handle of the blade/I start to cuttin' just as
fast as I can/By the end of the day, I can hardly move my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Another New Yorker, Bev Grant, wrote ``No Sweat'' with Pat
Humphries. You get the point right away: ``We sew the clothes/The
ones that you buy/We can't afford them for ourselves/The price is
too high.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kirk Kelly, who performed the other day for striking workers
at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, has a song called
``Service Economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We sweated and we bled, but the jobs we knew have fled/And the
workers never got what we deserved,'' it goes. ``Now that you are
done, the factories don't run./And the nation doesn't build, it
serves.''
</P>
<P>
   What many new songs have in common with those of yesteryear is
sympathy with those who endure ``tedium on the job,'' O'Connor
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing much has changed,'' he said. ``Maybe you don't strain
your back so much now, but you get carpal tunnel syndrome instead.
It's the same old song.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's take was this: ``The exploitation is the same. And the
way you build a union is the same. And the reason you build it is
the same. It's all about human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick, Grant said, is to move people to anger, or to tears,
while steering clear of lyrics that sound as if they are cribbed
from a pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``First person is always good,'' she said. ``One of my strengths
is that I do work. And I've been on welfare, and grew up poor. So I
have enough experience to enrich my writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some writers prefer original scores. But melding new words with
familiar tunes is a tried-and-true technique to get juices flowing
on the picket line. It goes at least as far back as the great labor
anthem ``Solidarity Forever,'' written in 1915 to the melody of
``The Battle Hymn of the Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember ``Stand By Me''? Think of its opening notes
accompanying this offering from Julie McCall: ``When the boss calls
me in/And the axe is about to fall/And the pink slip is all that I
can see/I'm not afraid, no I'm not afraid/'Cause I know the union
stands by me.''
</P>
<P>
   If you know ``After Midnight,'' you can sing this by Mark Levy:
``Afta NAFTA, we gonna let your job go down/We gonna import cheaper
labor/Send this plant to our southern neighbor/That is what this
treaty's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   It is enough to inspire an amateur to try his own hand at this
craft. How about an update of the classic ``Union Maid''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking
to the union, till the day I die _ or till the boss offers me stock
options or better health benefits or an IPO.''
</P>
<P>
   On second thought, maybe the act needs more work.
</P>

NOVACAP ACQUIRES BRITISH TECH FIRM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALENCIA, Calif. _ NovaCap Inc., a subsidiary of Dover Corp.,
has acquired Syfer Technology LTD, a British manufacturer of
specialty ceramic electronic components, a company official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not released.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger basically means twice the amount of potential
sales,'' said Vaughn Chicagus, NovaCap's controller. ``The customer
market we serve is domestic and Far East, while they have a minor
presence in the U.S. and dominate Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   No layoffs are planned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition brings together two companies that manufacture
high-voltage safety capacitors, a critical component in modems and
information technology equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Valencia since 1988, NovaCap has been expanding the
company's manufacturing plants in both England and the United
States to satisfy the growing specialty capacitor markets in
telecom, datacom, medical and aerospace industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been hiring all year,'' Chicagus said. ``We have hired
140 people and will continue to hire new employees until we reach
250 total.''
</P>
<P>
   The continued hiring has nothing to do with the Syfer merger, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Syfer is headquartered in Norwich, England, and makes surface
mount capacitors, EMI filters and planner arrays.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of NovaCap's parent company, New York-based Dover Corp.,
fell 0.563 cents, or 1.1 percent, to close Friday at $48.313 on
heavy volume of 472,200 shares traded on the New York Stock
Exchange.

CAN BRUINS TURN THE TIDE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Catholics have Lent. Jews have Yom Kippur. Muslims
have Ramadan. And the UCLA football team had its own period of
atonement - the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was karma or coincidence, the Bruins figure they're
paid in full for the sins of the handicapped parking scandal after
last year's injury-wracked 4-7 season, their second-worst since
1971.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, unranked but newly penitent, begin the season today
at 12:30 p.m. at the Rose Bowl against third-ranked Alabama
determined to show the expected crowd of nearly 80,000 and a
nearly-national TV audience that last year was an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins say they don't look at Alabama, a six-point favorite,
with apprehension but with a sense of opportunity. This isn't Boise
State, it's a chance to clear their name. And are the Bruins ever
hungry for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starving,'' said senior linebacker Tony White, one of
the Bruins game captains today. ``It's like somebody who hasn't
eaten in days and they see a big ol' steak. All of a sudden, he
starts drooling out his mouth. That's us right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, to keep Alabama from knocking the slobber out of them, the
Bruins need to have several questions answered affirmatively:
</P>
<P>
   --Quarterback Cory Paus has looked impressive in fall camp -
throwing crisply and accurately, and making good decisions, but can
he deliver the ball to the Bruins' playmakers and avoid the
critical mistake against an extremely fast, talented defense?
</P>
<P>
   --Can the offensive line, inexperienced and injured a year ago,
protect Paus and provide running room for DeShaun Foster against a
defense that returns eight starters and was ninth in the nation
last year in total defense?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the keys is for our offense to move the ball,'' UCLA
coach Bob Toledo said. ``If their defense just stuffs us and we go
three (plays) and out, three and out, we could be in for some
trouble because they're going to score some points. We have to be
able to run the ball, but it won't be easy to run the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   --Can a defense with a banged-up front seven keep from getting
blown off the ball and can a secondary that's been so porous the
past two seasons cover and tackle adequately?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year I've been here we haven't lived up to
expectations,'' end Kenyon Coleman said of the defense. ``We've got
a lot to prove. We want to show people the Bruins can play
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Tackle Ken Kocher, the Bruins' best lineman against the run,
won't start and is questionable with a high ankle sprain. He won't
be on the field for more than 20 plays, Toledo said. There are also
depth problems at linebacker where Asi Faoa's suspension (fighting)
leaves true freshman Brandon Chillar backing up White, and
weak-side starter Ryan Nece might be limited by a sore shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama will throw all kinds of formations at UCLA, from a
five-receiver shotgun set to the I formation with two tight ends.
It will put a lot of pressure on UCLA to not only defend but
recognize what Alabama's doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're extremely diverse,'' said UCLA defensive coordinator
Bob Field. ``You see every personnel grouping and every conceivable
formation. They put a lot of pressure on you to recognize what
they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alabama is not without questions of its own.
</P>
<P>
   While it lost just two starters on offense, they are guard Chris
Samuels, the No. 2 pick in the draft, and tailback Shaun Alexander,
who scored 23 of the Tide's 38 offensive touchdowns last season.
Until someone establishes himself, tailback will be a committee of
Shaun Bohanon, Ahmaad Galloway and Brandon Miree.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the weight of expectations. Alabama hasn't been
ranked in the top five since 1994 and fans back home are already
talking of a national championship. As many as 25,000 Tide fans are
expected at the Rose Bowl and they're not there to root a team on
to the Outback Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little concerned because of the hype that's going with
this game, going out on the West Coast, and seeing the Rose Bowl
for the first time,'' `Bama coach Mike DuBose said. ``Good football
teams are ready to play when the ball is teed up.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Tide isn't, count on the Bruins to be.
</P>
<P>
   They've excelled as an underdog at home against ranked
nonconference opponents (4-3 since 1988 with narrow losses to
Michigan, Tennessee and Nebraska). And Toledo will be sure the
Bruins come out swinging - emotionally and tactically.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, who loves trick plays, and offensive coordinator Al
Borges have had eight months to pick over film, so if there's a
weakness, they're sure to try to exploit it early. In Toledo's
first three seasons, the Bruins scored on their first possession
against No. 2 Tennessee, Washington State and No. 23 Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet where the Bruins will be at the end of the day even he
wonders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best team we've played since I've been here,''
Toledo said of Alabama. ``We're ahead of last year, but it might
not show it that much. I hope it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Parking is available on the Brookside Golf Course for $5.
Parking is also available at $5 at the Ralph Parsons Engineering
Building on Fair Oaks and Walnut in Pasadena with a free shuttle
bus to and from the Rose Bowl with service beginning at 8:30 a.m.
... Ticket booths and will-call booths at the Rose Bowl will open
at 9 a.m.

WITH TRIBAL STATUS PENDING, PEQUOTS HOPE FOR CASINO 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Eastern Pequot Indians, a Connecticut tribe seeking formal
recognition by the federal government, have publicly acknowledged
for the first time that they hope to build a casino as part of a
larger ``world class'' resort.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, the tribe had declined to discuss its economic
development plans, although casino gambling is widely recognized as
perhaps the most lucrative opportunity afforded by official
recognition from the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, and other
local government officials have opposed the Eastern Pequots'
petition for tribal recognition, saying the tribe does not meet the
historical criteria required under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's interest in casino gambling was first reported
Thursday in The Norwich Bulletin and confirmed Friday in a
statement issued by its council. The statement said the tribe hoped
to develop ``a tourism-based family resort'' in partnership with a
local municipality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will develop a plan that may include hotels, restaurants,
entertainment and shopping, along with golf and other outdoor
activities,'' the tribal vice chairman, Mark Sebastian, said in the
statement. ``Subject to the required federal and state approvals,
we will also examine the feasibility of gaming as part of the
concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said Friday that his office would continue to oppose
recognition for the tribe. ``The specifics of their economic
development plan really are irrelevant to our position on
recognition,'' he said. ``We've asked probative and challenging
questions about the merits of their petition based on factual and
legal gaps that we see in their application.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``And their statement simply confirms suspicions that
are widely held about the plan to do gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal has repeatedly voiced opposition to formal
recognition, last month urging the Interior Department, which
decides the matter, to postpone its decision. But an official at
the Bureau of Indian Affairs, part of the department, has already
issued a preliminary finding favoring recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Tyler, a spokeswoman for the Eastern Pequots, said the
tribe was interested in finding a municipal partner for its
economic development plans. In the past, tribal officials have
thanked the Trump organization for supporting their effort to
achieve recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe shares a reservation of over 200 acres in North
Stonington, Conn., with the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots.

HILLARY CLINTON INTERVENES ON SPY'S BEHALF 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton quietly intervened last week
to save Jonathan Pollard, the American convicted of spying for
Israel, from a transfer to a more dangerous unit of the federal
prison where he is serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's action falls short of calling upon President
Clinton to grant Pollard clemency, her Senate campaign is hoping
that the intervention will make clear her sympathies and strengthen
the first lady's sluggish support among Jews.
</P>
<P>
   A number of New York Jewish leaders, who consider Pollard's
sentence too harsh, are increasing pressure on Hillary Rodham
Clinton to call for his release. Such a move would be a dramatic
break from her husband and from the positions of his
administration's foreign policy and defense establishments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign officials said Friday that Clinton's action,
which was first reported in Friday's New York Post, was not
necessarily a precursor to calling for clemency. ``She did it
because the issue was brought to her attention, and she was
concerned on humanitarian grounds,'' said Howard Wolfson, a Clinton
campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson added that Hillary Rodham Clinton was ``continuing to
study'' the issue. In June, Clinton said that she would ``work on''
forming an opinion before the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, Clinton's opponent, has said that he had not
had the kind of ``secured briefing'' he needed to make a judgment
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard is imprisoned in a special unit of the Federal
Correctional Institution in Butner, N.C. The unit, used primarily
to house nonviolent sex offenders, is considered safer than another
unit to which Pollard was to have been transferred last week.
Pollard's supporters said Friday they worried that he might have
been exposed to rapes, stabbings and other violence there.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton intervened after meeting in Manhattan on Wednesday with
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Assemblyman Dov Hikind of
Brooklyn, an Orthodox Jew whose endorsement she seeks. Although
both men asked her during the hour-and-a-half meeting to call for
clemency for Pollard, it was not until the next day that they
received word of Pollard's impending transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Hikind immediately called Clinton, who quickly contacted ``White
House officials,'' according to her campaign. Those officials,
Wolfson said, got in touch with ``the appropriate authorities.'' He
would not specify more. But by the following day, Friday, Hikind
was informed by Clinton's campaign that the problem had been taken
care of and that Pollard would stay where he was. It was not clear
Friday why prison officials wanted to move Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled that she acted in this particular instance,''
said Hikind, a Democrat who often supports Republicans. ``A lot of
people are gratified by what she did. People see this as positive
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Hikind added that although he is considering endorsing Clinton,
he has not made his support contingent upon her support for
Pollard's release. No such deal was offered at the meeting, he
said, adding that even if the first lady did call for Pollard's
release, that would not be enough for him. ``There are other issues
she needs to address,'' Hikind said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Democrats who support Clinton are divided over how
much Hikind's endorsement matters, and how many votes it would
attract even within his own constituency. The campaign's attitude,
for now, is that his support could not hurt.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pollard pleaded guilty to espionage in 1986 for selling some of
the United States' most sensitive intelligence information to
Israel. His supporters say that Pollard, who was a civilian
intelligence analyst for the Navy, simply passed along information
to an ally that was already receiving U.S. intelligence through
official channels. Military officials say he passed along highly
sensitive material about Soviet weapon designs, among other things,
that jeopardized agents working inside Russia.
</P>
<P>
   His case has been the subject of intense political debate for
years, and it almost derailed the Wye peace agreement in 1998.
Since then, the Clinton administration has been reviewing Israel's
request that Pollard be released. Support for Pollard, who has been
championed by Jews on the right, has been growing among mainstream
and more liberal groups.

EUAN UGLOW, 68, BRITISH REALIST ARTIST 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Euan Uglow, a British realist artist whose work received high
praise in his homeland, died on Thursday in London. He was 68 and
lived in London.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, The Times of London reported.
</P>
<P>
   Uglow won particular praise in Britain for his nudes and his
still lifes. He was so painstaking as an artist that his output was
sometimes only two paintings in a year. He asserted once that
before he finally finished a painting of a model she might have
gotten engaged, married and divorced.
</P>
<P>
   His works were shown in spaces including the Tate Gallery in
London.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Lambert, veteran of the London art world, wrote in The
Guardian Friday that if Uglow's legacy were ``imagined as a string
of gems, the rarest would be his beautifully faceted paintings of
silent nudes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Uglow's views of himself and others in his field could have
a distinctly nonestablishment tone. He wrote in 1996 that the
example of Cezanne ``helps me to dare to follow my most awkward,
foolish passions and obsessions, to wave my own red flags in the
dull faces of late-century salon hacks and killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Uglow was born in London and studied at the Camberwell and Slade
art schools in Britain. He was almost unknown in the United States,
where he had a mixed reception. John Russell, writing in The New
York Times about the exhibition ``Eight Figurative Painters'' at
the Yale Center for British Art in 1981, said that ``to live with
the memory of paintings'' by Uglow, who was one of the eight, ``it
is almost indispensable to have been reared in London.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing works by Uglow on display in 1994 at Salander-O'Reilly
Gallery in Manhattan and at the New York Studio School, Reagan
Upshaw wrote in Art in America, ``Uglow has a superb color sense,
which I suspect derives ultimately from Matisse.''

VIDEO GAME MAKER GIVEN $50 MILLION LINE OF CREDIT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. _ Video game manufacturer THQ Inc. announced
Friday that it has secured a new $50 million line of credit with a
number of financial institutions, including Union Bank of
California.
</P>
<P>
   The new line of credit provides for cash advances or a letter of
credit during the Calabasas-based company's peak selling season,
which is from November to February, according to a company
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Kathy Mendoza explained that the additional credit
line also gives the company up to $25 million in financing outside
the peak selling season.
</P>
<P>
   The company's previous agreement with Union Bank, which recently
expired, provided for cash advances of up to $38 million and a
total line of credit up to $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides all the funds to finance the company for the next
year,'' said Fred Gysi, THQ's senior vice president of finance and
administration and chief financial officer. ``It also allows us to
purchase products during the holiday season.''
</P>
<P>
   Gysi said the company develops and designs interactive
entertainment software for video games, then pays either Sony,
Nintendo or Sega to manufacture the game.
</P>
<P>
   The financing allows THQ to then purchase the finished product
back from Sony, Sega or Nintendo and distribute it to Wal-Mart and
other retailers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of THQ lost 18 cents, or 0.88 percent, to close Friday at
$21.188 on light volume of 47,200 shares traded on the Nasdaq Stock
Market.

 &HT;    Two for one plan to keep workers who want more balanced lives
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jon Vancleve, a work/life consultant with Hewitt
Associates, recently met an interesting pair.
</P>
<P>
   One of Vancleve's banking clients is now employing two people
who share the same job. They are bank managers who split between
them the full-time responsibility for managerial duties of their
branch.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, each had worked at separate offices. But now the two
share one job _ and a place in a growing workplace trend, said
Vancleve, whose office is in the Chicago area.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are finding is that (job sharing) is becoming more
popular,'' he said. ``It's been on the rise for the past five years
as an option for a flexible work arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   A Hewitt survey of American firms found 28 percent of the
companies polled in 1999 allow job sharing. That figure is up from
18 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Job sharing is a work/life arrangement _ with management
approval _ between two employees who share full responsibility for
one job. A common arrangement is for each employee to work three
days a week, with one day overlapping. There are many variations on
the theme, however.
</P>
<P>
   Job sharing first gained national exposure in 1972 when Barney
Olmsted and Suzanne Smith, founders of New Ways to Work in San
Francisco, job-shared the post of director of the nonprofit firm.
</P>
<P>
   The option often comes into play when a company wishes to keep a
valued employee who seeks reduced hours but holds a job requiring
full-time coverage, reported HR Magazine in a recent case study on
the trend.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more workers strive for greater quality of life and
balance between work and personal commitments, and as employers
everywhere look at creative ways to attract and retain good
workers, job sharing has emerged as a creative solution for
satisfying both sides, Vancleve said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually is one of the best retention strategies in today's
market,'' said Katherine M. Donahue, president of the Marietta,
Ga.-based Mercury Group, a consulting firm that specializes in
organizational effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works the best in jobs where it's a transaction-oriented
job like customer service, accounting,'' for example, Donahue said.
</P>
<P>
   It may not work as well with work that requires long-term
projects and close, collaborative communication with clients and
co-workers, she adds.
</P>
<P>
   Decatur, Ga.-based Huddle House Restaurants has incorporated
job-sharing into its training program for about a year now,
according to Mike Wiemers, director of training.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 Huddle House employees in the company's 12-state
system are sharing jobs, Wiemers estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have a cook's position that opens up on second shift, if
we have someone who can work part of it and someone can work the
remaining part of it, we do it that way,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   The employees receive training at times that meet their specific
scheduling needs, if necessary, Wiemers said. Effective
communication between the job partners is stressed by Huddle
House's training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it `talking out of position,' '' Wiemers said,
describing the way the outgoing employee confers with the incoming
worker about the day's duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to make sure that as one's leaving, he's being
talked out of a position as the other is being talked into a
position, so that they know what needs to be done, whether it's
cooking or serving.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's more: ``We do a shift change checklist also . . .
that lets them know what has been accomplished and what should be
accomplished'' during the shift, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Experts expect the job-sharing option to continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers are getting interested in job sharing because it's a
wonderful concept to fill positions that need full-time coverage,
not part-time, and that's what you get 52 weeks a year,'' said
Nadine Mockler, principal of Flexible Resources Inc., a staffing
firm in Cos Cob, Conn., that specializes in permanent jobs with
flexible hours. ``Job sharing's only going to get bigger because
the labor market is shrinking, and the cream is thin on the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Even while some firms have resorted to giving away cars and
large cash bonuses to lure workers, Donahue said job sharing is a
competitive recruiting tool in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge deal to be able to offer something like that,''
she said. ``There are a lot of things important to employees rather
than all the money offers and cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money offers are not as likely to entice (potential job
sharers) because they can't get that flexibility and that control''
over their time.
</P>
<P>
   That management will increasingly turn to job sharing is
something Shari Rosen Ascher is betting on. A job sharer in radio
advertising sales with Maggie Sisco since 1995, the two started
ShareGoals in April, a New York-based, job-sharing consulting firm
that offers training for management and employees and individual
counseling for potential job sharers.
</P>
<P>
   Their Web site, www.Sharegoals.com, has free information about
the option. And she and Sisco continue to job share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, Maggie and I have turned managers who were
doubters of job sharing into believers _ and we outlasted them,''
Ascher said. ``It's a way to keep talented people, and we want to
demystify it. Some managers think it's complicated, more expensive,
more work, and clients may not approve. But we have worked it all
through: Maggie and I even worked back-to-back maternity leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ascher said because of job sharing, she gets to go on class
trips with her kids and kick box and lift weights. ``Even when
stuff happens, work goes on when you job-share,'' she said.
``Employers get two minds and 20 fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   And they get more, according to Dana Mazis, sales manager at the
Hyatt Regency hotel of San Diego. ``Employers get the combined
strengths of two people, and they only have to pay for one,'' said
Mazis, who has job-shared with Susan Stoneback since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first sales managers here to job share, and now
three of our seven managers do, too,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason other Hyatt managers are adopting it: ``It works,''
Mazis said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement works best when employees initiate it, Hewitt's
Vancleve said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen that really makes them work or successful, the
two individuals within job sharing, in that position, really have
to be the ones that approach their manager to recommend the set up,
to make it work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When management puts forth the idea, they must be prepared to
let go of some of the traditional control they may have had over
other employees, Mercury's Donahue said.
</P>
<P>
   The option works best when the job-sharing pair decides who
works when, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I have seen it work best is if you hire people with
dissimilar lives,'' such as one parent and one student, for
example, people whose lifestyle issues are different. Then, for
optimum benefits with job sharing, managers should ``allow the two
people to decide what hours they're going to work and that the two
of them can work that out as they go,'' Donahue added.

LEON HARRIS JR., 74, RETAILER AND BIOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   By SHELLY FREIERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leon A. Harris Jr., a biographer and a former department store
executive, died on Aug. 17 at his home in Dallas. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Jane Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Harvard University in 1947, Harris began
working at A. Harris &AMP; Co., a family-owned department store founded
in 1886 in Dallas by his grandfather Adolph Harris. He held several
positions, including marketing director, before being named
executive vice president in 1950. A. Harris was sold in 1961 to
Federated Department Stores, which owns Macy's and Bloomingdale's,
and later the store was merged with other Federated stores.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who received a bachelor's degree at Harvard, published a
children's book, ``The Night Before Christmas _ in Texas,'' a
parody of the Clement Clark Moore poem, in 1951. He turned to
writing full time after the family business was sold. ``The Fine
Art of Political Wit,'' which traced the history of political humor
since the 18th century, was published in 1964. He followed with two
biographies: ``Only to God: The Extraordinary Life of Godfrey
Lowell Cabot,'' about the industrialist and philanthropist, which
was published in 1967, and ``Upton Sinclair, American Rebel,''
about the writer and social reformer, published in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Harris wrote a history of some of America's most
successful Jewish businessmen, ``Merchant Princes: An Intimate
History of Jewish Families Who Built Great Department Stores.'' In
a review in The New York Times, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt described
the book as a freewheeling narrative that used the stories of the
Filenes of Boston, the Riches of Atlanta, the Rosenwalds of Chicago
and the Marcuses of Dallas, among others, to explore Jewish life,
philanthropy and anecdotes. The book, the review said, was ``sturdy
enough to hold regional history, gossip, personal reminiscences and
a history of the art and science of department-store
merchandising.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris also wrote several other children's books.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by his 2-year-old
daughter, Lee Harris III, and a nephew, Thomas Harris Hartman of
New York.

NOVACAP ACQUIRES BRITISH TECH FIRM

<TEXT>
<P>
   VALENCIA, Calif. _ NovaCap Inc., a subsidiary of Dover Corp.,
has acquired Syfer Technology LTD, a British manufacturer of
specialty ceramic electronic components, a company official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not released.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger basically means twice the amount of potential
sales,'' said Vaughn Chicagus, NovaCap's controller. ``The customer
market we serve is domestic and Far East, while they have a minor
presence in the U.S. and dominate Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   No layoffs are planned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition brings together two companies that manufacture
high-voltage safety capacitors, a critical component in modems and
information technology equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Valencia since 1988, NovaCap has been expanding the
company's manufacturing plants in both England and the United
States to satisfy the growing specialty capacitor markets in
telecom, datacom, medical and aerospace industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been hiring all year,'' Chicagus said. ``We have hired
140 people and will continue to hire new employees until we reach
250 total.''
</P>
<P>
   The continued hiring has nothing to do with the Syfer merger, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Syfer is headquartered in Norwich, England, and makes surface
mount capacitors, EMI filters and planner arrays.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of NovaCap's parent company, New York-based Dover Corp.,
fell 0.563 cents, or 1.1 percent, to close Friday at $48.313 on
heavy volume of 472,200 shares traded on the New York Stock
Exchange.

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Tim Belcher threw seven scoreless inning pitching on a
rehab assignment for Double-A Erie Friday night. He made 99
pitches, gave up four hits, struck out six and walked none. He
reached 89-mph on the radar gun and seems ready to take the next
step and join the big league club.
</P>
<P>
   But how the 38-year-old Belcher will fit in with a staff that is
full of young pitchers remains to be seen. Belcher started Game 1
of the 1988 World Series for the Dodgers when three of the Angels'
current starters were still in junior high. However, manager Mike
Scioscia won't commit to sticking Belcher into the starting
rotation just yet, leaving open the option to use him out of the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, it comes down to getting it done,'' Scioscia said.
''You can talk all you want about intangibles. If it were only
about intangibles, I'd be catching and (pitching coach) Buddy Black
would be pitching. The bottom line is production. Certainly his
experience will be an asset, but it comes down to executing
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher executed his pitches Friday night, and might be a
consideration to start next Thursday in Detroit, moving Kent
Mercker to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher hasn't pitched in a major league game since July 2
because of a strained muscle in his right elbow. He had surgery on
the same elbow last off-season. In four starts this season, he is
2-2 with a 9.69 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrod Washburn is another option for Scioscia in the starting
rotation, but he is not as close to returning as Belcher.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn has a stress fracture in his left shoulder, but is
currently throwing without pain. He is scheduled to throw off the
mound again today.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's still hitting some bumps in the road,'' Scioscia said of
Washburn, who is 7-2 with a 3.74 ERA. ''But he's made consistent
progress, so he's still in the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad started his seventh game in a row at designated
hitter Friday, still bothered by a strained muscle in his ribcage
that caused him to miss four games Aug. 20-23 in New York and
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad can hit but can't throw without pain. And he says the
club isn't being overly cautious with him because it's so late in
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Put it this way,'' Erstad said. ''If I could throw I'd be out
there.''

after recovering from a brain hemorrhage. He began the season in
the bullpen but was later moved to the rotation because of injuries
to others.

MEMBERS OF VISITING PAKISTANI BAND GO AWOL IN NEW YORK By SHAILA K. c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Pakistani military contingent landed on U.S. shores
last week and marched up Madison Avenue. Then part of it
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was front-page news in the city's Pakistani press _
seven or eight members of an army pipe and drum band who came to
New York for last Sunday's Pakistani Independence Day Parade had
fled. What they left behind were a few phone numbers found on a
host's caller ID box and a string of embarrassed officials
stretching from Pakistan to New York to Washington and back. And
with Pakistan's ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, about to visit for
the United Nations' Millennium Summit next week, the AWOL bagpipers
have engendered a string of denials and recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the band on the run, a spokeswoman for Pakistan's
mission to the United Nations recommended calling the Pakistan
Consulate. The consulate said to call the embassy in Washington.
The embassy, whose spokesmen said they were too busy to give their
names, suggested calling the consulate. All said they knew nothing
about the army band's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Two Pakistani officials visiting New York for the United Nations
event said they were not sure what had happened. Maj. Gen. Rashid
Qureshi, the director general of the army's information services,
and Javed Jabbar, the federal minister for information and media
development, said that they would gather details and call back on
Friday, but they did not.
</P>
<P>
   It was not even clear whether all of the band members were
members of the military. Qureshi said some of them were civilians.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after the parade, some (either six or seven) of the
band members failed to appear at a dinner in their honor at the
Kashmir Restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, said Shaheen Khalid, the
restaurant's owner. Khokar told him that they ``fell sick, or
somehow there was some problem and they could not make it,'' Khalid
said.
</P>
<P>
   Azid M. Mian, the U.N. bureau chief for the Jang Group,
Pakistan's leading newspaper chain, said he, too, was at the
dinner, and that Khokar had invited him to go to New Jersey to
search a house there for the band members, but he refused.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the band _ or what was left of it _ dined at the
Bukhara restaurant on Coney Island Avenue in the Kensington section
of Brooklyn before its flight home from Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
   There, another band member fled the restaurant after going to
the bathroom, said a manager who refused to give his name. The
manager said the man was pursued, but not caught. It is unclear
whether that man was the seventh or eighth deserter.
</P>
<P>
   Even the issue of where the band was staying is in dispute.
Lodhi and Khokar said the 24 members, plus the 11 Khattak dancers
who came with them, stayed at the homes of five parade trustees.
</P>
<P>
   But two of those trustees, Muzzafar Chaudry and Inayat Shaikh,
denied that. Chaudry said that all the band members had stayed at
the Brooklyn home of Latif Munawar Chaudry, another trustee.
Chaudry could not be reached for comment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mian, the first journalist to report the story, has since become
something of a character in it, clearly relishing his investigative
role. He went to the airport to see which band members boarded the
departing plane, he said, and even warned an airline official to
process the passengers as individuals rather than as a group. He
said Khokar had asked him not to write about the defections.
</P>
<P>
   Khokar, in turn, told a reporter that Mian was using his ``whole

arrested in Pakistan and had been involved in a scheme to embezzle
port fees from the Pakistani government.
</P>
<P>
   Mian denied those accusations.

   The Pakistani Independence Day Parade has not been without
controversy. Past organizers have been accused of using the parade
as a ver to bring illegal Pakistani immigrants into the United
States.

PETA OFFERS APOLOGY TO MAYOR FOR MILK ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Pa., Va.)   By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After riding a wave of publicity, an animal rights
group apologized Friday to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for using his
face on billboard advertising that linked milk consumption to
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
sponsored four billboards that appeared in milk-producing sections
of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania last week. The ads, which were widely
criticized, clearly angered the mayor, who said they were
exploiting his illness.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter of apology to the mayor, PETA said the ads ``were
not intended as an attack on you, and we're sorry they were taken
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The billboards, already taken down by the advertising companies
that put them up, were ``intended to be provocative, not hurtful, a
fine line that we regret we crossed,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The apology elicited little response from City Hall on Friday. A
spokeswoman for the mayor, Sunny Mindel, said Giuliani had not read
the letter and would withhold comment. Senior advisers to Giuliani,
insisting that their names not be used, complained privately that
PETA's intent was to attract more publicity.
</P>
<P>
   PETA, based in Norfolk, Va., has long been known for abrasive
tactics in promoting animal rights. Its president, Ingrid E.
Newkirk, said in an interview Friday that the group had ``incurred
a lot of wrath'' because of the ads using Giuliani's face with a
milk mustache, but said that it had scored a publicity coup that
exceeded its own expectations.
</P>
<P>
   She said 58,000 people had sought out PETA's Web site on the
issue, www.dumpdairy.com, during the week since the dispute with
the mayor made its way into newspapers and television reports. She
added that of those who called or e-mailed their opinions, most had
been sympathetic to the mayor, saying that the ad campaign unfairly
exploited his illness.
</P>
<P>
   The squabble with PETA began on Aug. 24, when the mayor
threatened to sue the group over its billboards, which were
dominated by an oversized image of his face in a parody of the
ubiquitous ``Got Milk?'' ads that are sponsored by the dairy
industry. One line of text on PETA's ads read ``Got prostate
cancer?'' Another read ``Drinking milk contributes to prostate
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides threatening legal action, the mayor responded with
ridicule. He seemed to delight in the exchange, at one point
spending two hours on stage at a town hall meeting last week in
midtown Manhattan with a half-gallon of milk by his side, and
repeatedly drinking from a glass on his lectern.
</P>
<P>
   Despite PETA's apology to the mayor, Newkirk seemed on Friday to
revel in the publicity, which she said had come at little cost.
Because the advertising companies in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania had
taken down the PETA billboards over the group's objections, she
said the companies had now agreed to either refund PETA's money or
erect new billboards that attack the dairy industry without using
the mayor's face.
</P>
<P>
   PETA said it was already preparing a new campaign featuring Bill
Maher, host of ``Politically Incorrect'' and a supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor drew more attention to this than we could have of
our own devices,'' Newkirk said. ``People usually don't expect us
to act like grown-ups, but they do expect it of him.''

CLOCK RADIO DISPUTE ERUPTS IN GUNFIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATSWORTH, Calif. _ The wake-up call came around 6 a.m. Friday
- first the clock radio and then the fusillade of bullets that
smashed through the apartment wall.
</P>
<P>
   John Dickson tumbled out of bed unhurt from the attack that
police said was carried out by his next-door neighbor as part of a
long-running dispute over noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first shot, I figured my television was blowing up,
because I heard glass,'' said Dickson, 47. ``The second shot, I
heard plaster - at least seven, eight to 12 shots. It was
terrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   After firing the shots, the gunman barricaded himself inside his
apartment at the Chatsworth Garden complex in the 21000 block of
Lassen Street for five hours until surrendering peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   John Leggette, 45, was arrested on suspicion of discharging a
firearm in a negligent manner, said Los Angeles Police Department
Sgt. Harold Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Leggette surrendered the arms at 11 a.m., after 10 tear gas
rounds were fired through his second-story window.
</P>
<P>
   He had difficulty leaving, however, because he had glued his
doors shut to prevent officers from entering, said Capt. Joseph
Curreri of the LAPD's Devonshire Division.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was found in possession of several high-powered
rifles, Curreri said. ``Luckily, there were no injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Leggette was a geochemist who had worked several years as a
nighttime forklift operator, police and neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Thompson, the apartment manager, said Leggette was
disturbed by Dickson's two children who visited on weekends, though
no children were at the house Friday. He didn't like noise from
morning cartoons, or the stereo.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson said Leggette had banged on his walls for years. ``He's
been harassing me, walking by the window,'' he said. ``He's
unstoppable.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say both neighbors provoked each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kinda had a feud going for quite some time,'' said Bob
Owen, 47, the apartment manager's son.
</P>
<P>
   Three dozen residents, some wearing bathrobes, were evacuated
from the 60-unit complex as two LAPD divisions and a SWAT team
cordoned off the area. Businesses across the street also were asked
to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I feel inconvenienced?'' asked Chris Agnone, a Chatsworth
Gardens resident in sweats, sans shoes. ``Not at all - I could be
sleeping, I've no watch, no cell phone, no nothin.'''
</P>
<P>
   Several neighbors described Leggette as a lean man who didn't
drive, rode a mountain bicycle and carried a backpack everywhere he
went. Several said Leggette liked to talk about or show off his
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Some said Leggette had a good heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were friends,'' Owen said. ``He was a Christian, he
belonged to some church and used to go to downtown L.A. and cook
(for) and feed the homeless.''
</P>
<P>
   His father had died recently and left him his guns, Owen said.

 MAN IS FIRST IN NEW JERSEY INFECTED BY WEST NILE 
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New Jersey reported its first human case of infection
with the West Nile virus on Friday, while New York reported its
seventh, a 61-year-old Staten Island man.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials in New Jersey said a 43-year-old Jersey City
man was hospitalized last month with a headache and a 100-degree
fever. On Friday, the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention confirmed a finding by the New Jersey Department of
Health and Senior Services that the virus had been detected in the
man's blood and spinal fluid. Health officials did not identify the
man but said he had been discharged from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent victim in New York has also returned home, said
Dr. Neal Cohen, the city health commissioner, at a news conference
Friday. The man, who was not identified, lives in Staten Island,
officials said. He was found to be infected after he was admitted
to a hospital complaining of muscle fatigue and was given a
diagnosis of encephalitis, a potentially fatal inflammation of the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six other people infected in New York, only one, an
87-year-old Brooklyn woman who suffered seizures and lapsed into a
coma shortly after becoming infected, remains in a hospital, city
health officials said. The woman, still in critical condition, is
also the only victim who does not live on Staten Island, which has
become the epicenter of this year's West Nile outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said New York City would continue efforts to combat the
virus by spraying pesticides in areas where large numbers of
infected mosquitoes have been trapped.
</P>
<P>
   On Staten Island, the city has found 67 such areas, compared
with seven in Manhattan, three in Queens and two in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Though the number of cases confirmed this year continues to lag
behind the 10 cases reported by this time last year, health
officials urged caution and said they were not ready to declare
their strategy a success, especially with hundreds of thousands of
people expected to be outdoors over the Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the past few weeks have been the peak time of the
mosquito season,'' Cohen said, ``it would not be unexpected if we
were to learn of additional cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Smith, a spokeswoman for the New York State Health
Department, added: ``It was just about this time last year that we
started discovering cases. It's certainly too soon to now say we
have this thing beaten. We've got to be vigilant for a number of
more weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, New Jersey health officials continue to turn up
infected birds, including 469 dead crows and one cockatiel so far.
The state is awaiting tests on blood and spinal fluid from 19
people who have recently become ill and live near areas where the
birds were found.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of Friday's news, New Jersey health officials urged
people not to panic. Instead, said Dennis McGowan, a spokesman for
the state health department, ``take the precautions.''

MAN RUN OVER, KILLED; DRIVER THEN BUYS BAGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JORDAN SMITH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAN NUYS, Calif. _ A 65-year-old man was killed Friday in this
North Los Angeles community when a motorist hit him, backed over
him and then made a racial slur moments later while ordering
bagels, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Marie E. West of Hermosa Beach, hit Jesus Plascencia
as he walked out of the Western Bagel shop on Sepulveda Boulevard
just after 4 a.m., said Los Angeles Police Department Detective Al
Aldaz. Plascencia picked up bagels every morning for the nearby
delicatessen where he worked.
</P>
<P>
   West then put her car in reverse and hit Plascencia again -
dragging his body 30 feet north up Sepulveda - before returning to
the store to order bagels, Aldaz said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said while she was inside the store, West made
disparaging remarks about Latinos. A Western Bagel employee said
the woman commented, ``God, I hate Latinos.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are handling this as hate-related,'' Aldaz said.
``Witnesses disclosed that the suspect intentionally hit him
repeatedly.''
</P>
<P>
   West was arrested on suspicion of murder, police said. The
attack was witnessed by 15 people, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   West's husband, Al Bowman, said in an interview his wife is not
a racist. He said she has a history of mental illness, and that the
incident was the result of her ceasing to take medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not a racist or anything - I'm half Mexican, and I can
tell you, she doesn't hate Mexicans,'' he said. ``If she'd hit a
Jew, she would've said she hates Jews, if she'd hit a black she
would've said she hates blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of her illness; if it were easy to figure out it
wouldn't be called mental illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman said West has been hospitalized for bipolar disorder 18
times in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosa Beach police Watch Cmdr. John Koebsell said Bowman
called Thursday night to report that West was threatening to kill
him at their 7th Street home.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we arrived, she was already gone,'' he said. LAPD
spokesmen and detectives declined to comment about West's mental
state.
</P>
<P>
   Four bags of bagels littered the scene of the incident Friday
morning, just north of Stagg Street on Sepulveda Boulevard in Van
Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of the Western Bagel said Plascencia was a kind man
who came to the store every morning to buy bagels on his way to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a gentle man who didn't have a mean bone in his body,''
said one employee who asked not to be named. ``He was well-liked by
everybody, and I mean everybody. He was just at the wrong place at
the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   Plascencia had worked as a busboy for the past 14 years at
Weiler's Deli in North Hills. Manager Julie Shipley said he was
known for his smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a thin and frail man, but he was one of the best
busboys we ever had. All he ever did was smile,'' she said. ``He
picked up the bagels for us every day on the way to work - he
offered to do it. This was something he did every day, every year
for the past 14 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipley said the deli will be keeping a photo of Plascencia on
the counter as a memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Jacquelyn Lacey of
the department's hate crimes division said she expects to file
charges against West on Tuesday.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Black is back. Not the color, necessarily, but the
name. On Thursday, at the U.S. Open in Flushing Meadows, Lincoln
introduced its 2002 Blackwood luxury truck. And Buick has put the
final touches on a show car, the Blackhawk, that will make the
rounds of custom-car and hot-rod shows.
</P>
<P>
   The full-size, four-door Lincoln pickup, which closely resembles
a design study that was a sensation at auto shows last year, is
essentially a Navigator SUV with a pickup bed instead of a
wagon-type cargo area. Side-hinged Dutch doors give access to the
bed; electric motors open and close the hard tonneau cover. The bed
is lined with stainless steel, punctuated by LED strips that
provide illumination.
</P>
<P>
   Although the original Blackwood concept truck had rare wenge
wood outside its cargo box, the production version will have
composite panels that reproduce the look of the dark African wood
through a photo-lamination process. The Blackwood's cabin has
dark-stained wood trim, adjustable pedals, front and rear consoles
and four leather bucket seats that are internally heated and
cooled.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackwood will share the Navigator's 5.4-liter,
300-horsepower V-8 engine.
</P>
<P>
   The truck goes on sale in the first half of 2001. The price,
which has not been announced, is likely to be over $50,000. Fewer
than 10,000 are to be built annually.
</P>
<P>
   The Buick Blackhawk will have a far more limited run _ of just a
single car. A four-seat convertible with a retractable top, it is
an amalgam of some of Buick's most famous designs: a grille and
lighted trunk logo from 1939, a ``torpedo'' body of the '40s, a
455-cubic-inch GS Stage III V-8 engine from 1970 and interior
touches from the '96 Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked on a lot of great concepts for Buick, but this is
No. 1 for me,'' said Mike Doble, the division's special vehicles
manager, who will soon retire after 35 years at General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Although Doble came up with the idea of creating a custom car
based on highlights of past Buicks, the actual design was done by
Steven D. Pasteiner, a former Buick designer who now has his own
company, Advanced Automobile Technologies, in Rochester Hills,
Mich.

GRACE HALSELL, 77, JOURNALIST WHO SOUGHT TRUTH IN DISGUISE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grace Halsell, a journalist whose curiosity about ``a wider
world'' led her to experience life on society's fringes by
disguising herself as women of different races, died on Aug. 16 in
Washington, where she lived. She was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by John Howard Griffin's 1961 book ``Black Like Me,''
in which the author darkened his skin to pass as black, Halsell
took pills that were used to alleviate pigmentation problems,
supplemented by extensive tanning sessions, to cross the color
barrier. Further transformed by a wig and dark contact lenses, she
moved in 1968 first to Harlem and then to the Deep South, where at
the height of the civil rights movement she took a job as a
cleaning woman.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote about this in her 1969 book, ``Soul Sister,'' in which
she described the anonymity and degradation of being a black
domestic in a world of white employers, one of whom tried to rape
her. The book sold more than one million paperback copies and was
translated into six languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soul Sister'' was followed in 1973 by ``Bessie Yellowhair,''
based on her life on a Navajo reservation and as a American Indian
nanny for a Los Angeles family, and in 1978 by ``The Illegals,'' in
which she wrote of crossing the border with a group of Mexican
immigrants. In the 1980s she lived undercover with a group of
Christian fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a West Texas cattleman, she was reared on her
father's tales of frontier life on the Great Plains. ``I never felt
anything I did was anything at all compared to his stories,'' she
wrote in her 1996 autobiography, ``In Their Shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   After high school she accepted a job at The Avalanche-Journal,
the only newspaper in Lubbock, Texas, where she attended a local
college while working full time. She eventually studied
anthropology at Columbia University and in 1945 became the first
woman to cover the police beat at The Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
While working as a reporter in the Washington bureau of The Houston
Post in the mid-1960s she was recruited by President Lyndon B.
Johnson for a secretarial position on his White House staff. When
she told him she did not take dictation, she was assigned to write
official statements and became the highest ranking woman on his
staff during her three-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a brother and a sister, both of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr., Halsell left the White House for the journey she
described as ``embracing the Other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to strip myself to see who I was, to see if there was
anything there,'' she said.

JAMES CAVANAGH, FORMER NEW YORK DEPUTY MAYOR, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Cavanagh, a former first deputy mayor who advised Mayor
Abraham Beame during the depth of New York City's fiscal crisis in
the 1970s, died Thursday at a hospice near his home in Boynton
Beach, Fla. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Brooklyn, New York, whose career in city government
spanned four decades, Cavanagh spent many of his early years with
the city as an examiner in the Department of Finance. A longtime
friend and adviser to Beame, he was a senior adviser to the city
comptroller when Beame held that position in the early 1970s. He
was brought to City Hall when Beame took office as mayor in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Cavanagh, a genial, slightly rumpled man, was widely respected
for his financial acumen, but he nonetheless bore the brunt of
fierce criticism directed at Beame's fiscal management; Wall Street
bond analysts condemned the city's borrowing as excessive and all
but cut off New York's ability to pay its bills through the use of
public financing and municipal bonds. Despite Cavanagh's loyalty to
Beame, the ensuing fiscal crisis led him to resign his City Hall
post under pressure in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a quiet man who wouldn't speak unless asked, and when
asked, he always knew the answer,'' said Julius Edelstein, the
senior vice chancellor emeritus at the City University of New York,
a longtime friend of Cavanagh. ``He was not only a fiscal expert,
but an expert on government operations, and they offered him up as
a scapegoat to the bankers,'' Edelstein said in an interview
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his short tenure at City Hall, Cavanagh was able to
complete a major assignment from Beame: organizing the city's Off
Track Betting Corp., a venture intended at the time to raise
revenue and prop up city finances.
</P>
<P>
   Cavanagh is also recalled fondly by friends and family members
for a less widely known accomplishment: he completed years of night
classes to obtain his bachelor of arts degree from Empire State
College while serving as first deputy mayor.
</P>
<P>
   After his resignation, Cavanagh dedicated himself to volunteer
work before retiring and moving to Boynton Beach, Fla., in 1982. He
was a trustee of the City University of New York, president of the
Brooklyn Council of the Boy Scouts of America and an adviser to the
Fund for the City of New York, a private foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 22 years, the former Mary Delano
of Boynton Beach; two sons, James of Sarasota, Fla., and
Christopher of Hazlet, N.J.; four stepchildren; and nine
grandchildren.

HILLARY CLINTON INTERVENES ON SPY'S BEHALF 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Changes ``convicted of spying'' to ``who pleaded guilty to
spying'' in 1st graf.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton quietly intervened last week
to save Jonathan Pollard, the American who pleaded guilty to spying
for Israel, from a transfer to a more dangerous unit of the federal
prison where he is serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton's action falls short of calling upon President
Clinton to grant Pollard clemency, her Senate campaign is hoping
that the intervention will make clear her sympathies and strengthen
the first lady's sluggish support among Jews.
</P>
<P>
   A number of New York Jewish leaders, who consider Pollard's
sentence too harsh, are increasing pressure on Hillary Rodham
Clinton to call for his release. Such a move would be a dramatic
break from her husband and from the positions of his
administration's foreign policy and defense establishments.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton campaign officials said Friday that Clinton's action,
which was first reported in Friday's New York Post, was not
necessarily a precursor to calling for clemency. ``She did it
because the issue was brought to her attention, and she was
concerned on humanitarian grounds,'' said Howard Wolfson, a Clinton
campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson added that Hillary Rodham Clinton was ``continuing to
study'' the issue. In June, Clinton said that she would ``work on''
forming an opinion before the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, Clinton's opponent, has said that he had not
had the kind of ``secured briefing'' he needed to make a judgment
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard is imprisoned in a special unit of the Federal
Correctional Institution in Butner, N.C. The unit, used primarily
to house nonviolent sex offenders, is considered safer than another
unit to which Pollard was to have been transferred last week.
Pollard's supporters said Friday they worried that he might have
been exposed to rapes, stabbings and other violence there.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton intervened after meeting in Manhattan on Wednesday with
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Assemblyman Dov Hikind of
Brooklyn, an Orthodox Jew whose endorsement she seeks. Although
both men asked her during the hour-and-a-half meeting to call for
clemency for Pollard, it was not until the next day that they
received word of Pollard's impending transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Hikind immediately called Clinton, who quickly contacted ``White
House officials,'' according to her campaign. Those officials,
Wolfson said, got in touch with ``the appropriate authorities.'' He
would not specify more. But by the following day, Friday, Hikind
was informed by Clinton's campaign that the problem had been taken
care of and that Pollard would stay where he was. It was not clear
Friday why prison officials wanted to move Pollard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled that she acted in this particular instance,''
said Hikind, a Democrat who often supports Republicans. ``A lot of
people are gratified by what she did. People see this as positive
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Hikind added that although he is considering endorsing Clinton,
he has not made his support contingent upon her support for
Pollard's release. No such deal was offered at the meeting, he
said, adding that even if the first lady did call for Pollard's
release, that would not be enough for him. ``There are other issues
she needs to address,'' Hikind said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Democrats who support Clinton are divided over how
much Hikind's endorsement matters, and how many votes it would
attract even within his own constituency. The campaign's attitude,
for now, is that his support could not hurt.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pollard pleaded guilty to espionage in 1986 for selling some of
the United States' most sensitive intelligence information to
Israel. His supporters say that Pollard, who was a civilian
intelligence analyst for the Navy, simply passed along information
to an ally that was already receiving U.S. intelligence through
official channels. Military officials say he passed along highly
sensitive material about Soviet weapon designs, among other things,
that jeopardized agents working inside Russia.
</P>
<P>
   His case has been the subject of intense political debate for
years, and it almost derailed the Wye peace agreement in 1998.
Since then, the Clinton administration has been reviewing Israel's
request that Pollard be released. Support for Pollard, who has been
championed by Jews on the right, has been growing among mainstream
and more liberal groups.

GREENE MAKES A GOLDEN STATEMENT FOR THE SYDNEY GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 By ALAN MAIMON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Maurice Greene ran to victory in the men's 100 meters
on Friday and concluded the Golden League series with the fastest
time of the year and a suitcase full of gold. Greene's victory in
9.86 seconds at the ISTAF 2000 meet entitled him to a share of the
$1 million jackpot _ which is given out in gold bars _ awarded to
athletes who have won their events in at least five of the seven
Golden League meets this summer.
</P>
<P>
   On a brisk evening at the Olympic Stadium, Greene trailed Jon
Drummond at the start of the race but surged ahead to beat him by
one-tenth of a second. After a disappointing third-place finish in
rainy Gateshead, England, on Monday, Greene believed he had
something to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show the world I will be unbeatable in Sydney,''
Greene said before the meet. ``If all the others go to the Olympics
feeling they have no chance, it will be easier for me.''
</P>
<P>
   After the race he said, ``I'm exactly where I want to be heading
into the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   The ISTAF was the last major meet before the Summer Games in
Sydney, Australia, which begin Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Jones may have left Berlin without a share of the
jackpot, but she secured a decisive victory in the women's 100
meters. Jones won with a time of 10.78 seconds, matching the year's
best time, which she set in London in August. She has not been
defeated in a 100-meter race since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' Jones said after the race. ``The cool weather
we had tonight isn't really my favorite, but I ran really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Greene both ended their evenings with victorious
anchor legs in the 100-meter exhibition relays. Jones made up a big
deficit, while Greene held on to a comfortable lead given to him by
Drummond, Bernhard Williams and Curtis Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   As the late evening wind kicked up, Michael Johnson took to the
track and won the men's 400 meters. His time of 45.00 seconds was a
far cry from his goal of breaking the 43-second mark before he
retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a great performance, but I'm satisfied,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones opted not to participate in the long jump, an event she
has struggled in this summer. Without Jones, it became a showdown
between Heike Drechsler of Germany and Tatiana Kotova of Russia. In
her final jump of the evening, Kotova edged Drechsler by a quarter
of an inch, leaping 22 feet 10 inches to secure her share of the
jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. shot-putter Adam Nelson fouled on five of his six
attempts, but his one legal throw of 68-6{ was good enough for
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, a Dartmouth graduate taking time off from his job as a
business development manager in Silicone Valley, will face stiff
Olympic competition from his fellow American C.J. Hunter, a
last-minute no-show on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A boisterous crowd of 41,300 watched the meet at the stadium
where Jesse Owens captured four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics. A
sizable portion of the stadium was closed off because of
renovations for the soccer World Cup in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Trine Hattestad, a Norwegian javelin thrower, and Hicham
el-Guerrouj, the Moroccan 1,500-meter runner, continued their
winning ways. Both won for the fifth time in the Golden League.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Devers, who withdrew from Friday's event because of a
strained hamstring, was the fifth athlete to share the prize. She
won the 100 hurdles at five consecutive Golden League meets before
her injury. &QL;

 THEODORE TRAUTWEIN, JUDGE IN LANDMARK PRESS CASE, DIES AT 80
</HEADLINE>
 By   DAVID CORCORAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theodore W. Trautwein, the New Jersey judge who sent a reporter
to jail in 1978 in a celebrated case that tested the boundaries of
press freedom and fair trials, died on Aug. 17 in Hollywood, Fla.,
where he had lived for the last two years. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said his son, Ted.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1978, M.A. Farber, a reporter for The New York Times,
was called to Superior Court in Hackensack, N.J., to testify in the
trial of a 51-year-old surgeon accused of murdering three patients
at a small hospital in nearby Oradell by injecting them with lethal
doses of the muscle relaxant curare. Front-page articles by Farber
in 1976 had led the Bergen County prosecutor's office to reopen the
case, which it had abandoned 10 years earlier, and exhume the
patients' bodies to test for the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Though he answered questions from lawyers defending the surgeon,
Dr. Mario E. Jascalevich, Farber refused to turn over thousands of
pages of notes demanded by the defense, saying the First Amendment
compelled him to protect those who had talked to him in confidence.
The trial judge, William J. Arnold, turned the matter over to
Trautwein, who as assignment judge supervised all the Bergen County
civil, criminal and municipal courts.
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, 1978, before a courtroom packed with journalists and
spectators (including Jascalevich), Trautwein found Farber and The
Times guilty of criminal contempt and sentenced the reporter to
jail for six months and the paper to fines of $5,000 a day until
the notes were turned over.
</P>
<P>
   A beefy, imposing judge who was all business on the bench and
who favored plain English over legalese, he later told Farber,
``You chose to put your privilege and your concept of your
constitutional rights above the rights of the people of this state
and this defendant.''
</P>
<P>
   With time off for appeals, Farber wound up spending 40 days in
the Bergen County Jail, one of the longest sentences ever served by
an American reporter for refusing to testify about sources.
Trautwein freed him on Oct. 24, shortly before the jury acquitted
Jascalevich after just three hours of deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   In upholding Trautwein's action in August 1978, the New Jersey
Supreme Court also overturned the state law shielding reporters
from having to testify about their sources in criminal cases. The
New Jersey Legislature rewrote the law to satisfy the court's
objections, and the state continues to have one of the nation's
strongest shield laws. In 1982 Farber and The Times were
retroactively pardoned by Gov. Brendan Byrne, and the state repaid
the paper $101,000 of the $285,000 it had paid in fines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 Trautwein made a pivotal ruling in another closely
watched murder case, when the State Parole Board asked him to set
restitution payments so it could release Thomas Trantino, who was
serving a life sentence for shooting two police officers to death
in a Lodi nightclub in 1963. The judge refused.
</P>
<P>
   Without the required restitution, the Parole Board never freed
Trantino. His subsequent pleas for parole have all been denied, and
still in prison at age 62, he is New Jersey's longest-serving
inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Walter Trautwein was born on March 29, 1920, in
Paramus, N.J. He graduated from Hackensack High School, where he
was an all-star athlete, won a scholarship at Columbia University
and was drafted as a pitcher by the St. Louis Cardinals. But as he
later told an interviewer, he needed to earn money to help his
struggling family, so he went to work as a stevedore. He attended
the Merchant Marine Academy and served in the Navy in World War II.
After the war he went to New York University and its law school. He
became a lawyer in 1953 and a county judge in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   As a District Court judge in the 1960s and 70s, Trautwein upheld
laws that established state control over the Hackensack Meadowlands
and financed the sports complex that brought major league football,
basketball and hockey to New Jersey. He was promoted to the State
Appellate Division in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, Ted, of Cos Cob, Conn., he is survived
by his wife of 45 years, Lorna; a daughter, Lorie Hayman of
Hallandale, Fla.; and four grandchildren.
