<HEADLINE> Suspension of Anthrax Program Urged  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE STRONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The military's program to inoculate all 2.4 million
troops against anthrax as protection against biological warfare is based on
``dangerously narrow scientific'' evidence and should be suspended, a House
panel says.
</P>
<P>
	   The anthrax vaccine should be considered experimental because its
effectiveness against biological warfare is uncertain and the safety of troops
taking the anthrax shots is not being monitored adequately, according to the
sharply critical report being released Thursday by the Government Reform
Committee's national security subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   A draft of the report obtained by The Associated Press says the immunization
program ``is an unmanageably broad military undertaking built on a dangerously
narrow scientific and medical foundation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Defense spokesman Jim Turner said Wednesday that the department is reviewing
the congressional study. Defense officials have said repeatedly the vaccine is
safe and effective.
</P>
<P>
	   The 80-page report was written by the subcommittee's Republican majority
after six hearings on the vaccination program.
</P>
<P>
	   The vaccine has come under increasing scrutiny from congressional lawmakers
as soldiers, including pilots in the National Guard and reserves, have expressed
concerns about taking the six-shot regimen.
</P>
<P>
	   Complaints included fevers, muscle pain and dizziness. Some reserve pilots
testified they would resign to protect their health and flying careers while
other soldiers in the active military have faced courts martial.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered all active duty and reserve
troops to get shots of the anthrax vaccine, starting with soldiers most likely
to encounter biological warfare overseas. Some 340,000 service members have been
immunized so far.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 to 300 have refused to take it because of concerns about its
safety and efficacy, Pentagon officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feel the program is a vital force protection program against a known
threat,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthrax has never been used in combat, but the Pentagon fears Iraq, North
Korea and other countries -- or terrorist groups -- might try. Anthrax is a
naturally occurring bacteria found in domesticated animals; it can be produced
as dry spores that, when inhaled, cause death within a few days.
</P>
<P>
	   The vaccine had been studied mostly for its effectiveness in protecting
veterinarians and mill and livestock handlers decades ago against infection from
touching animals or animal parts of goats, sheep or cattle.
</P>
<P>
	   There is little research concerning the inhalation of anthrax spores by
humans and no long-term research on the vaccine, the report says; therefore, the
vaccine should be regarded as an investigational drug, requiring the approval of
troops to be administered.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also says the program should be suspended because some troops
have told lawmakers they do not trust medical information provided by the
Defense Department and that is hurting troop retention and morale.
</P>
<P>
	   The department has engaged in ``absolutist declarations'' and ``heavy-handed
propaganda,'' labeling critics as paranoid rather than answering their
questions, the report said. Instead of encouraging reporting of adverse
reactions, the lawmakers said, the military may have under-reported problems
with shots due to an ``institutional culture that is hostile, even resistant, to
reports.''

<HEADLINE> Thruway official: losing canals would be way around toll hike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - While not exactly endorsing a proposal to give
another agency the responsibility for the state canal system, the executive
director of the Thruway Authority says the idea sounds intriguing.
<P>
	   John Platt noted Wednesday that giving away the canal system would save
roughly the same amount of money the Thruway Authority had planned to raise
through an unpopular toll increase plan.
</P>
<P>
	   And, Platt conceded that the authority lacks the money to maintain and
promote the canals in a style the historic waterways deserve.
</P>
<P>
	   "We really don't have the assets and resources to make that (the canal
system) the economic development engine that we could," Platt told a state
Assembly hearing on the proposed Thruway toll increases. "That is one of our
dilemmas."
</P>
<P>
	   The Thruway Authority has had responsibility for the 524 miles of state
canals, including the remaining portions of the venerable Erie Canal, since
1992. Platt said it costs the authority $55 million to $60 million a year to
maintain and operate the waterways, but he acknowledged that's not nearly enough
funding to do the kind of improvements and beautification to make the canal a
premiere recreational boat route and tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thruway Authority is also hampered in maintaining the canal system by
long-ago-reached cap on how much it can borrow for canal projects, Platt said.
All maintenance on the system must be done on a pay-as-you-go basis.
</P>
<P>
	   "The need for rehabilitation continues year in and year out," he said. "This
is a system that is in some cases more than 100 years old. It's held up very
well considering its age."
</P>
<P>
	   State Assembly Republicans on Tuesday proposed turning the canal system over
to the state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. That, in
effect, means all New York taxpayers would pay for the canals instead of
motorists on the New York State Thruway.
</P>
<P>
	   Platt, echoing Tuesday's comments by Thruway Authority Chairman Lou Tomson,
said the canal divestment proposal merits "careful consideration."
</P>
<P>
	   The Thruway Authority's board on Jan. 27 approved a previously unannounced
plan for what it called annual toll "adjustments" - toll hikes - based on
increases in a 20-city Construction Cost Index. The first-year increase would
have been 1.8 percent under that plan, to have gone into effect on June 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Thruway officials said they need the extra money to pay for roadway
improvements over the next five years, from lane additions in some urban
stretches to things like a "flyover" at the Thruway's busiest exit, No. 24 in
Albany. The flyover would be a special link between the Thruway and Interstate
87 only for E-ZPass users.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki, legislative leaders and business groups criticized the
toll increase plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Platt said the Thruway needs $216 million more over five years to pay for
road maintenance and new projects. Coincidentally, giving away fiscal
responsibility for the canal system would save the Thruway Authority roughly the
same amount of money.
</P>
<P>
	   Or perhaps that is no coincidence, suggested state Assemblyman Paul Tonko, a
Montgomery County Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the sequence of events since Jan. 27 - a previously unknown toll
hike plan coming to light, criticism from state leaders including Pataki of a
toll hike and the emergence of the canal divestment proposal - might look to
"some cynics" like "orchestrating" to get the Legislature to go along with a
shift of responsibility for the canals.
</P>
<P>
	   Platt said the idea of giving up the canals because they are a financial
drain on the Thruway has been talked about since the Thruway Authority took them
over from the state Department of Transportation as a Cuomo-era financial
gimmick.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is something that's been discussed for a number of years," Platt said.
"I don't see how this is a late development. It's been discussed all along."
</P>
<P>
	   Platt demurred Wednesday when pressed by legislators whether the toll
increase plan is dead.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have a board that makes that decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tolls last increased on the Thruway in 1988, by 31 percent.

<HEADLINE> Three generations of black family see different Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Rev. Timothy Mitchell has led the fight for
civil rights most of his 69 years. Today, he finds the trial of four white
police officers accused of killing a black man is bringing back those most
heated conflicts, while bringing three generations of his family together.
<P>
	   For his son, the trial in the death of Amadou Diallo is a touchstone to the
early civil rights movement as well as tragic evidence of the serious threat to
younger black men like himself.
</P>
<P>
	   For the minister's grandson, the death was a tragic mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think this was about racism," 12-year-old Preston Mitchell said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The three generations are part of the vigil outside the trial of New York
City officers charged with murder for gunning down Diallo one year ago in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   Timothy Mitchell, through gospel song, powerful oratory and sheer will, has
on most freezing days of the trial led groups from a dozen Harlem school
children to more than a hundred black and white adults from New York City to
Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's justice, why I'm here" the grandfather roared to Wednesday's growing
lunchtime crowd. "These racists will kill you ... (and) who do they kill? Black
me!"
</P>
<P>
	   He's walked this road before. In the 1960s he preached and marched for civil
rights, drawing black men and women along the way in the movement's early days.
Now he's drawing on that experience, helping to organize Albany churches to feed
and house Diallo supporters bused from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have the same spirit," he said on the last day of testimony. "That's how
we can win."
</P>
<P>
	   His son, the Rev. Timothy Immanuel Mitchell, 40, bristles at even the
tearful testimony of the police officers this week.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe the tears were legitimate, but they were tears of guilt, tears
of remorse," he said. "We have sympathy for the (Diallo) family and we do have a
sense of sympathy for the police out of love of God - what we learned from Dr.
King was to love our enemies."
</P>
<P>
	   But he says the enemy is beyond the four police officers who fired 41 shots
at Diallo - hitting him 19 times - outside his home.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't just blame the officers," he said. "What needs to be looked at and
what I don't see enough attention over is racial profiling."
</P>
<P>
	   The criminal justice system, he insists, should be on trial. He said New
York City's street crime units, of which the officers were part, see a black man
reach for a wallet, as Diallo apparently did, and police think it's a gun. A
white man reaches for his wallet and police think it's a wallet, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Preston Mitchell said he also wants justice served in the 22-year-old's
death. "But it's still sort of Amadou's fault, too. He should have stopped" when
the plainclothes police approached him, he said. "But they still didn't need to
gun him down."
</P>
<P>
	   "It wasn't about racism, it was a big mistake," he said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Forbids Pregnancy for Woman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- A woman convicted of endangering her unborn child by
taking drugs was ordered Wednesday not to get pregnant for ten years.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of her sentence, Dawn Marie Spinkle of Helena was instructed by
District Judge Dorothy McCarter to take a pregnancy test every two months. If
she tests positive, the judge said Sprinkle could be jailed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't want another damaged baby born because we didn't do enough to
supervise that woman,'' the judge said. ``If she wants to drug herself to death,
fine. But we can't have her taking drugs when she's pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sprinkle, 29, was given a three-year deferred sentence by McCarter last year
after she gave birth to a boy at St. Peter's Community Hospital in 1998. A urine
test conducted on the newborn indicated amphetamines in his system.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors claim Sprinkle violated several conditions of her sentence,
including not paying fines nor completing chemical dependency treatment, and
testing positive for drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Had Sprinkle abided by the conditions imposed by the original sentence, the
conviction would have been wiped from her record.
</P>
<P>
	   The sentence imposed Wednesday puts Sprinkle under the supervision of the
Montana Department of Corrections for ten years with five years suspended. She
is expected to spend a portion of that time in boot camp.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani heads to far north to press oil price issue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, running for the Senate
against Hillary Rodham Clinton, says he will continue touring the state and
blasting her husband until he turns on the taps to the nation's oil reserves to
reduce home heating oil prices.
<P>
	   Giuliani headed to New York's frigid, far north Wednesday to continue his
attack on President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to take this message throughout the state of New York." the New
York City mayor said. "We're going to keep it up every day until he eventually
releases some of the oil reserves."
</P>
<P>
	   "What's happening right now to our home heating oil prices is outrageous,"
Giuliani told a group of Republican officials and supporters at a Plattsburgh
restaurant as snow fell outside and the temperature hovered in the 20s.
</P>
<P>
	   "He could stand up to OPEC and he's refusing to do that," Giuliani added.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning last weekend, Giuliani began lambasting the president for refusing
to dip into the nation's strategic oil reserves to ease the price crunch on
consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the mayor's campaign team unveiled a radio ad to run statewide
in which he says: "Mister President, why don't you feel our pain? Release the
oil."
</P>
<P>
	   While the first lady has also called for using some of the oil reserves to
help reduce prices, Giuliani aides believe that by attacking her husband they
can boost the mayor's standing while hurting Clinton's Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an example of an issue that really unites the entire state. It
affects people in Brooklyn and in Buffalo," Giuliani campaign manager Bruce
Teitelbaum said. "We've seen the mayor doing his job, advocating for the people
of the city - that's his responsibility now - but also advocating on behalf of
people all across the state."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani said that with oil prices rising, the OPEC countries were reaping
huge profits.
</P>
<P>
	   "Think of where that money is coming from. It's coming from you," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Tetreault, owner of Hitchcock's restaurant where Giuliani's
Plattsburgh event was held, said the rapidly rising cost of fuel oil had "hurt
our business. A lot of our patrons, who typically pay $200 a month (for fuel
oil) are now paying $280, $320 or $350. That one or two nights a week they come
out for happy hour or dinner, they're not coming out."
</P>
<P>
	   Tetreault, who opened his restaurant in June, said that while he was a
political independent who tried to stay neutral in politics, "I would vote for
Rudy over Hillary ... I'm just uncomfortable with the fact that she's coming to
an area she's never lived in before to run for Senate."
</P>
<P>
	   "This may be Clinton County, but we vote Republican and we'll do that again
in November," state Assemblyman Chris Ortloff, a local Clinton County
Republican, said as he introduced Giuliani to the more than four dozen on hand
for the mayor's appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   Following his news conference with Republican officials in Plattsburgh, just
south of the Canadian border, Giuliani flew to Syracuse for a similar event.
</P>
<P>
	   With OPEC countries limiting production, the cost of home heating oil in New
York has risen from a statewide average of 90.6 cents a gallon in February of
last year to $2.01 a gallon as of last week. It had dipped to about $1.71 a
gallon on average by early this week as East Coast supplies improved somewhat.
The Northeast has been hardest hit by the price increases.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton announced Wednesday, just before Giuliani's event, that he
was making another $120 million available to help poor people nationwide pay
their heating oil bills. Of that, $36.6 million goes to New York where his wife
is running for the Senate. In all, Clinton has released $325 million of such
funding since the heating oil crisis began, $73.6 million of which has gone to
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   While Giuliani said such action would help the poor, he said it would also
serve to further line OPEC's pockets and "will not help the middle-class."
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has thus far refused to tap into the strategic oil
reserves despite calls for it to do so from a bipartisan group of state
officials and members of Congress, including Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said Wednesday that he wouldn't rule out using the petroleum
reserves.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani heads to far north to press oil price issue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, running for the Senate
against Hillary Rodham Clinton, says he will continue touring the state and
blasting her husband until he turns on the taps to the nation's oil reserves to
reduce home heating oil prices.
<P>
	   Giuliani headed to New York's frigid, far north Wednesday to continue his
attack on President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to take this message throughout the state of New York." the New
York City mayor said. "We're going to keep it up every day until he eventually
releases some of the oil reserves."
</P>
<P>
	   "What's happening right now to our home heating oil prices is outrageous,"
Giuliani told a group of Republican officials and supporters at a Plattsburgh
restaurant as snow fell outside and the temperature hovered in the 20s.
</P>
<P>
	   "He could stand up to OPEC and he's refusing to do that," Giuliani added.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning last weekend, Giuliani began lambasting the president for refusing
to dip into the nation's strategic oil reserves to ease the price crunch on
consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the mayor's campaign team unveiled a radio ad to run statewide
in which he says: "Mister President, why don't you feel our pain? Release the
oil."
</P>
<P>
	   While the first lady has also called for using some of the oil reserves to
help reduce prices, Giuliani aides believe that by attacking her husband they
can boost the mayor's standing while hurting Clinton's Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an example of an issue that really unites the entire state. It
affects people in Brooklyn and in Buffalo," Giuliani campaign manager Bruce
Teitelbaum said. "We've seen the mayor doing his job, advocating for the people
of the city - that's his responsibility now - but also advocating on behalf of
people all across the state."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani said that with oil prices rising, the OPEC countries were reaping
huge profits.
</P>
<P>
	   "Think of where that money is coming from. It's coming from you," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Tetreault, owner of Hitchcock's restaurant where Giuliani's
Plattsburgh event was held, said the rapidly rising cost of fuel oil had "hurt
our business. A lot of our patrons, who typically pay $200 a month (for fuel
oil) are now paying $280, $320 or $350. That one or two nights a week they come
out for happy hour or dinner, they're not coming out."
</P>
<P>
	   Tetreault, who opened his restaurant in June, said that while he was a
political independent who tried to stay neutral in politics, "I would vote for
Rudy over Hillary ... I'm just uncomfortable with the fact that she's coming to
an area she's never lived in before to run for Senate."
</P>
<P>
	   "This may be Clinton County, but we vote Republican and we'll do that again
in November," state Assemblyman Chris Ortloff, a local Clinton County
Republican, said as he introduced Giuliani to the more than four dozen on hand
for the mayor's appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   Following his news conference with Republican officials in Plattsburgh, just
south of the Canadian border, Giuliani flew to Syracuse for a similar event.
</P>
<P>
	   With OPEC countries limiting production, the cost of home heating oil in New
York has risen from a statewide average of 90.6 cents a gallon in February of
last year to $2.01 a gallon as of last week. It had dipped to about $1.71 a
gallon on average by early this week as East Coast supplies improved somewhat.
The Northeast has been hardest hit by the price increases.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton announced Wednesday, just before Giuliani's event, that he
was making another $120 million available to help poor people nationwide pay
their heating oil bills. Of that, $36.6 million goes to New York where his wife
is running for the Senate. In all, Clinton has released $325 million of such
funding since the heating oil crisis began, $73.6 million of which has gone to
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   While Giuliani said such action would help the poor, he said it would also
serve to further line OPEC's pockets and "will not help the middle-class."
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has thus far refused to tap into the strategic oil
reserves despite calls for it to do so from a bipartisan group of state
officials and members of Congress, including Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said Wednesday that he wouldn't rule out using the petroleum
reserves.

<HEADLINE> Sharpe Announces Deal With Ravens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BALTIMORE (AP) -- Free-agent tight end Shannon Sharpe said on his Web site
Wednesday that he has agreed to a four-year contract with the Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Eller, the Ravens' director of operations, confirmed the team reached an
agreement with the seven-time Pro Bowl selection, but would not provide the
length of the deal or financial terms.
</P>
<P>
	   The Denver Rocky Mountain News reported it was a $14 million deal that
includes a $4.5 million signing bonus. Denver's KUSA-TV reported the contract is
worth $12.8 million, including a $4.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
	   Eller said he expects Sharpe to sign this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpe, 31, who missed most of last season with Denver because of a broken
collarbone, is the Broncos' career receiving leader with 543 catches for 6,872
yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpe said in a statement that one of the major influences in his decision
to sign with Baltimore was the chance to break the NFL mark for career
receptions by a tight end, set by former Cleveland Browns star Ozzie Newsome.
</P>
<P>
	   Newsome is bow the Ravens' pro personnel director.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpe needs 110 receptions and 997 yards to eclipse Newsome's marks of 662
receptions and 7,980 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpe visited Baltimore's training complex Tuesday and spoke at length with
Newsome and coach Brian Billick. On Monday, Sharpe had dinner with team
officials after flying from Atlanta on owner Art Modell's private plane.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Fiat Remains Independent  </HEADLINE>
    By FRANCES D'EMILIO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) -- From Daimler and Chrysler to Ford and Volvo to General
Motors and Saab, automakers around the world have teamed up in their drive to
the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the trend, Italy's Fiat continues to take the road alone. But many
are wondering how long it can stay that course.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Fiat will release 1999 financial results, which Fiat says will
show a turning-of-the corner after years of slipping in the European market and
after taking a beating in South America, where car sales plunged with the 1990s
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
	   Again and again, reports that Fiat is being courted or is playing the suitor
have surfaced and resurfaced. The latest speculation had DaimlerChrysler either
merging with or buying Fiat, whose makes include Alfa Romeo, Maserati and
Ferrari sports cars.
</P>
<P>
	   "Who knows how it will turn out?" said Lorenzo Re', an auto analyst with
Unicredito Italiano, in Milan. "The alliance of Fiat has been talked about for
more than one year," but that doesn't mean it will come off, said Re'.
</P>
<P>
	   Fiat wanted Volvo but Volvo didn't want Fiat, the analyst noted. In the end,
Ford Motor Co. ended up buying the Swedish maker's passenger car division. The
Italians had wanted to buy all of Volvo, not just the car sector.
</P>
<P>
	   Some have speculated whether the Agnelli family's hold on Fiat, Italy's
largest private employer, complicates deal-making. But recently the patriarch of
the dynasty, Giovanni Agnelli, made clear that Fiat could be interested if the
right arrangement is made.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fiat can go ahead by itself," said Agnelli, whose grandfather started the
company in 1899 and whose family still holds 30 percent of the automaker. "An
alliance is neither an obligation nor a necessity."
</P>
<P>
	   But, acknowledging the trend to concentrate business interests in all
sectors, Agnelli, now Fiat's honorary chairman, told Fiat managers at its Turin
headquarters: "We won't let the good occasions slip away."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Fiat has made some moves recently, purchasing Case Corp., a U.S.
maker of tractors and other agricultural equipment, and allying with Mitsubishi
to develop and assemble a new sport utility vehicle for production in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fiat is showing you can work out ad hoc partnerships that can greatly
reduce costs and achieve competitive products," said company spokesman Gualberto
Ranieri.
</P>
<P>
	   Mapping out a course without any big partner along for the ride, Fiat aims
to produce 4 million cars a year in the second half of this decade.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, before opening up several markets, including South Africa, Morocco,
Egypt, China and India, Fiat sold 2.8 million vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   The company is counting on growth in countries where many people have yet to
buy a car, such as India and China.
</P>
<P>
	   A DaimlerChrysler deal could give Fiat a presence in the United States,
where its poor service record a generation ago prompted unhappy owners to
nickname it "Fix It Again, Tony."
</P>
<P>
	   Closer to home, Fiat would like to make a comeback. Its market share in
Italy shrank to 39 percent in 1998 from its high of 60 percent as competition
eroded its dominance. It had 11 percent of car sales in Western Europe in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Fiat is betting heavily on the New Punto, a workhorse whose earlier version
was a big success. Stung by criticism that several other new models weren't all
that different from predecessors, Fiat is billing the New Punto, with its
push-of-a-button steering mode for city parking, as a "new species" in the
subcompact jungle.

Internet Racism Concerns U.N.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   GENEVA (AP) -- The United States could do more to curb the use of the
Internet for racist material while upholding freedom of speech, experts said
Wednesday at a U.N. meeting. Speakers noted the legal challenges of controlling
Internet content in, and originating from, the United States, where the First
Amendment of the constitution guarantees freedom of speech. Although the U.S.
government cannot ban racist speech outright, it could impose "reasonable
restrictions," such as requiring a permit that would force publishers to
identify the content of their sites, Swiss-based information technology law
expert David Rosenthal argued.

Reinforcements Arrive in Kosovo
</SUBHEAD>

	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.N. police reinforcements began
arriving in this ethnically divided town on Wednesday, following two weeks of
violence that left nine people dead and dozens injured. A total of 300 officers
are to be sent to Kosovska Mitrovica, top U.N. administrator Bernard Kouchner
said. With the upsurge in violence, more reinforcements were needed, and not
just in Kosovska Mitrovica, but throughout the province of Kosovo, U.N.
Assistant Secretary-General Hedi Annabi told the Security Council on Wednesday
at the United Nations. A rocket attack on a U.N. bus which killed two Serb
civilians on Feb. 2 sparked the latest round of violence.

Clinton Rejects Death Penalty Moratorium
</SUBHEAD>

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton rejected calls for a national
moratorium on capital punishment Wednesday but urged the nation's governors to
examine their death penalty systems to make sure that innocent people are not
executed. The idea of a death penalty moratorium has gathered momentum since Ill
Gov. George Ryan took the unprecedented step Jan. 31 of putting all executions
on hold in Illinois, saying that the state's system was "fraught with error."
Clinton said death penalty supporters -- including himself -- are obligated to
make sure there is no question of guilt for condemned prisoners.

Funerals Held for Tornado Victims

	   PELHAM, Ga. (AP) -- A small Baptist church overflowed Wednesday with
mourners for the congregation's pastor and his wife, the first victims of the
Georgia tornadoes to be laid to rest. Union Hill Primitive Baptist Church had to
set up speakers so friends and relatives outside in the sunlight could hear
tributes to Jackie and Mary Ann McClelland, both 64, who were killed Monday when
a twister thrashed their home. "It's difficult to stand here and try to express
to you that God is a God of love," the Rev. Cleston Brooks told mourners. "But
do not let this harden your heart. It's not for you and I to choose when our
time will come."

China Dissident Gets Six Years

the northeastern city of Dalian, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human

<HEADLINE> United States 1, Peru 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MIAMI (AP) -- Cobi Jones' header in the 59th minute lifted the United States
to a 1-0 victory over Peru in a Gold Cup soccer game Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   American goalie Brad Friedel made two sterling saves in the final 23 minutes
to preserve the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Americans (2-0) secured first place in the Group B bracket and will face
Columbia (1-1) in a quarterfinal match Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Honduras (2-0), a 2-0 winner over Colombia in the first game, will play Peru
(0-1-1) in the other Miami-based quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the first half, Peru's pressure was outstanding," American coach Bruce
Arena said. "In the end it may have caused them to run out of gas."
</P>
<P>
	   After a closely marked first half with few scoring opportunities,
left-footer Eddie Lewis passed to Jones, who headed a shot past the arms of
Peruvian goalie Oscar Ibanez. Jones also scored in a 3-0 U.S. victory over Haiti
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was kind of a blur for me," Jones said. "Eddie switched it to his right
foot and I went up to try to get it inside the right post."
</P>
<P>
	   In the second half, Friedel smothered a point-blank shot from substitute
Ysrael Zuniga in the 67th minute. Seven minutes later, Friedel deflected a
straight-on blast from Abel Lobaton.
</P>
<P>
	   "The defender was in front of me and he (Zuniga) hit it sharp on the
ground," said Friedel, who had five saves. "I had to move quick. I had to get a
good angle. That's my job."
</P>
<P>
	   "We realize in front of us was a strong opponent in the U.S.," Peru coach
Francisco Maturana said. "They're technically sound. We have quite a way to go
to be at that level."
</P>
<P>
	   Honduras got second-half goals seven minutes apart from Carlos Pavon and
Milton Nunez to wrap up first place in Group A. Pavon also assisted on Nunez's
header in the 78th minute.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday's winners advance to the semifinals next week in California.

<HEADLINE> Bush leads McCain in national polls; his advantage over Gore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Gov. George W. Bush retains a healthy lead over Sen.
John McCain in the Republican presidential race, but his lead over Democratic
front-runner Al Gore has virtually disappeared, say two national polls.
<P>
	   Bush, governor of Texas, leads McCain, an Arizona senator, 58 percent to 31
percent in a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll and led McCain by 20 points in a CBS-New
York Times poll. Support for Alan Keyes was in the single digits in both.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democratic race, Gore, the vice president, led Bradley, a former New
Jersey senator, by about 40 points in both polls, a strong position Gore has had
in many polls since beating Bradley in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   And Gore's involvement with President Clinton may be less of a liability
these days. When people with a favorable view of Gore were asked why, they
mentioned his role in the Clinton administration and his experience. Two-thirds
of those polled said they approved of the Clinton administration's policies.
</P>
<P>
	   But those with an unfavorable view of Gore mentioned his ties to the Clinton
administration most often.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush remains at the top of the GOP field, the polls no longer provide
solid evidence of his claim to be the strongest GOP candidate for the November
general election.
</P>
<P>
	   People were evenly divided about whether they had a favorable or unfavorable
feeling about Bush, about a third taking each view. McCain was viewed favorably
by more than 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had a slight edge over Bradley among likely voters in both polls, but
Bush had only a slight lead over Gore in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll, and the
two were tied in the CBS-New York Times poll.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain had a big lead over Bradley in both polls and a 16-point lead over
Gore in the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll.
</P>
<P>
	   After losing in New Hampshire, Bush is now in a close fight with McCain in
South Carolina and Michigan, and trailing in Arizona, according to polls in
those states with primaries in the next few days. McCain has narrowed the gap
with Bush in delegate-rich states like California and New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The CBS-New York Times poll indicated that Bush's efforts to paint McCain as
a liberal ally of the Democrats has been unsuccessful, so far. Only one of 10
consider McCain a liberal, about the same number who see Bush that way.
</P>
<P>
	   Both were considered conservative by about a third of the population, and
the remainder saw them as moderate.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the four leading presidential candidates, McCain was seen as the straight
talker in the CBS-Times poll. About half said he's someone who says what he
believes and a third felt he says what people want to hear. People were about
evenly split on Bradley and by a 2-to-1 margin, they felt Gore and Bush say what
people want to hear.
</P>
<P>
	   The polls remain fluid and a survey by the Vanishing Voter Project
illustrates why.
</P>
<P>
	   When Americans were asked which candidate they support at this time, but are
given the option of admitting they haven't picked a candidate yet, the clear
leader is "no candidate yet."
</P>
<P>
	   "What we are seeing in this early stage is a lot of 'top-of-mind response,"
said Thomas Patterson, co-director of the Vanishing Voter Project, which is run
by the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The national CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of 1,050 adults was taken Monday and
Tuesday and has an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points, and plus
or minus 5 percentage points for likely voters. The CBS-New York Times poll of
1,225 adults was taken Saturday through Monday has an error margin of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris Starts Awareness Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris USA, the nation's largest cigarette maker,
has begun a series of newspaper ads on tobacco related issues, such as underage
smoking and smoking in public places.
</P>
<P>
	   "These ads are part of our company's ongoing commitment to communicate more
openly, honestly and directly with the American people about tobacco-related
issues," Philip Morris, which makes about half of the cigarettes sold in the
United States and is facing growing legal challenges, said in launching the ads
in major newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The maker of Marlboro and other brands said tobacco marketing was
"fundamentally changed" by the industry's 1998 multibillion-dollar settlement
agreement with the states over the costs of treating sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe opening this dialogue will help bring us more in accord with
public expectations of a responsible company in a changing world," the ad said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ads which occupy about a half page will appear frequently in The New
York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post and USA Today as well
as in papers in major cities, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokeswoman Mary Carnovale declined to say how much money was being spent on
the ads, but said the company would like them to appear opposite the editorial
page.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign is separate from a $100 million annual effort the tobacco
company started last year to deter youth smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris Cos., the parent of Philip Morris USA, Kraft Foods and Miller
Brewing, started a separate $100 million campaign last October aimed at
improving its corporate image by reporting how it has helped disaster victims,
the hungry and abused women.
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco companies remain the target of lawsuits by smokers, farmers and the
federal government, despite agreements to pay the states $246 billion over 25
years to settle claims for reimbursement for treating sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
	   A jury in state court in Florida has been asked to determine what damages
should be assessed against major tobacco makers after ruling last July that the
industry fraudulently conspired to produce a dangerous and defective product.

<HEADLINE> Cargo Plane Crashes in California  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HOWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif. (AP) -- A DC-8 cargo plane crashed into an automobile
wrecking yard while trying to make an emergency landing late Wednesday and burst
into flames, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately known how many people were on board or if there were
any survivors, the FAA said. The plane, Emery Worldwide transport service Flight
17, typically carries a crew of three, said Jim Whitehead, manager of the FAA's
regional operations center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash set up to 200 cars on fire and caused explosions over a
200-yard-long area, fire Capt. Dan Haverty told KXTV.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses told the station they saw the plane take off from the former
Mather Air Force Base and then turn around.
</P>
<P>
	   KCBS radio said the pilot reported trouble, circled back to make an
emergency landing and then crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries on the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   Flames covered several hundred yards, and a piece of the aircraft was seen
burning in a nearby wrecking yard.
</P>
<P>
	   Since its closure in 1993 as a military base, Mather has become a civilian
airport and the Sacramento region's air cargo hub.
</P>
<P>
	   Emery, based in Redwood City, specializes in transportation services for
business shippers of heavyweight cargo, the company says on its Web site. The
$2.4-billion company is a subsidiary of CNF Inc., a $5.6-billion diversified
transportation company based in Palo Alto, the site states.

Internet Racism Concerns U.N.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   GENEVA (AP) -- The United States could do more to curb the use of the
Internet for racist material while upholding freedom of speech, experts said
Wednesday at a U.N. meeting. Speakers noted the legal challenges of controlling
Internet content in, and originating from, the United States, where the First
Amendment of the constitution guarantees freedom of speech. Although the U.S.
government cannot ban racist speech outright, it could impose "reasonable
restrictions," such as requiring a permit that would force publishers to
identify the content of their sites, Swiss-based information technology law
expert David Rosenthal argued.

Reinforcements Arrive in Kosovo
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.N. police reinforcements began
arriving in this ethnically divided town on Wednesday, following two weeks of
violence that left nine people dead and dozens injured. A total of 300 officers
are to be sent to Kosovska Mitrovica, top U.N. administrator Bernard Kouchner
said. With the upsurge in violence, more reinforcements were needed, and not
just in Kosovska Mitrovica, but throughout the province of Kosovo, U.N.
Assistant Secretary-General Hedi Annabi told the Security Council on Wednesday
at the United Nations. A rocket attack on a U.N. bus which killed two Serb
civilians on Feb. 2 sparked the latest round of violence.

Clinton Rejects Death Penalty Moratorium
</SUBHEAD>

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton rejected calls for a national
moratorium on capital punishment Wednesday but urged the nation's governors to
examine their death penalty systems to make sure that innocent people are not
executed. The idea of a death penalty moratorium has gathered momentum since Ill
Gov. George Ryan took the unprecedented step Jan. 31 of putting all executions
on hold in Illinois, saying that the state's system was "fraught with error."
Clinton said death penalty supporters -- including himself -- are obligated to
make sure there is no question of guilt for condemned prisoners.

	   PELHAM, Ga. (AP) -- A small Baptist church overflowed Wednesday with
mourners for the congregation's pastor and his wife, the first victims of the
Georgia tornadoes to be laid to rest. Union Hill Primitive Baptist Church had to
set up speakers so friends and relatives outside in the sunlight could hear
tributes to Jackie and Mary Ann McClelland, both 64, who were killed Monday when
a twister thrashed their home. "It's difficult to stand here and try to express
to you that God is a God of love," the Rev. Cleston Brooks told mourners. "But
do not let this harden your heart. It's not for you and I to choose when our
time will come."

China Dissident Gets Six Years

	   BEIJING (AP) -- A Chinese court has handed a six-year jail term to a
dissident convicted of subversion for his part in organizing a would-be
opposition party, a human rights group said. Liu Shizun, who worked as an
assistant to dissident Xu Wenli, now also in jail, was sentenced Wednesday in
the northeastern city of Dalian, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China said Thursday. Liu, 38, is the 21st
leader of the China Democracy Party to be imprisoned on subversion charges since
the government began cracking down on the group in late 1998, the Information

<HEADLINE> Vaccine Panel Changes Recommendation  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- In a sign that cost is becoming a factor in making
immunization policy, a government advisory committee has changed its
recommendation to require fewer children to receive an expensive vaccine that
fights illnesses such as ear infections and meningitis.
</P>
<P>
	   The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on
Immunization Policy recommended Wednesday that the vaccine Prevenar should be
administered to all children under 2 and those under age 5 who are at high risk
of contracting the diseases.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, ACIP had voted to recommend Prevenar, which costs $232 per
four-dose series, for all children under 5.
</P>
<P>
	   It was only the second time the committee has ever debated the potential
economic impact of a vaccine, marking a potential shift in what medical experts
consider before making a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're having to look at cost more and more," said Dr. John Modlin,
committee chairman and a professor of pediatric medicine at Dartmouth
University.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dr. Paul Offit, a committee member who is chief of infectious diseases
at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said, "That's basically trying to
find relative values in human life, even though everyone could benefit from it.
We need to recommend it first and figure out how to pay for it second."
</P>
<P>
	   That doesn't change the realities faced by the public and private sector
alike, especially with the hefty price tag, other committee members argued. The
federal government pays for about half of all immunizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Food and Drug Administration approval of the vaccine is expected this week,
and its manufacturer, American Home Products, will begin marketing it this
spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Prevenar fights the bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae -- the leading cause
of pneumonia, meningitis and the millions of ear infections that lead to crammed
pediatrician waiting rooms every year.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a study, the vaccine reduced ear infections by 9 percent.
Doctor visits by those who were diagnosed as having chronic ear infections and
took the vaccine were down 20 percent, and there was a 20 percent reduction in
the number of children who needed tube implants to fight the infections.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Paradiso, vice president for scientific affairs for the division of
American Health that makes the vaccine, said that the sweeping scope of the
first set of guidelines was not expected and that the company is pleased with
the new recommendation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The numbers show that this is cost effective, since it reduces surgeries
and doctor's visits," added Paradiso, adding that the company has been working
on this vaccine since 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Eric France, assistant chief of preventive medicine for the American
Association of Health Plans, said he believes that all managed care
organizations will cover the new vaccines despite the cost.
</P>
<P>
	   "But the membership of the ACIP needs to understand that cost is a factor
and needs to be taken into consideration along with safety and effectiveness,"
France said. "We need to make it part of the discussion before the initial
recommendations are made."

<HEADLINE> Sears Pulls Benetton Contract  </HEADLINE>
    By TAMMY WEBBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Sears, Roebeuck and Co. severed ties with trendy Italian
clothier Benetton, whose ad campaign featuring death row inmates upset
customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Sears chairman and chief executive Arthur C. Martinez was "outraged," as
were many customers, at the ads, said company spokesman Tom Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
	   "The advertising campaign was inconsistent with what Sears has come to stand
for and is inconsistent with the customer base we serve," Nicholson said. "We
have a high level of customer trust and loyalty, and there has been some strong
emotional reaction to (Benetton's) campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   The ads, which began appearing in magazines and on billboards last month,
feature portraits of American death row inmates in prison uniforms over the
words, "Sentenced to Death." The ads also give the inmate's name, date of birth,
crime and expected method of execution.
</P>
<P>
	   Benetton officials said the ads were meant to raise awareness about the
death penalty, but victims' rights groups said the ads glorified convicted
killers and were insensitive to victims' families and friends.
</P>
<P>
	   Sears ended its contract even after the Italian clothing company agreed to
allow Sears to preview future ads. Sears had said it would keep the contract
under that condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Sears has been weighing its decision to terminate the contract since it
learned the content of the ads in early January, Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been hearing from people who have lost loved ones to some of the
folks who have been profiled," Nicholson said. "It's reopened wounds and brought
back a lot of painful memories and people are hurt by it."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday groups picketed a Houston Sears store and Benetton's New York
office. Hours later, Sears announced it would immediately pull Benetton-designed
clothing from all 400 Sears stores that have been selling the Benetton USA line.
</P>
<P>
	   Benetton spokesman Mark Major did not immediately return a phone call
seeking comment on Sears' decision.
</P>
<P>
	   But earlier Wednesday he said Benetton stood by its ads and believed it had
succeeded in "launching a national and global discussion on capital punishment."
</P>
<P>
	   Benetton has made headlines in the past with ads addressing such topics as
AIDS and racism. It also prompted protests from the Roman Catholic Church in the
1990s for ads featuring models dressed as a priest and a nun that were kissing.
</P>
<P>
	   Sears, based in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, introduced the
Benetton USA clothing line last fall to help boost lagging clothing sales.
Benetton made that line exclusively for Sears and continued to sell its United
Colors of Benetton clothing in its own stores.

<HEADLINE> Police officer cleared in shooting of teen-ager  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - On the last day of his life, 14-year-old Aquan
Salmon set out with three friends to buy yo-yos, but they instead purchased a
pair of gun-shaped cigarette lighters.
<P>
	   Police say those lighters were aimed at a mugging victim in the early
morning hours of April 13, 1999. A short time later, Officer Robert Allan
followed a car he believed was carrying armed suspects into a dark driveway in
the city's North End.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighty-eight seconds later Allan had shot Salmon dead. On Wednesday, after a
10-month investigation a special prosecutor ruled the shooting was justified.
</P>
<P>
	   "The shooting was over in a matter of seconds," said New London State's
Attorney Kevin Kane, who conducted the investigation. "To say the situation
Officer Allan was in was tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving is an
understatement."
</P>
<P>
	   Under state law, Kane said, Allan did not have to see Salmon with a weapon -
only to reasonably believe that his life was in danger when he fired one shot at
Salmon.
</P>
<P>
	   Although cleared of state charges, the officer's legal entanglements are far
from ended.
</P>
<P>
	   Kane's 200-page report has been turned over to the FBI's civil rights
division and the U.S. attorney for Connecticut. The city also is conducting its
own review.
</P>
<P>
	   Salmon's family would not comment. Allan could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a tragedy for (Salmon's) family, his friends and the entire
community," Kane told a news conference Wednesday at the State Armory. "People
chose sides quickly, and hopefully they will pause and examine the facts
presented in this report today."
</P>
<P>
	   Some paused to pray. A dozen North End residents gathered near the shooting
site Wednesday afternoon to reflect near the remnants of a makeshift memorial.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Cornell Lewis, pastor of the North End Church of Christ, led the
residents in prayer. Lewis, who is also a substance abuse and anger management
counselor, said people need to "vent" in a constructive way.
</P>
<P>
	   Kane and Public Safety Commissioner Henry Lee, a noted forensic expert,
outlined in detail the final minutes leading up to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Alone in his patrol car in the early morning hours of April 13, Allan was on
the lookout for a white Cadillac carrying suspects in the mugging. Witnesses
reported seeing four black males and two guns.
</P>
<P>
	   Allan spotted the car at 2:09 a.m. The Cadillac became hung up on a pile of
asphalt and the occupants began running from the car.
</P>
<P>
	   Allan, who said he thought he heard gunshots, gave chase. He said he saw
that the fleeing driver appeared to have a gun in his hand.
</P>
<P>
	   The gun-shaped cigarette lighters were recovered, one on the front seat of
the Cadillac and the other in the lot where Salmon was shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Salmon, a back seat passenger, was among the last to leave the car. He
approached Allan from behind, and began running past him on the right.
</P>
<P>
	   The officer ordered Salmon to stop and said the teen made a quick sweeping
motion toward his waistband. Allan fired one shot. Salmon was struck in the
upper left side of his back.
</P>
<P>
	   Allan's account of hearing gunshots could not be substantiated. Lee
concluded there was enough debris in the lot that anyone running across it could
make popping sounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the report was made public, investigators discussed the findings with
Salmon's family and community officials. Outside that meeting, a small group of
protesters chanted, "No justice, no peace."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a lynching," said Kuba Assegai, a black businessman in the city. "We
want a police force who are there to serve the community, not bully the
community."
</P>
<P>
	   Allan has been on desk duty since the shooting. Acting Police Chief Deborah
Barrows would not comment on the report, but City Manager Saundra Kee-Borges
said Allan still faces a police review board and will remain on desk duty until
that probe is completed.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Mike Peters said deep wounds are still healing.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to take a look at our procedures, sensitivity training and how we
approach situations like this so it doesn't happen again," he said.

<HEADLINE> Community unhappy, but not surprised, by exoneration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The city's blighted North End became a forum to
vent outrage over the results of a report that cleared a white police officer in
the shooting death of a 14-year-old black mugging suspect.
<P>
	   Before making public the findings Wednesday, state and city officials met at
a neighborhood church to brief the family of Aquan Salmon and selected community
leaders about why Officer Robert Allan was found innocent of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Hartford police department has to be changed because Officer Allan is
going back on the street," said the Rev. Henry Price. "He's been found not
guilty."
</P>
<P>
	   In the lot where Salmon was killed, a dozen people gathered during the
afternoon for an impromptu prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   They sought spiritual guidance - and expressed frustration over the decision
of special prosecutor Kevin Kane.
</P>
<P>
	   Carmen Melendez brought her 5-year-old daughter, Catalina, and her nieces
and nephews to what remains of a makeshift memorial to Salmon. Candles, a teddy
bear, broken statues and plastic flowers lay amid snow and mud. Spray-painted on
a brick wall were tributes to "Quanny."
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's messed up how the cop got off, because he's only a kid. He's
somebody's brother; somebody's baby," said Melendez, who lives in the
neighborhood where Salmon was killed on April 13.
</P>
<P>
	   The children placed their palms together and bowed their heads as they
recalled a boy they never met.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Cornell Lewis, pastor of the North End Church of Christ, came to
the scene "just trying to find certain people and let certain people find me to
offer counseling."
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis led the group in prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   "I pray also, Father, in the days and months to come, that if Officer Robert
Allan is guilty that you judge him," said Lewis. "We pray, Father, in your
divine justice that you not let this man go if he is guilty."
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis and others were frustrated at being kept out of a meeting earlier in
the day between investigators and Salmon's family. Had they been allowed inside,
they could have shared the information with others, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're asking the community to act crazy because they're shutting them
out," said Wendy Moore. "They create a who's-who. Everybody should be a
who's-who. It makes a difference when people can learn it for themselves."
</P>
<P>
	   Later in the evening, about two dozen people returned to Phillips
Metropolitan CME Church, where the morning meeting was held.
</P>
<P>
	   Other churches and a mosque in the North End opened their doors Wednesday
night as social workers joined clergy in an effort to address the needs of
residents.
</P>
<P>
	   City police were prepared for the worst, though no problems were reported
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers formed small teams to patrol the city. Cruisers were manned by a
driver, a supervisor, a video technician and a specially trained
disorder-control or emergency-response officer.

<HEADLINE> DNA Leads to Charge in 1981 Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Nearly two decades after walking away from police custody, a
37-year-old man has been charged with the stabbing death of a teen-aged girl.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said DNA evidence taken from a bandage that had been wrapped
around Patrick Durham's hand links him to the killing of 14-year-old Mary
Burhoe, who was stabbed more than 100 times.
</P>
<P>
	   Durham, 37, pleaded innocent to murder at his arraignment Wednesday. He
already was serving time at the state prison in Norfolk for an unrelated drug
conviction.
</P>
<P>

River.

	   Witnesses saw Durham the night before demand sex and threaten the girl with
a knife, Suffolk County prosecutor David Meier said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested Durham the day Burhoe's body was found, but authorities have
said there was not enough evidence to charge him. Police kept the bandage Durham
had on his right hand.

	   With the advent of DNA fingerprinting technology, investigators matched
blood from the bandage with blood found on Burhoe's jeans, Meier said.

<HEADLINE> Mohegans unveil $800 million expansion to casino complex  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MONTVILLE, Conn. (AP) - An $800 million expansion to the Mohegan Sun
Casino will have visitors seeing stars-literally.
<P>
	   The project includes a 1,200-room high-rise hotel visible from Long Island
Sound and 115,000 square feet of gaming space. Its centerpiece will be a
six-story alabaster tower with a cocktail lounge and a planetarium which will
project the heavens on the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a very exciting day for us," said Maynard Strickland, a member of
the Tribal Council, who attended Wednesday's announcement of the plan in New
York City. "It's putting Uncasville on the map."
</P>
<P>
	   The development is expected to bring 4,000 jobs to the region and increase
the Mohegan Sun's stature as a rival to the larger and older Foxwoods Resort
Casino, operated by the neighboring Mashantucket Pequots.
</P>
<P>
	   The construction is already under way and is expected to be completed by the
spring of 2002, said Mitchell Etess, executive vice president of marketing for
Mohegan Sun.
</P>
<P>
	   The $325 million Mohegan Sun opened in October 1996. But it was built
without a hotel and that affected the amount of time people could stay at the
casino, Etess said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The hotel's going to create a whole new business for us in the meeting and
convention business," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The project will be paid with $360 million worth of high-yield bonds and a
loan from Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
	   Also included in the plans are 100,000 square feet of convention space, a
40,000-square-foot ballroom, a 175,000-square-foot retail complex offering
brand-name merchandise and a 10,000-seat arena.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside, crystals and multicolored beads will reflect light around the new
casino, said David Rockwell, an architect with Rockwellgroup who is helping
design the casino.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mohegans' casino will still be smaller than the Mashantucket's Foxwoods
Resort Casino, which opened in 1992. The Mohegan Sun has 280,000 square feet of
gambling space, compared with 315,310 square feet at Foxwoods. The new hotel
will have 1,200 rooms, while the grand hotel at Foxwoods has 1,416.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob DeSalvio, a vice president of marketing at Foxwoods Resort Casino, said
the Mashantuckets wish their neighbors well.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're firm believers that the project that they're putting forth is
actually very good for the region," DeSalvio said.

<HEADLINE> Salmon case revives frustration with other shooting investigations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - The decision not to prosecute a Hartford police
officer in the shooting of a teen-age suspect only exacerbated criticism of the
way police shootings in Connecticut are investigated.
<P>
	   Relatives of those shot by police say state's attorneys, state police and
even federal law enforcement cannot do a fair review of a local police
department shooting because of their professional ties to law enforcers.
</P>
<P>
	   "There needs to be some objectivity in the investigation," said Emma Jones,
the mother of Malik Jones, who was killed by an East Haven police officer in
April 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the only way to ensure fairness of all of the people involved, not
just for the families but for the police too," Jones said Wednesday. "As long as
they continue with the process that they have, there can never be any trust or
respect for the system."
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney John Kelly, who represents three police officers involved in fatal
shootings, said he believes the process is fair.
</P>
<P>
	   "Instead of just mouthing off, people ought to read the reports, let it sink
in and realize that these reports are very comprehensive, very detailed," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelly represents Hartford Officer Robert Allan, who was cleared of
wrongdoing Wednesday in the April 13 shooting death of 14-year-old mugging
suspect Aquan Salmon.
</P>
<P>
	   He also represents New Milford Officer Scott Smith, who faces a murder trial
next week in the December 1998 shooting of Franklyn Reid, and North Branford
Officer Michael Breen, who was cleared of wrongdoing last week in the July
shooting death of Victoria Cooper of West Haven.
</P>
<P>
	   "My position has always been that the state's attorney who conducts these
investigations knows the facts better than these critics," Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
	   But David Rosen, the lawyer for Cooper's family, said Breen was given two
weeks to write his report on Cooper's death, while police officers on other
cases must get a report together much more quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   Breen also did not have to undergo questioning by supervisors or anyone else
about the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   "The officer's given every opportunity to shape the story to the facts
instead of responding the way everyone else is asked to," Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jimmy Jones, Malik Jones' father, also said police officers should be
questioned and cross-examined after a fatal shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there is nothing for him or her to fear, then what's the problem here?"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Emma Jones said the state should go one step further and start a grand jury
investigation whenever police kill someone. The case should be led by federal
investigators who have no ties to Connecticut, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Malik Jones' case, East Haven Officer Robert Flodquist was cleared after
investigations by the New Haven state's attorney and the U.S. attorney for
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut does allow outside prosecutors to be brought in to investigate
police shootings. Smith was indicted by Waterbury State's Attorney John
Connelly, even though the shooting occurred in the Litchfield Judicial District.
</P>
<P>
	   "We would have been upset if they had appointed a local investigator," said
Pearlylyn Reid, mother of victim Franklyn Reid. "Because things probably would
have been swept under the rug."

<HEADLINE> Businessman points to pressure to fund campaigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The Rowland administration says there is no truth
to a Mystic businessman's claim that he was pressured to give $30,000 to a "high
ranking" state Treasury official in exchange for a state business loan.
<P>
	   John Haggerty gave few details to the Legislature's Government
Administration and Elections Committee during a public hearing on campaign
finance reform Wednesday, but said the payoff was to be funneled to political
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he never handed over the money and was denied the loan by the
Department of Economic and Community Development.
</P>
<P>
	   DECD spokesman Jim Watson said the agency worked with Haggerty and decided
not to give him financial assistance. He dismissed Haggerty's accusation of a
political quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
	   "His accusation is without any merit and not based on fact," Watson said.
"It's well known that this agency does not operate in that fashion."
</P>
<P>
	   Haggerty said that after meeting with Department of Economic and Community
Development Commissioner James Abromaitis on Feb. 16, 1999, he was "introduced
to a former high ranking state treasury official."
</P>
<P>
	   He refused to identify the official, and said he has not shared his
accusation with any law enforcement agents.
</P>
<P>
	   "In that meeting, this person told me I would need to supply $30,000 so he
could get Gov. (John G.) Rowland to approve the project," Haggerty said. "He
said the money would be used to fund campaigns. I was also told how the funds
should be handled. I am not suggesting that this individual was acting on
instruction from the governor. However, I was shocked, disgusted and afraid."
</P>
<P>
	   Haggerty is the former owner of C.C. Bagel Company, a chain which had
several stores throughout New London County. He applied for state aid in 1997 to
market several products under the Mystic Seaport name - including soda, beer and
clam chowder.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani said Haggerty's claims are without merit.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor would not be involved in approving a project like this,
anyway," Pagani said. "It would be done at the agency level. It doesn't make
sense. What he's saying happened wasn't even in an election year."
</P>
<P>
	   About seven months after Haggerty's meeting with Abromaitis, former state
Treasurer Paul Silvester pleaded guilty to federal racketeering and
money-laundering charges related to his failed 1998 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Silvester admitted to investing state pension money with companies in
exchange for kickbacks to himself, his family and his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature is considering two campaign finance reform plans which call
for different campaign spending caps. Both plans would allow residents to fund
campaigns through checkoffs on their state income tax return. The system would
take money away from the individual's refund, rather than use money out of the
state's General Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Both plans call for public financing of races for governor and
constitutional offices such as attorney general and treasurer. Neither plan
includes public financing of legislative races.
</P>
<P>
	   Some leading Republicans say it will be impossible to publicly fund
campaigns with voluntary checkoffs, and argued that capping campaign spending
infringes on free speech.
</P>
<P>
	   "I really think they are all attempts to limit political speech, which I
find too precious," said House Minority Leader Robert Ward, R-Northfield. "The
weighing and balancing ought not to be focused on limiting free speech."

<HEADLINE> Judge orders Waterbury to release more water into river  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) - A Superior Court judge has ordered the city of
Waterbury to release more water into the Shepaug River, ending a dispute that
pitted the city against environmentalists and two rural towns, officials said.
<P>
	   "I am very ecstatic and very pleased," said Roxbury First Selectman Barbara
Henry. "I think it is a victory for the Shepaug River Association and for all
the people who knew all along that there is plenty of water for everyone."
</P>
<P>
	   Conservationists from Roxbury and Washington sued the city in 1997, saying
Waterbury does not release enough water into the Shepaug River from an upstream
watershed.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit claimed that the city's actions affect the river, especially in
the summer when it dries to a trickle in some places. The river runs through the
towns of Warren, Washington and Roxbury before it empties into the Housatonic
River.
</P>
<P>
	   The city releases between 1.5 million and 5 million gallons of water into
the river each day, Henry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Beverly Hodgson ordered Waterbury to release 34.3 million gallons a
day in May, 13.8 million gallons per day in June, 7.6 million in July, 6.5
million in August, 6.1 million in September and 9.8 million on October, Henry
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a fight that was well worth fighting," she said."I think the river
is going to be much better off than when we started."
</P>
<P>
	   Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano said he was satisfied with the decision. He
said the city had offered a settlement that would have put even more water back
in the river.
</P>
<P>
	   "(The judge) also indicated that in extreme drought conditions those numbers
would not be required, and that was very important," he said.

<HEADLINE> Soviet Spy Ring Member Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The youngest member of a family spy ring for the Soviet Union
has been released from a halfway house after serving 15 years of a 25-year
prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Lance Walker, 37, the son of the ring's leader, John A. Walker Jr.,
was released Wednesday. He will be on supervised probation for the rest of the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   The spy ring operated for 17 years, causing what authorities described as
extensive damage to national security.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Walker was arrested in 1985 on the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz,
where he was responsible for destroying secret messages. A box filled with 15
pounds of secret documents he had stolen was found hidden near his bunk.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy seaman pleaded guilty along with his father, a retired Navy warrant
officer, to spying charges. He testified that he became a spy in 1983 ``for the
money and to please my father.''
</P>
<P>
	   John Walker admitted passing secrets while he was a shipboard communications
officer, and after his retirement by recruiting his son, brother and a friend,
Jerry A. Whitworth, a chief petty officer.
</P>
<P>
	   John Walker, 62, and his brother, Arthur, 65, a retired Navy lieutenant
commander, will not be eligible for release for another 15 years. Whitworth, 60,
is serving a life sentence.

<HEADLINE> U.Va. Sees Drop in Black Applicants  </HEADLINE>
   By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Heated debate over the University of Virginia's
affirmative action programs is partly to blame for a 25 percent drop in the
number of black applicants, a university official said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's devastating,'' said Rick Turner, dean of the school's Office of
African-American Affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of black applicants for this fall's freshman class fell to 961,
from 1,287 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Turner said it is the largest single-year drop in black applicants since he
came to the university in 1988, and possibly the biggest since the school began
admitting blacks in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any time you have a drop in enrollment there's no one reason, but it
doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that one of the primary reasons is
because of the controversy we've been embroiled in over affirmative action,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The friction stems from last fall, when a special committee of the school's
governing body considered changing the way the race factors into admissions.
</P>
<P>
	   The university decided to drop a scoring system that gave an advantage to
some applicants for race and other factors, such as geographic location. But the
university still informally considers race among the many factors in determining
which students are admitted.
</P>
<P>
	   University spokeswoman Louise M. Dudley said while it is hard to pinpoint
one reason for the fewer black applicants, it is clear the affirmative action
debate played a role.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall undergraduate applications to the University of Virginia also
decreased by 16 percent this year. A total of 14,298 incoming freshmen applied,
compared with 17,090 last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Dudley said possible factors contributing to the overall drop include the
university's decline in the national rankings of top public universities, and
higher tuition for out-of-state students.

<HEADLINE> Africans Want U.N. Peacekeepers  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- African nations are lobbying to get thousands of U.N.
peacekeepers on the ground quickly to support a shaky cease-fire in Congo -- but
many council members first want to be certain that fighting has stopped and
there really is a peace to keep.
</P>
<P>
	   French U.N. Ambassador Alain Dejammet said prospects for getting thousands
of peacekeepers into Congo in the near future ``are dim.''
</P>
<P>
	   The rebel campaign to oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila has drawn in
six countries and has threatened the stability of central Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a cease-fire signed last summer in Lusaka, Zambia, by supporters and
opponents of Kabila, both sides have been accused of repeated violations. And
there have been no moves to withdraw foreign forces from Congo as called for in
the Lusaka accord.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think there is a great deal of enthusiasm to see a U.N.
peacekeeping force deployed to -- how shall I put it -- anchor an invading force
in the country,'' said Canada's U.N. ambassador, Robert Fowler.
</P>
<P>
	   He was referring to troops from Uganda and Rwanda who are supporting rebel
forces in parts of eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   As an initial step, the Security Council last August authorized the
deployment of 90 military liaison officers to countries involved in the
conflict: Congo and its backers -- Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia -- as well as
Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
	   But it took months to get 79 officers in the field, and they have been
barred from key sites, especially in government-held areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Next week, the Security Council is almost certain to approve a long-delayed
second step to cool the Congo conflict -- sending 500 military observers and
over 5,000 logistics and security personnel to support them. The vote is
expected on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S.-sponsored resolution calls for observers to monitor implementation
and lay the groundwork for possible deployment of a much larger U.N.
peacekeeping force, which is called for in the Lusaka agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   But there is still uncertainty about when the military observers will arrive
in Congo. And the Security Council was very vague about possible deployment of
peacekeepers, saying in late January that it intends to consider preparations
``at the appropriate time.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lobbying Congress on Tuesday to support the military observer mission, U.S.
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said deployment would begin only when key
conditions are met, including security, access, and the parties' cooperation
with U.N. personnel.
</P>
<P>
	   Approval of a follow-up peacekeeping force ``is not automatic,'' he
stressed, and will depend on the parties observing the Lusaka accord and
withdrawing forces from confrontation lines, as well as progress on a ``national
dialogue'' in Congo.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke reiterated that U.N. peacekeepers would not enforce the Lusaka
accord or forcibly disarm the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Echoing his concerns, Russian U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said ``a lot
depends on the willingness of the parties -- which should be demonstrated -- to
abide by the Lusaka agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dejammet said ``the real, rational, logical'' action after a cease-fire is
secured would be for the United Nations to try to establish a buffer force along
the borders between Congo and Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But it would cost money. It would require a lot of people. And at this
very moment, if we are realistic, it's obvious that it's uneasy to foresee such
a development in a not too far away time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior U.N. officials said last August that a minimum of 25,000 soldiers
would be needed for a peacekeeping force in Congo, which is the size of the
United States east of the Mississippi River. The U.N. peacekeeping department is
reported to be working on scenarios with different force sizes, but no numbers
have been released. African leaders say a large force is needed to restore
peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Congolese U.N. Ambassador Andre Kapanga said Wednesday that his government
wants a U.N. buffer force on its border -- but it also wants U.N. troops to help
move Rwandan and Ugandan forces out of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Namibia's U.N. ambassador, Martin Andjaba, believes once the U.N. observer
mission arrives, the Security Council will have to increase it to a full
peacekeeping operation in order to restore peace to central Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting Holbrooke's focus on Africa, and especially the Congo, in January, he
said ``Africans want the United States to take the lead'' in getting a Congo
peacekeeping force quickly.

<HEADLINE> North Korean Stamp Barred From Show  </HEADLINE>
   By AMALIE YOUNG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The federal government has canceled plans by an
international stamp dealer to sell rare postage stamps for the North Korean
government at a collectors' show.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the Trading with the Enemy Act, selling stamps from the communist
nation in the United States is illegal, according to the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These stamps are subject to the embargo'' against Communist North Korea,
said an agency spokeswoman, who declined to give her name. ``There is no
exception.''
</P>
<P>
	   The stamp dealer, Mark Dianda of Oakland, Calif., says the American
Philatelic Society gave him permission to sell the stamps at its three-day show
this weekend in Portland.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, North Korea appointed Dianda its agent to sell stamps in the
United States. Since then, he has been selling them over the Internet for 75
cents to $2 each.
</P>
<P>
	   Dianda said that under his agreement, the North Korean government gets some
of the proceeds and he gets the rest. He did not provide the breakdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Dianda said he has sold North Korean stamps in the United States before, and
he doesn't understand the fuss this time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not like I'm trading nuclear secrets,'' he said Wednesday. ``It's
really annoying that I can't sell them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dianda says he will display the stamps at the Portland show, but he won't
try to sell them. The stamps depict sports events in preparation for the Sydney
Olympics; animals including ducks, cats and butterflies; and a copy of a 10th
century Korean mural to commemorate the Year of the Dragon.
</P>
<P>
	   Dianda said he thought he could sell the North Korean stamps because he had
seen press releases and newspaper articles that indicated trade sanctions
against the country had been relaxed.
</P>
<P>
	   Although President Clinton eased some sanctions against the Asian nation in
September, it is still a closed nation, and commercial sales of its stamps are
forbidden in this country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's kind of a disappointment; I like that sort of stuff myself as a
collector,'' said Bob Lamb, executive director of the philatelic society. ``I'd
like to get some, but I'm not going to break the law.''

<HEADLINE> Jamaican Parliament Approves Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW J. ROSENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Jamaica's parliament approved the end of the
island's telephone monopoly, but opponents threatened to block the deal in
court, saying the planned deregulation is too slow.
</P>
<P>
	   The parliament passed legislation Wednesday night finalizing a deal struck
by the government with Cable and Wireless Jamaica for opening the
telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the deal, full competition will be instituted in phases over three
years in all areas, including international calls. During the transition, the
government will heavily regulate sectors where the British-based Cable and
Wireless remains dominant.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement, reached in September, voids a 1988 deal that granted the
company's government-owned predecessor a 25-year monopoly with guaranteed annual
profits of 17.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Debate over the deal has been a focus of interest for other former and
current British Caribbean territories with Cable and Wireless monopolies.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents -- including local Internet companies, consumer groups and a local
civil rights group -- charge the long transition stifles competition by giving
Cable and Wireless an insurmountable head-start over potential competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   During two days of parliamentd debate, opposition Labor Party lawmakers
echoed those complaints.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It gives this multinational, United Kingdom company privileges and bonuses
that are incomprehensible'' said Labor Party leader Edward Seaga, who called the
agreement ``a sweetheart deal.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will challenge it in court,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmaker Andrew Holness said the bill allowed ``industrial espionage'' by
giving Cable and Wireless the right to inspect equipment used by competitors to
transmit data overseas to ensure that it is not being used illegally for
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry, Commerce and Technology Minister Philip Paulwell brushed aside the
charges. ``This bill represents a tremendous leap into the technological
world,'' he said. ``We are going to see the tremendous benefits from competition
that will flow.''
</P>
<P>
	   Paulwell said it paves the way for foreign investment worth millions of
dollars that will create thousands of jobs for the economically depressed
island.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said the agreement would bring telephones to isolated communities
and would allow the government to provide Internet access in every post
office.

<HEADLINE> Cargo Plane Crashes in California  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HOWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif. (AP) -- A DC-8 cargo plane crashed into an automobile
wrecking yard while trying to make an emergency landing Wednesday and burst into
flames, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately known how many people were on board or if there were
any survivors, the FAA said. The plane, Emery Worldwide transport service Flight
17, typically carries a crew of three, said Jim Whitehead, manager of the FAA's
regional operations center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash set as many as 200 cars on fire and caused explosions over a
200-yard-long area, fire Capt. Dan Haverty told television station KXTV.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane took off at 7:50 p.m., bound for Dayton, and the pilot immediately
called back to the airfield's departure control and told them he had a severe
problem with the center of gravity of the plane, Whitehead said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He impacted the ground in a wrecking yard in a ball of fire,'' Whitehead
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses told the station they saw the plane take off from the former
Mather Air Force Base and then turn around before it crashed. There were no
immediate reports of injuries on the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   Motorist Ernie Killinger said the plane hit the ground belly-first.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like he was crash-landing,'' said Killinger, who was on his way
home. ``I saw the front half of the fuselage come out of the flames and the
cockpit was straight up and it just rocked back and forth until it was engulfed
by the flames.''
</P>
<P>
	   The McDonnell Douglas DC-8 has two engines mounted on each wing. The model
went into service in 1959 and production ended in 1972.
</P>
<P>
	   Since its closure in 1993 as a military base, Mather has become a civilian
airport and the region's air cargo hub. The airport, now known as Mather Field,
is located about 10 miles east of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
	   Emery, based in Redwood City, specializes in transportation services for
business shippers of heavyweight cargo, the company says on its Web site. The
$2.4-billion company is a subsidiary of CNF Inc., a $5.6-billion diversified
transportation company based in Palo Alto, the site states.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Urges Big Iran Vote Turnout  </HEADLINE>
   By VIJAY JOSHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's president has urged his supporters to turn out
in large numbers for Friday elections in a drive to end the domination of
parliament by hardliners who have hampered his campaign for social and political
reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents to President Mohammad Khatami's liberal reforms called on voters
to cast ballots for conservative candidates to uphold the virtues of Islam,
which now dictate nearly every aspect of Iranian life.
</P>
<P>
	   At stake are 290 seats in the Majlis, or parliament. In the outgoing
chamber, conservatives held a slight majority.
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami's brother, Mohammadreza Khatami, a front-running candidate in
Tehran, predicted a two-thirds majority for reformists in the new legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am sure that the youth will ... show to the world that we are alive and
we are looking for a free life,'' he said at a rally Wednesday, the last day of
campaigning before the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   There are no opinion polls in Iran, but many expect the reformists to do
well because of the mounting frustration among ordinary people with the Islamic
rule imposed after the 1979 revolution brought the clergy to power.
</P>
<P>
	   That frustration first brought Khatami to office in a landslide victory in
May 1997 elections. In a radio and television address to the nation Wednesday,
the president said people can once again show their will in these elections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By these votes, you can give the most help to the president,'' he said.
``This election will be the 21st election since the revolution and, God willing,
it would be the most significant one.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since coming to power, Khatami has eased social restrictions and granted
greater freedom of speech, despite stiff opposition from hard-liners, who
control crucial institutions such as the judiciary, radio and television, and
the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   The election results will prove ``that someone may rule as a jailer, but he
cannot lock the hearts of the people,'' said Ali Reza Nouri, a Tehran candidate.
His brother, former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri, is in jail for religious
dissent -- one of several reformists imprisoned by the hard-liners in an attempt
to thwart their growing popularity.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if reformists win a majority in the Majlis, they face the hard-liners'
domination of the Guardian Council, which must endorse all legislation. Iran's
supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is said to be behind the
conservatives, has the final word on all matters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The structure of power in our country is such that the president alone
cannot do much. But one by one we should take control of the power bases,'' said
Karoon Memari, 18, in a Tehran street.
</P>
<P>
	   For many Iranians, a reformist parliament could change their day-to-day
lives and allow many activities now forbidden -- watching western television
programs, listening to the music of their choice, criticizing the clergy and,
for women, dressing in clothes other than the head-to-toe robes now mandated by
law.
</P>
<P>
	   At a rally by top reformist candidates in a basketball stadium in downtown
Tehran on Wednesday, about 5,000 supporters waved banners, whistled, and sang
patriotic songs.
</P>
<P>
	   Conditioned by 21 years of restrictions, men and women sat on opposite
stands but clapped and shouted in unison. Many in the audience had wrapped
campaign pamphlets around their foreheads like crowns.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 6,000 candidates, including 424 women, are running in the elections
-- both numbers a record. For the first time, candidates must have a college
degree to be able to stand.
</P>
<P>
	   About 38.7 million of Iran's 62 million people are eligible to vote.

<HEADLINE> Talks Fail To Dent Belfast Deadlock  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- The prime ministers of Britain and Ireland have vowed to
steer Northern Ireland's feuding politicians back into government together, but
admit they don't yet know how.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not going to pretend that this is not a difficult situation, because
it is,'' British leader Tony Blair said Wednesday night after he and Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern spoke to key politicians in the province's suspended
power-sharing Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   The diplomacy inside Blair's London residence failed to move either the
IRA-linked Sinn Fein party or the province's major Protestant party, the Ulster
Unionists. They remained entrenched on opposite sides of an argument over when,
if ever, the outlawed Irish Republican Army should disarm in support of the
province's 1998 peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The ball is still firmly in their court,'' said Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sinn Fein can't make peace on our own,'' countered Gerry Adams, the
party's leader.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ulster Unionists in November accepted an American-brokered deal that
required them to form the four-party Cabinet in expectation that the IRA would
disarm in response. But the outlawed group offered no firm commitments to a
disarmament commission last month, triggering the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain, determined to forestall the Cabinet's total collapse, took powers
away from the coalition Friday and resumed direct control. The move deterred the
Ulster Unionists from resigning their posts, as they had threatened.
</P>
<P>
	   It also provoked the IRA -- which had offered a vague but promising proposal
to the province's disarmament commission -- to retaliate by retracting that
submission and breaking off contact with the commission.
</P>
<P>
	   That has left Northern Ireland's peace process in the familiar Catch-22 that
blocked the Cabinet's formation for more than a year. The IRA and Ulster
Unionists are both demanding the other side make the next painful move.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair pledged that in the coming days of negotiations in Belfast, Dublin and
London the dilemma would be untangled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The one thing I am sure of, having met all the parties, is that none of
them really wants to see this agreement fall. All of them know it is the only
way forward,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``None of us wanted to suspend the institutions,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair was referring to the Cabinet, the 108-member Belfast legislature from
which it was drawn, and six policy-making committees that linked the governments
in Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic. All were stripped of power Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, President Clinton said it was unfortunate that the IRA hadn't
maintained contact with the disarmament commission. He conceded that the peace
process faced ``a rough patch'' with no clear outcome.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton cited the apparent strength of the IRA's 1997 cease-fire as a
bright spot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The IRA has given no indication whatever that they will revert to
violence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein's Adams warned that other parties were taking his influence over
IRA policy for granted at a dangerous moment.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it had proved extremely difficult to persuade the IRA to open
disarmament talks at all, ``and the IRA's voluntary initiative was thrown back
in its face.''
</P>
<P>
	   As long as Britain withheld powers from the Cabinet in Belfast, Sinn Fein
``cannot play a useful and constructive role in resolving the arms issue,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Latvia Wants Extradition Treaty  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN C. JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- Latvian prosecutors are pushing to conclude an
extradition treaty with Australia to speed the handover of 86-year-old Nazi war
crimes suspect Konrads Kalejs if he is indicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Jewish groups have pressured Latvia to extradite Kalejs -- accused of
involvement in atrocities during Germany's 1941-44 occupation of Latvia -- for
trial after he was found by Nazi hunters in a retirement home in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs, who was deported from the United States and Canada in the 1990s for
lying about his wartime record, returned in January to Australia, where he has
had citizenship since 1957.
</P>
<P>
	   Latvian officials have said they do not have sufficient witnesses or
evidence to indict Kalejs and invited investigators from the United States,
Canada, Australia, Great Britain, Germany and Israel to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can promise that we will see to it that all war criminals are called to
liability,'' Justice Minister Valdis Birkavs said Wednesday as the conference
opened. ``Latvia has a strong political will for this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jewish leaders, who have criticized Latvia for not convicting a single Nazi
since it gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, welcomed the
conference but said they remained skeptical and were disappointed that they had
not been invited.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our feeling is that this might be a very positive step but the jury is
still out,'' said Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
	   In Moscow, Russian foreign ministry officials also complained that they
weren't invited, saying the talks should involve all parties that suffered from
Nazism, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Latvian officials said they asked Australia to help overcome
``bureaucratic delays'' on both sides that were hampering agreement on an
extradition treaty, foreign ministry spokesman Janis Silis said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We intend to do all we can to sign an extradition treaty, but we need
efforts from both sides,'' he said, adding that agreement could be reached in
four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Jewish groups say Kalejs was involved in World War II massacres as a
lieutenant in the Arajs Kommando, a notorious Nazi-sponsored death squad staffed
mainly by Latvians. The unit is said to have murdered some 30,000 Latvian Jews.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs has said he was ordered by German officers to head an Arajs Kommando
unit, but he has denied being present when civilians were shot.
</P>
<P>
	   In total, 80,000 Jews perished during the Nazi occupation, most within the
first year of German rule. Germans planned and ordered the massacres, but
Latvian Nazis often carried out the actual killings.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which tracks people accused of
atrocities against Jews, provided Latvian officials with the names of seven
former Arajs men who could testify against Kalejs.
</P>
<P>
	   Zuroff said testimony from these men would be key in indicting Kalejs. He
also said the center was examining new evidence linking Kalejs to a labor camp.
</P>
<P>
	   After regaining independence from Moscow following the 1991 Soviet collapse,
Latvia vowed to pursue and prosecute alleged agents of Nazi- and Stalinist-era
crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   But while Latvia has indicted or convicted nearly a dozen men for Stalinist
crimes, mainly for participating in mass deportations to Siberia, no alleged
Nazis have been tried. The Soviet Union did execute several hundred Nazi war
criminals in Latvia immediately after World War II.

<HEADLINE> Dry Winter Halts Wheat Grazing  </HEADLINE>
    By ROXANA HEGEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Dry weather means Kansas ranchers who saw strong
cattle prices and bought lightweight cattle with the hope of grazing the animals
on winter wheat pastures have had to send much of the herd to feedlots.
</P>
<P>
	   "Cattle were brought in to western Kansas with hopes of wheat pastures that
never materialized," said Steve Hessman, hay reporter for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's office in Dodge City. "Those cattle then ended up in feedlots."
</P>
<P>
	   In January, 2.29 million head of cattle were in feedlots across the state,
compared with just 2.11 million for the same month a year ago, according to
Kansas Agricultural Statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry observers expect the February feedlot count, to be released Friday
by the USDA, to also be high.
</P>
<P>
	   "The lack of wheat pasture has had an impact on the industry this winter,"
said Todd Domer, spokesman for the Kansas Livestock Association. "Fortunately,
the costs of grain in feedlots is pretty economical at this point, so it
probably hasn't been a big economic loss for producers in that situation."
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the dry winter has had a minimal impact for livestock producers in
Kansas, said James Mintert, an agricultural economist at Kansas State
University.
</P>
<P>
	   "Wheat grazing is not as predominant an activity in Kansas as it is in
Oklahoma," he said. "It has had an impact on wheat grazing, but that is not
unusual. There are a lot of years when wheat grazing in Kansas isn't very good."
</P>
<P>
	   It is uncertain how widespread the practice of wheat grazing is in Kansas,
since no government agency keeps track of such things for this state. But many
wheat farmers with livestock operations graze their winter wheat over the fall
and winter months, taking the cattle off in time -- typically by early March in
Kansas -- to still harvest a good wheat crop.
</P>
<P>
	   "The winter impact of dry conditions will be different than it will be
during the grazing season, and obviously we came into winter somewhat dry,"
Domer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas cattlemen are coping with it because they are used to feeding cattle
during the winter, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If by late April and May it is still dry, then you are going to see a huge
impact on the industry," Domer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the dry conditions around the region -- coupled with higher
feedlot numbers -- have cut into surplus hay supplies in the state. Large
semi-load lots of Kansas hay have been shipped as far as West Virginia,
Tennessee and Kentucky, Hessman said.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   PASCO, Wash. (AP) -- From plows to personal computers, Northwest farmers are
increasingly involved in the high-tech world of "precision agriculture."
</P>
<P>
	   The term refers to practices that help farmers decrease variability and
increase production in their fields by micromanaging soil.
</P>
<P>
	   Precision techniques include soil sampling, mapping using global positioning
systems and adding fertilizers and pesticides at rates specific to each patch of
ground.
</P>
<P>
	   While farmers have always tried to figure out why some land grows better
plants than others, the computer age gives farmers better tools to isolate
problems and tinker with solutions.
</P>
<P>
	   High-tech farm equipment can alter chemical application rates within a
field, computer programs can crunch batches of data from soil tests and
satellites can pinpoint ground plots.

<HEADLINE> Minorities Describe Publishing Life  </HEADLINE>
    By HILLEL ITALIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- How does it feel to be a black person in publishing? One
veteran editor compares it to owning a collapsible car: Every day, you have to
rebuild it from scratch.
</P>
<P>
	   "You always have to prove yourself," said Manie Barron, an editor at Random
House. "You can have successes, but even though you've made money you're still
thought of as a fluke."
</P>
<P>
	   Barron was one of nine panelists Wednesday for a discussion entitled
"Minorities in Publishing: Where is Everyone?" The event, attended by about 75
people, was sponsored by the Women's National Book Association, a nonprofit
professional organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Editors, publishers and agents discussed the difficulties of working in an
industry where minorities still are widely perceived as a small, disinterested
market. They criticized mainstream publishers for failing to hire more ethnic
minorities and questioned whether the industry could adjust to an increasingly
non-white population.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's like a species failing to adapt to the environment. If it doesn't, it
won't survive," said Marcela Landres, an editor of Spanish-language books at
Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
	   Juliana Koo, managing editor of Kaya Press, which specializes in
Asian-American literature, said that commercial publishers and editors were
"lazy" and didn't take the time to learn about different markets.
</P>
<P>
	   And Elyse Cheney, an agent whose clients include rapper and activist Sister
Souljah, said minorities have to "work 10 times as hard."
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a lot of misperceptions," said Cheney, an agent with Sanford J.
Greenburger Associates, Inc. "Publishers think non-whites don't buy books. But
you can have a bestseller without any white people reading the book."
</P>
<P>
	   Landres, the daughter of Ecuadorian immigrants, compared the boardrooms at
major publishers to "purebred cats. ... Everybody's the same. They all go to the
same college."
</P>
<P>
	   She also joked about the low pay, noting that in the Hispanic community it's
considered more prestigious to be a doctor or lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's why Hispanics aren't coming to publishers," she said. "Their parents
won't let them."
</P>
<P>
	   Both Landres and Barron mentioned the success of Terry McMillan, author of
the best-selling novels "Waiting to Exhale" and "Disappearing Acts," as proof
that a market exists for commercial black fiction.
</P>
<P>
	   Landres said she was "desperately seeking a Spanish Terry McMillan" while
Barron said the history of modern publishing could be told in two chapters:
"Before Terry. After Terry."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Barron said McMillan's success had not led to an increase in black
agents and editors and he didn't offer much hope for other minorities. Noting
that a Chinese-American, Ha Jin, had recently won the National Book Award for
fiction, he questioned whether the prize would help other Asian-Americans
authors.
</P>
<P>
	   "How many publishers looked on their shelves and said, 'Is there an Asian
book?' But let the book be from a small, Latvian country and all of a sudden
they'll be publishing Latvians," Barron said.
</P>
<P>
	   Panelist Sandra Guzman, a native of Puerto Rico, was more optimistic about
the future of minorities in publishing. Guzman, an author and editor, remembered
organizing a reading of Hispanic authors at Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a "dreary" Friday night, she said, and the store was expecting about
75 people because "they figured we'd all be out partying."
</P>
<P>
	   More than 300 people showed up.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were pulling every Spanish title they could find off the shelves," she
said. "At the end of the night this woman from the store came up and told me,
'You know what, you sold more books than Henry Kissinger."'

<HEADLINE> Ex-bank exec, husband plead guilty in Russian money-laundering  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Russian bankers whose clients wanted to escape taxes and
erase the trail of their income set up an illegal bank in the United States with
the help of an executive of the Bank of New York, the executive says.
<P>
	   Before U.S. law enforcement authorities shut it down, the four-year
operation had processed more than $7 billion from Russia, including $300,000 in
ransom money for a kidnapping in Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucy Edwards, 41, and Peter Berlin, 46, admitted they arranged one of the
biggest money laundering schemes in U.S. history as they pleaded guilty to
federal charges Wednesday in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   The pleas were the first major admissions of wrongdoing since the
investigation caused an international scandal last August and strained relations
between Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant director of the FBI's New York office, called
the pleas a significant development but said "much remains to be done" in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing side by side, the couple each told a federal judge how they used
Edwards' position as a vice president in the bank's Eastern European division to
help Russian bankers launder the money.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators believe most of the money came from Russian importers trying
to avoid taxes, though they are looking into whether some came from Russian
mobsters. The matter was not directly addressed in court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But a prosecutor mentioned the ransom money, and Edwards said the bankers
she teamed up with in 1995 at the Russian bank DKB had some sinister
connections.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was aware that personnel for DKB were on occasion in fear of their
customers and afraid to leave the bank because they said customers with machine
guns were waiting for them," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also said Russian banking officials were accomplices in the scam.
The administration of former President Boris Yeltsin has called the Bank of New
York allegations a creation by the West to tarnish Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards and Berlin, a Russian businessman, surrendered to the FBI on Tuesday
after flying to New York from London, where they had been living.
</P>
<P>
	   They could face up to 10 years in prison at sentencing on May 3 but could
get lesser sentences by identifying others involved. They also agreed to
surrender more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   T. Barry Kingham, an attorney for Edwards and Berlin, said the couple will
keep cooperating with investigators. "They are anxious to fulfill their
obligations here and resume a normal life," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dressed in black and smiling frequently during the hearing, Edwards
described creating an illegal banking network for Russians - without required
licenses - that was run through accounts at the Bank of New York. The Bank of
New York was not accused of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Money laundering involves moving deposits through a series of accounts to
disguise their illicit source. In this case, Edwards and her husband set up
accounts at Bank of New York and then sifted the money through shell companies
in New York City and Jersey City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank provided the companies with software that was then used by the
Russians to transfer money, cheating the Russian government out of customs
duties and tax revenue, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said she "suspected the accounts were being used by many people for
illicit purposes."
</P>
<P>
	   In exchange, Edwards and her husband were paid $1.8 million, a percentage of
the money being moved, she said. "We were paid substantial commissions for doing
very little work," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   They said they shifted the money to offshore accounts to avoid reporting the
income and paying taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also said that after the couple moved to London in 1996, they paid a
Bank of New York employee, Svetlana Kudryavtsev, $500 a month to make sure the
accounts were operating properly.
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev was indicted last month on perjury charges for allegedly lying
to a federal grand jury about whether she or her husband had ever received money
or loans from Edwards. Kudryavtsev's lawyer has said any money she received was
a product of her friendship with Edwards.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also admitted she used her position at the Bank of New York to help
hundreds of Russians, most of them affiliated with the Russian banking industry,
to enter the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy to commit money
laundering and operating an unlawful banking business. Each will remain free on
$500,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
	   An alleged accomplice in the money transfers, Aleskey Volkov, remains a
fugitive.

<HEADLINE> Both Parties Push Seniors' Concerns  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is rushing to pass legislation allowing Social
Security recipients over age 65 to work and keep all their benefits. Democrats
and Republicans are bickering over Medicare prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   There is little doubt both parties view the elderly vote as crucial to their
electoral success in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The senior vote is the battleground for who gets control of the House,''
said Dan Maffei, spokesman for Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee.
Republicans hold a 222-211 majority in the current House, with two independents
-- one in the Republican orbit, the other aligned with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   The odds appear long that Congress will make progress on the biggest of
senior citizen issues: ensuring the long-term financial solvency of Medicare and
Social Security and giving people new options to invest for retirement. So
lawmakers are focusing on lesser steps that would demonstrate some
accomplishment for voters or provide a campaign issue if compromise is not
possible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everybody knows somebody who can't afford prescription drugs,'' said Rep.
Ronnie Shows, D-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   After languishing for years, bipartisan legislation ending the Social
Security earnings limit is on the fast track in the House, and President Clinton
is promising to sign it into law. The bill would scrap a Depression-era law that
takes away $1 in benefits for every $3 a person age 65-69 earns over $17,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
	   One reason that elimination of the earnings limit has never passed before is
that sponsors of broader Social Security reform wanted to use it as a
``sweetener'' to attract more support for that effort. Now, the bill is expected
to reach the House floor in March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At least we are moving some Social Security reform forward,'' said Rep. E.
Clay Shaw, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   But some lawmakers question this approach -- similar to what House GOP
leaders are doing with a series of tax cuts -- of moving only one popular item
through Congress instead of tackling the larger problem head-on.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It essentially represents an 'eat-dessert-first' approach to reform,''
said Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, who nonetheless supports the bill. ``Congress
should be grappling with the tough choices of how to extend Social Security
solvency.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the Social Security earnings limit bill has a good chance of becoming
law, Republicans and Democrats seem less likely to settle on a Medicare
prescription drug benefit. Republicans believe Democrats will oppose any
compromise, preferring to use costly prescription drugs as a potent political
issue.
</P>
<P>
	   But House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said Wednesday that the ``health of
Americans is more important than politics'' and accused GOP leaders of using the
election as an excuse for no action.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Instead of just looking toward our own campaigns, we need a campaign for
seniors' health care,'' the Missouri Democrat said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic leaders on Wednesday began trying to force House consideration of
two bills intended to lower the costs of prescription drugs through group
purchasing power and to add an outpatient drug benefit for the 39 million people
who now receive Medicare. Democrats would have to get 218 signatures on
petitions to get the bills to the House floor.
</P>
<P>
	   But the bills are opposed by some Democrats and most Republicans, as well as
by a coalition led by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America
-- the lobbying group responsible for the television ad campaign featuring
``Flo,'' the bowler who urges a bipartisan solution. Critics say the Democratic
bills amount to government-imposed price controls and a costly burden on the
already-faltering Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has asked the Commerce and Ways and
Means committees to work on a solution, but the GOP is divided on whether to
hold out for broader Medicare reform or concentrate on the prescription drug
issue alone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're working on it. We haven't made that decision yet,'' Hastert said in
an interview. ``We want to find the best way to do it. I'd prefer that we have a
bipartisan effort.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans say any prescription drug measure should avoid putting Medicare
in further financial jeopardy, be targeted to help the neediest senior citizens
and avoid putting the government in charge. But Democrats say such restrictions
could make the bill meaningless.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be so focused, and so surgical, that it doesn't help many people
at all,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE -- The Medicare bills are H.R. 664 and H.R. 1495. The Social
Security earnings limit elimination bill is H.R. 5.

<HEADLINE> Privacy Rules for Patients Debated  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Judi Selig mentioned to a co-worker that she had
been exposed to hepatitis years ago, her company demanded that she get a blood
test and sign a release that would let a doctor in the employer's health plan
access her medical records.
</P>
<P>
	   Selig, a secretary who worked for a South Carolina machinery firm in 1997,
took the test but refused to sign the release to protect her privacy. She said
the company suspended her for a week without pay as punishment. She eventually
found another job and quit the company.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had no objection to them knowing that I passed the test, but don't keep
handing me a piece of paper saying I have to give you my medical records,'' said
Selig, 48.
</P>
<P>
	   Proposed federal rules aimed at protecting the privacy of medical records
are murky about whether employers can access workers' files, prompting privacy
and physicians' groups to call for tougher regulations that include, among other
things, a requirement that health plans, insurers and employers get a patient's
permission before disclosing medical information.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are worried that their records will be used against them,'' said
Peter Kane, executive director of the National Coalition for Patients Rights,
which advocates more confidentiality in health care.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Health and Human Services, which wrote the proposed
regulations, has received thousands of comments from consumers and interest
groups about the rules, the subject of a congressional hearing scheduled for
today.
</P>
<P>
	   The rules call for insurers to notify patients about how their information
is used but allows them to use medical records without authorization as long as
it's for treatment, payment or operational purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   HHS officials said their aim was for patients to receive better information
about how records are used than they are probably getting now. Most patients
have to sign a broad consent form as a condition of treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed regulations were created to fill what privacy advocates say is
a disturbing void: There is no federal law protecting the confidentiality of
medical records. Anyone -- financial institutions, direct marketing firms,
employers, lawyers -- can use medical records, if they can get them, without
patients' knowledge or consent.
</P>
<P>
	   But the privacy groups say the proposed regulations, which apply to
electronic, not paper, records, are too broad and provide little protection of
privacy. They believe that if people are concerned that their medical
information could be disclosed, they won't be open with their doctors, which
could hurt their medical care.
</P>
<P>
	   HHS wrote the rules after Congress failed to meet a self-imposed deadline in
August to adopt legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   The rules require health organizations to get patients' written permission
to release information that would be used for something other than treatment,
payment or operational purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   Any information they did release would have to be the minimum necessary --
not the patient's entire file. Patients would have the right see and copy their
medical records and request corrections of any errors.
</P>
<P>
	   The rules don't protect patient information from being accessed by
employers, but a company's health plan division would be prohibited from giving
medical information to supervisors or others in the company.
</P>
<P>
	   A violation of the rules carries a $100 penalty, but individuals caught
intentionally releasing or selling information face heavier fines and jail
sentences.
</P>
<P>
	   While privacy groups say the regulations are weak, HMOs and insurers contend
that they go too far and say they could interfere with sending patients checkup
reminders or information about treatments.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the American Association of Health Plans, which represents HMOs
and other network plans, want the regulations to make clear that information
could be used, without authorization, for disease management and health
promotion programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want the terms to encompass all of the efforts that we do now,'' such
as sending individuals who are at risk for certain diseases special notices,
said Kristin Stewart, director of private market issues at AAHP.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition for patient rights contends that marketing companies could get
access to patient information under the guise of disease management programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The fate of the regulations is ultimately in Congress' hands. If it decides
that the regulations are unworkable, lawmakers could draft legislation. A law
would carry more weight, and interest groups and HHS have said they would prefer
that Congress write a law.

<HEADLINE> Standards Fall in S. Carolina Race  </HEADLINE>
   By LEIGH STROPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- If negative campaigning consists of two Republican
presidential candidates sniping and swiping and pointing fingers over who is
more unpleasant, then politics South Carolina-style must resemble the World
Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain compares Gov. George W. Bush to President Clinton --
considered the ultimate insult among Republicans. Bush suggests McCain is more
like Clinton. Each accuses the other of distorting positions on taxes and Social
Security and breaking promises.
</P>
<P>
	   But this is the state where, in 1998, a U.S. senator told an opponent who
called for a courteous campaign to ``kiss my fanny.'' That same year, the
campaign for governor was inundated with cash from gambling interests as charges
flew about who was beholden to the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This presidential primary looks like a kindergarten show,'' said Clemson
University political scientist Dave Woodard, a Republican consultant. ``They're
talking about the fact that they've really gone negative -- and they're talking
about economic plans.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an abrupt change of strategy last week, McCain pulled ads critical of
Bush after advisers determined they were hurting his image as a reformer. McCain
urged Bush to do the same. He refused, saying the Arizona senator's suggestion
was a ``bait-and-switch trick.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite all of the talk about taking the high road, both men bickered
through a debate Tuesday, which prompted Alan Keyes -- who sat between them --
to remark on their ``pointless squabbling.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush complained about a McCain ad comparing him to Clinton. McCain
complained about a Bush supporter who accused him of abandoning veterans. Bush
said McCain's tax plan represented the Washington mentality. McCain shot back
that his plan was ``the grown-up mentality.''
</P>
<P>
	   All this in happening in a state where two years ago Sen. Ernest ``Fritz''
Hollings, D-S.C., told then-Rep. Bob Inglis where to stick his idea of a
courteous campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He finesses all around,'' Hollings said. ``He is Jack be nimble, Jack be
quick. He's all around the damn clock, so oozing and goozing and such a nice
little choirboy and so pleasant, and everybody's rude, and he wants to be
courteous. He is a ... damn skunk. I can tell you that right now.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hollings was re-elected to his seventh term.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor's race wasn't much nicer. Incumbent Republican David Beasley
accused Democratic challenger Jim Hodges of being a tool of gambling interests
and organized crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Those gambling interests, angry that Beasley wanted to ban video poker,
showered Democrats with cash and mounted their own campaign against the
governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Beasley lost his bid for a second term.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Legislature has battled bitterly for years about whether to remove
the Confederate flag from atop Statehouse. One state senator recently called the
NAACP, which is pushing a tourism boycott of the state until the flag comes
down, ``the National Association for Retarded people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Back in 1978, a congressional campaign turned ugly when a third-party
candidate criticized Democrat Max Heller, an Austrian-born Jew, for not
believing in Jesus Christ. Voters also were asked in a poll paid for by former
Gov. Carroll Campbell, who was running for the seat, to choose from six
characteristics that best described the men. Among them, ``a Jewish immigrant''
and ``a native South Carolinian.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is nothing,'' Lucinda Stephens, a Mount Pleasant teacher, said of the
presidential politics. ``We've seen some real mudslinging.''
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, Bush and McCain called each other friend. They shook hands
in Michigan, promising they would not run negative ads.
</P>
<P>
	   But that was all before Bush's big loss to McCain in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing into Bush's newly aggressive strategy is probably the realization
that ``going negative'' in South Carolina isn't necessarily a bad thing, Woodard
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, South Carolinians like a good fight for their votes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't like wallflowers,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a McCain
supporter. ``We want people to defend their positions, to go at it, boys.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Optimistic in South Carolina  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FLORENCE, S.C. (AP) -- Despite spending more money than he had hoped to and
watching Sen. John McCain pick up endorsements from his former supporters, Gov.
George W. Bush is exuding confidence as he heads toward Saturday's pivotal South
Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You see, it's the beginning of the end of the Clinton era in Washington,''
the Republican presidential front-runner said Wednesday night in a warmly
received speech before about 3,500 people at the University of South Carolina at
Aiken.
</P>
<P>
	   But looking down the road to replacing President Clinton may be premature.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to the Texas governor acknowledged his campaign had burned through $50
million of its unprecedented $70 million campaign kitty by the end of January.
Since Bush's loss to the Arizona senator Feb. 1 in New Hampshire, the campaign
has been spending more than $3 million per week.
</P>
<P>
	   He had $20 million remaining as of Jan. 31 -- double the amount in McCain's
warchest. But McCain's campaign said it was trying to close the money gap and
was raising $150,000 to $200,000 every day through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Bush watched as the former governor of Washington state,
the highest elected Republican officeholder in California and former
presidential rival Gary Bauer all jumped on McCain's bandwagon. Another backer
said he was rethinking his support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   -- In Washington state, former Gov. Dan Evans said he switched from Bush to
McCain, a former Senate colleague, because of negative attacks from Bush's camp
and McCain's ``courageous fire.''
</P>
<P>
	   -- In California, Secretary of State Bill Jones said he switched because
some South Carolina Republicans were sending the message that ``your vote
doesn't count as an independent or crossover unless you vote for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
	   -- In South Carolina, Bauer, who quit the race two weeks ago, endorsed
McCain at a rally at Furman University, saying he was the GOP's ``best shot'' at
winning the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also was dealt a blow by Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who said he was
``reconsidering my support'' because of Bush's appearance at Bob Jones
University. The school bans interracial dating and its leadership has harshly
criticized the Catholic church, actions that King said were hard to defend and
made Bush seem ``almost blind to Catholic sensibilities.''
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing the switch by Jones, Bush said: ``If he's interested in being on
the team that's going to win the Republican nomination, he made the wrong
decision.''
</P>
<P>
	   The candidate, and some staffers, expressed a stay-the-course optimism.
Aides were planning a series of fund-raisers next month to replenish their
campaign coffers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush himself said: ``I know we're on plan. We've got a strategy that's
working. But my intense focus is on turning out a vote here in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who has sworn off negative ads, began airing a campaign-closing TV
spot designed to convince Republicans here that he can defeat both Bush and the
Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   The upbeat ad features adoring crowds, patriotic images and a voiceover
calling McCain ``a Republican like Ronald Reagan who can win.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, whose campaign has grown increasingly aggressive, began a new ad
accusing McCain of unfounded negative attacks and waffling on public financing
of congressional elections, which both candidates say they oppose.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain rolled through inland South Carolina from town meeting to town
meeting, beaming confidence and arguing that he'll press ahead regardless of the
outcome Saturday. He said ``the polls show us in the margin of error'' and he
hoped for a backlash against Bush's negative ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Trammell of Greenville, where McCain went for a book signing event, said
the campaigning had prompted him to change from Bush to McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was a Bush supporter until a couple of weeks ago, but I got turned off
by all the negative campaigning,'' he said. ``I'm impressed by McCain's
character.''

<HEADLINE> House Bill Helps Small Businesses  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has voted to protect small businesses from
crippling lawsuits, but like other product liability bills approved in the past
it faces an uncertain future in the Senate and a promised presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting mainly along party lines, the House on Wednesday approved a bill,
221-193, under which small businesses would have to pay no more than $250,000 in
punitive damages, or three times compensatory damages, whichever is less, in
most civil lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Exceptions are made to the cap when the defendant purposely tries to cause
harm or the misconduct involves such acts as violent crime, terrorism or civil
rights violations.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill also exempts small businesses from joint and several liability,
where one defendant only partially liable for non-economic damages such as pain
and suffering can end up paying all damages. And all retailers, big and small,
are free from legal responsibility for defective goods they receive from
manufacturers but do not alter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For too long, America's small businesses have lived under a cloud of
fear'' of frivolous lawsuits, said Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif. the bill's chief
sponsor. He cited a survey finding that 20 percent of small businesses decide
against expanding services or hiring new employees out of fear of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need this kind of national standard to return the courts to being
agents of justice instead of lotteries for trial lawyers looking to hit the
jackpot,'' said Mike Baroody, senior vice president at the National Association
of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   Rogan's bill focused on small businesses in hopes of avoiding the fierce
opposition that broader product liability bills have faced from trial lawyers
and consumer groups, two key Democratic constituencies. President Clinton in
1996 vetoed a major product liability bill crafted as part of the GOP ``Contract
with America.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the White House, in a statement, said Clinton's senior advisers would
recommend a veto because, despite the narrow scope suggested in its title, it
would bring about sweeping changes to state laws and ``strand a large number of
injured plaintiffs.''
</P>
<P>
	   It said the limits on joint and several liability would ``fall most harshly
on the poor, the elderly and children -- those persons likely to suffer less
economic harm and more non-economic harm from the wrongful conduct of others.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before getting to the president's desk the bill must still win passage in
the Senate, where Democrats have been more successful in blocking changes to
liability law.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary
Committee, also faulted the bill for defining a small business only by number of
employees, not revenue. Some companies with fewer than 25 employees do hundreds
of millions or billions of dollars in business, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Conyers amendment that would have confined the bill to businesses making
less than $5 million annually and applying product liability protections to only
small business retailers was defeated, 237-178.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., also argued that the legislation would protect
some gunmakers, including the makers of the guns used in the Columbine high
school shootings, from lawsuits. Rogan said his bill would do nothing to stop a
claimant from seeking economic damages -- or non-economic damages if there is an
intentional wrong -- from a gun manufacturer.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 3 Die in Calif. Cargo Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HOWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif. (AP) -- A DC-8 cargo plane crashed into an automobile
wrecking yard while trying to make an emergency landing Wednesday, bursting into
flames and killing the three crew members aboard the aircraft, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Those on board the Emery Worldwide plane were dead by the time fire crews
arrived at the site about 1 mile east of Mather Field, said fire Capt. Dan
Haverty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no chance of rescue,'' Haverty said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane carried three crew members: the pilot, first captain and a flight
engineer, all believed to be Emery employees, said company spokesman James
Allen.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilot reported unsecured cargo shortly after the plane took off, Haverty
said. The plane's manifest listed clothing, automatic transmission fluid and a
small amount of unknown detonating devices, he said. The airline said the
devices were 0.009 kilograms of fuses used to activate automobile air bags.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash set as many as 200 cars on fire and caused explosions over a
200-yard-long area.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 17 had taken off at 7:50 p.m., bound for Dayton, Ohio, and the pilot
immediately called back to the airfield's departure control and told them he had
a severe problem with balance of the aircraft, said Jim Whitehead, manager of
the Federal Aviation Administration's regional operations center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane hit the ground ``in a ball of fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Motorist Ernie Killinger said the plane hit belly-first.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like he was crash-landing,'' said Killinger, who was on his way
home. ``I saw the front half of the fuselage come out of the flames and the
cockpit was straight up and it just rocked back and forth until it was engulfed
by the flames.''
</P>
<P>
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries on the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   FAA investigators, a bomb squad and a hazardous materials team were among
those on the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   The McDonnell Douglas DC-8 has two engines mounted on each wing. The model
went into service in 1959 and production ended in 1972.
</P>
<P>
	   Mather Field was once known as Mather Air Force Base, which was closed as a
military operation in 1993. Since then, it has become a civilian airport and the
region's air cargo hub. It is located about 10 miles east of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
	   Emery, based in Redwood City, specializes in transportation services for
business shippers of heavyweight cargo, the company says on its Web site. The
$2.4-billion company is a subsidiary of CNF Inc., a $5.6-billion diversified
transportation company based in Palo Alto, the site states.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Looks to India, Pakistan Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is leaving the door open -- slightly --
to making a visit to Pakistan and offering to help mediate the volatile Kashmir
dispute Pakistan has with India.
</P>
<P>
	   Since India never has accepted outside intervention, the president's offer
at a news conference Wednesday to intercede as he has in the Arab-Israeli
dispute and in Northern Ireland is probably academic.
</P>
<P>
	   But asked whether he would be willing, Clinton responded, ``absolutely, I
would,'' and then said ``unless we are asked by both parties to help, we can't
get involved.''
</P>
<P>
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over disputed Kashmir. Their
simmering dispute over the part of the Himalayan state controlled by India is
considered even more dangerous now that they both have exploded nuclear devices.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton intends to visit India, the world's largest democracy, and also
Bangladesh in March, but has made no decision on Pakistan. This week, Sandy
Berger, his assistant for national security affairs, met with several experts on
the region at the White House to discuss the pros and cons of a presidential
visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he would base his decision on what would best serve U.S.
interests in trying to stop ``a nuclear arms race.''
</P>
<P>
	   There is a precedent for going to India and not to Pakistan. President
Carter did that in 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   The fact that Pakistan is under military rule and is suspected of supporting
terrorist groups that attack Hindus in Kashmir weighs against a presidential
visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan sent a cabinet minister, Omar Asghar Khan, here this week to try to
neutralize U.S. concerns about terrorism and anti-democratic trends.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's military ruler, urged Clinton earlier this
month not to bypass his country, saying a visit would go a long way toward
easing tensions with India.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said Wednesday that ``it would be the wrong
signal to send.''
</P>
<P>
	   At a House International Relations Committee hearing, Gejdenson criticized
Musharraf for undercutting the country's court system and for preparing to try
former President Nowaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously, many of us in Congress have felt tremendous frustration, first
with the coup, second, now, with the assault on the judiciary, the connection,
at least, with some elements of terrorists and obviously the connection with the
Taliban,'' Gejdenson told Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who was
testifying. The Taliban that controls most of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright told the committee, however, that ``we have to remember the very
important relationship that we have had with Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said it had been interrupted, and that the Clinton administration
consistently had urged Musharraf ``to move in terms of some measurable
milestones of a return to civilian government.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are watching that very carefully -- how he reforms the electoral
commission on the parties and holds local elections,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors seek lesser-charge options for Diallo jury  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Jurors in the trial of four police officers accused
of murdering an unarmed Bronx man in a hail of 41 bullets could have the option
to convict the defendants on less serious charges.
<P>
	   With testimony in the Amadou Diallo case completed after just nine days,
prosecutors asked the judge to allow the jury to consider manslaughter and
criminally negligent homicide in addition to the original second-degree murder
charges. The defense did not object.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi reserved decision on the request, which
came moments after the defense rested. The judge denied a defense motion to
throw out the murder charges. He then adjourned the trial until Tuesday, when
the jury will hear closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, Richard Murphy, 27, Sean Carroll, 37, and Edward McMellon,
27, have pleaded innocent to charges of intentional murder, depraved
indifference murder and reckless endangerment. If convicted of murder, they face
a maximum sentences of 25 years to life.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors refused to say why they sought to include the lesser charges.
</P>
<P>
	   But both sides appeared to be hedging their bets - the prosecution against a
complete exoneration of defendants in a high-profile case, the defense against
the specter of harsh prison terms for their clients. Second-degree murder
carries a minimum 15-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Privately, defense attorneys said their clients had given them permission to
acquiesce to a lesser charge motion long before the defense case was over. But
Stephen Worth, McMellon's attorney, insisted to reporters that despite the
decision, the officers expected to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't concede for a moment that it's anything but not guilty," Worth
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, the officers testified they fired 41 bullets at Diallo on
Feb. 4, 1999 because the unarmed Guinean immigrant refused to stop for
questioning, retreated to his Bronx building and pulled out what appeared to be
a gun; he was hit 19 times. The object Diallo pulled turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution contends the officers never yelled any warnings before
cornering Diallo and opening fire. Backed by autopsy findings, prosecutors also
say most of the bullets hit Diallo while he was going down or flat on his back.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting of an unarmed black man by four white officers resulted in
enough pretrial publicity and protests alleging widespread police abuse of
minorities that an appeals court decided to move the case to Albany. Before the
change of venue, attorneys had predicted the trial would last at least six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Teresi's ruling upholding the murder charges, the defense argued they
were too severe. Attorney Bennett Epstein claimed the case marked the first time
in state history a depraved indifference charge had been brought against "police
officers, public servants, on duty on the streets of New York risking their
lives, who made a mistake."
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Eric Warner countered that the fact Diallo had been trapped and
killed by a "wall of lead" would "more than suggest depraved indifference to
human life."
</P>
<P>
	   With the prosecution request, the jury could face a much more complex set of
decisions about the conduct of each officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The alternatives to the intentional murder charge would be first-degree
manslaughter - intent to cause injury resulting in death - which carries a
maximum sentence of 12 1/2 to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
	   For depraved indifference, options would be second-degree manslaughter -
recklessly causing death - which carries a maximum sentence of 5 to 15 years, or
criminally negligent homicide - failing to perceive the risk of death - which
carries a maximum of 1 1/3 to 4 years.
</P>
<P>
	   A conviction on the murder charges or the first-degree manslaughter charge
would guarantee some jail time for the officers. The lesser charges allow for
probation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Africa Policy Scrutinized  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two years ago, President Clinton sat in a conference room
in Uganda, chatting with a cluster of leaders from countries he hailed as
symbols of Africa's future.
</P>
<P>
	   But at this moment, most of those countries are mired in conflict, either
with their neighbors or within their borders -- even though Clinton has devoted
millions of dollars in his budget proposals to resolving African disputes.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Clinton was to address concerns by critics and supporters alike that
these problems indicate his Africa policy has gone awry.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech before the National Summit on Africa, the president was
defending his Africa policy since that historic 1998 visit, on peacekeeping,
conflict resolution and economic revitalization.
</P>
<P>
	   The summit, funded by the Carnegie Foundation, Ford Foundation, businesses
and others, has been in the making since late 1996. Summit organizers want to
unify and strengthen the lobby for Africa in America, improve Africa's image in
the states, and change U.S. policy toward Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   Regardless of what Clinton was saying today, some critics believe there is
little that can be done to fix his Africa policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The record actually is disastrous,'' said American University economics
professor George Ayittey. ``Some of us want this administration to stop playing
political football with Africa. The solutions to Africa's problems can't be
micromanaged from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ambitious trade bill that Clinton promoted during his visit emerged from
the Senate weaker than he hoped. It requires, among other things, that imported
African fabrics be duty-free only if they are made of American thread.
</P>
<P>
	   His calls for debt relief have gone largely unanswered by European allies.
Also, his own pledge to forgive $500 million of African debt can hardly make a
dent in the billions owed.
</P>
<P>
	   In his budget proposals over the past two years, Clinton has devoted more
than $100 million to assisting the peacekeeping effort known as ECOMOG, or the
Economic Community of West African States. He also has earmarked $120 million a
year to building institutions that promote democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Ayittey cited some successes in conflict resolution, in Liberia and Sierra
Leone, but said those are eclipsed by the flare-ups between some nations Clinton
embraced, such as Eritrea, Congo, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Congo, U.N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke appealed Tuesday to Congress
for support of a new force of peacekeepers -- without U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Ayittey said there have been setbacks to democratic rule throughout Africa,
and blamed a policy that is too focused on leaders, rather than the people who
select them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only bright spot the administration can claim is Nigeria,'' Ayittey
said. ``But then, the democratization process in Nigeria is iffy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation and a major supplier of U.S. oil, is
a linchpin in Clinton's policy, the hope being that it can help radiate
stability to the nations around it. On Wednesday, the Clinton administration
signed a trade agreement with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
	   But the larger trade package, for Africa and the Caribbean Basin, is still
awaiting final passage in Congress, even though Clinton had hoped for passage
before the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
	   These are the type of halting, incremental steps that have marked Clinton's
approach to Africa since he returned from his 1998 tour, the most extensive of
any sitting U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My dream for this trip is that together we might do the things so that 100
years from now, your grandchildren and mine will look back and say, 'This is the
beginning of a new African renaissance,''' Clinton said upon arrival in Accra,
Ghana, on March 23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   During the trip, Clinton apologized for the slow U.S. response to the 1994
genocide in Rwanda, and promised ``never again'' would it be that way.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mel Foote, head of the advocacy group Constituency for Africa, said the
conflict in Sierra Leone drew a similar response ``at the same time we're
pouring billions into Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He showed us he cared about Africa. He doesn't have a lot of people in his
administration who can do the follow-up,'' Foote said. ``The biggest thing he
achieved was goodwill.''
</P>
<P>
	   This week, Clinton's envoy on war crimes is traveling to Tanzania to review
an international tribunal's progress on Rwandan genocide cases. Later, the
envoy, David Scheffer, was to stop in Sierra Leone to talk with rebel leaders
about atrocities there.

Internet Racism Concerns U.N.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   GENEVA (AP) -- The United States could do more to curb the use of the
Internet for racist material while upholding freedom of speech, experts said
Wednesday at a U.N. meeting. Speakers noted the legal challenges of controlling
Internet content in, and originating from, the United States, where the First
Amendment of the constitution guarantees freedom of speech. Although the U.S.
government cannot ban racist speech outright, it could impose "reasonable
restrictions," such as requiring a permit that would force publishers to
identify the content of their sites, Swiss-based information technology law
expert David Rosenthal argued.

said. With the upsurge in violence, more reinforcements were needed, and not
just in Kosovska Mitrovica, but throughout the province of Kosovo, U.N.
Assistant Secretary-General Hedi Annabi told the Security Council on Wednesday
at the United Nations. A rocket attack on a U.N. bus which killed two Serb

<P>
    ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Fredrik Olausson tied it with a late power-play and
Oleg Tverdovsky won it in overtime as the Anaheim Mighty Ducks beat Calgary 6-5
Wednesday night, extending the Flames' winless streak to 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Rucchin had two goals and an assist for the Ducks and Paul Kariya had
a goal and four assists. Kevin Haller ended a 41-game goal drought and Teemu
Selanne extended his point-scoring streak to 12 games with a pair of assists,
including his 700th NHL point.
</P>
<P>
	   Selanne, from Finland, reached the milestone in his 541st game and became
the third-fastest European-born player to get 700 points. Only Peter Stastny and
Jari Kurri accomplished the feat in fewer games.
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Weimer scored twice for the Flames, who lost for the fifth straight
time and eighth consecutive on the road despite rallying three times. Calgary
has lost four games in overtime during their winless streak after setting a
single-season mark with 10 victories in the extra session.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarke Wilm, Robyn Regehr and Jarome Iginla also scored for the Flames,
0-9-1 since winning Jan. 24 at Boston. The Flames are one away from tying the
franchise's longest unbeaten streak, set in 1985-86.
</P>
<P>
	   Olausson got the equalizer with six minutes left on a one-timer from 55 feet
that went through the skates of Calgary right wing Martin St. Louis and snuck
between Fred Brathwaite's pads.
</P>
<P>
	   Tverdovsky veered around defenseman Darryl Shannon and faked Brathwaite to
the ice before scoring his eighth goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Rucchin gave Anaheim a 4-3 lead with his second goal of the game and 13th
overall, tipping in Olausson's shot from the right point. The Ducks have a
power-play goal in nine straight games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Flames tied it for the third time just 33 seconds into the third. Weimer
got a pass in the left circle from Shannon and took a high wrist shot that
deflected off Guy Hebert's glove and over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   Weimer then got his seventh goal from in front on a pass from Marc Savard
while Pavel Trnka was serving a tripping penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   Kariya put the Ducks ahead 3-2 at 10:15 of the second, converting Selanne's
pass from behind the net for his 35th goal.
</P>
<P>
	   But Iginla tied it 3-3 and extended his point-scoring streak to a
career-best eight games with his 16th goal at 17:02 of the second.
</P>
<P>
	   Regehr made it 2-2 at 5:04 of the second with a slap shot from the right
point.

District Court, blamed the decision to keep the group from marching before the
official St. Patrick's Day Parade on a "backroom political process."
</P>
<P>
	   But a city attorney, comparing ILGO to party crashers, argued that the
Giuliani administration violated no one's rights by refusing to grant the
demonstrators a permit to march.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the lawsuit, the city violated ILGO's First Amendment rights to
free speech by refusing to allow it a permit to march up Fifth Avenue
immediately prior to the nation's oldest and largest St. Patrick's Day Parade.
The city did so in 1996, 1997 and 1998, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
	   If a federal jury agrees, ILGO could receive financial damages and U.S.
District Court Judge John G. Koeltl could issue a ruling allowing them to march
before this year's parade.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawyers swapped charges in closing arguments after a three-week trial,
the end result of the 1996 lawsuit filed against the city by ILGO.
</P>
<P>
	   The court battle over the group's inclusion at the parade has become an
annual event since ILGO first surfaced in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   City attorney Virginia Waters said the city's decision was not tied to
ILGO's politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, she cited a 1993 court order barring ILGO from marching in the main
parade; traffic and other problems caused by granting a permit; and the city's
offer to let ILGO march somewhere off Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
	   "ILGO claims it is flexible, as long as it can march where it wants and when
it wants," said Waters, comparing the group to "an uninvited guest" at a party.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ancient Order of Hibernians, which oversees the parade, predictably
agreed with the city. They had successfully argued that ILGO could be banned
because the parade was a private, not public, event.
</P>
<P>
	   "When it's a private parade," said Ernest Mathews, attorney for the
Hibernians, "the government can't tell you who can march or what your message
must be."
</P>
<P>
	   But ILGO attorney Diane Knox said the city's excuses were "smoke. There's no
good reason why ILGO can't have a march of 2,000 people. There's no reason at
all."

<HEADLINE> Missile-Defense Deadline Approaches  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Meeting President Clinton's timetable for a summer
decision on whether to deploy a limited national missile defense system will be
tough but attainable, suggests the Air Force general who oversees the program.
</P>
<P>
	   But Lt. Gen. Ronald T. Kadish said that any further test failures, like the
one in January, could significantly set back the program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a difficult program with high visibility,'' he told two House Armed
Services subcommittees on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He conceded there was heavy political pressure for a decision, but said he
did not feel it constituted ``undue pressure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kadish's testimony came after the Defense Department's senior weapons
tester, Philip E. Coyle, suggested earlier this week that the Pentagon was
facing undue pressure to meet the administration's timetable for a decision on
deploying such a system.
</P>
<P>
	   For now, Defense Secretary William Cohen plans to review the readiness of
the missile defense project in June. On the basis of that review, Cohen is to
recommend to the president whether to move ahead with deployment.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report to Congress and Cohen, Coyle wrote that the current timetable
ignored major technological problems with the program, particularly in light of
a test failure in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Kadish, director of the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization,
told lawmakers he thought the current timetable could be met.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, he said, ``If we have a failure, we may not meet that
schedule on time. We have a very aggressive schedule that we're meeting. I won't
promise that we won't have problems along the way.''
</P>
<P>
	   As envisioned by the Pentagon, the system would use a network of radars and
silo-based interceptor missiles to detect, track and shoot down long-range
ballistic missiles outside Earth's atmosphere. Congress has required the
administration to deploy such a system as soon as technology allows.
</P>
<P>
	   So far two tests have been staged of the system's ability to intercept a
target missile in space. The first, last fall, succeeded. The second, in
January, failed.
</P>
<P>
	   The next test, scheduled for April before the January failure, has now been
rescheduled for May, Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
	   It must be successful for the president's timetable to be met, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kadish said the January failure is still being investigated, but appears to
have been due to either a leak or a constriction in a pipe that cools infrared
sensors. ``We believe it can be fixed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee
on research and development, said it was important for the administration to
move ahead as quickly as feasible on the system to shoot enemy warheads out of
the sky.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've already passed the threat threshold,'' Weldon said, citing ballistic
missile programs by North Korea, Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans in Congress have long pressed for development of such a system,
a smaller-scaled version of the missile defense shield envisioned by Ronald
Reagan in the 1980s and derided by critics as ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Norman Sisisky, D-Va., argued that the timetable shouldn't be
forced. ``This is rocket science,'' he said. ``Technology, not politics, should
rule.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Die in Calif. Cargo Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HOWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif. (AP) -- A DC-8 cargo plane crashed into an automobile
wrecking yard while trying to make an emergency landing Wednesday, bursting into
flames and killing the three people aboard the aircraft, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
	   Emery Worldwide Flight 17 took off at 7:35 p.m., bound for Dayton, Ohio,
from Mather Field when the pilot immediately reported trouble, said company
spokesman James Allen.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane turned around and crashed about 1 mile east of Mather, he said.
Those on board were dead by the time fire crews arrived, said fire Capt. Dan
Haverty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no chance of rescue,'' Haverty said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane carried three crew members: the pilot, first captain and a flight
engineer, all believed to be Emery employees, said Allen.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilot reported unsecured cargo shortly after takeoff, Haverty said. The
plane carried clothing, automatic transmission fluid and a small amount of fuses
-- 9 grams, or about a third of an ounce -- used to activate automobile air
bags, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Whitehead, manager of the Federal Aviation Administration's regional
operations center in Los Angeles, said the pilot reported a severe problem with
the balance of the aircraft. The plane hit the ground ``in a ball of fire,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane crashed into the Insurance Auto Auctions salvage yard, setting as
many as 200 cars on fire and causing explosions over a 200-yard-long area.
</P>
<P>
	   Motorist Ernie Killinger watched the plane strike belly-first.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like he was crash-landing,'' said Killinger, who was driving home
at the time. ``I saw the front half of the fuselage come out of the flames and
the cockpit was straight up and it just rocked back and forth until it was
engulfed by the flames.''
</P>
<P>
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries on the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   FAA investigators, a bomb squad and a hazardous materials team were among
those on the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   The McDonnell Douglas DC-8 has two engines mounted on each wing. The model
went into service in 1959 and production ended in 1972.
</P>
<P>
	   Mather Field was once Mather Air Force Base, which was closed as a military
operation in 1993. Since then, it has become a civilian airport and the region's
air cargo hub. It is located about 10 miles east of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
	   Emery, based in Redwood City, specializes in transportation services for
business shippers of heavyweight cargo, the company says on its Web site. The
$2.4-billion company is a subsidiary of CNF Inc., a $5.6-billion diversified
transportation company based in Palo Alto, the site states.

<HEADLINE> Air Power Impacts Colombia Rebels  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP) -- As swarms of guerrillas rushed the tiny police
post and officers inside radioed frantically for help, a pilot high in the skies
flicked on his night-vision equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Staring into the glow of an infrared screen, the air force captain uttered a
prayer and then rained .60-caliber bullets on Colombia's southern savannah.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I said God, my protector, help me. And then I fired'', recalled Arturo,
the man who was flying the Vietnam-era AC-47 gunship, a plane Colombian
guerrillas have nicknamed ``The Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
	   The attack in July was part of a Colombian military resurgence that
observers credit at least partly to improved night capabilities, communications
and intelligence-sharing provided by the United States since President Andres
Pastrana took office 19 months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The government's air advantage would grow enormously if the U.S. Congress
approves a $1.6 billion anti-narcotics plan the Clinton administration has
proposed for the South American nation that could come to a vote as early as
March.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack that Arturo described killed about a dozen guerrillas in Puerto
Rico, one of the towns attacked during a leftist offensive. The military
reported 300 rebels killed during the campaign -- mostly from the air.
</P>
<P>
	   The heaviest guerrilla losses in nearly four decades of conflict were also a
stunning reversal for a military that had been repeatedly humiliated in ground
combat on the rebels' jungle turf.
</P>
<P>
	   Government planes and helicopters had similar success in clashes that
followed -- cutting down insurgents crossing fields, blowing up guerrilla
convoys on highways, and even blasting rebel riverboats out of Amazonian
tributaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The air force is a very powerful weapon, with great capacity for
destruction,'' boasted its commander, Gen. Hector Velasco. ``We've used only a
minimal portion of what we have.''
</P>
<P>
	   Military analysts believe air power could be crucial to turning the tide in
Colombia's long-running civil conflict -- a factor that might discourage the
large-scale attacks that rebels began mounting successfully in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   The new U.S. plan before Congress includes 30 Black Hawk and 33 Huey
helicopters, an RG-8A reconnaissance plane, air base and radar enhancements and
further upgrades to add night-vision systems to aging planes.
</P>
<P>
	   The helicopters would escort unarmed planes that fumigate drug crops and
ferry troops from two new U.S.-trained army battalions into guerrilla-infested
jungles.
</P>
<P>
	   The aid is earmarked for use against drug traffickers or rebels from the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, who protect the drug
operations. But U.S. officials admit it won't be easy to prevent Colombia from
using its new planes and helicopters in standard counterinsurgency operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Velasco said aircraft donated or sold with Pentagon approval for
counternarcotics purposes have also been used effectively against the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to 18 U.S.-built Black Hawks, Velasco said the air force has
sent into combat A-37 ``Dragonflies'' and OV-10 ``Broncos'' -- Vietnam-era
tactical fighters acquired principally for downing drug-smuggling planes.
</P>
<P>
	   During Pastrana's tenure, the Pentagon has trained pilots to fly in the dark
and outfitted some of these aircraft with night-vision goggles and
Forward-Looking Infrared sensors that can detect a rebel's head from several
thousand feet aloft.
</P>
<P>
	   After the air force spent much of its ammunition beating back last year's
FARC offensive, the U.S. military replaced the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   While U.S. officials say Americans are only training Colombian troops and
pilots, some Democratic lawmakers in Washington have expressed concern U.S.
soldiers could be drawn into combat.
</P>
<P>
	   Those fears grew last year when a U.S. Army reconnaissance plane crashed
over rebel territory, killing five Americans who the Pentagon said were on a
routine counterdrug mission. U.S. reconnaissance planes still regularly fly over
Colombia, the military says. None are known to have been shot at by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and Colombian military officials are watching closely to see whether
the FARC will try to neutralize the aerial threat with surface-to-air missiles
-- so far absent in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Velasco said the FARC has offered its fighters $2,500 for every military
pilot they assassinate -- which explains why Arturo, the AC-47 pilot, asked that
his last name not be published.
</P>
<P>
	   Concerns exist, meanwhile, that more strafing and bombing will put civilians
at risk. U.N. human rights monitors believe air force bullets and rockets caused
the December 1998 deaths of 16 villagers in a town near the Venezuelan border.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots at a Black Hawk base near Medellin said they have strict instructions
to avoid civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   One swaggering airman -- identifiable by his code name, Rhinoceros, and the
words ``Born to Fly'' taped on his helmet -- said it is gratifying to be hitting
back at the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A year ago, they had us running ragged, attacking bases, kidnapping
soldiers and police,'' he said. ``That's changed a lot.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Close Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen Thursday after a U.S.
ratings agency's placed Japan's yen-denominated bonds on review. Tokyo share
prices closed higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 110.08, up 1.06 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also
above its late New York level of 109.39 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which was down some 70 points
early in the session, gained 192.22 points, or 0.98 percent, to close the day at
19,791.40. On Wednesday, the average closed up 231.55 points, or 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In foreign exchange, the dollar moved higher against the yen after Moody's
Investors Service Inc. said Thursday it has placed on review for possible
downgrade Aa1-rated yen-denominated domestic bonds issued or guaranteed by
Japan's government.
</P>
<P>
	   "The review is prompted by structural problems in Japan's economy that have
resulted in a level of public sector debt that will soon be the highest,
relative to GDP, among the advanced industrial economies," Moody's said.
</P>
<P>
	   It said given the scale of Japan's fiscal imbalance, meaningful fiscal
correction might jeopardize the nation's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 108.69 yen, up from 106.98 yen
late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices started lower following a drop on Wall Street
overnight, but moved into positive territory on buying of high-technology issues
and some precision instrument makers.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 156.68 points, or 1.5
percent, to 10,561.41 at Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section closed up 25.99 points, or 1.54 percent, to 1,717.11. The TOPIX closed
up 0.98 points, or 0.96 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.8500

<HEADLINE> Hope Seen at U.N. Trade Conference  </HEADLINE>
    By NAOMI KOPPEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Negotiators at a major U.N. trade conference
expressed confidence Thursday that they had reached agreement on a program
designed to help reduce poverty through trade.
</P>
<P>
	   But the plan they looked set to agree on will have no teeth, committing no
one to anything and leaving the big issues on the table to be resolved later by
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, bringing together 160
countries, is trying to avoid the disagreements that led to the collapse of the
WTO's summit in Seattle last year in street protests and acrimony.
</P>
<P>
	   Delegates said the atmosphere was much better in Bangkok, largely because
UNCTAD, which seeks to promote development in poor countries, has attempted to
be a sounding board for ideas on how to shape trade in the globalized era.
</P>
<P>
	   The WTO, in contrast, was attempting a bigger task -- launching a new round
of trade talks that would lead to an enforceable treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   UNCTAD is hoping that an action plan to emerge from the conference, which
concludes Saturday, will achieve a consensus that can be built upon by the WTO
to finally get a new round of trade talks going.
</P>
<P>
	   "The atmosphere has been so good that nobody has any interest in creating a
delay or a mini-crisis," a senior Mexican diplomat told The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   He said a compromise had already been agreed on the issue of help for the
world's 48 poorest nations, a major theme of nearly every leader that has
appeared in Bangkok, including WTO chief Mike Moore, a former New Zealand prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
	   Rich governments have in the past failed to agree to measures that would
remove all import tariffs and quantity restrictions for goods from the so-called
least-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan of action produced in Bangkok will support the principle of the
idea and will instruct UNCTAD to look at how this can be achieved. It won't
commit nations to act now, but could serve as a stepping stone.
</P>
<P>
	   Delegates are also close to agreement on the wording of a text on
agricultural subsidies -- an issue that was a major block to an agreement in
Seattle -- and on the social element of trade, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan, coordinating the negotiations, said he
believed agreement in UNCTAD could pave the way for agreement in the WTO and
other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the intention of the Thai government and UNCTAD -- a new beginning,
a new healing process," Surin said. "I think we have achieved that to a high
degree."
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting attracted heads of state and ministers from many developing
countries, but relatively low-level delegations from richer countries,
especially the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and other rich countries have been accused in Bangkok of
being the main beneficiaries of globalization and current WTO rules. Those
feelings contributed heavily to the breakdown in Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Albright Vows Ex-Iran Hostage Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is promising to work with
former American hostages and their families to find ways of settling
multimillion-dollar judgments against the government of Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   As a federal judge prepared to rule on a $100 million lawsuit by former
hostage Terry Anderson, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a
congressional hearing the administration was ``looking at various funds''
containing money owed to Iran that might be tapped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But we have to do it in some way that does not harm our overall foreign
policy interests,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   After two days of testimony, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson on
Wednesday began deliberating Anderson's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Although held in Lebanon, Anderson and his fellow former hostages contend
their capture was orchestrated by Iran. Jackson, who has called testimony by
Anderson, his wife and daughter ``compelling,'' held Iran in default earlier in
the week when it did not send a representative to the trial. That means the
principal issue before the judge is the size of the judgment.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson, former chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
was held for 2,454 days -- from March 1985 to December 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Three other hostages held with Anderson in Beirut -- David Jacobsen, Joseph
Cicippio and Frank Reed -- earlier won judgments from Jackson totaling $65
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Both their suit and Anderson's were filed under a 1996 law that lets
Americans subjected to terrorism in foreign countries sue in U.S. courts if the
State Department lists those nations as sponsors of terrorism. Iran is so
listed.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, however, no money has been collected because the law lacks an
enforcement mechanism.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright, testifying Wednesday before the House International Relations
Committee, expressed caution against confiscation of Iranian diplomatic property
that might prompt retaliation against U.S. assets overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   She indicated officials have not determined exactly what they can do. But
she said she would work with hostages and their families on what actions can be
taken to collect on the judgments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are trying to be of assistance in terms of how to resolve these
(claims) and we're prepared to work with these families to identify unblocked
Iranian assets to help satisfy the judgments they have received,'' Albright
said. ``This is a subject that is high on our agenda.''
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson, who has been meeting privately with administration officials and
lawmakers in hopes of finding a compromise mechanism for tapping Iranian assets,
said Albright's comments could lead to a major victory in allowing hostages and
their families to collect judgments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The chances are pretty good we can work something out with the
administration,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a formula might also make it easier for the Americans held hostage in
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran to press claims against Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Militants seized the U.S. Embassy there in 1979 and held 52 Americans
hostage for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson's lawyer, Stuart Newberger, said he hopes for a ruling by Jackson
within a few weeks -- although suggested it might be get delayed by the
Microsoft antitrust case, which is also pending before Jackson.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Farmers Sue Cigarette Makers  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tobacco farmers who say that cigarette makers are trying
to put them out of business are suing the industry for $69 billion, opening a
new front for the companies in their ongoing legal battles.
</P>
<P>
	   A class-action lawsuit filed Tuesday in federal court alleges that the
companies misled farmers into helping them stop congressional legislation in
1998 that would have given growers $28 billion. The companies later reached a
settlement with the states that will provide growers with much less -- $5.15
billion over 12 years.
</P>
<P>
	   "All we're asking for and all we've ever asked for ... is to be treated
fairly. We haven't been treated fairly," said Lamar DeLoach, a Metter, Ga.,
grower.
</P>
<P>
	   He is one of 4,010 plaintiffs in the lawsuit who grow tobacco or own federal
tobacco quotas, the licenses that a farmer must either own or rent to sell the
crop. There are about 500,000 farmers and quota holders nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys general of 14 tobacco-growing states are listed as co-conspirators
in the lawsuit along with a Philip Morris USA lobbyist because of their role in
getting the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the companies were sued by wholesalers who allege they fixed
cigarette prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies deny wrongdoing in either case. Jay Poole, a spokesman for
Philip Morris, said the growers' lawsuit was a "direct assault" on the states'
settlement with the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lorillard Tobacco Co. said it believed frustrated growers filed the suit
in response to challenges from a changing marketplace. The cigarette maker
called the suit groundless and a frivolous endeavor organized and encouraged by
Washington, D.C., trial attorneys.
</P>
<P>
	   "We regret the action taken today by a small segment of the tobacco grower
community," Lorillard said in a written statement. "It is always unfortunate
when customers are sued by their suppliers. ... Lorillard continues to value the
relationship we have with the more than 100,000 tobacco farmers who have chosen
not to follow this ill-advised course."
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco farmers have seen their income decline sharply in recent years
because of declining consumption and increased imports of cheaper foreign leaf.
Since 1997, the amount of tobacco farmers are allowed to grow under the quota
system has been reduced by more than half. Small-scale farms that must rent
allotments have been especially hard hit.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA fixes the quotas each year based on the companies' purchasing
intentions, exports and existing tobacco stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The farmers who are suing the industry say the companies want to do away
with the quota system and contract directly with a select number of producers.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation that the growers helped the industry defeat was intended to
settle state lawsuits against the companies and would have cost them $500
billion. The settlement they reached with the states will cost $206 billion. The
farmers say the companies made vague promises to "take care" of them if they
lobbied against the legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Other farmers oppose the lawsuit, preferring to negotiate with the companies
instead.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't think it's time to give up yet," said Danny McKinney, chief
executive officer of the Burley Tobacco Grower's Cooperative in Lexington, Ky.
"You don't bite the hand that feeds you."
</P>
<P>
	   John Boyd, a Virginia grower, said the lawsuit could tie up states'
settlement and prevent farmers from getting their payments.

<HEADLINE> Air Power Impacts Colombia Rebels  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP) -- As swarms of guerrillas rushed the tiny police
post and officers inside radioed frantically for help, a pilot high in the skies
flicked on his night-vision equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Staring into the glow of an infrared screen, the air force captain uttered a
prayer, then rained bullets on Colombia's southern savannah.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I said God, my protector, help me. And then I fired'', recalled Arturo,
the man who was flying the Vietnam-era AC-47 gunship, a plane Colombian
guerrillas have nicknamed ``The Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
	   The attack in July was part of a Colombian military resurgence that
observers credit at least partly to improved night capabilities, communications
and intelligence-sharing provided by the United States since President Andres
Pastrana took office 19 months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The government's air advantage would grow enormously if the U.S. Congress
approves a $1.6 billion anti-narcotics plan the Clinton administration has
proposed for the South American nation that could come to a vote as early as
March.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack that Arturo described killed about a dozen guerrillas in Puerto
Rico, one of the towns attacked during a leftist offensive. The military
reported 300 rebels killed during the campaign -- mostly from the air.
</P>
<P>
	   The heaviest guerrilla losses in nearly four decades of conflict were also a
stunning reversal for a military that had been repeatedly humiliated in ground
combat on the rebels' jungle turf.
</P>
<P>
	   Government planes and helicopters had similar success in clashes that
followed -- cutting down insurgents crossing fields, blowing up guerrilla
convoys on highways, and even blasting rebel riverboats out of Amazonian
tributaries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The air force is a very powerful weapon, with great capacity for
destruction,'' boasted its commander, Gen. Hector Velasco. ``We've used only a
minimal portion of what we have.''
</P>
<P>
	   Military analysts believe air power could be crucial to turning the tide in
Colombia's long-running civil conflict -- a factor that might discourage the
large-scale attacks that rebels began mounting successfully in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   The new U.S. plan before Congress includes 30 Black Hawk and 33 Huey
helicopters, an RG-8A reconnaissance plane, air base and radar enhancements and
further upgrades to add night-vision systems to aging planes.
</P>
<P>
	   The helicopters would escort unarmed planes that fumigate drug crops and
ferry troops from two new U.S.-trained army battalions into guerrilla-infested
jungles.
</P>
<P>
	   The aid is earmarked for use against drug traffickers or rebels from the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, who protect the drug
operations. But U.S. officials admit it won't be easy to prevent Colombia from
using its new planes and helicopters in standard counterinsurgency operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Velasco said aircraft donated or sold with Pentagon approval for
counternarcotics purposes have also been used effectively against the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to 18 U.S.-built Black Hawks, Velasco said the air force has
sent into combat A-37 ``Dragonflies'' and OV-10 ``Broncos'' -- Vietnam-era
tactical fighters acquired principally for downing drug-smuggling planes.
</P>
<P>
	   During Pastrana's tenure, the Pentagon has trained pilots to fly in the dark
and outfitted some of these aircraft with night-vision goggles and
Forward-Looking Infrared sensors that can detect a rebel's head from several
thousand feet aloft.
</P>
<P>
	   After the air force spent much of its ammunition beating back last year's
FARC offensive, the U.S. military replaced the stock.
</P>
<P>
	   While U.S. officials say Americans are only training Colombian troops and
pilots, some Democratic lawmakers in Washington have expressed concern U.S.
soldiers could be drawn into combat.
</P>
<P>
	   Those fears grew last year when a U.S. Army reconnaissance plane crashed
over rebel territory, killing five Americans who the Pentagon said were on a
routine counterdrug mission. U.S. reconnaissance planes still regularly fly over
Colombia, the military says. None are known to have been shot at by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and Colombian military officials are watching closely to see whether
the FARC will try to neutralize the aerial threat with surface-to-air missiles
-- so far absent in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Velasco said the FARC has offered its fighters $2,500 for every military
pilot they assassinate -- which explains why Arturo, the AC-47 pilot, asked that
his last name not be published.
</P>
<P>
	   Concerns exist, meanwhile, that more strafing and bombing will put civilians
at risk. U.N. human rights monitors believe air force bullets and rockets caused
the December 1998 deaths of 16 villagers in a town near the Venezuelan border.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots at a Black Hawk base near Medellin said they have strict instructions
to avoid civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   One swaggering airman -- identifiable by his code name, Rhinoceros, and the
words ``Born to Fly'' taped on his helmet -- said it is gratifying to be hitting
back at the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A year ago, they had us running ragged, attacking bases, kidnapping
soldiers and police,'' he said. ``That's changed a lot.''

<HEADLINE> Suspension of Anthrax Program Urged  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE STRONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The program to inoculate all 2.4 million American troops
against anthrax as protection against biological warfare is based on ``a paucity
of science'' and should be suspended, a House panel says in a report sharply
critical of the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The anthrax vaccine should be considered experimental because its
effectiveness against biological warfare is uncertain and the safety of troops
taking the anthrax shots is not being monitored adequately, according to the
report being released today by the House Government Reform national security
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At best, the vaccine provides some measure of protection to most who
receive it,'' says a draft of the report obtained by The Associated Press.
``Just how much protection is acquired, by whom, for how long ... are questions
the Defense Department answers with an excess of faith but a paucity of
science.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Defense Department spokesman, Jim Turner, said Wednesday that Pentagon
officials were reviewing the congressional recommendations.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon and Food and Drug Administration officials have said repeatedly the
vaccine is safe and effective. FDA officials also say they believe there is no
basis for concluding the approved vaccine should be demoted to an
investigational drug category.
</P>
<P>
	   The 80-page report was written by the subcommittee's Republican majority
after five hearings on the immunization program.
</P>
<P>
	   The vaccine has come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers as soldiers
have expressed concerns about taking the six-shot regimen. Complaints included
fevers, muscle pain and dizziness. Reserve and National Guard pilots testified
that morale was plummeting and colleagues would resign rather than take the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered all active duty and reserve
troops to get the shots, starting with soldiers most likely to encounter
biological warfare overseas. More than 380,000 service members have been
immunized so far.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 to 300 have refused to take it because of concerns about its
safety and efficacy, Pentagon officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 400 reports of adverse reactions have been filed. While FDA
officials have linked the vaccine to few of the reactions with a high level of
confidence, the agency has not been able to rule it out entirely.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthrax has never been used in combat, but the Pentagon fears Iraq, North
Korea and other countries -- or terrorist groups -- might try. Anthrax is a
naturally occurring bacteria found in domesticated animals; it can be produced
as dry spores that, when inhaled, cause death within a few days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feel the program is a vital force protection program against a known
threat,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the House panel's report called the program unrealistic in providing
protection against only one form of biological attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The vaccine was studied mostly for its effectiveness in protecting mill
workers and livestock handlers decades ago against infection from touching
animals or animal hides.
</P>
<P>
	   There is little research on the inhalation of anthrax spores by humans and
no long-term health research on the vaccine, the report says; therefore, the
vaccine should be regarded as an investigational drug, requiring the approval of
troops to be administered.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also says the program should be suspended because some troops do
not trust medical information provided by a Defense Department that has engaged
in ``heavy-handed propaganda,'' labeling critics as paranoid rather than
answering their questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of encouraging reporting of adverse reactions, the lawmakers said,
the military may have underreported problems with shots due to an
``institutional culture that is hostile, even resistant, to reports.''
</P>
<P>
	   The lawmakers also were critical of BioPort Corp. of Lansing, Mich., the
vaccine's sole supplier. The report recommended research and development of a
second-generation vaccine, allowing other companies to compete to alleviate
supply shortages and cost increases.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Meet AFL-CIO Leaders  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The AFL-CIO's endorsement of Al Gore for president does
not mean labor leaders will go soft on a key point of disagreement with him this
year: China's trade relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we have to take on a fight on this issue, we're going to fight on this
issue,'' said AFL-CIO President John Sweeney of the labor federation's
opposition to a Clinton administration push for Congress to give China permanent
normal trade status, which Gore supports.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was scheduled to meet with AFL-CIO leaders here today for the first
time since the federation's endorsement of him last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Sweeney says Gore will be backed, no holds barred, by a massive political
campaign by unions to line up votes for him. Today, the AFL-CIO president
planned to introduce Gore to Louisiana workers at the Avondale shipyard, where
unions recently won a six-year organizing fight.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore's closed-door meeting with union leaders is not expected be all
handshakes and slaps on the back.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president will face the leaders of two major unions that so far
have not joined the others in endorsing him, largely because of trade issues --
the Teamsters and the United Auto Workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, who met labor leaders on Wednesday, said she
told them the administration is working hard to keep lines of communication open
and ``not to have trade ... become a polarizing issue,'' this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately Wednesday, AFL-CIO leaders, in a shift in stance toward
immigrants, called for the repeal of a 1986 law they say has made it hard to
unionize or improve conditions for undocumented workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The new stand also commits unions to press for amnesty for the estimated 5
million to 6 million workers and their families who are here illegally or have
only temporary legal status.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The current system of immigration enforcement in the United States is
broken and we must fix it. We believe the AFL-CIO can lead on this issue,'' said
AFL-CIO executive vice president Linda Chavez-Thompson.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO is still committed to opposing increases in the number of
immigrants allowed to come here to work legally.
</P>
<P>
	   But it is calling for new immigration laws that would protect those already
here working illegally from firing or deportation if they try to unionize or
complain to the government about violations of labor laws, including the minimum
wage and safety requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO wants the new rules to replace the 1986 law that set up the
current system of enforcing immigration laws through employers, holding over
companies the threat of punishment if they hire undocumented workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The labor movement originally supported that law, but now says it is being
used by employers to intimidate illegal immigrants who try to join unions or
otherwise try to improve their wages or working conditions.

<HEADLINE> Polls Indicate Hot GOP Contest  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When letter carrier Bill Wilson of Anderson, S.C., talks
to people on his rounds he hears lots of chatter about the state's GOP
presidential primary from Republicans, independents and Democrats alike.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there will be quite a bit of voting by independents and Democrats,
just from delivering mail and talking to people,'' said Wilson, a Republican.
``Just from walking the streets. I see a lot of McCain and Bush signs in the
yards.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson's perception is backed up by polls suggesting that turnout Saturday
will be the highest of any GOP presidential primary in the state. Polls and
campaign-watchers are finding plenty of enthusiasm for Sen. John McCain and an
energized GOP base for Gov. George W. Bush -- elements for a hot contest,
indeed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are ignited,'' Clemson University political scientist David Woodard
said of core Republicans rallying for Bush. ``They are glowing in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican officials have printed an additional 400,000 ballots to be
sure they have enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnout in the 1996 Republican primary was 276,000 and a third of the voters
identified themselves as independents or Democrats, according to exit polls.
State GOP director J. Sam Daniels said he expects more than 300,000 voters this
time, and possibly many more.
</P>
<P>
	   In polls out Wednesday, Bush had a 2-to-1 lead or better among Republicans
while McCain held a slightly bigger margin among independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain were in a dead heat in a Los Angeles Times poll out early
this week in which 45 percent of the respondents were non-Republicans. In polls
with a smaller sampling of non-Republicans -- 40 percent -- Bush has held a slim
lead or been in a dead heat with McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them, a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll had Bush slightly ahead and a Zogby
poll had them essentially tied.
</P>
<P>
	   An American Research Group poll of 600 likely voters gave Bush 47 percent
and McCain 41 percent, with 7 percent undecided. The poll, also with 40 percent
non-Republicans, was taken Sunday through Tuesday and had an error margin of
plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   A Mason-Dixon poll done for media outlets in South Carolina had the race
essentially tied, Bush with 45 percent and McCain with 42 percent with a 4 point
error margin.
</P>
<P>
	   The third candidate in the race, Alan Keyes, has been in single digits.
</P>
<P>
	   Woodard, co-director of the Palmetto Poll, said a question for McCain is
whether all the enthusiasm for him among non-Republicans will translate into a
strong turnout on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   Weather could be a big factor, he said, because McCain needs a high turnout
from those less accustomed to voting in a GOP primary. If it rains, ``then God
wants George Bush'' to win, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   While many non-Republicans are expected to vote, some say the negative turn
of the campaign has cooled their enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
	   Shirley Walker, a 64-year-old Democrat and foster mother from Walterboro, is
still considering whether to vote and admits to being bothered by the campaign
tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If a person is capable and honest, they shouldn't have to do that if they
run for president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative Republican enthusiasm for Bush has grown along with that of
moderates, independents and some Democrats for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a little concerned about the crossover Democrats trying to influence
the election,'' said salesman Guy Stanley Orr of Simpsonville.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the campaign first started, I wasn't sure how I felt about Bush,''
Orr said. ``But as I listened to him, he has answered all the questions I have
at this time.''

<HEADLINE> Conservative Ideology Becomes Issue  </HEADLINE>
   By WALTER R. MEARS AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush is trying to build a barricade on the
right against Sen. John McCain, but it may be a shaky one. There's a new dent
now that a conservative dropout candidate has endorsed McCain as the best
Republican bet to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign has been working to rally support from religious,
social-issue conservatives, and the Christian right is a powerful bloc in South
Carolina, where the GOP rivals collide in a pivotal primary on Saturday. But the
movement's influence has waned in this campaign. They are generally with Bush,
but without the activism of past campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   And there is no clear line between Bush and McCain on conservative ideology.
It's a matter of degree, according to the Texas governor. ``I'm more
conservative on certain issues,'' he said Tuesday night in their South Carolina
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer, the conservative activist who abandoned his campaign after
getting less than 1 percent of the vote in New Hampshire, now is backing McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is the best shot we have to end the era of Bill and Hillary and Al
Gore,'' Bauer said Wednesday in Greenville, S.C. He said McCain doesn't stand
for ``a money-bags democracy'' but for civility, decency and honor.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer's endorsement is a helpful message for McCain against suggestions that
he is a sort of closet moderate, not the proud conservative of his self
description.
</P>
<P>
	   The Christian conservative vote is ``still very critical,'' said Ralph Reed,
a Bush strategist and veteran of that movement. ``The vote was cannibalized by
multiple candidacies.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reed said the religious conservative vote will determine who wins the South
Carolina primary. But that could change should turnout swell significantly
beyond the Republican base.
</P>
<P>
	   The primary is open not only to independents -- who delivered McCain's
landslide margin over Bush in New Hampshire -- but to Democrats, too. So both
campaigners have been looking toward the center, while at the same time trying
to persuade conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Nothing so simple as in the long-past era when Republican campaigns were
waged between the right and center-left wings of the GOP. The lines are blurred
now. Bush's conservative allies are trying to draw them again, against McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Pat Robertson, the Christian Coalition founder, backs Bush and has
said McCain is unfit to be president. He says religious conservatives would walk
away from a McCain ticket in the fall, undermining the Republican base.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a state that embraces conservative values,'' Bush said in South
Carolina. ``I'm the conservative candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes tried to claim that role, but quit for lack of votes. He said
the contest had become one of personalities and charisma, and that his message
of issues never got through.
</P>
<P>
	   That, essentially, was Bauer's explanation when he dropped out, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Forbes and Bauer said they had pushed the campaign to the right.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we really have had tremendous clout,'' said Rep. Bob Barr of
Georgia, who had backed Forbes. He said the issues Bush and McCain are talking
about, ``even the language they are using, makes clear that they are hearing the
conservative message.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``How anyone can say McCain's New Hampshire victory translates into an
epitaph for the right is baffling,'' says Edwin Feulner, president of the
Heritage Foundation. ``Each one of this year's contenders, even the dropouts, is
running as a self-proclaimed conservative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They may argue over how conservative ideas should be applied to today's
issues, but the heir to Bill Scranton and Nelson Rockefeller is nowhere to be
found,'' Feulner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Governors Rockefeller of New York and Scranton of Pennsylvania were two
pillars of the liberal Republican establishment, rivals in turn to Barry
Goldwater, the Mr. Conservative GOP presidential nominee in 1964. That liberal
wing is no longer a factor in Republican campaigns. Ronald Reagan moved the
agenda to the right and conservatives dominate the GOP majorities in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said 'No' when asked in the debate whether he was trying to imply that
McCain is too liberal. He said he considers the Arizona senator a conservative.
</P>
<P>
	   But at rallies, he says McCain's ideas on taxes and other issues are
comparable to President Clinton's, and that while ``I wouldn't call John a
liberal,'' he does have some Democratic positions.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign financing plan is one point of contention with
conservative interest groups, who object to its restrictions on issue ads, which
are a factor in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Right to Life Committee is using radio ads and mailings in the
state's most conservative areas backing Bush and opposing McCain on abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign is pressing the issue although both men oppose abortion,
albeit with subtle differences. Among conservatives, and especially on abortion,
the fine print counts.

<HEADLINE> Hope Seen at U.N. Trade Conference  </HEADLINE>
    By NAOMI KOPPEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Negotiators at a major U.N. trade conference
expressed confidence today that they had reached agreement on a program designed
to help reduce poverty through trade.
</P>
<P>
	   But the plan they looked set to agree on will have no teeth, committing no
one to anything and leaving the big issues on the table to be resolved later by
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, bringing together 160
countries, is trying to avoid the disagreements that led to the collapse of the
WTO's summit in Seattle last year in street protests and acrimony.
</P>
<P>
	   Delegates said the atmosphere was much better in Bangkok, largely because
UNCTAD, which seeks to promote development in poor countries, has attempted to
be a sounding board for ideas on how to shape trade in the globalized era.
</P>
<P>
	   The WTO, in contrast, was attempting a bigger task -- launching a new round
of trade talks that would lead to an enforceable treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   UNCTAD is hoping that an action plan to emerge from the conference, which
concludes Saturday, will achieve a consensus that can be built upon by the WTO
to finally get a new round of trade talks going.
</P>
<P>
	   "The atmosphere has been so good that nobody has any interest in creating a
delay or a mini-crisis," a senior Mexican diplomat told The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   He said a compromise had already been agreed on the issue of help for the
world's 48 poorest nations, a major theme of nearly every leader that has
appeared in Bangkok, including WTO chief Mike Moore, a former New Zealand prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
	   Rich governments have in the past failed to agree to measures that would
remove all import tariffs and quantity restrictions for goods from the so-called
least-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan of action produced in Bangkok will support the principle of the
idea and will instruct UNCTAD to look at how this can be achieved. It won't
commit nations to act now, but could serve as a stepping stone.
</P>
<P>
	   Delegates are also close to agreement on the wording of a text on
agricultural subsidies -- an issue that was a major block to an agreement in
Seattle -- and on the social element of trade, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan, coordinating the negotiations, said he
believed agreement in UNCTAD could pave the way for agreement in the WTO and
other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the intention of the Thai government and UNCTAD -- a new beginning,
a new healing process," Surin said. "I think we have achieved that to a high
degree."
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting attracted heads of state and ministers from many developing
countries, but relatively low-level delegations from richer countries,
especially the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and other rich countries have been accused in Bangkok of
being the main beneficiaries of globalization and current WTO rules. Those
feelings contributed heavily to the breakdown in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   One reason for the more harmonious atmosphere in Bangkok has been that,
unlike in Seattle, free-trade critics have been allowed to attend most meetings
at the UNCTAD conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Protest groups have been allowed to present petitions, and non-governmental
organizations have been given a room in the conference hall -- part of an effort
by UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens Ricupero and Thai officials to hear their
views.
</P>
<P>
	   "We must credit Mr. Ricupero for working hard to include NGOs in this
process," said Walden Bello, a Philippine activist who heads the Thai-based
Focus on the Global South. "It certainly was a sincere process."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Comments on 2000 Races  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says American voters have the pick of
four good candidates to take his job, and that the daily sniping on the campaign
trail is just politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, at a news conference Wednesday, also rejected calls for a national
moratorium on capital punishment, while urging the nation's governors to ``look
very closely'' at their death penalty systems to make sure innocent people are
not executed.
</P>
<P>
	   During the hourlong meeting with reporters, his first of the new year,
Clinton took questions on presidential politics with relish, even as he said he
is trying to stay above the day-to-day political fray.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You've basically got four people running for president now who are people
of accomplishment, people who have certain convictions, people who have, I
think, pretty clear philosophies and records,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   While Clinton wants to see Vice President Al Gore succeed him, he declined
the opportunity to bash any of the other candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd like to think I'm casting a little sunshine'' over the race, Clinton
said to laughter. ``I keep trying to build these fellas up, you know. I'm being
nice and generous and all that.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also said the country has ``a good choice'' among the leading contenders,
and seemed to downplay the current fracas over negative campaigning that has led
to finger-pointing among both Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have never seen a tough race where people fought with each other, where
they didn't have different interpretations of each other's record and each
other's positions,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Illinois Gov. George Ryan was courageous to impose a freeze on
executions last month, after the exoneration of 13 death row inmates in his
state over two decades. Clinton said death penalty supporters -- including
himself -- have ``an especially heavy obligation'' to make sure there is no
question of guilt for condemned prisoners.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton refused to say whether he will challenge ethics complaints seeking
to strip him of his Arkansas law license because of his conduct in the Monica
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he paid $850,000 last year to settle a related case -- the sexual
harassment suit of Paula Jones -- only to prevent it from being a distraction to
his presidency. He said the suit ``had absolutely no merit.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he has not ruled out a visit to Pakistan next month when he
visits its neighbor and nuclear rival, India. He said his decision would hinge
on whether stopping in Islamabad could halt the regional arms race, promote
democracy in military-ruled Pakistan and resolve the India-Pakistan conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   He also announced the release of $125 million in federal money to help needy
families buy home heating oil in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also said he would seek $600 million in emergency funds to
deal with the current crisis and problems likely to occur later this year in
areas suffering from extreme heat.
</P>
<P>
	   On other subjects, Clinton:
</P>
<P>
	   --Said Republican presidential hopefuls John McCain and Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas have ``got a tough job'' in running against the Clinton record of peace
and prosperity. ``I have a lot of sympathy with them,'' he said, a day after
sharp criticism from Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   --Said Democratic rivals Bill Bradley and Vice President Al Gore were
``right to condemn'' Clinton's nomination of Republican Bradley Smith to the
Federal Election Commission. Clinton said Smith ``hates campaign finance''
legislation but that he nominated him anyway simply to fill a Republican
vacancy, and Smith was the candidate favored by Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   --Refused to cast blame for the deepening crisis in the Northern Ireland
peace process. ``I don't think you can Monday morning quarterback that,'' the
president said. He said the current crisis was ``a very unfortunate
development'' but that the IRA ``has given no indication whatever that they will
revert to violence.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``And so that means that they still think, no matter what the rhetoric says,
that all the parties really believe that they ought to find a way to work this
out.''

<HEADLINE> Funerals Held for Tornado Victims  </HEADLINE>
   By ERIN McCLAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PELHAM, Ga. (AP) -- In the tiny Baptist church where the Rev. Jackie
McClelland delivered his sermons, church members struggled to make sense of the
tragedy caused by deadly tornadoes that swept through southwest Georgia this
week.
</P>
<P>
	   McClelland and his wife Mary Ann, both 64, were killed Monday when twisters
struck their rural farm house. Mrs. McClelland, director of the Grady County
Health Department, was just one month shy of retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's difficult to stand here and try to express to you that God is a God
of love,'' the Rev. Cleston Brooks told mourners. ``But do not let this harden
your heart. It's not for you and I to choose when our time will come.''
</P>
<P>
	   Union Hill Primitive Baptist Church couldn't fit all of the mourners inside
its church, which seats 200. Speakers were set up outside so others could hear
the tributes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were people that other people cherished,'' said Junior Peeples, a
relative. ``And they went together -- to go with the one you shared your life
with, that's a special meaning.''
</P>
<P>
	   The tornadoes touched down in four counties. Authorities reduced the death
toll from 22 to 18 Wednesday, saying confusion in the aftermath of the storms
led to four victims being counted twice.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell County, which had 11 dead, was worst hit. Winds reached as high as
200 mph and cut a 10-mile path of devastation.
</P>
<P>
	   Families in the small Mitchell County town of Camilla, about 40 miles from
the Georgia-Florida border, met with insurance adjusters Wednesday to assess
what they had lost and how long recovery would take.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, who assessed regional damage by helicopter, also
toured Camilla for a firsthand look.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What do you guys make of all this? Pretty scary, wasn't it?'' Gore asked
one family, who sat on a plastic-covered mattress in what would have been their
front yard.
</P>
<P>
	   The Insurance Information Institute put the total Georgia storm damage at
$25 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal, state and local authorities planned to set up a temporary housing
park with 40 units for displaced families early next week, Georgia Emergency
Management Agency spokesman Jeff Jellets said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile Wednesday, about 150 people attended a funeral for Gloria Jean
Miller Eglinton, 54, a bank teller in Cairo, about 20 miles south of Pelham.
</P>
<P>
	   Her friends recalled her love for all living things.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some people can love the unlovable. Jeannie liked frogs,'' the Rev.
DeWayne Atkinson said. ``God gave her this personality -- this outgoing, bubbly
personality. She was a friend to everybody.''

<HEADLINE> Phone Services for Disabled Pushed  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to make the phone network more accessible to all
Americans, federal regulators are expanding the scope of services that phone
companies must make available to callers with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Communications Commission was expected today to require a new
service nationwide that allows users to speak directly to a special operator --
trained to identify speech patterns of those with disabilities -- who would
relay the message to the person on the other end of the line.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission's action also would bolster the quality of existing services,
such as text telephone, that already are available.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure that the phone network remains accessible to all
Americans,'' the agency's chairman, William Kennard, said in an interview.
``This is an effort to update the law and expand it so it's keeping pace with
technology.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard added that all Americans, not just those with hearing impairments or
speech disabilities, would benefit from having a more inclusive system.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC also was expected to set a minimum typing speed of 60 words a minute
for operators handling TTY calls and require that Spanish-speakers be able to
use the services.
</P>
<P>
	   Phone carriers would have to make available the new speech-to-speech service
by March 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The new service is especially important to people like Bob Segalman, who
used to rely on a text telephone or TTY to communication by phone. But the
device posed a fresh set of challenges for Segalman, who has cerebral palsy: He
could only type 10 words a minute.
</P>
<P>
	   So he developed a speech-to-speech relay service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In order to survive in today's world, you need to be able to use the
telephone,'' Segalman said in a relay interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a 1990 federal law, phone companies that provided voice service had to
ensure that relay services were available throughout the region they serve.
</P>
<P>
	   All states now offer TTY services in which the user types a message and an
operator reads it out loud to the person on the other end. The operator also
converts the replies into text.
</P>
<P>
	   Relay services are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, at no extra
charge.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost of paying for interstate relay services comes out of a federal pool
-- set at $44 million for 2000 -- that all telecommunications carriers pay into
and typically recover from consumers. Their contribution is less than 0.04
percent of their gross revenues. Each state handles separately the costs for
calls within the state.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear yet whether the new services will mean greater costs. In
Maryland, where speech-to-speech services have been offered since 1996,
officials say they have noticed no significant change in costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who use relay services say they have made an immeasurable difference
in their lives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has opened a whole new world to me,'' said Rebecca Ladew, using a text
telephone to answer questions through a Maryland relay operator. ``I can
communicate with anyone, anywhere, anytime.''
</P>
<P>
	   Letting Americans know that speech-to-speech services exist, and showing
them how to use them, is critical to making the services a success, users and
advocates say.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, Segalman noted that some people with speech disabilities have
never used the phone before this service became available.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many consumers need one-to-one help overcoming psychological barriers to
telephone use,'' Segalman said.
</P>
<P>
	   But consumers have told the FCC that such services are not always
``functionally equivalent'' to voice services as required by the Americans With
Disabilities Act. They complain that calls sometimes are answered too slowly at
the relay facilities or typing becomes too burdensome to transmit lengthy
messages.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, 10 states offer the service in which people with speech
disabilities can use their own voice or a voice synthesizer to talk on the
telephone, using special relay operators.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators also are encouraging -- but not requiring -- providers to offer
video relay interpreting services. This would let someone give their message in
sign language over video conferencing to the operator.

<HEADLINE> It's Luna Rossa vs. Black Magic  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- There won't be a shortage of contrasts when New
Zealand and Italy launch the 30th America's Cup series.
</P>
<P>
	It'll be Kiwi cool versus Italian emotion. The South Pacific versus the
Mediterranean. Big bucks from the Prada design house against a New Zealand team
that still raises money by selling red socks, similar to the lucky red socks
that Sir Peter Blake wore in the 1995 regatta.
</P>
<P>
	The Kiwis won the Cup in a huge upset, shocking Dennis Conner 5-0. Blake was
knighted.
</P>
<P>
	Even the boat names are on opposite tacks. Team New Zealand is sticking with
the Black Magic name and color scheme from '95, when its awesome boat speed
vexed everyone. Italy counters with the romantic-poetic name Luna Rossa (Red
Moon).
</P>
<P>
	And whichever team wins the best-of-9 regatta, starting Saturday (Friday
evening EST) will make history.
</P>
<P>
	If it's Luna Rossa, the oldest trophy in sports will sail back to Europe for
the first time in 149 years. If it's New Zealand, the Cup stays in the City of
Sails -- where everyone, it seems, has a boat. It would be the first time a
non-U.S. team has successfully defended it.
</P>
<P>
	Does it really matter that there's not an American boat in the America's Cup
for the first time ever? No one down here's shedding tears for the country that
gave the trophy its name because there's too much at stake for those still
sailing.
</P>
<P>
	``The more this sport is spread around, the better it is,'' said Luna Rossa
skipper Francesco de Angelis, an America's Cup rookie from Naples.
</P>
<P>
	An Italian victory ``would bring a lot of different countries that haven't
participated for a long while, or never participated,'' said tactician Torben
Grael, a Brazilian who lives in Italy. ``I think it will start a lot of interest
in the Cup.''
</P>
<P>
	It would also mean that Italians back home won't have to stay up until 4 a.m.
to watch the races on TV, like they do now.
</P>
<P>
	It was Luna Rossa, a silver-and-red bullet of a boat, that won the dramatic
Louis Vuitton Cup finals against San Francisco's AmericaOne, which went down to
the decisive ninth race and knocked the Americans completely out of the
America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
	``I think the harder it was, the better,'' Grael said. ``I think it can only
make us stronger.''
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand's mainsail trimmer, Warwick Fleury, who has sailed with de Angelis
and several of Luna Rossa's crew before, doesn't share the general belief that
the Italians would collapse under America's Cup pressure.
</P>
<P>
	``I am not surprised they came through,'' Fleury said. ``They are not the kind
to buckle. They deserve to be there.''
</P>
<P>
	Auckland is ready to cheer on its heroes. But there's also a sense of
apprehension, because as Luna Rossa survived attrition and demolition in the
four-month, 11-team challenger trials, Team New Zealand was off by itself,
testing its boats and sailing intrasquad races.
</P>
<P>
	No one will know how the teams compare until they head up the first leg
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Kiwis didn't have defender trials, Team New Zealand is still
expected to be formidable. Led by skipper Russell Coutts, most of the sailors
return from the walloping of Conner off San Diego in '95. They're deep enough to
have one crew for light winds and one crew for heavy winds.
</P>
<P>
	``The guys on the boat are looking forward to getting to grips with Prada,''
Blake said. ``They are going to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
	The Cup hasn't been in European hands since 1851, when the schooner America
claimed it after beating a fleet of English ships around the Isle of Wight.
</P>
<P>
	Prada chief and sailing enthusiast Patrizio Bertelli is spending an estimated
$60 million on Italy's campaign. He named Luna Rossa for the red moon he saw one
night over Punta Ala, on the Tuscany coast.
</P>
<P>
	If the Italians sail well enough the next several days, that could become the
new home of the America's Cup.

<HEADLINE> Mfume Rips Selig Over Tigers Case  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GOODMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- The NAACP is complaining that baseball commissioner Bud
Selig ``lost a golden opportunity'' to make an example of the Detroit Tigers for
ignoring league rules requiring teams to consider minorities for top jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tigers hired manager Phil Garner in October without interviewing any
minority candidates. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People protested and asked Selig to impose sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Tuesday, Selig said he was satisfied with the American League club's
decision to set up a community advisory group to help with minority hiring
issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you condone by inaction a team's hiring practice that does not allow
for qualified people of color to even be interviewed for a job, you close the
door on racial progress,'' NAACP president Kweisi Mfume said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Selig told teams last April that they must consider minority candidates, and
baseball's new constitution -- approved last month -- allows him to fine teams
up to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mr. Selig lost a golden opportunity to set a new course by using the full
authority of his office,'' Mfume said. ``I'm just not very impressed at all.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about Mfume's comments Wednesday night, Selig said: ``My comment was
what I said yesterday. I don't have any further comment.''
</P>
<P>
	   Selig said Tuesday that he was delighted by the Tigers' creation of a
five-member community advisory board.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Tigers have recognized the problem and addressed it,'' he said.
``That, I believe, is more important than taking disciplinary action.''
</P>
<P>
	   Telephone messages seeking comment were left for Tigers general manager
Randy Smith on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tigers fired manager Larry Parrish on Oct. 14 and replaced him with
Garner, who is white. Garner was the only person interviewed for the job, Smith
said at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fifty-two years after Jackie Robinson, baseball is still suffering from
the ugly stranglehold of racism,'' Mfume said. ``Are there no Branch Rickeys of
the world who believe that qualifications are more important than race?''
</P>
<P>
	   Rickey was the Brooklyn Dodgers general manager who signed Robinson as the
major leagues' first black player in decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Mfume said the group will keep pressing baseball to open the ranks of its
executive and managerial ranks to minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to continue to monitor the hiring and promotional practices of
major league baseball,'' he said. ``It's a very segregated industry off the
field.''
</P>
<P>
	   Baseball's top black executive, National League president Len Coleman, quit
last fall after learning owners intended to eliminate separate league offices.
</P>
<P>
	   In baseball's last survey, taken in 1997, 23 percent of employees in
baseball's central offices and the 30 teams were minorities, up from 20 percent
in the previous survey, which took place in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Five managers are members of a minority, with Davey Lopes (Milwaukee) and
Don Baylor (Chicago Cubs) hired during the offseason, joining Dusty Baker (San
Francisco), Jerry Manuel (Chicago White Sox) and Felipe Alou (Montreal).

	   Spring training in baseball is the best preseason in sports.
</P>
<P>
	   It comes after the college and pro football seasons, bowl games and playoffs
are over, before the March Madness of college basketball begins and long before
the NHL and NBA playoffs start.
</P>
<P>
	   Preseasons in college and pro football are held during baseball's regular
season. In the case of the NHL and NBA, baseball is involved in late-season
pennant races or in postseason play when the skaters and the dunkers begin
preparing for another campaign in which it seems almost every team makes the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   More importantly, baseball spring training is a traditional rite of passage.
The thump of ball in glove, the crack of ball against bat at camps in Florida
and Arizona announces that the longest, most casual, yet at times most intense
season of any American sport is not far away.
</P>
<P>
	   Baseball spring training and its attendant games in the Grapefruit League in
Florida and in the Cactus League in Arizona are a time of preparation for the
players and a time of relaxation for the fans, many old enough to be reminded of
the good old days and many young enough to some day look back and think these
were good old days.
</P>
<P>
	   Past and future are a doubleheader in baseball, one that CEO-type player
salaries, the designated hitter, domes, fake grass and
what-have-you-done-for-me-lately owners cannot spoil in the long run. The
present always reminds fans of the past -- and baseball has the richest past of
American any sport -- and touches off hopes and arguments about the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Baseball does not pass off its spring training games as being the real
thing, as the NFL does with its preseason contests played at regular-season
prices as part of season-ticket plans.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chicago Cubs got off first this year, when their pitchers and catchers
reported to camp Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Manager Don Baylor and pitcher Kerry Wood symbolize the hopes spring
training brings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've had this pressing headache for 36 hours of waiting for this day of
opportunity,'' said Baylor, a baseball lifer, returning to managing after having
been fired by the Colorado Rockies after the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Spring training is always ``next year'' no matter what a team or a player
did the past season.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel pretty good,'' said the 22-year-old Wood, who threw 42 pitches in
five minutes. It was a step forward for Wood, who missed last season because of
having reconstructive surgery in his right elbow in April after having won the
1998 NL Rookie of the Year award with a 13-6 record, a 3.40 ERA and 233
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Cubs will report Friday, while other players for the rest of the clubs
will report next week. The latest reporting date is Feb. 25 for the Texas
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
	   So by the end of next week, fans will warming up for arguments about how
trades and free-agency signings helped or hurt their clubs, hoping that this is
the year their heroes go all the way -- expecting them to if the fans are
Yankees rooters.

<HEADLINE> Selig Leaves Rose With Little Hope  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- More than a decade later, Bud Selig still thinks his
old friend Bart Giamatti made the right decision about Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
	   Though he didn't come right out and say it, the commissioner made it clear
Wednesday that Rose won't be getting back into baseball as long as the former
Milwaukee Brewers owner runs the sport.
</P>
<P>
	   While Selig hasn't officially responded to Rose's application for
reinstatement, he made his strongest public statement yet on the career hits
leader during a speech to the Rotary Club of Madison.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is not a scintilla of give in that area,'' Selig said of baseball's
determination to keep gambling out of the sport.
</P>
<P>
	   Following an investigation of his gambling, Rose agreed to a lifetime ban on
Aug. 23, 1989, a deal announced by commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti the
following day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pete did accept a voluntary lifetime suspension from Dr. Giamatti,'' Selig
said. ``There hasn't been any new evidence since then. I think just from my
answer, you'll understand my depth of feeling on this subject.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rose applied for reinstatement on Sept. 26, 1997, and the application sat
without action until a few weeks ago. Selig's top lawyer, Bob DuPuy, met Jan. 27
with Rose's lawyers and gave them 30 days to submit additional information.
</P>
<P>
	   Rose, ineligible for the Hall of Fame while he's on the permanently banned
list, claims investigator John Dowd's evidence was not conclusive, and he should
be allowed back in baseball. Rose's lawyers presented DuPuy with evidence from
their experts.
</P>
<P>
	   S. Gary Spicer, one of Rose's lawyers, did not return a telephone call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Selig, who allowed Rose to participate in ceremonies for baseball's
All-Century team at last year's World Series, said last week that Rose will not
be allowed at an on-field ceremony in Cincinnati in June honoring the Reds' 1975
World Series championship team.
</P>
<P>
	   The commissioner kept his remarks light and didn't comment on several
hot-button issues, including a federal appeals court's opinion last week that
stated the owners' collusion against players in the 1980s was both real and
damaging to the sport.
</P>
<P>
	   Selig also didn't address a recent medical report that androstenedione, the
supplement once used by Mark McGwire, raises testosterone above normal levels
and could be hazardous. Andro is banned by the Olympics, the NCAA, the NFL and
the men's and women's tennis tours, but is allowed in baseball, the NBA and the
NHL.
</P>
<P>
	   Selig said he personally wrote the news release concerning John Rocker's
suspension. Selig banned the Atlanta Braves reliever until May 1 following the
pitcher's remarks that he would never play for a New York team because he didn't
want to ride a subway train ``next to some queer with AIDS.'' Rocker also mocked
foreigners and called a Latin teammate a ``fat monkey.''
</P>
<P>
	   Selig isn't worried about whether the suspension will be overturned by
arbitrator Shyam Das, who heard an appeal by the players association last week.
Selig said his decision, which he made after consulting with Braves executive
Hank Aaron, was the right one.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Baseball is a social institution,'' Selig said. ``It does have social
responsibilities. It's a game that has a tremendous influence in society, and
you should be protective of that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue sharing and stadium initiatives were briefly addressed by the
commissioner, though not in detail. He said baseball's biggest problem in
stadium construction or improvement lies in Minnesota, where little progress has
been made in securing a new ballpark for the Twins.
</P>
<P>
	   Selig said Twins owner Carl Pohlad has been ``remarkably patient.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're going to have to do something,'' Selig said. ``I've been up there
a lot. ... Minnesota needs to do what every city has done. All these cities
confront the same sorts of issues. Minnesota needs to address these issues.''
</P>
<P>
	   Selig said some realignment and divisional rotation within interleague play
could take place for the 2001 season. Some owners want to move Arizona from the
NL West to the AL West, shift Texas to the AL Central, move Detroit to the AL
East and Tampa Bay to the NL East.
</P>
<P>
	   And while Selig has not made firm plans to use the expanded powers granted
him by baseball's owners during their winter meeting in Arizona, he said his
first project will be to implement a ``bigger, better'' form of revenue sharing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's my job to produce as much hope and faith in as many places as
possible,'' he said. ``I would not have taken this job if I didn't think
something could be done. I know that the economic landscape needs to be altered.
It has already.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Rotary Club greeted Selig with a standing ovation and treated the
commissioner to sing-alongs of ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' and ``You Gotta
Have Heart,'' from the musical ``Damn Yankees.''

<HEADLINE> Bulls' Benjamin Placed on IL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DEERFIELD, Ill. (AP) -- Chicago Bulls guard Corey Benjamin was placed on the
injured list Wednesday because of a sprained left ankle. He'll miss at least
five games.
</P>
<P>
	   Benjamin, the Bulls' first-round pick in 1998, is averaging 8.9 points and
2.3 rebounds in 29 games this season. He started nine games and has scored in
double-figures 14 times.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bulls made the move after trading Toni Kukoc to the Philadelphia 76ers.
In return, Chicago gets a No. 1 draft pick and John Starks from Golden State, as
well as Bruce Bowen from Philadelphia. The 76ers sent Larry Hughes and Billy
Owens to Golden State.

<HEADLINE> NFL Roundup  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Growing up in Houston, Fred Miller didn't have to search far for heroes on
the offensive line. Now he has the chance to play with Bruce Matthews and for
Mike Munchak as a new member of the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to be a treat to go out and play with them, line up and bleed
and sweat and just have good times and bad times with them," the right tackle
said Wednesday after signing a six-year contract. "It's everything you want in
your football career."
</P>
<P>
	   The $24 million contract and the chance to earn more with incentives also
helped lure Miller to the Titans from the Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   But Miller said it was a thrill for him to play on a line with Matthews, the
man who has played more NFL games than any other offensive lineman, and be
coached by Munchak, now an assistant coach after his career with the former
Houston Oilers franchise.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller was happy to see the two finally reach the Super Bowl last month for
the first time in their football careers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't want them to win. I was glad they made it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The four-year veteran replaces Jon Runyan on the Titans' offensive line.
Runyan signed a six-year, $30 million contract Monday with the Philadelphia
Eagles, becoming the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans offered Runyan a contract close to that, but the Eagles offered
more money earlier in their deal.
</P>
<P>
	   With the money Tennessee saved from not signing Runyan, they also signed
Dallas linebacker Randall Godfrey to a five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Godfrey's deal is for $24 million, according to his agent Ben Dogra.
</P>
<P>
	   "We basically traded Jon Runyan for Fred Miller and Randall Godfrey," Titans
president Jeff Diamond said. "We feel we're a better team for that."
</P>
<P>
	   In other key signings Wednesday, Shannon Sharpe and the Baltimore Ravens
agreed on a deal for the former Denver tight end, and Minnesota re-signed Pro
Bowl punter Mitch Berger.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpe said on his Web site that he has agreed to a four-year contract the
Ravens.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Eller, the Ravens' director of operations, confirmed the team reached an
agreement with the seven-time Pro Bowl selection, but would not provide the
length of the deal or financial terms.
</P>
<P>
	   The Denver Rocky Mountain News reported it was a $14 million deal that
includes a $4.5 million signing bonus. Denver's KUSA-TV reported the contract is
worth $12.8 million, including a $4.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpe, 31, who missed most of last season with Denver because of a broken
collarbone, is the Broncos' career receiving leader with 543 catches for 6,872
yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpe said in a statement that one of the major influences in his decision
to sign with Baltimore was the chance to break the NFL mark for career
receptions by a tight end, set by former Cleveland Browns star Ozzie Newsome.
</P>
<P>
	   Runyan was considered the best free-agent tackle available, but the Titans
saw how well Miller played during the Super Bowl. Miller held Jevon Kearse, the
NFL's defensive rookie of the year, without a sack during the Rams' 23-16
victory.
</P>
<P>
	   That performance more than made up for perhaps the worst game in Miller's
career, which also came against the Titans. Miller was penalized six times for
false starts last Halloween while facing the speedy Kearse in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
	   "So many ironic things have happened this year," Miller said. "This is just
another ironic thing here."
</P>
<P>
	   Miller started 39 games in four seasons with the Rams, including the last
21. He was part of a line that helped the Rams average 321.5 yards a game and
Marshall Faulk gain an NFL-record 2,429 yards from scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
	   Godfrey visited the Jacksonville Jaguars before flying to Nashville. Both
teams desperately wanted the linebacker who led the Cowboys with 143 tackles
last season. Godfrey also had six tackles for loss, a sack and an interception
and started 54 straight games for Dallas over the last four seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jaguars kept calling Godfrey during his two-day visit with the Titans,
but Godfrey said he wanted to make a quick decision and end his free agency by
signing with the AFC champions.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans scheduled a meeting today with their own free-agent linebacker,
Joe Bowden. General manager Floyd Reese said little money remains right now and
that they will have to restructure a couple of contracts to free up enough space
if they want to sign more free agents.
</P>
<P>
	   Berger signed a five-year, $6 million deal that includes a $1.65 million
signing bonus, a record for an NFL punter. The total value of the deal ties
Cleveland's Chris Gardocki as the richest ever signed by a punter.
</P>
<P>
	   Berger was the Vikings' top offseason priority, not only because of his
booming punts and kickoffs that helped them lead the league in opponents'
starting field position, but because they were unable to afford their other
high-profile free agents.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vikings, who began the offseason $20 million over the $62.17 million
salary cap, waived several decorated veterans such as 11-time Pro Bowl guard
Randall McDaniel, lost Pro Bowl center Jeff Christy to Tampa Bay without much of
a fight and told quarterback Jeff George to seek other offers.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, Denver signed cornerback Jeremy Lincoln from the New York Giants
and claimed defensive back Toya Jones off waivers from San Francisco; Carolina
signed defensive end Jay Williams from the Rams; Cincinnati signed Green Bay
defensive end Vaughn Booker to a five-year contract; the Packers signed
defensive end John Thierry away from Cleveland; Miami signed Seattle safety
Brian Walker to a two-year contract; and New Orleans tended a contract offer to
St. Louis Rams linebacker Charlie Clemons.

<HEADLINE> Faith Groups OK'd in Federal Program  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proposed changes in federal literacy programs would not
only guarantee that religious groups could participate, but ensure they wouldn't
have to cover up sacred images at program sites or hire staff that didn't adhere
to their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
	   The $500 million Even Start program, which offers tutoring to preschoolers
and literacy and job training for their parents, was approved by the House
Education and the Workforce Committee on Wednesday. The bill approved by a voice
vote was the latest in a line of recent ``charitable choice'' measures that
would permit religious groups to participate in federally funded social service
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Trying to totally separate the faith of a society from any form of
influence is ridiculous,'' said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., who sponsored the
changes approved by the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   He said religious groups often have the community ties to deliver social
programs such as day care, drug treatment, welfare-to-work and, in this case,
family literacy.
</P>
<P>
	   But critics say such proposals would reverse 250 years of separation of
church and state and would be tantamount to giving certain faiths governmental
approval and making religious belief public policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The courts have never allowed churches to get tax dollars to run
educational programs,'' said Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans
United for Separation of Church and State. ``It is particularly appalling that a
congressional committee thinks it is OK to fund programs that practice religious
discrimination in hiring.''
</P>
<P>
	   Backers of such measures won their first major victory during the 1996
overhaul of federal welfare laws. Religious groups were allowed to deliver
services to the poor. Other programs have followed. The juvenile justice bill
that is tied up in a congressional dispute over gun control would allow
faith-based organizations to participate in programs for troubled teens.
</P>
<P>
	   Souder says the changes in the literacy bill would make groups more
comfortable in providing the services without fear of being sued or threatened
by the main program provider. For example, a Catholic church could leave a
crucifix up on a wall during tutoring or a synagogue would not have to hire
non-Jewish staff to get funding, Souder said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some opponents worry that giving groups more leeway to practice their faiths
can have undue religious influence, particularly over children.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., an education committee member who opposed the
measure, said, ``The practice of federally sanctioned religious discrimination
is wrong for children, it's wrong for adults. It's so wrong, I don't think you
need to differentiate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The literacy programs were one of two renewed Wednesday under the $15
billion federal law that governs programs for children from kindergarten though
12th grade. A funding program for school districts that lose property tax
revenue to federal lands such as military bases was also sent to the full House.

<HEADLINE> Nickelodeon Unveils New Series  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Striking a blow for diversity, the kids' cable network
Nickelodeon has plans for three new series with Hispanic leads.
</P>
<P>
	   The new shows are "a rounding out of our efforts to reflect the world of
kids," said Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Among eight new series for the 2000-2001 season, Nick will launch "Taina," a
multigenerational series about a 14-year-old Hispanic girl in New York City and
another live-action show, "The Brothers Garcia," which revolves around a
Mexican-American family in San Antonio. Told from the perspective of the
youngest of four siblings, "Garcia" is described as an Hispanic "Wonder Years."
</P>
<P>
	   An interactive animated series, "Dora the Explorer," will feature a
7-year-old Hispanic girl who lives inside a computer. In every episode, young
viewers will be invited to participate in an adventure.
</P>
<P>
	   Although no premiere dates were announced Wednesday, the new series are
expected to roll out between this summer and early next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Other new shows include:
</P>
<P>
	   -- "Noah Knows Best," a live-action comedy about New Yorker Noah Beznick and
his sister Megan that focuses on sibling rivalry.
</P>
<P>
	   -- "Invader Zim," a cartoon series about an alien who spies on Earth by
masquerading as a kid and attending elementary school.
</P>
<P>
	   -- "As Told By Ginger," about a sixth-grade girl caught with one foot in
dorkiness and the other in the world of blooming popularity. It's from
Klasky-Csupo, creators of the network's popular "Rugrats," "The Wild
Thornberrys" and "Rocket Power."
</P>
<P>
	   -- "Chalk Zone," which follows the adventures of a boy who discovers a magic
piece of chalk that allows him to enter a world beyond the chalkboard.
</P>
<P>
	   -- "The Fairly Oddparents," which bestows upon 10-year-old Timmy two magical
helpmates: bumbling godparents.
</P>
<P>
	   Nickelodeon next season also will air some 150 new hours of 17 ongoing
series including "Blue's Clues," "Rugrats" and "SpongeBob SquarePants."
</P>
<P>
	   Nickelodeon is the top-rated basic cable channel in households and among
children.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Fight Navy in Puerto Rico  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Residents of the Puerto Rican island of Vieques say they
will continue acting as human shields to try to stop the Navy from dropping
unarmed bombs on a military training ground.
</P>
<P>
	   A delegation of protesters met with lawmakers Wednesday and protested
outside the White House. They charged that President Clinton's order last month
to allow the Navy to resume dropping dummy bombs in Puerto Rico demonstrates a
cavalier and undemocratic disregard for residents who want the military to leave
immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want the Navy out of there,'' said Carlos Zenon, a fishermen who has
organized demonstrations against the Navy. ``They could bomb Staten Island if
they want or Martha's Vineyard.''
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference, Zenon and the other demonstrators promised to continue
staging acts of civil disobedience to stop the Navy from firing dummy weapons on
Vieques, a 51-square-mile island located eight miles off Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
	   At a separate news conference later in the day, Clinton was asked whether he
would be willing to use force to remove protesters who have acted as human
shields on the island. He didn't respond directly but said the people of Puerto
Rico should accept his directive as ``a perfectly reasonable compromise.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I still believe it is a good agreement,'' he said. ``I view this
compromise as an empowerment of the people of Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
	   For some 60 years, the Navy has bombed, shelled and strafed Vieques as a
military training ground. The island's 9,400 residents are sandwiched between a
western zone where the military stores weapons in bunkers and an eastern
training ground where bombings, shellings and mock invasions are staged.
</P>
<P>
	   After an errant bomb killed a civilian security guard and injured four
others last April, protesters moved in. The military exercises were temporarily
suspended, and Puerto Rico demanded the bombing range be shut down.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Clinton reached a deal last month with Puerto Rico's Gov. Pedro
Rossello that allows the Navy to continue training for now, but only using inert
bombs. The agreement calls for a referendum, likely to be held in 2001, that
will give Vieques residents two choices:
</P>
<P>
	   --They can allow the Navy to resume use of the range on its own terms --
including the use of live bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   --Or they can require the Navy to cease all training by May 1, 2003. Until
then, however, the Navy could use the dummy bombs.
</P>
<P>
	   Most observers believe Vieques will vote to evict the Navy.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those protesting Wednesday was Mirta Sarta Rodriguez, the sister of
David Sanes Rodriguez, the security guard who died last April. She wept as she
talked about the loss of her 35-year-old brother.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want the Navy to leave Vieques once and for all,'' she said through a
translator.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters also claim the war games are responsible for a higher cancer
rate of 208 per 100,000 residents, almost double the Puerto Rican average.

<HEADLINE> 1907 Campaign Finance Law Attacked  </HEADLINE>
   By BILL BERGSTROM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The growing number of ``soft money'' donations by
businesses and unions proves that a 93-year-old law banning corporate
contributions to federal candidates is woefully ineffectual, a lawyer argued.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Floyd Abrams urged the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on
Wednesday to strike down the ban since ``spending of large amounts of soft money
destroys the purpose of the campaign finance law, which is to deter corruption
and the appearance of corruption.''
</P>
<P>
	   The term ``soft money'' refers to contributions made to political parties to
be used for business-related expenses, not for a particular candidate's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Abrams represents Renato P. Mariani, former president of Empire Sanitary
Landfill, who was indicted in a wide-ranging campaign finance probe that led to
a prison sentence for state Rep. Frank Serafini.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariani has sued the federal government, contending the ban on corporate
contributions to candidates is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say the law permits parties to spend millions of dollars on
so-called ``issue ads'' that make veiled attacks on candidates without directly
advocating their defeat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This statute does not work,'' Abrams told the court.

<P>
	   The chief judge of the appeals court, Edward Becker, said such arguments
were understandable when ``you have soft money that is off the charts'' and
``issue ads in which the difference may be gossamer between addressing an issue
and supporting a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   But attorney David Kolker of the Federal Elections Commission said it is up
to Congress, not the courts, to change the law if they think it needs
improvement.

<P>
	   Overturning the ban and allowing corporations to make secret contributions
directly to candidates, he said, would ``throw the baby out with the bath
water.''

<P>
	   Mariani and other former Empire officials were charged with funneling
corporate money from the landfill to candidates for federal office, including
President Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
	   While that case was pending, Mariani sued the to overturn the corporate
contributions law.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Thomas Vanaskie sought an appeals court ruling, saying
in a 144-page memorandum in October that he found many of Mariani's arguments to
be valid.
</P>
<P>
	   Soft-money contributions and loopholes have ``essentially rendered the
contributions and spending limits meaningless,'' Vanaskie wrote, questioning
whether the 1907 ban still meets the legal standard that it serve a
``significant state interest.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Breaks Spending Records  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain's surge in fund raising has narrowed the
gap between him and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has raised and spent a record
amount of money for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to McCain, who is raising $150,000 to $200,000 a day via the Internet
in addition to his big-ticket fund-raisers, said he had $10 million in the bank
as of mid-February, including money borrowed against the federal funds he will
receive. Bush, who began the year with $31.4 million in the bank, had $20
million as of Jan. 31 and has been spending at a rate of $3 million per week.
</P>
<P>
	   At the start of the year, Bush had $31.4 million in the bank, while McCain
had $1.5 million plus $4.2 million in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
	   This narrows the financial gap between Bush and McCain as the candidates
prepare for the long list of primaries scheduled for March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The most important statistic is the money in the bank,'' said Larry
Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a research
group that studies money and campaigns. ``It's going to be much more dependent
on money than anything we've seen before in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is trying to replenish his funds, having already raised a campaign
record of more than $70 million. He is planning four or five fund-raising events
in March, campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   He needs the money because he has also set records for spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spent $13 million in January, bringing his total to $50 million for the
campaign, well over the $42.2 million Bob Dole spent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, meanwhile, spent $12 million over the past six weeks -- almost as
much as the $14 million he spent during all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is when you're supposed to spend your money,'' McCain spokesman
Howard Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because he is accepting federal funds for his campaign, McCain has a limit
on how much he can spend. The limit is around $40 million, plus additional funds
for some legal and accounting costs. McCain so far has spent around $26 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is not accepting federal funds for his campaign and can keep raising
and spending as much as he wants.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush adviser Haley Barbour, former chairman of the Republican National
Committee, said there was nothing unusual in holding a new round of
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's pretty typical for campaigns to raise money all the way through,''
Barbour said. ``I've never known a campaign that didn't.''
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking in South Carolina, where he is competing against McCain in
Saturday's GOP primary, Bush said he was not concerned about his campaign
spending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've got a plan in place that's going to enable me to stay in this race
for the long run,'' Bush said. ``We have been fighting in every primary state,
we're on plan and I think I've got a good chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
	   Much of Bush's money is going for television. Fleischer said Bush was on the
air in seven states: South Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Washington, North
Dakota, Virginia and California. Opinsky said McCain is on the air in five
states: South Carolina, Michigan, Virginia, Washington and California.
</P>
<P>
	   Another Bush adviser, former Rep. Bill Paxon, noted that the campaign was
spending money not only to win the nomination but the general election as well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor Bush has done exactly the right things, building a national
campaign focusing on winning the White House,'' Paxon said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Premier To Testify  </HEADLINE>
   By ALVIN UNG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia's prime minister said today he would
testify in the sodomy trial of his ousted deputy if a judge rules that he must
-- even though he suspects it would be a ``political stunt.''
</P>
<P>
	   High Court Judge Ariffin Jaka was expected to hear arguments today in a
Kuala Lumpur courtroom on whether Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad should be
forced to take the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it is relevant, I suppose I will have to go,'' Mahathir told reporters
after inaugurating a meeting of freight operators. ``That is the law, and there
is nothing I can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he added, if it is not relevant ``then it will be a kind of political
stunt.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mahathir said the desire to drag him to court appeared to be driven more by
politics than by law. ``I don't know much about the case,'' he said. ``But
apparently there is some political nuance in the desire to put me on the
stand.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mahathir fired Anwar Ibrahim as deputy prime minister in September 1998, and
his administration put the former politician on trial for abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
	   Anwar is serving a six-year jail term for corruption and faces another 20
years if found guilty of sodomy, a crime in this predominantly Muslim country.
</P>
<P>
	   Anwar claims the charges are part of a political conspiracy launched by
Mahathir to end his challenge to the prime minister's 18-year rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Anwar's defense wants Mahathir to answer questions about the allegations he
has made against his former deputy. But prosecutors have cited a rarely used law
under the Southeast Asian country's Evidence Act to argue that Mahathir's
testimony would not be relevant to the sex trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Karpal Singh accused Mahathir of setting a bad example by
``dragging his feet'' about testifying. A court appearance by the leader would
send a message about the fairness of Malaysia's judiciary, he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In this country even the king can be taken to court ... and Mahathir is no
king,'' Karpal said, as onlookers at the courthouse broke into applause.
</P>
<P>
	   Ariffin said at the close of Wednesday's hearing that the prime minister
should be prepared to come to the court at any time. He is expected to give his
ruling on whether the prime minister must testify after hearing arguments from
both defense and prosecution lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of people hoping to see Mahathir face-to-face with Anwar for the
first time since Anwar was fired gathered outside the courthouse early today to
grab a seat in the public gallery. There were no signs of extra security.
</P>
<P>
	   Anwar and his adopted brother are accused of forcing Anwar's former family
driver, Azizan Abu Bakar, to have sex with them between January and March 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Azizan has accused Anwar of repeatedly sodomizing him, claiming he became
Anwar's ``sex slave'' more than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   A defense witness has testified that Azizan and others were paid money by
Mahathir's political secretary to come forward with the false allegations.

<HEADLINE> Villagers skeptical of safety claim after steam release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) - While many people might choose to live somewhere
other than near a nuclear power plant, George Kiljarian said he has grown used
to it.
<P>
	   "I'm a fatalist," said the Ossining man, a retired attorney who lives near
the Indian Point 2 nuclear reactor. "I made it through World War II. ... If
they've never had a problem in 26 years I guess that's all right."
</P>
<P>
	   But other neighbors are concerned about being so close to Indian Point 2
because they weren't notified Tuesday night when the plant leaked a small amount
of radioactive steam - the most serious accident in its 26-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, a group of local activists plan to rally this afternoon at
Indian Point's front gate in opposition of the plant reopening ever again.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm definitely afraid," said Regina Erben, just four doors from the plant
entrance. "I'm afraid to brush my teeth. I'm afraid to make the coffee."
</P>
<P>
	   Plant officials said the steam was barely radioactive, describing its escape
from the nuclear reactor as "momentary and minuscule." They added there was no
health danger, no need to warn nearby residents, no reason to keep the kids home
from school.
</P>
<P>
	   But some remained upset that a hazardous response effort was undertaken
without any notice being given to neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   "Where were the sirens?" asked David Coviello, 55, who lives two doors from
the plant gate. "I have a 7-year-old son, an 18-year-old daughter."
</P>
<P>
	   Salvatore Simone said officials should notify residents of any accident,
regardless of its seriousness. "I should decide for myself," he said. "I might
have gotten into the car with my family and gotten away."
</P>
<P>
	   Officials in four counties agreed that the accident was too small to merit
sounding warning sirens, said Westchester's deputy county executive, Jay
Hashmall. County Executive Andrew Spano was in Los Angeles, coincidentally to
examine that city's emergency operations center.
</P>
<P>
	   Guidelines from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission "call for the sounding of
sirens only when some protective action is needed," such as evacuations or
stay-inside orders, Hashmall said.
</P>
<P>
	   No such measures were needed Tuesday because the radioactivity released was
"completely unmeasurable," said Con Ed Vice President Steve Quinn.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, Con Ed declared an alert, a first for the plant, located on
the Hudson River about 35 miles north of Times Square and with 15.5 million
people within a 50-mile radius. An alert is one of four categories of nuclear
events identified by the NRC. In order from least serious to most serious they
are: unusual event, alert, site area emergency and general emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   The only general emergency at a U.S. nuclear plant was the March 1979
accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   Mindy Landau of the NRC said an average of three or four alerts are declared
a year among the nation's 103 operating reactors.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's alert was lifted just before 7 p.m. Wednesday, when water
temperatures cooled to below 200 degrees. Workers were then to begin
investigating the cause of the leak and determining how long the plant would be
idle.
</P>
<P>
	   Quinn said the leak was in a tube carrying hot, slightly radioactive water
through a pool of cooler water, which is thereby turned into steam. The steam is
used to turn a turbine, generating electricity. The plant produces about a
seventh of the power Con Ed supplies to its 3 million customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the hot water was under high pressure, it turned into steam as it
escaped from the tube at about 7:30 p.m. It was vented through the building's
roof, but a radiation detector in the vent sounded an alarm and automatically
sealed the vent, so the slightly radioactive steam escaped into the air for only
a few seconds, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Measurements taken around the plant found normal background radiation, Quinn
said, and workers were not exposed to anything above what they get in a normal
workday. No one was injured, he said, and "There is no danger to the health and
welfare of the general public."
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Jacobs, executive director of the Westchester People's Action
Coalition, said the Indian Point plants are old and failing and should be
investigated independently of the NRC.
</P>
<P>
	   NRC spokesman Neil Sheehan said steel-alloy tubes like the one that leaked
"have been known to develop leaks from time to time." Con Ed's Robert Leonard
said the tubes at Indian Point 2 were the originals from 1974. In the past, when
leaks were found, a tube might simply be plugged and not used because the
generator does not need all of the 200 tubes it has, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A slight increase in the generator's normal leakage - about a half-gallon a
day more than the normal 2 gallons a day in comparable generators - was detected
several weeks ago, The New York Times reported today. But NRC inspectors
permanently stationed at the plant never indicated that the increase was serious
enough to warrant shutting the plant, James Baumstark, Con Ed's vice president
for nuclear engineering, told The Times.
</P>
<P>
	   The nearby Indian Point 3 reactor, owned by the state Power Authority, has
been tentatively purchased for $806 million by Entergy Corp. of New Orleans,
which said Monday that it was also interested in buying Indian Point 2. Con Ed
has said it is seeking a buyer for Indian Point 2. Entergy spokesman Carl
Crawford said Wednesday that Tuesday's leak had no effect on either deal.

Protesters Fight Navy in Puerto Rico
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Residents of the Puerto Rican island of Vieques say they
will continue acting as human shields to try to stop the Navy from dropping
unarmed bombs on a military training ground. A delegation of protesters met with
lawmakers Wednesday and protested outside the White House. They charged that
President Clinton's order last month to allow the Navy to resume dropping dummy
bombs in Puerto Rico demonstrates a cavalier and undemocratic disregard for
residents who want the military to leave immediately. "We want the Navy out of
there," said Carlos Zenon, a fishermen who has organized demonstrations against
the Navy. "They could bomb Staten Island if they want or Martha's Vineyard."

tragedy caused by deadly tornadoes that swept through southwest Georgia this
week. McClelland and his wife Mary Ann, both 64, were killed Monday when
twisters struck their rural farm house. Mrs. McClelland, director of the Grady
County Health Department, was just one month shy of retirement. Union Hill
Primitive Baptist Church couldn't fit all of the mourners inside its church,
which seats 200. Speakers were set up outside so others could hear the tributes.

	   RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif. (AP) -- A DC-8 cargo plane crashed into an automobile
wrecking yard while trying to make an emergency landing Wednesday, bursting into
flames and killing the three crew members aboard the aircraft, investigators
said. Those on board the Emery Worldwide plane were dead by the time fire crews
arrived at the site about 1 mile east of Mather Field, said fire Capt. Dan
Haverty. "There was no chance of rescue," Haverty said. The plane carried three
crew members: the pilot, first captain and a flight engineer, all believed to be
Emery employees, said company spokesman James Allen.

Clinton Looks to India, Pakistan Aid
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is leaving the door open -- slightly --
to making a visit to Pakistan and offering to help mediate the volatile Kashmir
dispute Pakistan has with India. Since India never has accepted outside
intervention, the president's offer at a news conference Wednesday to intercede
as he has in the Arab-Israeli dispute and in Northern Ireland is probably
academic. But asked whether he would be willing, Clinton responded, "absolutely,
I would," and then said "unless we are asked by both parties to help, we can't
get involved."

Internet Racism Concerns U.N.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   GENEVA (AP) -- The United States could do more to curb the use of the
Internet for racist material while upholding freedom of speech, experts said
Wednesday at a U.N. meeting. Speakers noted the legal challenges of controlling
Internet content in, and originating from, the United States, where the First
Amendment of the constitution guarantees freedom of speech. Although the U.S.
government cannot ban racist speech outright, it could impose "reasonable
restrictions," such as requiring a permit that would force publishers to
identify the content of their sites, Swiss-based information technology law
expert David Rosenthal argued.

Reinforcements Arrive in Kosovo
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.N. police reinforcements began
arriving in this ethnically divided town on Wednesday, following two weeks of
violence that left nine people dead and dozens injured. A total of 300 officers
are to be sent to Kosovska Mitrovica, top U.N. administrator Bernard Kouchner
said. With the upsurge in violence, more reinforcements were needed, and not
just in Kosovska Mitrovica, but throughout the province of Kosovo, U.N.
Assistant Secretary-General Hedi Annabi told the Security Council on Wednesday
at the United Nations. A rocket attack on a U.N. bus which killed two Serb
civilians on Feb. 2 sparked the latest round of violence.

Protesters Fight Navy in Puerto Rico
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Residents of the Puerto Rican island of Vieques say they
will continue acting as human shields to try to stop the Navy from dropping
unarmed bombs on a military training ground. A delegation of protesters met with
lawmakers Wednesday and protested outside the White House. They charged that
President Clinton's order last month to allow the Navy to resume dropping dummy
bombs in Puerto Rico demonstrates a cavalier and undemocratic disregard for
residents who want the military to leave immediately. "We want the Navy out of
there," said Carlos Zenon, a fishermen who has organized demonstrations against
the Navy. "They could bomb Staten Island if they want or Martha's Vineyard."

twisters struck their rural farm house. Mrs. McClelland, director of the Grady
County Health Department, was just one month shy of retirement. Union Hill
Primitive Baptist Church couldn't fit all of the mourners inside its church,

Clinton Looks to India, Pakistan Aid
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is leaving the door open -- slightly --
to making a visit to Pakistan and offering to help mediate the volatile Kashmir
dispute Pakistan has with India. Since India never has accepted outside
intervention, the president's offer at a news conference Wednesday to intercede
as he has in the Arab-Israeli dispute and in Northern Ireland is probably
academic. But asked whether he would be willing, Clinton responded, "absolutely,
I would," and then said "unless we are asked by both parties to help, we can't
get involved."

Internet Racism Concerns U.N.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   GENEVA (AP) -- The United States could do more to curb the use of the
Internet for racist material while upholding freedom of speech, experts said
Wednesday at a U.N. meeting. Speakers noted the legal challenges of controlling
Internet content in, and originating from, the United States, where the First
Amendment of the constitution guarantees freedom of speech. Although the U.S.
government cannot ban racist speech outright, it could impose "reasonable
restrictions," such as requiring a permit that would force publishers to
identify the content of their sites, Swiss-based information technology law
expert David Rosenthal argued.

<HEADLINE> IOC Rips Sydney Organizers  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A top IOC official accused Sydney organizers today of
undermining their own corporate sponsors and misleading the public by describing
the marketing programs for the 2000 Games as a failure.
</P>
<P>
	``Is there anything about the word `success' you don't understand?''
International Olympic Committee vice president Dick Pound said in an unusually
blunt public criticism of an Olympic organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
	Pound blasted Sydney organizers for their ``dysfunctional relationship'' with
local sponsors and described the committee's frequently raised revenue targets
as ``nuts.''
</P>
<P>
	Michael Knight, president of the Sydney organizing committee (SOCOG), retorted
by suggesting that Pound's outburst marked the start of his political campaign
to succeed Juan Antonio Samaranch as IOC president.
</P>
<P>
	``If one candidate has a point of departure, that's politics,'' Knight said.
``I'm never surprised by anything Dick says. I've known him for quite a while.
We've had our moments from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
	The sharp exchanges came as SOCOG announced another $22.8 million in budget
cuts, and as UPS -- one of the games' major sponsors -- was dropped as Sydney's
Olympic ticket distributor in Australia.
</P>
<P>
	With only seven months until the start of the Sydney Games, Pound's remarks
were sure to put further pressure on an organizing committee that has been
reeling from a series of recent controversies over ticketing, budget shortfalls
and political disputes.
</P>
<P>
	Pound, who negotiates the IOC's television and marketing deals, said Sydney's
marketing program was the most successful in Olympic history -- generating total
global revenues of $2.6 billion in three years.
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG has repeatedly cited a shortfall in sponsorship revenues, including a
latest figure of around $63 million out of its total budget of $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
	``They insist on calling it a failure and a marketing shortfall,'' Pound said.
``There simply is no marketing failure.''
</P>
<P>
	``We don't understand whether they don't understand or whether there is some
other agenda to be bad mouthing a very successful program. You can't undermine
your private sector and sponsors like this.''
</P>
<P>
	Sydney's original local sponsorship target was $207 million, and the program
has so far generated more than $300 million. But SOCOG, confident of being able
to raise much more money, has raised the revenue target several times -- to a
peak of $460 million.
</P>
<P>
	Pound chided SOCOG for treating sponsorship dollars as a ``milk cow that could
be returned to again, again and again.''
</P>
<P>
	``The first time (SOCOG raised the revenue target) we thought it was wildly
optimistic,'' Pound said. ``The second time we thought it was foolishly
optimistic. The third time we knew it was nuts and said so. It proved to be
right.''
</P>
<P>
	Pound said sponsors had approached the IOC to complain about SOCOG's attitude.
</P>
<P>
	``What you see from a distance is a dysfunctional relationship between the
organizing committee and the sponsors,'' Pound said. ``There's got to be a
bridge built to make sure these games are a success for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
	Pound said his remarks were directed at the ``highest level of SOCOG,''
including Knight.
</P>
<P>
	``I think Michael Knight has done a great job, but not in everything,'' he
said. ``For some reasons I don't understand, he says the marketing program is a
failure, and that's the reason they had to cut back and the IOC is taking all
this money away from SOCOG. It's just not right.''
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the New South Wales government agreed to forego $19 million
and the AOC $7 million to help SOCOG's budget-cutting efforts.
</P>
<P>
	``Making a profit is not the objective,'' Pound said. ``Our advice is: Wait
until the end of the games before you spend profits.''
</P>
<P>
	Knight, meanwhile, said that today's cuts would balance SOCOG's budget without
eliminating any jobs or affecting sports venues or operations for the games.
</P>
<P>
	``There has been no radical surgery here,'' he said. ``It's nip and tuck rather
than amputations.''
</P>
<P>
	Knight also announced that UPS, the American delivery service company, had been
dropped from the role of distributing Olympic tickets to Australian customers.
</P>
<P>
	Knight said UPS declined to meet SOCOG's requirements for delivering all
tickets door-to-door. SOCOG was negotiating with three other companies to step
in, he said.
</P>
<P>
	UPS will continue to deliver tickets from the printer to designated
distribution points.

<HEADLINE> Vaccine Panel Changes Recommendation  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- In a sign that cost is becoming a factor in making
immunization policy, a government advisory committee has changed its initial
recommendation and will require fewer children to receive an expensive vaccine.
</P>
<P>
	   The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on
Immunization Policy recommended that the vaccine Prevenar be administered to all
children under 2 and those under 5 who are at high risk of contracting illnesses
such as meningitis.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee voted in October to recommend Prevenar, which costs $232 per
four-dose series, for all children under 5.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's 7-4 vote in favor of changing the recommendation came after a
lengthy discussion of cost implications that included a presentation from a
representative of health insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to children under 2, the committee recommended vaccinations for
children from 2 to 5 who have had frequent ear infections, are socially or
economically disadvantaged or attend group child care. Children older than 2
only need one dose, which costs $58.
</P>
<P>
	   It was only the second time the committee has ever debated the potential
economic impact of a vaccine, even while some committee members felt the matter
shouldn't even be considered.
</P>
<P>
	   "This could save lives no matter what the age or the cost, and the
discussion about at what price this becomes reasonable is indecipherable to me,"
said Dr. Paul Offit, chief of infectious diseases at The Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to recommend it first and figure out how to pay for it second," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other committee members argued about realities faced by the public and
private sector alike, especially with the hefty price tag of the vaccine. The
federal government pays for about half of all immunizations.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're having to look at cost more and more," said Dr. John Modlin, the
committee's chairman and a professor of pediatric medicine at Dartmouth
University. "We know (Prevenar) will be expensive in the short term, but over
the long haul ... we could see a lowering of pediatric health costs as a result
of this."
</P>
<P>
	   Federal approval of the vaccine is expected this week. Manufacturer American
Home Products Inc. plans to begin marketing Prevenar this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Prevenar fights the bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae -- the leading cause
of pneumonia, meningitis and the millions of ear infections that lead to crammed
pediatrician waiting rooms every year.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a study, the vaccine reduced ear infections by 9 percent.
Doctor visits by those who were diagnosed as having chronic ear infections and
took the vaccine were down 20 percent, and there was a 20 percent reduction in
the number of children who needed tube implants to fight the infections.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Heating Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is asking Congress for $600 million in
emergency assistance to help people meet heating oil costs and releasing an
additional $125 million for more immediate help to low-income families.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Americans have always pulled together to help their fellow citizens in
time of need,'' Clinton said Wednesday at a news conference. ``Now the families
of the Northeast need our help too, and we must act.''
</P>
<P>
	   His announcement came as Energy Secretary Bill Richardson met in Boston and
Bangor, Maine, with New England state energy officials and oil industry
representatives.
</P>
<P>
	   New England officials had been lobbying the president to release the
remaining low-income, or LIHEAP, assistance funds. The administration already
had released $200 million, distributed nationwide. The latest money was being
earmarked for hardest hit states, mostly in the Northeast where people rely
heavily on oil to heat their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   There are between 10 million and 14 million homes that are heated by oil,
according to industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Northeast lawmakers also have urged the administration to release oil from
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but Richardson has said repeatedly he has no
such intentions. The reserve is designed for supply disruptions and not to
influence prices, administration officials have maintained.
</P>
<P>
	   There is also concern that if the strategic reserve were tapped it would
make it more difficult to convince OPEC oil producers to increase production
when they meet next month to consider future production strategies. OPEC
producers a year ago agreed to reduce production by 4.3 million barrels a day,
triggering prices to soar to $30 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he ordered the release of the last $125 million in the Low
Income Home Energy Assistance Program for this year. While the money is
earmarked for the poor, Clinton said states facing the biggest heating oil
problem could adjust the requirements so some middle income families also might
qualify.
</P>
<P>
	   The LIHEAP funds are normally available to people whose incomes are no
higher than 150 percent of the poverty line, or 60 percent of the medium income
in their states.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton said middle income families also ``are really hurt by an
increase of $200 to $300 a month in their home heating bill'' and should be
considered eligible for assistance. States can raise the income limits, he said.

<HEADLINE> Small Business Care Plans Under Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House-passed bill intended to make it cheaper for small
businesses to provide health insurance actually would boost premiums for some
and do little to trim the number of uninsured Americans, according to a
Congressional Budget Office report.
</P>
<P>
	   James Baumgardner, the nonpartisan CBO's acting deputy assistant director
for health policy, told the House Small Business Committee on Wednesday that the
bill would have little impact on the 43 million Americans who do not have health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On balance, about 330,000 more people would be covered through small-firm
employment than would otherwise have been the case,'' he said. ``That represents
a 1.3 percent increase in coverage through small firms.''
</P>
<P>
	   The measure's chief supporter, Rep. Jim Talent, R-Mo., called the study ``an
insult to the intelligence of small business.''
</P>
<P>
	   When the bill was introduced last year, supporters said it would allow small
firms to band together to pool risks and curb costs while expanding health care
coverage for the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
	   But the report said new plans would attract healthier workers and leave
sicker individuals in the existing pool, increasing costs for those left in the
traditional insurance market.

<HEADLINE> Low-Power FM Station Rule Attacked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's broadcasting lobby has asked an appeals court
to set aside a rule adopted by federal regulators to create hundreds of new
low-power FM stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The petition filed Wednesday in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia claims that the decision last month by the Federal
Communications Commission to authorize the stations is ``arbitrary, capricious
and otherwise contrary to law.''
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the National Association of Broadcasters, which made the appeal,
said the FCC's plan would cause significant interference to existing FM
stations. Broadcasters have opposed the idea since its inception, saying their
testing showed serious harm to the sound of existing stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC says its own tests demonstrate that low-power service can be
introduced without harm to FM radio. Last month, it adopted rules so that it
could begin by summer awarding noncommercial, educational licenses to groups
that want to operate 100-watt and 10-watt stations. That's far less than the
6,000 watts to 100,000 watts at which most FM stations now operate.

<HEADLINE> IRS: $2B in 1996 Refunds Unclaimed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than $2 billion in unclaimed 1996 tax refunds is
sitting in government accounts and it's still not too late for almost 1.6
million taxpayers to get what they're owed.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Internal Revenue Service cautioned Wednesday that these tardy
taxpayers have until April 15 of this year to file their late returns and still
get a refund. After that date, they still have to file a tax return but they
won't get their refund.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The law generally provides for refunds only if taxpayers file returns
within three years,'' said IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti. ``We want people
to get the refunds they deserve, but they have to file tax returns in order to
claim them.''
</P>
<P>
	   There are some catches: the IRS would hold any 1996 refund if taxpayers also
haven't filed returns for 1997 and 1998, and the amount could be reduced for any
amount of tax still owed for those years. There is no penalty for filing a late
tax return in which a refund is owed, since penalties are based on unpaid taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Taxpayers who are owed a 1996 refund also must ensure the return is received
by the IRS by April 15, not just postmarked by that date.

<HEADLINE> Two Air Force Jets Crash in Arizona  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YUMA, Ariz. (AP) -- Two Air Force F-16 fighter jets from military bases in
Arizona and Georgia crashed during training exercises, but the pilots in both
managed to eject safely.
</P>
<P>
	   The accidents involving the $20 million aircraft occurred Wednesday. Both
were under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona, Maj. Anthony Barrell, from Luke Air Force Base near Glendale,
was flying over the Barry M. Goldwater bombing range in southwestern Arizona
near Yuma.
</P>
<P>
	   Barrell was flying as part of a four-jet formation. But before the start of
an aerial engagement, Barrell radioed he had a problem and turned the jet toward
the Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field to recover, a base spokesman said. He
ejected en route to Gila Bend.
</P>
<P>
	   At Luke, the world's largest F-16 training base, all F-16s were grounded
until a cause for the crash can be determined. Wednesday's crash was the eighth
since the fall 1998 involving a jet flying a mission from base west of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
	   Brig. Gen. John Barry, of Luke, said that with availability of the vast 2.7
million-acre Goldwater Range, Luke flies its planes the way they are flown in
combat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So, if they're going to start showing the cracks someplace in the system,
they're probably going to show here,'' Barry said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Georgia, two pilots managed to eject safely from an F-16 jet from Moody
Air Force Base on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Charles B. Kearney and 1st Lt. Christoph Hutchins were participating in
night-vision goggle training when they were forced to eject, said 1st Lt. DeDe
Halfhill, a base spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   The F-16 crashed in Donalsonville, about 90 miles away.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots were transported back to Moody by helicopter for medical
evaluation, Halfhill said.

<HEADLINE> Paper: HIV Grant Raises Questions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- The former head of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's HIV vaccine unit awarded an $8 million research grant to a company
that hired him only a few months later, a newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, former CDC official Dr. William Heyward became the vice
president for international clinical studies at VaxGen Inc., a vaccine maker
based in Brisbane, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   CDC and VaxGen officials confirmed Wednesday that Heyward played a key role
in earmarking $8 million in funds in October for trials of a vaccine
manufactured by VaxGen, according to today's editions of the Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
	   The money is to be used at five U.S. trial sites for AIDSVAX, the only HIV
vaccine undergoing advanced testing. It is designed to control HIV infection by
generating a type of protein that may be able to prevent the virus from
attaching to immune cells.
</P>
<P>
	   Heyward could not be reached for comment Wednesday by the newspaper. VaxGen
and CDC officials said Heyward had cleared his role in the grant allocation with
CDC attorneys.
</P>
<P>
	   Don Francis, VaxGen's president, said he and Heyward had discussed the
possibility of Heyward's employment with VaxGen for about two years, but said
they halted negotiations before the October decision to avoid a conflict of
interest.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC's general counsel office, however, is reviewing whether
post-employment restrictions policies would apply to the VaxGen matter, a
spokesman for the health agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Rep. John Porter, R.-Ill., who chairs a House Appropriations
subcommittee on biomedical research, said Heyward's role in the AIDSVAX trial
grant raises questions of a conflict of interests.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani attacks President Clinton; Candidate Clinton discusses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani took his
campaign for U.S. Senate to chilly upstate and blasted President Clinton, the
husband of his Democratic opponent, for not releasing the nation's oil reserves
to reduce home heating oil prices.
<P>
	   "What's happening right now to our home heating oil prices is outrageous,"
Giuliani told a group of Republican officials and supporters at a Plattsburgh
restaurant Wednesday, as snow fell outside and the temperature hovered in the
20s.
</P>
<P>
	   "He could stand up to OPEC and he's refusing to do that," Giuliani said of
the president.
</P>

	   Meanwhile, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was on Giuliani's turf, laying
out her goals for the race during an interview with journalist Charlie Rose in
front of Manhattan audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Rose, who is host of a show on PBS and is a correspondent on CBS's "60
Minutes II," asked what Mrs. Clinton would do if she lost the race to Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well, I am going to win," she said without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
	   She also said she did not plan to use the Senate as a springboard to return
to the White House as president.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to serve my full six-year term, and I have learned that senators
have a whole lot more privacy than presidents," she added, getting a laugh from
the mostly friendly audience of about 900 people, who repeatedly interrupted her
comments with chuckles and applause.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has criticized the president for refusing to dip into the nation's
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ease the price crunch on consumers.
Administration officials have maintained that the reserve is designed for supply
disruptions and not to influence prices.
</P>
<P>
	   While the first lady also has called for using some of the oil reserves to
help reduce prices, Giuliani aides believe that by attacking her husband they
can boost the mayor's standing while hurting Mrs. Clinton's Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries limiting
production, the cost of home heating oil in New York has risen from a statewide
average of 90.6 cents a gallon in February of last year to $2.01 a gallon as of
last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before Giuliani's event, the president announced he was making another
$125 million available for immediate help to poor people nationwide pay their
heating oil bills.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, in Manhattan on Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton spoke about her work as
first lady. She said that although she failed to reform health care, she was
able to work on lower-profile issues like adoption, foster care and a program to
provide low-income children with health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was more acceptable for me to work behind the scenes," she said. "We've
got a problem with ..."
</P>
<P>
	   "Strong women?" Rose asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "You say that, I wouldn't say that," she answered. "I think it's a problem
with the role of first lady. It's not a job. It's a role, which people mold to
their desires and interests, which I think is appropriate, and someday the first
man will have the same options."
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert visited New York City and
offered words of praise for his friend Giuliani, although he said he was not
making an endorsement in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need a great friend for Jerusalem and of all the public figures I know
in America, the one I trust most, is the greatest friend of Jerusalem in the
United States, is Rudolph Giuliani," Olmert said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   In a swipe at Mrs. Clinton, Olmert said Giuliani has not had to apologize
"for anything he said or didn't say, for anything that he did or didn't do."
Mrs. Clinton had been criticized by some Jewish groups for her silence during a
speech by the wife of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat charging Israeli troops
with gassing Palestinian children. She later came out against the remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Her campaign did not answer messages left seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> CDC Move Raises Impropriety Issue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- The former head of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's HIV vaccine unit approved an $8 million grant for research on a
vaccine whose manufacturer hired him months later, the Chicago Tribune reported
today. He denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   CDC and VaxGen Inc. officials confirmed Wednesday that Dr. William Heyward
played a key role in earmarking $8 million for AIDSVAX trials in October, the
Tribune reported. He became VaxGen's vice president for international clinical
studies in January.
</P>
<P>
	   AIDSVAX, the only HIV vaccine undergoing advanced testing, is designed to
control HIV infection by generating a type of protein that may be able to
prevent the virus from attaching to immune cells.
</P>
<P>
	   VaxGen and CDC officials said Heyward had cleared his role in the grant
allocation with CDC attorneys.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with The Associated Press today, Heyward insisted there was
no conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Heyward said the CDC funded only six of the 60 research clinics where tests
on the vaccine are being conducted.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, he said, other CDC officials also approved the agency's
participation, and his own decisions on the trials had nothing to do with his
impending departure to work for VaxGen, a vaccine maker based in Brisbane,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   "I made no decisions myself that dictated where something would be done or
not," he said by telephone from his home in Georgia. "My advice was that CDC
should be involved in this trial. But I don't care what vaccine it was, I would
have said the same thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Don Francis, VaxGen's president, said he and Heyward had discussed the
possibility of Heyward's employment with VaxGen for about two years, but he said
they halted negotiations before the October decision to avoid a conflict of
interest.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tribune quoted a CDC spokesman as saying the Atlanta-based health
agency's general counsel office is reviewing whether post-employment
restrictions policies would apply to the VaxGen matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Heyward said those restrictions bar him from representing VaxGen on
government activities in which he was involved while with the CDC. "I am abiding
by that," he said. "I'm playing this strictly by the rules. There've been no
breaches."
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., who chairs a House Appropriations subcommittee on
biomedical research, said Heyward's role in the AIDSVAX trial grant raises
questions of a conflict of interests.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes More Heating Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is asking Congress for $600 million in
emergency assistance to help people meet heating-oil costs and releasing an
additional $125 million for more immediate help to low-income families.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Americans have always pulled together to help their fellow citizens in
time of need,'' Clinton said Wednesday at a news conference. ``Now the families
of the Northeast need our help too, and we must act.''
</P>
<P>
	   His announcement came as Energy Secretary Bill Richardson met in Boston and
Bangor, Maine, with New England state energy officials and oil industry
representatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said the federal government, the oil industry and ``everybody was
caught napping'' before the latest energy crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody a year ago could predict that prices would go from $10 a barrel to
$30,'' Richardson said today on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' ``We had an
unusually cold winter. There were a lot of delivery and transportation problems,
especially for home heating oil in the Northeast. ... But it's not that we
didn't have a response. We have a response.''
</P>
<P>
	   New England officials had been lobbying the president to release the
remaining low-income, or LIHEAP, assistance funds. The administration already
had released $200 million, distributed nationwide. The latest money was being
earmarked for hardest-hit states, mostly in the Northeast where people rely
heavily on oil to heat their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 10 million and 14 million homes are heated by oil, according to
industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Northeast lawmakers also have urged the administration to release oil from
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but Richardson has said repeatedly he has no
such intentions. The reserve is designed for supply disruptions and not to
influence prices, administration officials have maintained.
</P>
<P>
	   There is also concern that if the strategic reserve were tapped it would
make it more difficult to convince the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to increase production at a meeting next month to consider future
production strategies. OPEC producers a year ago agreed to reduce output by 4.3
million barrels a day, triggering prices to soar to $30 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said he ordered the release of the last $125 million in the Low
Income Home Energy Assistance Program for this year. While the money is
earmarked for the poor, Clinton said states facing the biggest heating-oil
problem could adjust the requirements so some middle-income families also might
qualify.
</P>
<P>
	   The LIHEAP funds are normally available to people whose incomes are no
higher than 150 percent of the poverty line, or 60 percent of the median income
in their states.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton said middle-income families also ``are really hurt by an
increase of $200 to $300 a month in their home heating bill'' and should be
considered eligible for assistance. States can raise the income limits, he said.

<HEADLINE> Faith Groups OK'd in Federal Program  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proposed changes in federal literacy programs would not
only guarantee that religious groups could participate, but ensure they wouldn't
have to cover up sacred images at program sites or hire staff that didn't adhere
to their beliefs.
</P>
<P>
	   The $500 million Even Start program, which offers tutoring to preschoolers
and literacy and job training for their parents, was approved by the House
Education and the Workforce Committee on Wednesday. The bill approved by a voice
vote was the latest in a line of recent ``charitable choice'' measures that
would permit religious groups to participate in federally funded social service
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Trying to totally separate the faith of a society from any form of
influence is ridiculous,'' said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., who sponsored the
changes approved by the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   He said religious groups often have the community ties to deliver social
programs such as day care, drug treatment, welfare-to-work and, in this case,
family literacy.
</P>
<P>
	   But critics say such proposals would reverse 250 years of separation of
church and state and would be tantamount to giving certain faiths governmental
approval and making religious belief public policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The courts have never allowed churches to get tax dollars to run
educational programs,'' said Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans
United for Separation of Church and State. ``It is particularly appalling that a
congressional committee thinks it is OK to fund programs that practice religious
discrimination in hiring.''
</P>
<P>
	   Backers of such measures won their first major victory during the 1996
overhaul of federal welfare laws. Religious groups were allowed to deliver
services to the poor. Other programs have followed. The juvenile justice bill
that is tied up in a congressional dispute over gun control would allow
faith-based organizations to participate in programs for troubled teens.
</P>
<P>
	   Souder says the changes in the literacy bill would make groups more
comfortable in providing the services without fear of being sued or threatened
by the main program provider. For example, a Catholic church could leave a
crucifix up on a wall during tutoring or a synagogue would not have to hire
non-Jewish staff to get funding, Souder said.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been no definitive Supreme Court ruling on whether religion-based
employers are subject to federal anti-bias laws when they are making decisions
based on the tenets of an applicants' faith.
</P>
<P>
	   Some opponents worry that giving groups more leeway to practice their faiths
can have undue religious influence, particularly over children.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., an education committee member who opposed the
measure, said, ``The practice of federally sanctioned religious discrimination
is wrong for children, it's wrong for adults. It's so wrong, I don't think you
need to differentiate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The literacy programs were one of two renewed Wednesday under the $15
billion federal law that governs programs for children from kindergarten though
12th grade. A funding program for school districts that lose property tax
revenue to federal lands such as military bases was also sent to the full House.

<HEADLINE> Gay activists cheer Bradley in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Presidential candidate Bill Bradley, criticized by some
abortion rights advocates for attacking rival Al Gore's mixed record on
abortion, stepped up his offensive today with an ad across the country
suggesting the vice president tried to straddle the issue.
<P>
	   Designed to appeal to women voters, the TV spot begins with a female
announcer saying Bradley is the only presidential candidate who "has been
pro-choice for everyone, all the time." It includes images of women at a rally
and Bradley mixing with crowds.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the kind of issue that you can't straddle," Bradley says in the ad.
"You can't be on both sides. You have to decide which side you're on. Are you
anti-choice or are you pro-choice."
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., a Bradley supporter who unveiled the ad in
Washington, said it would begin airing Friday in all the states voting on the
two biggest presidential primary days - March 7 and March 14. They include New
York, California and Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League gave
its endorsement to Gore, breaking its tradition of neutrality during the
primaries. The group's leaders said both Democratic candidates support abortion
rights but complained that Bradley was using abortion as a political wedge to
divide voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Eshoo acknowledged that Gore supports abortion rights but said he came to
that position years behind Bradley. In a core Democratic issue like abortion,
she said, "the clarity, the consistency is important."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is also challenging Gore for gay voters, picking up support during
two days of barnstorming New York state.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bill Bradley has pushed the envelope on gay rights to the top of the
mainstream political dialogue in this nation," said Ethan Geto, a popular mentor
to New York gay activists, who introduced Bradley Wednesday evening at the
Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   He cited Bradley's early opposition to President Clinton's "don't ask, don't
tell" policy on gays in the military, his call for adoption rights for gay
couples and his proposal to expand protections of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to
include sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was taking his campaign bus to Massachusetts, Rhode Island and
Connecticut as well as making additional stops in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing 200 people packed into a meeting room and watching on video in an
overflow room, Bradley detailed Wednesday evening why he believes openly gay
people should be able to serve in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you're a gay American, you can serve openly in the Congress, in the
judiciary, in the Treasury Department, in the White House," Bradley said. "You
ought to be able to serve openly in the military."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore called in December for an end to the current policy on gays in the
military. He also last week picked up the endorsement of the Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian rights group. On Wednesday, Gore
was endorsed by a New York gay rights group, Empire State Pride Agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, running as an anti-Washington outsider despite 18 years in the
Senate, asked reporters rhetorically whether that group is based in Washington.
It is.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley continues to accuse Gore of using "scare tactics" to discredit his
health care plan. Gore says Bradley's plan to replace Medicaid with a system of
subsidies would leave thousands of people with diseases such as AIDS without
coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   In visits to Buffalo and Rochester earlier Tuesday, Bradley said Gore
ignored western New York and other places left out of the economic boom while
courting voters elsewhere for the big March 7 primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Going all out in New York, one of the biggest March 7 prizes, Bradley
portrayed Gore as a latecomer to an area that has not shared deeply in the past
decade's economic good times.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley told students in Rochester that federal formulas should be adjusted
so New York gets a better return on its tax dollar. But shifting formulas to
help New York could reduce federal funding to places in the South and West -
including California, the biggest delegate target on March 7.

<HEADLINE> Volpe to testify as defense begins Louima trial case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The prosecution today rested its case against three
police officers who allegedly obstructed an investigation into the brutal Abner
Louima assault, setting the stage for the victim's torturer to testify.
<P>
	   Justin Volpe, the ex-police officer and now prison inmate, was due on the
stand later today as the leadoff witness for the defense, said defense attorney
Ronald Fischetti.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution ended its presentation in U.S. District Court by focusing on
phone records showing the contacts between the accused officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad briefly recalled an FBI agent who has
testified that the trio made an unusual number of calls to each other in the
days after Volpe sodomized the Haitian immigrant with a broken broomstick in a
precinct bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Brought from prison, where he is serving 30 years for violating Louima's
civil rights, Volpe is expected to say - as he did after his sentencing last
year - that Charles Schwarz was not the "second officer" in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 34, Thomas Bruder, 33, and Thomas Wiese, 36, are accused of
conspiring to obstruct justice by claiming Schwarz was never in the bathroom
when Volpe assaulted Louima. Schwarz was convicted last year of violating
Louima's civil rights by holding him down during the attack. Wiese says it was
he who entered the room briefly during the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   FBI agent Joseph Foelsch testified there were 59 calls involving the trio
and a few other officers in the four days after the Aug. 9, 1997, incident -
more than seven times as many contacts as they had by phone in the previous 10
weeks. The number of calls reached 150 over the next 2 1/2 months, Foelsch said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors contend that the three defendants, seeking to conceal Schwarz's
role, coordinated their stories in a private meeting and the many phone calls,
while appealing to other 70th Precinct cops to keep silent.
</P>
<P>
	   Police union trustee Michael Immitt testified earlier that he urged cops at
several roll calls not to discuss the case, but denied trying to impede the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   As one of its last witnesses, the prosecution called Anthony Abbate, a
former stationhouse crony of Schwarz who was fired from the police department in
1996 for verbally abusing a female officer during an argument and then lying
about it under oath.
</P>
<P>
	   Abbate, a participant with Schwarz or Wiese in 36 calls on the FBI list,
said he was trying to give support to Schwarz as a friend, but denied suggesting
that they concoct a scenario that put Wiese in the bathroom in the bathroom with
Volpe and Louima, instead of Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
	   Abbate acknowledged telling a federal grand jury in early 1998 that Schwarz
had told him that he, Schwarz, escorted Louima to the lavatory. But he quoted
Wiese as having "repeated, over and over, that Schwarz was never in the
bathroom."
</P>
<P>
	   Abbate, who now works as a construction laborer, said he had been falsely
accused in the incident that led to his being dismissed from the force.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 14.56 After 110-Point Gain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices swung sharply in early trading today after
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said inflation is still a threat to the
economy. Greenspan made his warning despite a government report that indicated
inflation is under control.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 14.56 at 10,549.74 after having been up 110 points soon after
the market opened.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were slightly higher. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 16.56 at 4,428.89, but the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.57 at
1,376.44.
</P>
<P>
	   Stock prices initially rose after a government report today said wholesale
prices held steady in January as a sharp decline in cigarette prices offset
rising costs for gasoline, heating oil and other energy products. The
performance was a better showing on inflation than analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Dow fell immediately after Greenspan said the economic expansion
could not last unless its grow rate slows.
</P>
<P>
	   Presenting the Fed's twice-a-year report on the economy to Congress,
Greenspan said economic conditions are remarkable, with the nine-year-long
expansion turning in exceptionally rapid growth that has driven unemployment to
a 30-year low of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan attributed to his worries about the economy to the tight labor
markets and fears that workers will begin to demand higher wages that could set
off inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The market interpreted his comments as implying that the central bank is
likely to raise interest rates again-- it has already done four times since
June.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 135.8 million shares, down from Wednesday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index rose 5.95 to 553.71.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1 percent. In afternoon trading,
Germany's DAX index was up 1.6 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.6 percent,
and France's CAC-40 was up 2.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Criticizes Anthrax Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE STRONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The program to inoculate all 2.4 million American
military personnel against anthrax as protection against biological warfare is
based on ``a paucity of science'' and should be suspended, a House panel says in
a report sharply critical of the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The anthrax vaccine should be considered experimental because its
effectiveness against biological warfare is uncertain and the safety of troops
taking the anthrax shots is not being monitored adequately, according to the
report released today by the House Government Reform national security
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At best, the vaccine provides some measure of protection to most who
receive it,'' says a draft of the report obtained by The Associated Press.
``Just how much protection is acquired, by whom, for how long ... are questions
the Defense Department answers with an excess of faith but a paucity of
science.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Defense Department spokesman, Jim Turner, said Wednesday that Pentagon
officials were reviewing the congressional recommendations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Plagued by uncertain supplies, uncertain safety and unproven efficacy
against the anthrax threat, the mandatory, force-wide immunization program
should be suspended until the Department of Defense gets approval to use an
improved vaccine,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., chairman of the
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is an unrealistically broad undertaking built on a dangerously narrow
scientific, medical and industrial base,'' he said. ``The consequences are we
have some men and women getting sick.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon and Food and Drug Administration officials have said repeatedly the
vaccine is safe and effective. FDA officials also say there is no basis for
demoting the approved vaccine to an investigational drug category.
</P>
<P>
	   The 80-page report was written by the subcommittee's Republican majority
after five hearings on the immunization program.
</P>
<P>
	   The vaccine has come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers as soldiers
have expressed concerns about taking the six-shot regimen. Complaints included
fevers, muscle pain and dizziness. Reserve and National Guard pilots testified
that morale was plummeting and colleagues would resign rather than take the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are also flying our domestic planes, and if there are side-effects,
the airlines have to worry about this too,'' said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered all active duty and reserve
troops to get the shots, starting with soldiers most likely to encounter
biological warfare overseas. More than 380,000 service members have been
immunized so far.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 to 300 have refused to take it because of concerns about its
safety and efficacy, Pentagon officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 400 reports of adverse reactions have been filed. While FDA
officials have linked the vaccine to few of the reactions with a high level of
confidence, the agency has not been able to rule it out entirely.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthrax has never been used in combat, but the Pentagon fears Iraq, North
Korea and other countries -- or terrorist groups -- might try. Anthrax is a
naturally occurring bacteria found in domesticated animals; it can be produced
as dry spores that, when inhaled, cause death within a few days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feel the program is a vital force protection program against a known
threat,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the House panel's report called the program unrealistic in providing
protection against only one form of biological attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The vaccine was studied mostly for its effectiveness in protecting mill
workers and livestock handlers decades ago against infection from touching
animals or animal hides.
</P>
<P>
	   There is little research on the inhalation of anthrax spores by humans and
no long-term health research on the vaccine, the report says; therefore, the
vaccine should be regarded as an investigational drug, requiring the approval of
troops to be administered.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also says the program should be suspended because some troops do
not trust medical information provided by a Defense Department that has engaged
in ``heavy-handed propaganda,'' labeling critics as paranoid rather than
answering their questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of encouraging reporting of adverse reactions, the lawmakers said,
the military may have underreported problems with shots due to an
``institutional culture that is hostile, even resistant, to reports.''
</P>
<P>
	   The lawmakers also were critical of BioPort Corp. of Lansing, Mich., the
vaccine's sole supplier. The report recommended research and development of a
second-generation vaccine, allowing other companies to compete to alleviate
supply shortages and cost increases.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani heads to far north to press oil price issue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, running for the Senate
against Hillary Rodham Clinton, says he will continue touring the state and
blasting her husband until he turns on the taps to the nation's oil reserves to
reduce home heating oil prices.
<P>
	   Giuliani headed to New York's frigid, far north Wednesday to continue his
attack on President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to take this message throughout the state of New York." the New
York City mayor said. "We're going to keep it up every day until he eventually
releases some of the oil reserves."
</P>
<P>
	   "What's happening right now to our home heating oil prices is outrageous,"
Giuliani told a group of Republican officials and supporters at a Plattsburgh
restaurant as snow fell outside and the temperature hovered in the 20s.
</P>
<P>
	   "He could stand up to OPEC and he's refusing to do that," Giuliani added.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning last weekend, Giuliani began lambasting the president for refusing
to dip into the nation's strategic oil reserves to ease the price crunch on
consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the mayor's campaign team unveiled a radio ad to run statewide
in which he says: "Mister President, why don't you feel our pain? Release the
oil."
</P>
<P>
	   The radio ad was supposed to have ended this week, but the mayor's team has
decided it will continue to run until at least the middle of next week, possibly
augmented by a new version.
</P>
<P>
	   While the first lady has also called for using some of the oil reserves to
help reduce prices, Giuliani aides believe that by attacking her husband they
can boost the mayor's standing while hurting Clinton's Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an example of an issue that really unites the entire state. It
affects people in Brooklyn and in Buffalo," Giuliani campaign manager Bruce
Teitelbaum said. "We've seen the mayor doing his job, advocating for the people
of the city - that's his responsibility now - but also advocating on behalf of
people all across the state."
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani said that with oil prices rising, the OPEC countries were reaping
huge profits.
</P>
<P>
	   "Think of where that money is coming from. It's coming from you," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Tetreault, owner of Hitchcock's restaurant where Giuliani's
Plattsburgh event was held, said the rapidly rising cost of fuel oil had "hurt
our business. A lot of our patrons, who typically pay $200 a month (for fuel
oil) are now paying $280, $320 or $350. That one or two nights a week they come
out for happy hour or dinner, they're not coming out."
</P>
<P>
	   Tetreault, who opened his restaurant in June, said that while he was a
political independent who tried to stay neutral in politics, "I would vote for
Rudy over Hillary ... I'm just uncomfortable with the fact that she's coming to
an area she's never lived in before to run for Senate."
</P>
<P>
	   "This may be Clinton County, but we vote Republican and we'll do that again
in November," state Assemblyman Chris Ortloff, a local Clinton County
Republican, said as he introduced Giuliani to the more than four dozen on hand
for the mayor's appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   Following his news conference with Republican officials in Plattsburgh, just
south of the Canadian border, Giuliani flew to Syracuse for a similar event.
</P>
<P>
	   With OPEC countries limiting production, the cost of home heating oil in New
York has risen from a statewide average of 90.6 cents a gallon in February of
last year to $2.01 a gallon as of last week. It had dipped to about $1.71 a
gallon on average by early this week as East Coast supplies improved somewhat.
The Northeast has been hardest hit by the price increases.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton announced Wednesday, just before Giuliani's event, that he
was making another $120 million available to help poor people nationwide pay
their heating oil bills. Of that, $36.6 million goes to New York where his wife
is running for the Senate. In all, Clinton has released $325 million of such
funding since the heating oil crisis began, $73.6 million of which has gone to
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   While Giuliani said such action would help the poor, he said it would also
serve to further line OPEC's pockets and "will not help the middle-class."
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has thus far refused to tap into the strategic oil
reserves despite calls for it to do so from a bipartisan group of state
officials and members of Congress, including Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   The president said Wednesday that he wouldn't rule out using the petroleum
reserves.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton and Gore to campaign together  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton and Al Gore will campaign
together in New York for the first time this year as they appeal Sunday to the
state's minority voters who could be crucial to them both, aides said today.
<P>
	   The two will appear together at a church service Sunday morning that is a
highlight of the annual weekend gathering in Albany of the state Legislature's
black and Hispanic legislative caucus. Both are expected to speak at the
service.
</P>
<P>
	   The caucus weekend annually brings together hundreds of the state's top
black and Hispanic leaders. The minority community in New York is an
increasingly powerful voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
	   A big test of that minority voting power comes in the state's March 7
presidential primary, considered a major showdown for Gore and former New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley. Both have launched major appeals to minorities in their bids
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The fact that presidential candidate Gore and Senate candidate Clinton
haven't yet campaigned together in New York has raised some eyebrows. It
prompted a front-page article in today's editions of The New York Times that
carried the headline: "Gore and Mrs. Clinton Keeping A Wary Distance as
Candidates."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said today that there was no
intentional distancing of the two candidates. Aides to Gore said the same thing.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, one Gore adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said today
that "for the next 19 days (until the New York primary), she helps us
tremendously. Her numbers are just off the charts with Democratic primary
voters."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked recently why they hadn't been campaigning together, Gore told one
television interviewer that, "It's a matter of scheduling. Not just me, but also
her."
</P>
<P>
	   Both have made it clear that they feel they must step out of the shadow of
President Clinton. As part of that effort, Hillary Rodham Clinton has become
simply "Hillary" in campaign posters and news releases.

<HEADLINE> Phone Service for Disabled Expanded  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to make the phone network more accessible to all
Americans, federal regulators today expanded the scope of services that phone
companies must make available to callers with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Communications Commission voted 5-0 to require a new service
nationwide that allows users to speak directly to a special operator -- trained
to identify speech patterns of those with disabilities -- who would relay the
message to the person on the other end of the line.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission's action today also would bolster the quality of services,
such as text telephone, that already are available.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure that the phone network remains accessible to all
Americans,'' the agency's chairman, William Kennard, said in an interview.
``This is an effort to update the law and expand it so it's keeping pace with
technology.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard added that all Americans, not just those with hearing impairments or
speech disabilities, would benefit from having a more inclusive system.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC also set a minimum typing speed of 60 words a minute for operators
handling TTY calls and a requirement that Spanish-speakers be able to use the
services.
</P>
<P>
	   Phone carriers would have to make available the new speech-to-speech service
by March 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   The new service is especially important to people like Bob Segalman, who
used to rely on a text telephone or TTY to communication by phone. But the
device posed a fresh set of challenges for Segalman, who has cerebral palsy: He
could only type 10 words a minute.
</P>
<P>
	   So he developed a speech-to-speech relay service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In order to survive in today's world, you need to be able to use the
telephone,'' Segalman said in a relay interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a 1990 federal law, phone companies that provided voice service had to
ensure that relay services were available throughout the region they serve.
</P>
<P>
	   All states now offer TTY services in which the user types a message and an
operator reads it out loud to the person on the other end. The operator also
converts the replies into text.
</P>
<P>
	   Relay services are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, at no extra
charge.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost of paying for interstate relay services comes out of a federal pool
-- set at $44 million for 2000 -- that all telecommunications carriers pay into
and typically recover from consumers. Their contribution is less than 0.04
percent of their gross revenues. Each state handles separately the costs for
calls within the state.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear yet whether the new services will mean greater costs. In
Maryland, where speech-to-speech services have been offered since 1996,
officials say they have noticed no significant change in costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who use relay services say they have made an immeasurable difference
in their lives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has opened a whole new world to me,'' said Rebecca Ladew, using a text
telephone to answer questions through a Maryland relay operator. ``I can
communicate with anyone, anywhere, anytime.''
</P>
<P>
	   Letting Americans know that speech-to-speech services exist, and showing
them how to use them, is critical to making the services a success, users and
advocates say.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, Segalman noted that some people with speech disabilities have
never used the phone before this service became available.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many consumers need one-to-one help overcoming psychological barriers to
telephone use,'' Segalman said.
</P>
<P>
	   But consumers have told the FCC that such services are not always
``functionally equivalent'' to voice services as required by the Americans With
Disabilities Act. They complain that calls sometimes are answered too slowly at
the relay facilities or typing becomes too burdensome to transmit lengthy
messages.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, 10 states offer the service in which people with speech
disabilities can use their own voice or a voice synthesizer to talk on the
telephone, using special relay operators.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators also are encouraging -- but not requiring -- providers to offer
video relay interpreting services. This would let someone give a message in sign
language over video conferencing to the operator.

<HEADLINE> Two F-16 Jets Crash in Ariz., Ga.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YUMA, Ariz. (AP) -- Two Air Force F-16 fighter jets from military bases in
Arizona and Georgia crashed during training exercises, but the pilots in both
managed to eject safely.
</P>
<P>
	   The accidents involving the $20 million aircraft occurred Wednesday. Both
were under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona, Maj. Anthony Barrell, from Luke Air Force Base near Glendale,
was flying over the Barry M. Goldwater bombing range in southwestern Arizona
near Yuma.
</P>
<P>
	   Barrell was flying as part of a four-jet formation. But before the start of
an aerial engagement, Barrell radioed he had a problem and turned the jet toward
the Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field to recover, a base spokesman said. He
ejected en route to Gila Bend.
</P>
<P>
	   At Luke, the world's largest F-16 training base, all F-16s were grounded
until a cause for the crash can be determined. Wednesday's crash was the eighth
since the fall 1998 involving a jet flying a mission from base west of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
	   Brig. Gen. John Barry, of Luke, said that with availability of the vast 2.7
million-acre Goldwater Range, Luke flies its planes the way they are flown in
combat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So, if they're going to start showing the cracks someplace in the system,
they're probably going to show here,'' Barry said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Georgia, two pilots managed to eject safely from an F-16 jet from Moody
Air Force Base on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Charles B. Kearney and 1st Lt. Christopher Hutchins were participating
in night-vision goggle training when they were forced to eject, said 1st Lt.
DeDe Halfhill, a base spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   The F-16 crashed in Donalsonville, about 90 miles away.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots were transported back to Moody by helicopter for medical
evaluation, Halfhill said.

<HEADLINE> Low-Power FM Station Rule Attacked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's broadcasting lobby has asked an appeals court
to set aside a rule adopted by federal regulators to create hundreds of new
low-power FM stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The petition filed Wednesday in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia claims that the decision last month by the Federal
Communications Commission to authorize the stations is ``arbitrary, capricious
and otherwise contrary to law.''
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the National Association of Broadcasters, which made the appeal,
said the FCC's plan would cause significant interference to existing FM
stations. Broadcasters have opposed the idea since its inception, saying their
testing showed serious harm to the sound of existing stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC says its own tests demonstrate that low-power service can be
introduced without harm to FM radio. Last month, it adopted rules so that it
could begin by summer awarding noncommercial, educational licenses to groups
that want to operate 100-watt and 10-watt stations. That's far less than the
6,000 watts to 100,000 watts at which most FM stations now operate.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 14.56; Nasdaq Up 56.14  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks fell today after Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan indicated the central bank will raise interest rates again to
slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   But technology stocks were unmoved, and headed close to record territory.
</P>
<P>
	   At midmorning on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
14.56 at 10,549.74.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index was up 56.14
at 4,483.89, just 5 points shy of its record close set a week ago. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 1.01 at 1,386.66.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial stocks were hurt by the prospect of higher interest rates. Dow
component American Express fell 5 7/16 to 148. Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest
retailer, was down 4 to 48 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow initially rose more than 110 points on a smaller-than-expected rise
in wholesale prices, but dropped immediately after Greenspan said the nation's
economic expansion could not last unless its grow rate slows.
</P>
<P>
	   Presenting the Fed's twice-a-year report on the economy to Congress,
Greenspan said the Fed's four quarter-point increases in the federal funds rate
over the past eight months have had little impact in slowing the economy.
Greenspan attributed his concerns about the economy to the tight labor markets
and fears that workers will begin to demand higher wages that could set off
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The market interpreted his comments as implying that the central bank is
likely to raise interest rates again-- it has already done four times since
June.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had good news on inflation front but Mr. Greenspan's commentary sure
indicated there more than one interest rate hike to come and that's not what
market wanted to hear," said Barry Hyman, chief market strategist at Ehrenkrantz
King Nussbaum.
</P>
<P>
	   But while interest rate sensitive stocks on the Dow and the S&AMP;P were hurt by
Greenspan's comments, Hyman noted the technology-dominated Nasdaq kept rising.
"The Nasdaq is a different ball game. It's not a credit sensitive sector," he
said
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan's comments came after a government report today said wholesale
prices held steady in January as a sharp decline in cigarette prices offset
rising costs for gasoline, heating oil and other energy products. The
performance was a better showing on inflation than analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 324.8 million shares, up from Wednesday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index rose 5.17 to 552.93.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Praised at Berlin Festival  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BERLIN (AP) -- Director Norman Jewison says he likes bringing controversial
movies like "The Hurricane" to the Berlin International Film Festival because of
its intellectual feel.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a political side to this festival that I find exciting," Jewison
said at a post-screening news conference Thursday. "People take films more
seriously here."
</P>
<P>
	   The film is based on the story of Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, played by Denzel
Washington, a middleweight boxer twice convicted of a 1966 triple homicide.
After narrowly escaping the electric chair he was cleared by a federal judge in
1985 and released in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Jewison defended his film against critics who say he skimmed over the real
story's depth and complexity. "It is about one man's struggle and indomitable
spirit," Jewison said. "It is the relationship between a young man and someone
who gives him hope to fight again."
</P>
<P>
	   Washington was nominated for an Academy Award for his role in the movie and
attributed the lack of more nominations to the fact that the film only opened in
December and is not yet well known in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presses Africa on AIDS Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Citing ``thousands of triumphs, large and small,''
President Clinton today defended his Africa policy and pressed African nations
to work harder on AIDS prevention before the disease cuts into their own
productivity.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech before the National Summit on Africa, the president said the
United States has worked aggressively on peacekeeping, conflict resolution,
education and economic revitalization since his historic 1998 visit. But
continued progress depends ``fundamentally and first'' on whether African
leaders put the best interest of their people ahead of political concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one in our government is under any illusions. There is still a lot of
work to be done,'' Clinton said. ``These things cannot be imported, and they
cannot be imposed from outside. Even countries making the right policy choices
still have to struggle to deliver for their people.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president said disease remains an enormous problem, and that the United
States would redouble efforts to fight tuberculosis, malaria and especially
AIDS. But he said African leaders have to do more to battle the spread of HIV,
saying AIDS stands to lop 20 years off the average African life expectancy,
creating problems in nearly every social stratum from employment to family
stability.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know there are cultural and religious factors that make it very
difficult to tackle this issue from a preventive point of view,'' Clinton said.
``But the real answer is to stop people from getting the HIV virus in the first
place. ... We shouldn't pretend that we can give injections and work our way out
of this.''
</P>
<P>
	   The summit, funded by the Carnegie Foundation, Ford Foundation, businesses
and others, has been in the making since late 1996. Summit organizers want to
unify and strengthen the lobby for Africa in America, improve Africa's image in
the states, and change U.S. policy toward the continent.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said his policy has worked. ``We have seen thousands of triumphs,
large and small,'' he said. ``In this world, we can be indifferent or we can
make a difference. America must choose, when it comes to Africa, to make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Clinton's optimism, some critics believe there is little that can be
done to fix his Africa policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The record actually is disastrous,'' said American University economics
professor George Ayittey. ``Some of us want this administration to stop playing
political football with Africa. The solutions to Africa's problems can't be
micromanaged from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
	   The ambitious trade bill that Clinton promoted during his visit emerged from
the Senate weaker than he hoped. It requires, among other things, that imported
African fabrics be duty-free only if they are made of American thread.
</P>
<P>
	   His calls for debt relief have gone largely unanswered by European allies.
Also, his own pledge to forgive $500 million of African debt can hardly make a
dent in the billions owed.
</P>
<P>
	   In his budget proposals over the past two years, Clinton has devoted more
than $100 million to assisting the peacekeeping effort known as ECOMOG, or the
Economic Community of West African States. He also has earmarked $120 million a
year to building institutions that promote democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Ayittey cited some successes in conflict resolution, in Liberia and Sierra
Leone, but said those are eclipsed by the flare-ups between some nations Clinton
embraced, such as Eritrea, Congo, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Congo, U.N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke appealed Tuesday to Congress
for support of a new force of peacekeepers -- without U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Ayittey said there have been setbacks to democratic rule throughout Africa,
and blamed a policy that is too focused on leaders, rather than the people who
select them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only bright spot the administration can claim is Nigeria,'' Ayittey
said. ``But then, the democratization process in Nigeria is iffy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation and a major supplier of U.S. oil, is
a linchpin in Clinton's policy, the hope being that it can help radiate
stability to the nations around it. On Wednesday, the Clinton administration
signed a trade agreement with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
	   But the larger trade package, for Africa and the Caribbean Basin, is still
awaiting final passage in Congress, even though Clinton had hoped for passage
before the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
	   These are the type of halting, incremental steps that have marked Clinton's
approach to Africa since he returned from his 1998 tour, the most extensive by
any U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My dream for this trip is that together we might do the things so that 100
years from now, your grandchildren and mine will look back and say, 'This is the
beginning of a new African renaissance,''' Clinton said upon arrival in Accra,
Ghana, on March 23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   During the trip, Clinton apologized for the slow U.S. response to the 1994
genocide in Rwanda, and promised ``never again'' would it be that way.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mel Foote, head of the advocacy group Constituency for Africa, said the
conflict in Sierra Leone drew a similar response ``at the same time we're
pouring billions into Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He showed us he cared about Africa. He doesn't have a lot of people in his
administration who can do the follow-up,'' Foote said. ``The biggest thing he
achieved was good will.''

<HEADLINE> Judge will allow Diallo jurors to consider lesser-charge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Jurors in the trial of four police officers accused
of murdering an unarmed Bronx man in a hail of 41 bullets will have the option
to convict the defendants on less serious charges, a judge ruled today.
<P>
	   With testimony in the Amadou Diallo case completed after just nine days,
prosecutors on Wednesday asked the judge to allow the jury to consider
manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in addition to the original
second-degree murder charges. The defense did not object.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi made the decision today without comment
at a hearing to discuss how the jury will be instructed. It is not unusual for
judges to do this if requested. Barry Kluger, chief assistant district attorney
in the Bronx, said prosecutors often ask for less serious charges and "no
special significance should be given to that."
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is adjourned until Tuesday, when the jury will hear closing
arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, Richard Murphy, 27, Sean Carroll, 37, and Edward McMellon,
27, have pleaded innocent to charges of intentional murder, depraved
indifference murder and reckless endangerment. If convicted of murder, they face
a maximum sentences of 25 years to life.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors refused to say why they sought to include the lesser charges.
</P>
<P>
	   But both sides appeared to be hedging their bets - the prosecution against a
complete exoneration of defendants in a high-profile case, the defense against
the specter of harsh prison terms for their clients. Second-degree murder
carries a minimum 15-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Privately, defense attorneys said their clients had given them permission to
acquiesce to a lesser charge motion long before the defense case was over. But
Stephen Worth, McMellon's attorney, insisted to reporters that despite the
decision, the officers expected to be cleared.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't concede for a moment that it's anything but not guilty," Worth
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, the officers testified they fired 41 bullets at Diallo on
Feb. 4, 1999 because the unarmed Guinean immigrant refused to stop for
questioning, retreated to his Bronx building and pulled out what appeared to be
a gun; he was hit 19 times. The object Diallo pulled turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution contends the officers never yelled any warnings before
cornering Diallo and opening fire. Backed by autopsy findings, prosecutors also
say most of the bullets hit Diallo while he was going down or flat on his back.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting of an unarmed black man by four white officers resulted in
enough pretrial publicity and protests alleging widespread police abuse of
minorities that an appeals court decided to move the case to Albany. Before the
change of venue, attorneys had predicted the trial would last at least six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Teresi's ruling upholding the murder charges, the defense argued they
were too severe. Attorney Bennett Epstein claimed the case marked the first time
in state history a depraved indifference charge had been brought against "police
officers, public servants, on duty on the streets of New York risking their
lives, who made a mistake."
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Eric Warner countered that the fact Diallo had been trapped and
killed by a "wall of lead" would "more than suggest depraved indifference to
human life."
</P>
<P>
	   With the prosecution request, the jury could face a much more complex set of
decisions about the conduct of each officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The alternatives to the intentional murder charge would be first-degree
manslaughter - intent to cause injury resulting in death - which carries a
maximum sentence of 12 1/2 to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
	   For depraved indifference, options would be second-degree manslaughter -
recklessly causing death - which carries a maximum sentence of 5 to 15 years, or
criminally negligent homicide - failing to perceive the risk of death - which
carries a maximum of 1 1/3 to 4 years.
</P>
<P>
	   A conviction on the murder charges or the first-degree manslaughter charge
would guarantee some jail time for the officers. The lesser charges allow for
probation.

<HEADLINE> Medical Privacy Rules Debated  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Judi Selig mentioned to a co-worker that she had
been exposed to hepatitis years ago, her company demanded that she get a blood
test and sign a release that would let a doctor in the employer's health plan
access her medical records.
</P>
<P>
	   Selig, a secretary who worked for a South Carolina machinery firm in 1997,
took the test but refused to sign the release to protect her privacy. She said
the company suspended her for a week without pay as punishment. She eventually
found another job and quit the company.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had no objection to them knowing that I passed the test, but don't keep
handing me a piece of paper saying I have to give you my medical records,'' said
Selig, 48.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal health officials who have proposed new regulations to protect the
privacy of medical records told members of Congress today that companies should
not be allowed to use workers' medical records against them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Employers should not be able to use information obtained for health
purposes to discriminate against individuals when making employment decisions,''
said Margaret Hamburg, assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human
Services, in testimony submitted to a House health subcommittee today.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress is weighing whether to endorse HHS' proposed regulations or write
legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Privacy and physician groups have called on Hamburg's agency to toughen the
proposed regulations to include a requirement that health plans, insurers and
employers get a patient's permission before disclosing medical information.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are worried that their records will be used against them,'' said
Peter Kane, executive director of the National Coalition for Patients Rights,
which advocates more confidentiality in health care.
</P>
<P>
	   The rules call for insurers to notify patients about how their information
is used but allows them to use medical records without authorization as long as
it's for treatment, payment or operational purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   HHS officials said their aim was for patients to receive better information
about how records are used than they are probably getting now. Most patients
have to sign a broad consent form as a condition of treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed regulations were created to fill what privacy advocates say is
a disturbing void: There is no federal law protecting the confidentiality of
medical records. Anyone -- financial institutions, direct marketing firms,
employers, lawyers -- can use medical records, if they can get them, without
patients' knowledge or consent.
</P>
<P>
	   But the privacy groups say the proposed regulations, which apply to
electronic, not paper, records, are too broad and provide little protection of
privacy. They believe that if people are concerned that their medical
information could be disclosed, they won't be open with their doctors, which
could hurt their medical care.
</P>
<P>
	   HHS wrote the rules after Congress failed to meet a self-imposed deadline in
August to adopt legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   The rules require health organizations to get patients' written permission
to release information that would be used for something other than treatment,
payment or operational purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   Any information they did release would have to be the minimum necessary --
not the patient's entire file. Patients would have the right see and copy their
medical records and request corrections of any errors.
</P>
<P>
	   The rules don't protect patient information from being accessed by
employers, but a company's health plan division would be prohibited from giving
medical information to supervisors or others in the company.
</P>
<P>
	   A violation of the rules carries a $100 penalty, but individuals caught
intentionally releasing or selling information face heavier fines and jail
sentences.
</P>
<P>
	   While privacy groups say the regulations are weak, HMOs and insurers contend
that they go too far and say they could interfere with sending patients checkup
reminders or information about treatments.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at the American Association of Health Plans, which represents HMOs
and other network plans, want the regulations to make clear that information
could be used, without authorization, for disease management and health
promotion programs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want the terms to encompass all of the efforts that we do now,'' such
as sending individuals who are at risk for certain diseases special notices,
said Kristin Stewart, director of private market issues at AAHP.

<HEADLINE> McCain the choice of Republicans in March, all voters in November  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HAMDEN, Conn. (AP) - A new poll shows Sen. John McCain is the big
favorite among Connecticut Republicans and Al Gore is tops with state Democrats
less than three weeks before the state's presidential primary.
<P>
	   The Quinnipiac College poll released today found that among likely
Republican primary voters surveyed, McCain led Texas Gov. George W. Bush 52
percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Among Democrats who said they were likely to vote in the March 7 primary,
Gore leads former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, 49 percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll indicates that among all registered voters, McCain is the favorite
in matchups for the presidency in November.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was favored 55 percent to 33 percent over Gore, and 50 percent to 34
percent over Bradley, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
	   "McCain clearly got a big bounce out of New Hampshire," poll director
Douglas Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwartz said Gov. John G. Rowland's endorsement of Bush hasn't carried much
weight with voters, a trend that he's noticed in other states.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's very tough for governor's to have an impact," he said. "The
governors don't carry as much weight as is often attributed to them."
</P>
<P>
	   In matchups pitting Bush against the Democratic candidates, Gore edges out
the Republican candidate 45 percent to 42 percent while Bradley tallies 48
percent to Bush's 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The survey of 1,365 Connecticut registered voters was conducted Feb. 9-15
and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The survey
includes 426 likely Democratic primary voters with a margin of error of 5
percent, and 333 likely Republican primary voters with a margin of error of plus
or minus just above 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Criticizes Anthrax Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE STRONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The program to inoculate all 2.4 million American
military personnel against anthrax as protection against biological warfare is
based on ``a paucity of science'' and should be suspended, a House panel says in
a report sharply critical of the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The anthrax vaccine should be considered experimental because its
effectiveness against biological warfare is uncertain and the safety of troops
taking the anthrax shots is not being monitored adequately, according to the
report released today by the House Government Reform national security
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At best, the vaccine provides some measure of protection to most who
receive it,'' says a draft of the report obtained by The Associated Press.
``Just how much protection is acquired, by whom, for how long ... are questions
the Defense Department answers with an excess of faith but a paucity of
science.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Defense Department spokesman, Jim Turner, said Wednesday that Pentagon
officials were reviewing the congressional recommendations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Plagued by uncertain supplies, uncertain safety and unproven efficacy
against the anthrax threat, the mandatory, force-wide immunization program
should be suspended until the Department of Defense gets approval to use an
improved vaccine,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., chairman of the
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is an unrealistically broad undertaking built on a dangerously narrow
scientific, medical and industrial base,'' he said. ``The consequences are we
have some men and women getting sick.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon and Food and Drug Administration officials have said repeatedly the
vaccine is safe and effective. FDA officials also say there is no basis for
demoting the approved vaccine to an investigational drug category.
</P>
<P>
	   The 80-page report was written by the subcommittee's Republican majority
after five hearings on the immunization program.
</P>
<P>
	   The vaccine has come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers as soldiers
have expressed concerns about taking the six-shot regimen. Complaints included
fevers, muscle pain and dizziness. Reserve and National Guard pilots testified
that morale was plummeting and colleagues would resign rather than take the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are also flying our domestic planes, and if there are side-effects,
the airlines have to worry about this too,'' said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered all active duty and reserve
troops to get the shots, starting with soldiers most likely to encounter
biological warfare overseas. More than 380,000 service members have been
immunized so far.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 to 300 have refused to take it because of concerns about its
safety and efficacy, Pentagon officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 400 reports of adverse reactions have been filed, but Defense
officials said only 72 were serious enough to require hospitalization or a day
off from work. While FDA officials have linked the vaccine to few of the
reactions with a high level of confidence, the agency has not been able to rule
it out entirely.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthrax has never been used in combat, but the Pentagon fears Iraq, North
Korea and other countries -- or terrorist groups -- might try. Anthrax is a
naturally occurring bacteria found in domesticated animals; it can be produced
as dry spores that, when inhaled, cause death within a few days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feel the program is a vital force protection program against a known
threat,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the House panel's report called the program unrealistic in providing
protection against only one form of biological attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The vaccine was studied mostly for its effectiveness in protecting mill
workers and livestock handlers decades ago against infection from touching
animals or animal hides.
</P>
<P>
	   There is little research on the inhalation of anthrax spores by humans and
no long-term health research on the vaccine, the report says; therefore, the
vaccine should be regarded as an investigational drug, requiring the approval of
troops to be administered.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also says the program should be suspended because some troops do
not trust medical information provided by a Defense Department that has engaged
in ``heavy-handed propaganda,'' labeling critics as paranoid rather than
answering their questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of encouraging reporting of adverse reactions, the lawmakers said,
the military may have underreported problems with shots due to an
``institutional culture that is hostile, even resistant, to reports.''
</P>
<P>
	   The lawmakers also were critical of BioPort Corp. of Lansing, Mich., the
vaccine's sole supplier. The report recommended research and development of a
second-generation vaccine, allowing other companies to compete to alleviate
supply shortages and cost increases.

progress today toward an agreement on how to divide the money.

	   Chief German negotiator Otto Lambsdorff and U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Stuart Eizenstat expressed confidence that negotiators could reach an agreement
during the next round of talks in Washington in March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are on the brink of achieving something truly historic,'' Eizenstat
said. ``We all agreed on the importance of accelerating the discussions'' to
ensure that aging survivors receive compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimates of the number of people who could benefit from the fund run to as
many as 2.3 million people, mostly non-Jews from eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   All sides agreed that the bulk of the fund will be reserved for compensating
forced and slave laborers, although Eizenstat said serious differences remained
on how the funds would be divided.
</P>
<P>
	   The German government is recommending that $3.85 billion be reserved for
slave and forced laborers, $500 million be used to compensate people whose
property was seized by the Nazis and an equal sum to establish a foundation for
future academic and humanitarian projects and exchanges. The balance, about $150
million, would go toward administrative and legal fees.
</P>
<P>
	   Lambsdorff defended the $500 million for the foundation in an interview
Wednesday with Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, and industry leaders also said that
amount was not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
	   Manfred Gentz, chief financial officer at DaimlerChrysler and the industry's
lead negotiator, was quoted by the newspaper as saying that the foundation was
possibly even more important than the payments to individuals because it would
be ``in the future directed at hindering offenses against human rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   German industry and the government agreed in December to contribute equal
shares to the $5 billion fund to compensate long-forgotten Nazi victims. Though
the agreement was hailed as a breakthrough, negotiations to actually launch the
project have been painstaking.
</P>
<P>
	   The eastern and central European governments that are in the talks have
generally accepted that the entire fund will not be used for compensating forced
laborers, however they have expressed concern about the size of the fund for
academic and humanitarian projects.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter released Wednesday, the governments of Belarus, Poland, Russia,
Ukraine and the Czech Republic warned U.S. and German envoys that money must not
be taken away from the remaining $4.5 billion for other claims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any decrease in that amount would mean that the payments to slave and
forced laborers would become even less than symbolic or that some categories of
victims would have to be excluded from payments,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Eizenstat appealed to a German parliament committee Wednesday to pass a law
creating the compensation fund in accordance with the agreements reached by the
negotiators.

<HEADLINE> NATO Cmdr. Warns Congress on Troops  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States should brace for keeping its troops in
Bosnia and Kosovo indefinitely as long as Slobodan Milosevic holds power in
Yugoslavia, the outgoing supreme NATO commander cautioned Congress today.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Wesley Clark brushed off repeated questions on when Americans might
expect to see the peacekeeping troops brought home for good.
</P>
<P>
	   Except for being driven from Kosovo, Milosevic's forces and military
equipment suffered little damage from last year's 78-day NATO bombardment, Clark
said. Now, Milosevic is seeking to consolidate his authority and should be
regarded as continuing to pose a threat to the Balkans, the general added.
</P>
<P>
	   Until Milosvevic is removed from power and brought to trial on war crime
charges, ``We're not going to see a resolution of the problem,'' Clark told the
House Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark said he did not want to suggest there wouldn't be further troop
reductions in both Bosnia and Kosovo but he declined to voice any optimism for
ending the U.S. military presence in either place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me go out on a limb and give you my personal opinion,'' the retiring
four-star general said. ``We're not going to be able to complete that mission
and wipe our hands of responsibility until that regime in Belgrade is replaced
by a democratic government.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. troops have served in Bosnia since late 1995 and now number about
5,600. Two deadlines set by President Clinton for the return of the troops have
come and gone, and there is no longer a target date for their departure. All
told there are about 24,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia, mostly from NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 50,000 peace implementation forces in Kosovo, about 6,000 are
Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark is leaving his European post in April, two months earlier than
planned, to accommodate his successor, Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston, who would
have had to retire had he not taken the promotion by May.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of Congress have been increasingly critical about the open-ended
U.S. commitment in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The introduction of ground forces to a peacekeeping operation in Kosovo
and the continuing mission in Bosnia has had a significant negative impact on
the Army,'' said Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., the committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark would not add his voice to rising complaints by U.S. policy- makers --
including Defense Secretary William Cohen -- that European allies haven't been
shouldering enough of the financial burden for the defense of Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a political imperative on both sides of the Atlantic that Europe do
more to share the burden,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said European countries are willing to pay more in the future -- and
already contribute the majority of peacekeeping troops in both Bosnia and
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Furthermore, he said, the United States continues to have ``vital interests
in Europe. That's the reality. We learned that lesson after World War II.''

<HEADLINE> Giuliani attacks President Clinton; Candidate Clinton discusses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani took his
campaign for U.S. Senate to chilly upstate and blasted President Clinton, the
husband of his Democratic opponent, for not releasing the nation's oil reserves
to reduce heating oil prices.
<P>
	   "What's happening right now to our home heating oil prices is outrageous,"
Giuliani told a group of Republican officials and supporters at a Plattsburgh
restaurant Wednesday, as snow fell outside and the temperature hovered in the
20s.
</P>
<P>
	   "He could stand up to OPEC and he's refusing to do that," Giuliani said of
the president.
</P>
<P>
	   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, meanwhile, was on Giuliani's turf, laying
out her goals for the race during an interview with journalist Charlie Rose in
front of a Manhattan audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Rose, who has a show on PBS and is a correspondent on CBS's "60 Minutes II,"
asked what Mrs. Clinton would do if she lost to Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well, I am going to win," she said without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
	   She also said she did not plan to use the Senate as a springboard to return
to the White House as president.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to serve my full six-year term, and I have learned that senators
have a whole lot more privacy than presidents," she added, getting a laugh from
the mostly friendly audience of about 900 people, who repeatedly interrupted her
comments with chuckles and applause.
</P>
<P>
	   The interview took place at the 92nd Street Y, where tickets to the sold-out
event ranged from $20 to $100. The proceeds went to the Y, a nonpartisan arena
that has long been a popular stop for politicians. Vice President Al Gore
attended a Hanukkah menorah lighting there in December, and Republican
presidential candidate Arizona Sen. John McCain recently discussed his book,
"Faith of My Fathers," as part of the Y's interview series in front of a paying
audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani also has accepted an invitation to appear the Y on May 18, but
details of the format are still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has criticized the president for refusing to dip into the nation's
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ease the price crunch on consumers.
Administration officials have maintained that the reserve is designed for supply
disruptions and not to influence prices.
</P>
<P>
	   While the first lady also has called for using some of the oil reserves to
help reduce prices, Giuliani aides believe that by attacking the president they
can boost the mayor's standing while hurting Mrs. Clinton's Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries limiting
production, the cost of home heating oil in New York has risen from a statewide
average of 90.6 cents a gallon last February to $2.01 a gallon as of last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before Giuliani's event, the president announced he was making $125
million more available for immediate help to poor people nationwide pay their
heating oil bills.
</P>
<P>
	   In Manhattan, Mrs. Clinton spoke about her work as first lady. She said that
although she failed to reform health care, she was able to work on lower-profile
issues like adoption, foster care and a program to provide low-income children
with health insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was more acceptable for me to work behind the scenes," she said. "We've
got a problem with ..."
</P>
<P>
	   "Strong women?" Rose asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "You say that, I wouldn't say that," she answered. "I think it's a problem
with the role of first lady. It's not a job. It's a role, which people mold to
their desires and interests, which I think is appropriate, and someday the first
man will have the same options."
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert visited New York City and
praised Giuliani, although he said he was not making an endorsement in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need a great friend for Jerusalem and of all the public figures I know
in America, the one I trust most, is the greatest friend of Jerusalem in the
United States, is Rudolph Giuliani," Olmert said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   In a swipe at Mrs. Clinton, Olmert said Giuliani has not had to apologize
"for anything he said or didn't say, for anything that he did or didn't do."
Mrs. Clinton had been criticized by some Jewish groups for her silence during a
speech by the wife of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat charging that Israeli
troops gassed Palestinian children. The first lady later denounced the remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Her campaign did not answer messages left seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Inflation Still a Danger  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today declared
the current good times "unprecedented in my half-century of observing the
American economy." But he cautioned that inflation dangers still exist and put
financial markets on notice to expect further interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Presenting the Federal Reserve's twice-a-year report on the economy to
Congress, Greenspan said conditions are remarkable with the 9-year-long
expansion, a record, turning in exceptionally rapid growth that has driven
unemployment to a 30-year low of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Ninety minutes before Greenspan spoke, the Labor Department reported that
wholesale prices were unchanged in January and that when the volatile energy and
food sectors are excluded, the Producer Price Index fell by 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though inflation has remained low outside of a burst in energy prices,
Greenspan said, this favorable condition cannot last unless the growth rate
slows to less than the 4 percent-plus gains of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan tied his worries to the tight labor markets and fears that workers
will begin to demand higher wages that could set off an inflationary spiral.
Since last June, the central bank has been trying to slow the economy, raising a
key interest rate it controls by a full percentage point.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Greenspan said today there is little evidence that those four
quarter-point increases in the federal funds rate have had much impact.
</P>
<P>
	   "To date, interest-sensitive spending has remained robust and the FOMC
(Federal Open Market Committee) will have to stay alert for signs that real
interest rates have not yet risen enough to bring the growth of demand into line
with that of potential supply," Greenspan said in testimony to the House Banking
Committee. "Achieving that alignment seems more pressing today than it did
earlier."
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts believe that the FOMC, the group of Fed board members in Washington
and Fed regional bank presidents that sets interest rate policy, will boost
rates for a fifth time March 21 and very likely will raise rates a sixth time in
May.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mr. Greenspan is telling us to expect higher interest rates," said Sung Won
Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. "He is warning that this
economic prosperity will be jeopardized unless we contain the imbalances."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 60
points at midday but the technology-heavy Nasdaq index was up 56, putting it
near its recent record high.
</P>
<P>
	   David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. said that while
Greenspan "was hawkish in tone ... it doesn't imply anything more than we were
expecting. That is why the markets have not reacted very much."
</P>
<P>
	   In response to questions, Greenspan told the committee that he was concerned
about the recent rise in oil prices, which have pushed the per- barrel price
above $30 for the first time since the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said oil inventories have fallen to exceptionally low levels,
leaving the country vulnerable in coming months to a big price spike if supplies
suddenly drop further.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also noted that because of conservation moves by businesses, the
amount of energy needed in U.S. production has declined significantly in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
	   In his testimony, Greenspan noted that tight labor markets have yet to
increase wage pressures and in fact unit labor costs, a measure of wages tied to
output, actually declined in the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   He tied this good news to a remarkable rebound in the growth of
productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, which helps keep inflation
low by allowing employers to pay for higher salaries through increased
production rather than raising prices.
</P>
<P>
	   But even if the gains in productivity continue, he said, they could have a
downside for the economy by pushing soaring stock prices even higher. The Wall
Street boom has contributed to the surge in consumer demand as investors have
spent their stock gains with abandon.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of his testimony, Greenspan presented the Fed's new economic
forecast for 2000. In terms of growth, the Fed was slightly more optimistic than
the administration or the Congressional Budget Office, predicting the gross
domestic product will expand by around 3.5 percent this year. President Clinton
based his current budget on a slower 2.9 percent prediction.
</P>
<P>
	   "Although the outlook is clouded by a number of uncertainties, the central
tendencies of the projections ... imply continued good economic performance in
the United States," Greenspan told the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed was also more optimistic that inflation will slow this year,
predicting that an inflation gauge tied to the GDP will rise by around 1.75
percent to 2 percent, compared to an increase of 2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
	   As he has in the past, Greenspan urged Congress to devote the huge federal
budget surpluses being generated by the good economic times to paying down the
national debt rather than using the money for increased federal spending or
cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maintaining the surpluses and using them to repay debt over coming years
will continue to be an important way the federal government can encourage
productivity-enhancing investment and rising standards of living," Greenspan
said. "We cannot afford to be lulled into letting down our guard on budgetary
matters."

<HEADLINE> Dissident Group Closes Thai Offices  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW PENNINGTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The main political group for exiled students
opposed to Myanmar's military regime said Thursday it had closed all its offices
in Thailand under pressure from Thai authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The closure could be a crippling blow to the All-Burma Students Democratic
Front, which has been under heavy Thai pressure since Myanmar rebels crossed the
border last month and took hundreds of hostages at a Thai provincial hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The siege ended with Thai commandos killing all 10 rebels, who included
members of the radical Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors and God's Army, a
fringe ethnic Karen group led by twin 12-year-old boys.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the front has disavowed the actions, Thailand, for years tolerant of
Myanmar dissidents, has made clear it does not want the mainstream group to
maintain a presence there.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have tightened security at the border with Myanmar, also known
as Burma, where around 700 members stay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If our offices cannot open here anymore, we shall go back into the jungle
of Burma,'' said Kyaw Kyaw, a central executive committee member.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Thai police raided two of the group's offices in Mae Sariang
district in northern Mae Hong Son province, 400 miles north of Bangkok. Three
students were sent to a refugee camp along the border.
</P>
<P>
	   A third office in the district was immediately closed by the front itself, a
member told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   A Thai official in Mae Sariang, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, confirmed the closures, saying it was Interior Ministry policy to
``keep all refugees in a camp.''
</P>
<P>
	   The front says its other offices have already shut.
</P>
<P>
	   The front was formed by students who fled the Myanmar military's bloody
crackdown on a mass uprising for democracy in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 104.86; Nasdaq Up 41.66  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks fell sharply today after Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated the central bank will raise interest rates
again to slow the economy. Technology stocks were unmoved, and headed higher.
</P>
<P>
	   At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 104.86 at
10,456.55.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was up 41.66 at 4,469.31, just 16 points shy of
its record close set a week ago. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 7.30
at 1,380.37.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow initially rose more than 110 points on a smaller-than-expected rise
in wholesale prices, but dropped immediately after Greenspan said the nation's
economic expansion could not last unless its grow rate slows.
</P>
<P>
	   Presenting his twice-a-year report on the economy to Congress, Greenspan
said the Fed's four quarter-point increases in the federal funds rate over the
past eight months have had little impact in slowing the economy. Greenspan
attributed his concerns about the economy to the tight labor markets and the
possibility that workers will begin to demand higher wages that could set off
inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   The market interpreted his comments as implying that the central bank is
likely to raise interest rates again-- as it has already done four times since
June.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had good news on inflation front but Mr. Greenspan's commentary sure
indicated there more than one interest rate hike to come and that's not what
market wanted to hear," said Barry Hyman, chief market strategist at Ehrenkrantz
King Nussbaum.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial stocks were hurt by the prospect of higher interest rates. Dow
component American Express fell 7 3/16 to 146. Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest
retailer, was down 4 to 48 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   But while interest rate sensitive stocks were hurt by Greenspan's comments,
Hyman noted the technology-dominated Nasdaq kept rising. "The Nasdaq is a
different ball game. It's not a credit-sensitive sector," he said
</P>
<P>
	   Intel, up 2 9/16 to 110 and biotech giant Amgen, up 3  1/2 to 73, powered
the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan's comments came after a government report today said wholesale
prices held steady in January as a sharp decline in cigarette prices offset
rising costs for gasoline, heating oil and other energy products. The
performance was a better showing on inflation than analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 460.6 million shares, up from Wednesday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index, reflecting the performance of smaller-company
stocks, rose 5.14 to 552.90.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Re-Elected Party Chief  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic opened his ruling
party's congress today, praising its ``struggle for freedom and independence''
and claiming victory over the West.
</P>
<P>
	   The congress, during which Milosevic was due to be re-elected Socialist
Party president, was a chance for the Yugoslav leader to rally his supporters,
while his opponents said there was nothing to cheer about with the country
isolated and the economy crumbling.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of Socialist Party supporters -- waving flags and chanting
``Slobo, Slobo'' -- were bused in from rural Serbia, Milosevic's stronghold, for
a rally in front of the plush Sava Center where the congress was held.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside, more than 2,000 delegates and as many guests attended the
conference, the fourth since the Socialists took over from the former Communist
Party in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Milosevic, the only candidate, was reelected party chief. No major policy
change or reshuffle in the ranks resulted from the one-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Milosevic, the only candidate for party chief, told the audience his party
``has been at the helm of the struggle for freedom and independence'' from
Western domination.
</P>
<P>
	   Socialists ``have succeeded in winning that battle,'' Milosevic said as he
received a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Movement, said in a
statement that congress delegates can only applaud ``the ruined country that has
been turned into a concentration camp isolated in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
	   The opposition charges that Milosevic and his party have turned Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, into a pariah state because of four wars it has
started in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbia has virtually lost control over its southern province of Kosovo after
a 78-day NATO bombing campaign to stop Milosevic's crackdown against ethnic
Albanians there.
</P>
<P>
	   In his keynote speech, Socialist Party General Secretary Gorica Gajevic
denounced what she called the ``brutal pressure by the American
administration,'' aiming to split Kosovo and Montenegro from the federation.
Serbia and Montenegro are the two republics that make up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   She also denounced Serbia's opposition for allegedly ``hiding behind'' the
Western powers that bombed Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   Ivica Dacic, the head of the Socialists in Belgrade, called the opposition's
local rule in the capital ``dishonest, traitor and vassal.'' The Socialists, who
lost local elections in Serbia four years ago, are preparing for new ones later
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   All domestic journalists working for major independent media outlets were
denied accreditation to cover the congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Milosevic's allies have often denounced the independent media for allegedly
being pro-Western. They have been branded ``traitors'' and heavily fined under
Serbia's media law for criticizing the government and its officials.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ahern: Britain Got Arms Proposal  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Just hours before Britain withdrew powers from Northern
Ireland's new administration, the British government had received a disarmament
proposal from the IRA, Ireland's prime minister said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said his government received details of a
secret Irish Republican Army proposal about 12 hours before Britain announced it
would reimpose ``direct rule'' in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he passed those details immediately to British Prime Minister Tony
Blair in London, contradicting claims Britain did not know about any IRA
disarmament hints in advance of suspending the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   Ahern's remarks added to the controversy surrounding Britain's decision last
week to disable the 2-month-old power-sharing Cabinet in Belfast, the intended
centerpiece of the 1998 Good Friday peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain has defended its action on the grounds that the IRA had not yet
pledged to disarm in line with a deal that formed the Cabinet in December.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition's essential Protestant participant, the Ulster Unionists, had
threatened to resign its posts within the four-party Cabinet unless action was
taken.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not going to pretend that this is not a difficult situation, because
it is,'' Blair said Wednesday night after he and Ahern spoke together to key
Northern Irish parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Their diplomacy inside Blair's London residence failed to move either the
IRA-linked Sinn Fein party or the Ulster Unionists, both of whom remained
entrenched on opposite sides of an argument over when, if ever, the outlawed IRA
should disarm in support of the Good Friday agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The ball is still firmly in their court,'' said Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble, who departed today for several days of speaking engagements in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sinn Fein can't make peace on our own,'' countered Gerry Adams, that
party's leader.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ulster Unionists agreed in November to drop their demand for some IRA
disarmament in advance of the Cabinet's formation -- but only in expectation the
IRA would disarm in response. The outlawed group offered no firm commitments to
a disarmament commission last month, triggering the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's reaction provoked the IRA -- which had offered a vague but
promising proposal to the commission -- to retaliate by retracting that
submission and breaking off contact with disarmament representatives.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview published today in the weekly IRA-Sinn Fein newspaper,
Republican News, an IRA spokesman said it was unlikely the group would reopen
disarmament talks.
</P>
<P>
	   The unidentified spokesman also declined to spell out what the IRA's
last-minute offer had been.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked whether the IRA would resume talks with the disarmament commission,
the spokesman was quoted as saying, ``What is the point engaging with a body
which the British government has rendered irrelevant?''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, President Clinton said it was ``very unfortunate'' the IRA
hadn't maintained contact with the commission, but cited the apparent strength
of the IRA's 1997 cease-fire as a bright spot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The IRA has given no indication whatever that they will revert to
violence,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Cops Admit Kidnap Report Lie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese police on Thursday admitted they lied in a press
release that said they found a woman who had been abducted and confined for nine
years, when in fact she was discovered by health workers, a news report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The police in Niigata, about 160 miles northwest of Tokyo, also acknowledged
they ignored requests for assistance from the workers who found the 19-year-old
woman in the home of her kidnapper, Kyodo News said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, 37-year-old Nobuyuki Sato, was arrested on suspicion of
abducting Fusako Sano, now 19, and imprisoning her in his second-floor room.
</P>
<P>
	   Sano was a 9-year-old in 1990 when she was abducted off the street. She says
she never left the second floor of kidnapper's house during her captivity.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kyodo report said health officials went to Sato's home when they
received a call from his mother that he was being violent.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials called the police for help when they found Sano in the
second-floor room, but were told to deal with the situation themselves, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said in their press release that they found Sano after the two turned
up at a hospital, when in fact they had been taken there by the workers, Kyodo
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials were not available for comment on the report late Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Elian Stalemate Frustrates Lawmaker  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of sending Elian Gonzalez back to Cuba
criticized the Clinton administration and the Miami exile community today for
the stalemate that has kept the 6-year old in South Florida almost three months
after he was rescued at sea.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said the Immigration and Naturalization
Service had botched the case by not implementing its ruling requiring that the
boy be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   She appeared at a news conference sporting a button with a red-framed
picture of Elian along with a written admonition that he be sent home. She and
other Democratic lawmakers were joined by religious leaders, children's-rights
advocates and an American whose two daughters were abducted by their mother in
Japan several years ago. He has not seen them since.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said he found it hard to believe that federal
official would place the boy in the hands of Miami relatives who have a
``questionable background'' -- a reference the numerous problems with the law
that some relatives have had over the years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The poor child is being used as a pawn to see who wins,'' Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian survived a crossing from Cuba last November but his mother drowned
when their boat capsized. Cuba has been demanding the boy's return but his case
has been tied up in federal court. Many Cuban exiles believe it would be cruel
to send Elian back to a country which does not adhere to democratic values.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., took aim at lawmakers who are taking steps to
grant citizenship to Elian in an effort to strip the INS of jurisdiction in the
case.
</P>
<P>
	   Asserting that there are 9 million undocumented aliens in the United States,
Serrano said that if Elian is granted citizenship, he will try to amend the
legislation to ensure that all aliens are awarded permanent residency on the
same day.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Julia Carson, D-Ind., said, ``The relationship between father and son
is the one we should focus on, not the relationship between the United States
and Cuba.''

<HEADLINE> Vaccine Panel Changes Recommendation  </HEADLINE>
    By JAMES PILCHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- In a sign that cost is becoming a factor in making
immunization policy, a government advisory committee has changed its initial
recommendation and will require fewer children to receive an expensive vaccine.
</P>
<P>
	   The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on
Immunization Policy recommended that the vaccine Prevnar be administered to all
children under 2, and given to those who are now age 2 to 5 only if they are at
high risk of contracting illnesses such as meningitis.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee had originally voted in October to recommend Prevnar for all
children under 5. Wednesday's 7-4 to change the recommendation came after a
lengthy discussion of cost implications that included a presentation from a
representative of health insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The recommendation for at-risk children affects those who are 2 to 5 now,
but eventually all children, except for those who slipped through the cracks,
will have received the shots by their second birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee recommended that black, native American or Eskimo children who
are now 2 to 5 be added to mandatory schedules because they are at higher risk.
It also recommended that the vaccine be mandatory for children ages 2-5 who have
sickle cell anemia, HIV or other immunodeficient diseases.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee said doctors should consider vaccinations for children now 2
to 5 who have had frequent ear infections, are socially or economically
disadvantaged or attend group child care. But vaccinations would not be
mandatory for children in these categories.
</P>
<P>
	   It was only the second time the committee has ever debated the potential
economic impact of a vaccine, even while some committee members felt the matter
shouldn't even be considered.
</P>
<P>
	   "This could save lives no matter what the age or the cost, and the
discussion about at what price this becomes reasonable is indecipherable to me,"
said Dr. Paul Offit, chief of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to recommend it first and figure out how to pay for it second," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other committee members argued about realities faced by the public and
private sector alike, especially with the hefty price tag of the vaccine. The
federal government pays for about half of all immunizations.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're having to look at cost more and more," said Dr. John Modlin, the
committee's chairman and a professor of pediatric medicine at Dartmouth
University. "We know (Prevnar) will be expensive in the short term, but over the
long haul ... we could see a lowering of pediatric health costs as a result of
this."
</P>
<P>
	   Federal approval of the vaccine is expected this week. Manufacturer American
Home Products Inc. plans to begin marketing Prevnar this spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Prevnar fights the bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae -- the leading cause
of pneumonia, meningitis and the millions of ear infections that lead to crammed
pediatrician waiting rooms every year.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a study, the vaccine reduced ear infections by 9 percent.
Doctor visits by those who were diagnosed as having chronic ear infections and
took the vaccine were down 20 percent, and there was a 20 percent reduction in
the number of children who needed tube implants to fight the infections.

<HEADLINE> Polls Indicate Hot GOP Contest  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When letter carrier Bill Wilson of Anderson, S.C., talks
to people on his rounds he hears lots of chatter about the state's GOP
presidential primary from Republicans, independents and Democrats alike.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think there will be quite a bit of voting by independents and Democrats,
just from delivering mail and talking to people,'' said Wilson, a Republican.
``Just from walking the streets. I see a lot of McCain and Bush signs in the
yards.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wilson's perception is backed up by polls suggesting that turnout Saturday
will be the highest of any GOP presidential primary in the state. Polls and
campaign-watchers are finding plenty of enthusiasm for Sen. John McCain and an
energized GOP base for Gov. George W. Bush -- elements for a hot contest,
indeed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are ignited,'' Clemson University political scientist David Woodard
said of core Republicans rallying for Bush. ``They are glowing in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican officials have printed an additional 400,000 ballots to be
sure they have enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnout in the 1996 Republican primary was 276,000 and a third of the voters
identified themselves as independents or Democrats, according to exit polls.
State GOP director J. Sam Daniels said he expects more than 300,000 voters this
time, and possibly many more.
</P>
<P>
	   In polls out Wednesday and today, Bush had a solid lead among Republicans
while McCain held a slightly bigger margin among independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palmetto Poll by Clemson University released today showed the two in a
very close race. Bush led McCain 49 percent to 31 percent among core Republican
voters, described as those who voted in at least two of the past three GOP
primaries. But McCain was favored by likely Democratic crossover voters, 49
percent to 39 percent. The poll included 450 people in each of the voter groups
and had an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, larger for
subgroups.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain were in a dead heat in a Los Angeles Times poll out early
this week in which 45 percent of the respondents were non-Republicans. In polls
with a smaller sampling of non-Republicans -- 40 percent -- Bush has held a slim
lead or was in a dead heat with McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them, a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll had Bush slightly ahead and a Zogby
poll had them essentially tied.
</P>
<P>
	   An American Research Group poll of 600 likely voters gave Bush 47 percent
and McCain 41 percent, with 7 percent undecided. The poll, also with 40 percent
non-Republicans, was taken Sunday through Tuesday and had an error margin of
plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   A Mason-Dixon poll done for media outlets in South Carolina had the race
essentially tied, Bush with 45 percent and McCain with 42 percent with a 4 point
error margin.
</P>
<P>
	   The third candidate in the race, Alan Keyes, has been in single digits.
</P>
<P>
	   Woodard, co-director of the Palmetto Poll, said a question for McCain is
whether all the enthusiasm for him among non-Republicans will translate into a
strong turnout on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
	   Weather could be a big factor, he said, because McCain needs a high turnout
from those less accustomed to voting in a GOP primary. If it rains, ``then God
wants George Bush'' to win, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   While many non-Republicans are expected to vote, some say the negative turn
of the campaign has cooled their enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
	   Shirley Walker, a 64-year-old Democrat and foster mother from Walterboro, is
still considering whether to vote and admits to being bothered by the campaign
tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If a person is capable and honest, they shouldn't have to do that if they
run for president,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative Republican enthusiasm for Bush has grown along with that of
moderates, independents and some Democrats for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a little concerned about the crossover Democrats trying to influence
the election,'' said salesman Guy Stanley Orr of Simpsonville.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the campaign first started, I wasn't sure how I felt about Bush,''
Orr said. ``But as I listened to him, he has answered all the questions I have
at this time.''

<HEADLINE> Descendant of Cinque to speak at Amistad launch  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MYSTIC, Conn. (AP) - The great-grandson of Cinque, the African who led a
revolt aboard the slave ship Amistad, will be the keynote speaker during the
launch of a replica of the schooner next month.
<P>
	   Amistad America Inc. chose Samuel H. Pieh over other prominent black leaders
to speak at the launch ceremony March 25, said the group's executive director,
R. Christopher Cloud.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just hit me. Why am I chasing people who would be appropriate but don't
have a relationship with this story?" Cloud said. "I said, 'Let's call him.' He
was honored to do it. Having him here will be terrific."
</P>
<P>
	   Pieh, 51, was born in Sierra Leone and now lives in Memphis, Tenn. He runs
Mid-South Africa Link, an organization that works to improve relations between
Africa and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Pieh said Wednesday he is "very much humbled and honored" to have been asked
to speak.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would like to commend the American citizens who have recognized the good
in a human being no matter where they are from," he said. "The Connecticut
community has demonstrated over and over their belief and commitment to
tolerance, their great diversity and their commitment to human rights and
justice."
</P>
<P>
	   His ancestor was Singe Pieh, also known as Cinque, who in 1839 took over the
slave ship with 52 fellow Africans as they were being transported along the
coast of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The Africans were eventually captured, taken to New London and then jailed
in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Supreme Court eventually agreed with a lower court decision that
the Africans who had survived the ordeal were free.
</P>
<P>
	   Director Steven Spielberg made the Amistad story into a movie in 1997. Pieh
portrayed the oldest captive in the movie and was a language coach for the other
actors.
</P>
<P>
	   At Mystic Seaport, a $2.8 million, 77-foot-long full-scale replica of the
Spanish ship is being built using some 19th-century tools and traditions.
Amistad America wants to use the ship as a floating laboratory to teach the
Amistad story.

<HEADLINE> Film, magazine report put staid Wesleyan to test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (AP) - Wesleyan University's image as something of a
staid liberal arts school is being put to the test with a campus pitch for a sex
film and a prominent mention in Hustler magazine.
<P>
	   Would-be student filmmaker Brian Brown recently proposed a "mockumentary"
about sex on campus, and figured on using local talent for his project.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown trolled for cast members with posters splashed around campus. The
posters said actors and actresses would "get paid to get laid."
</P>
<P>
	   Eleven students agreed to be part of the movie, including scenes with
explicit sexual content. The film's working title was "Wesporn."
</P>
<P>
	   Somebody else responded to the cast call, however - university President
Douglas J. Bennet.
</P>
<P>
	   After a tense meeting between Bennet and Brown, the would-be filmmaker
acceded to Bennet's request that he drop the project.
</P>
<P>
	   A university spokesman said Wednesday that Bennet had several concerns about
the project, including the possibility that the posters themselves represented a
threat to the safety of students.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown said he suspects Bennet's concern is more for the university's image.
</P>
<P>
	   "At some level," Brown said, "he may be right that 'Wesporn' isn't the best
publicity for the school."
</P>
<P>
	   However, the project may not be dead. On Wednesday, Brown said he would
revive the film if a poll in the college newspaper reveals broad student
support.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the latest edition of Hustler magazine carries a salacious salute
to Wesleyan.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine, known for graphic sexual content, reports on a pornography
class that was offered to Wesleyan students last year.
</P>
<P>
	   An article in the April issue entitled "Porn 101" mentions the Wesleyan
course and classes offered at other major universities.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wesleyan course, entitled "Pornography: Writing of Prostitutes," was
taught last year by Professor Hope Weissman.
</P>
<P>
	   The course, which examined pornography as a cultural and political practice,
became talk show fodder because of its subject matter and a final project in
which students produced their own pornography.

	   The class is not being offered this year; Weissman is on sabbatical. She has
said she may offer it again when she returns to campus.

<HEADLINE> Report: Japan Cops Admit Kidnap Lie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese police on Thursday admitted they lied in a press
release that said they found a woman who had been abducted and confined for nine
years, when in fact she was discovered by health workers, a news report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The police in Niigata, about 160 miles northwest of Tokyo, also acknowledged
they ignored requests for assistance from the workers who found the 19-year-old
woman in the home of her kidnapper, Kyodo News said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, 37-year-old Nobuyuki Sato, was arrested on suspicion of
abducting Fusako Sano, now 19, and imprisoning her in his second-floor room.
</P>
<P>
	   Sano was a 9-year-old in 1990 when she was abducted off the street. She says
she never left the second floor of kidnapper's house during her captivity.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kyodo report said health officials went to Sato's home when they
received a call from his mother that he was being violent.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials called the police for help when they found Sano in the
second-floor room, but were told to deal with the situation themselves, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said in their press release that they found Sano after the two turned
up at a hospital, when in fact they had been taken there by the workers, Kyodo
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials were not available for comment on the report late Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Firefighter Held for Noshing Nude  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Restaurant owners trying to figure out who was stealing the
stock installed video cameras that allegedly caught their landlord downing
expensive food and wine in the place after hours -- in the nude.
</P>
<P>
	   Albert Hohmann, a city firefighter, has been suspended without pay after
being arrested on charges including burglary, petty larceny and criminal
mischief, Fire Department spokesman Michael Regan said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hohmann, 46, owns a picturesque 100-year-old house on Staten Island and
lives on the second floor, leasing the first floor and basement to the
Tottenville Inn.
</P>
<P>
	   Michelle Macula, a partner in the restaurant, said it had been having theft
problems since the restaurant opened. At first, she and her partner reviewed
only portions of surveillance tapes recorded during business hours.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Then, in August, we rewound the tapes too far and we saw him just walking
around naked,'' she said. ``He went behind the bar and made himself a drink.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said she turned over tapes of his late-night raids to police after a
complaint lodged to him by her lawyer didn't stop the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   After downing vintage wines and taking expensive cuts of meat and seafood,
Hohmann would commit minor acts of vandalism, Macula said. The last incident
happened Friday when he was videotaped turning on water taps and flooding the
restaurant. Hohmann, a 10-year fire department veteran, was arrested later that
day.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Hohmann was the landlord, he had no legal right to be in the
restaurant when it was closed, the district attorney's office said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hohmann could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday morning. No
one answered the phone at his home.

<HEADLINE> Mexico: OPEC May Ease Oil Prices  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Latin American oil ministers are suggesting that OPEC raise its output of
crude oil in order to restrain soaring prices that are at 9-year highs and have
substantially boosted gasoline and heating oil costs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico's energy minister, Luis Tellez, said Thursday that he believes Saudi
Arabia, the largest OPEC producer, and Norway, a major producer outside the
cartel, both share Mexico's view that production should be increased.
</P>
<P>
	   His comments in a radio interview in Mexico City were the latest suggesting
that pressure is building on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
to raise production quotas at its meeting March 27 in Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Wednesday, Venezuela's oil minister, Ali Rodriguez, called on OPEC to
do something about rising crude prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's time to take corrective measures," Rodriguez said in a
televised address.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi, who is on a visit to South Korean,
was quoted as saying he favored crude oil prices in a range of $20 to $25 a
barrel. Currently crude is above $30 in the United States and is approaching
that level in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement issued Thursday by the Korean Energy Ministry also said Naimi
suggested that crude prices would fall following the high-demand winter season.
It gave no clue, however, whether Naimi favors raising quotas at the next OPEC
meeting or believes prices will moderate on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude oil exporter, and Venezuela are
among the top producing members of OPEC. Mexico and Norway are not members of
the 11-nation cartel, but both supported production cutbacks begun in 1998 to
increase oil prices from severely depressed levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil prices have more than doubled since OPEC and its non-OPEC allies agreed
in March 1999 to cut output by some 2.1 million barrels a day. That, added to
the 1998 cuts, removed more than 4.3 million barrels a day from international
markets, a decline of about 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   A series of upcoming meetings could provide clues on what OPEC may do at the
end of March.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is scheduled to travel to Mexico on
Saturday for talks with Tellez on oil prices. Next week he is expected to travel
to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait for further talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil ministers from the Arab Gulf states are due to meet next Wednesday in
the Saudi capital Riyadh to coordinate their strategy for the OPEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Tellez, meanwhile, has scheduled a trip to Norway on March 1 for talks with
his Norwegian counterpart, Marit Arnstad. A day later, he is scheduled to meet
with the Saudi and Venezuelan oil ministers.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela were the trio of oil producers that put
together the 1998 output cuts that involved both OPEC and non-OPEC producers.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Re-Elected Party Chief  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic opened his ruling
party's congress today, praising its ``struggle for freedom and independence''
and claiming victory over the West.
</P>
<P>
	   The congress was a chance for the Yugoslav leader to rally his supporters,
while his opponents said there was nothing to cheer about with the country
isolated and the economy crumbling.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of Socialist Party supporters -- waving flags and chanting
``Slobo, Slobo'' -- were bused in from rural Serbia, Milosevic's stronghold, for
a rally in front of the plush Sava Center where the congress was held.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside, more than 2,000 delegates and as many guests attended the
conference, the fourth since the Socialists took over from the former Communist
Party in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Milosevic, the only candidate, was re-elected president of the Socialist
Party. No major policy change or reshuffle in the ranks resulted from the
one-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Milosevic told the audience his party ``has been at the helm of the struggle
for freedom and independence'' from Western domination.
</P>
<P>
	   Socialists ``have succeeded in winning that battle,'' Milosevic said as he
received a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Movement, said in a
statement that congress delegates can only applaud ``the ruined country that has
been turned into a concentration camp isolated in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
	   The opposition charges that Milosevic and his party have turned Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, into a pariah state because of four wars it has
started in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbia has virtually lost control over its southern province of Kosovo after
a 78-day NATO bombing campaign to stop Milosevic's crackdown against ethnic
Albanians there.
</P>
<P>
	   In his keynote speech, Socialist Party General Secretary Gorica Gajevic
denounced what she called the ``brutal pressure by the American
administration,'' aiming to split Kosovo and Montenegro from the federation.
Serbia and Montenegro are the two republics that make up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   She also denounced Serbia's opposition for allegedly ``hiding behind'' the
Western powers that bombed Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   Ivica Dacic, the head of the Socialists in Belgrade, called the opposition's
local rule in the capital ``dishonest, traitor and vassal.'' The Socialists, who
lost local elections in Serbia four years ago, are preparing for new ones later
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   All domestic journalists working for major independent media outlets were
denied accreditation to cover the congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Milosevic's allies have often denounced the independent media for allegedly
being pro-Western. They have been branded ``traitors'' and heavily fined under
Serbia's media law for criticizing the government and its officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Unprecedented security measures have been taken in the hall in a new part of
Belgrade where the congress was held, including stopping all traffic in its
vicinity and closing the shops located in the hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Several huge party posters, displayed throughout Belgrade to announce the
congress, have been sprayed over with slogans such as ``The last congress,''
``Down with Slobo,'' and ``Thieves.''
</P>
<P>
	   A popular anti-Milosevic university students' organization held its own mock
congress in downtown Belgrade, attended by over a thousand people and several
opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The group issued a statement calling on Milosevic's government to
``immediately stop its language of hatred, repression and threats.''

<HEADLINE> House To Summon Tax-Scheme Suspects  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Bank of New York executive and her husband pleaded
guilty to helping Russian bankers launder more than $7 billion in one of the
biggest such schemes in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucy Edwards, 41, and Peter Berlin, 46, each told a federal judge Wednesday
how they used her position as a vice president in the bank's Eastern European
division to help setup illegal accounts for Russian bankers whose clients wanted
to escape taxes and erase the trail of their income.
</P>
<P>
	   The pleas came a day after the couple surrendered to the FBI after flying to
New York from London, where they had been living.
</P>
<P>
	   They could face up to 10 years in prison at sentencing May 3 but could get
lesser sentences by identifying others involved. They also agreed to surrender
more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington today, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, said he planned to subpoena Edwards and Berlin to testify about the
flow of money out of Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bank of New York case "represents a verifiable incident where the
financial system has been corrupted," Leach said in a statement. "It is critical
to review whether this is an (aberration) ... or symbolic of an endemic problem
in the international banking system."
</P>
<P>
	   The Banking Committee held hearings on the case in September at which Bank
of New York Chairman Thomas A. Renyi defended the bank's reputation but
acknowledged "a lapse" by its internal supervisors in allowing questionable
accounts to stay open. Some key figures in the investigation have declined to
testify voluntarily before the panel.
</P>
<P>
	   T. Barry Kingham, an attorney for Edwards and Berlin, said the couple will
keep cooperating with investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are anxious to fulfill their obligations here and resume a normal
life," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Their pleas were the first major admissions of wrongdoing since the
investigation caused an international scandal last August and strained relations
between Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators believe most of the money came from Russian importers trying
to avoid taxes, though they are looking into whether some came from Russian
mobsters. No one directly addressed the matter in court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   However, a prosecutor said $300,000 of the laundered money was ransom for a
kidnapping in Russia and Edwards also said bankers she teamed up with in 1995 at
the Russian bank DKB had some sinister connections.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was aware that personnel for DKB were on occasion in fear of their
customers and afraid to leave the bank because they said customers with machine
guns were waiting for them," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration of former President Boris Yeltsin has called the Bank of
New York allegations a creation by the West to tarnish Russia. The Bank of New
York has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant director of the FBI's New York office, called
the pleas a significant development but said "much remains to be done" in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Money laundering involves moving deposits through a series of accounts to
disguise their illicit source.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards described creating an illegal banking network for Russians --
without required licenses -- that was run through accounts at the Bank of New
York. The accounts were set up for shell companies with offices in New York and
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank provided the bogus companies with software that was used to
transfer money, cheating the Russian government out of customs duties and tax
revenue, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said she "suspected the accounts were being used by many people for
illicit purposes."
</P>
<P>
	   In exchange, Edwards and her husband were paid $1.8 million, a percentage of
the money being moved, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also said that after the couple moved to London in 1996, they paid a
Bank of New York employee, Svetlana Kudryavtsev, $500 a month to make sure the
accounts were operating properly.
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev was indicted last month on perjury charges for allegedly lying
to a federal grand jury about whether she or her husband had ever received money
or loans from Edwards. Kudryavtsev's lawyer has said any money his client
received was a product of her friendship with Edwards.
</P>
<P>
	   An alleged accomplice in the money transfers, Aleskey Volkov, remains a
fugitive.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards and Berlin pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy to commit
money laundering and operating an unlawful banking business. Each will remain
free on $500,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards also admitted she used her position at the Bank of New York to help
hundreds of Russians, most of them affiliated with the Russian banking industry,
to enter the United States illegally.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Reopens Afghan Art Gallery  </HEADLINE>
   By AMIR SHAH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Four years after seizing the Afghan capital, the
ruling Taliban militia reopened the National Art Gallery on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty paintings were on display, none with human figures -- according to
the Taliban's strict interpretation of Islam, human images are forbidden.
Photography is outlawed in the 90 percent of Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We give importance to art and that's why we have renovated the National
Art Gallery which was destroyed in the civil war,'' said the Taliban's deputy
minister for culture, Abdur Rehman Hotakki. ``Afghanistan has a rich and old
tradition of paintings and calligraphy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Only Taliban officials were at the gallery to admire the paintings by
Afghanistan's two late masters -- Ghulam Mohammed Maimana and Behazadi. The
works on display show Afghanistan's historical monuments, mosques and
landscapes.
</P>
<P>
	   The gallery is open to the public and hopes to promote art, said Information
Minister Maulvi Qudratullah Jamal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will try to preserve their work and promote the new talent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in 1979, Afghan artists
were among the best in Asia, Jamal said.
</P>
<P>
	   The gallery displayed all kinds of paintings and sculptures until the
Moscow-allied Afghan regime was ousted by Islamic fighters in 1991. The museum
was looted and wrecked when Islamic guerrillas captured the capital.

<HEADLINE> Britain Plans To Speed Up Adoptions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prime Minister Tony Blair will oversee a government drive to
overhaul Britain's adoption laws to remove the hurdles that leave some children
needlessly languishing in care.
</P>
<P>
	   Blair has been approached by couples wanting to adopt, complaining about
their frustrations, Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's spokesman said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They feel they have got to justify their whole life, their whole
existence,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wide variations exist in the way local social services departments approach
adoption, so consideration will be given to drafting national guidelines, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Couples adopting children older than 5 now have an average wait of five
years before proceedings are complete, while it takes an average of eight months
to adopt newborns, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell noted Blair's move was not intended to be critical of the local
departments, which he said were doing a difficult job.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, ``Real hurdles are put in the way of couples who want to
adopt. There is work to be done by the Department of Health and the Home Office.
We want to see whether new adoption laws are required.''
</P>
<P>
	   The number of annual adoptions has fallen from 20,000 in the 1960s and '70s
to about 6,000 per year -- with half those involving the child's own parent or a
stepparent, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
	   The move to change the laws was partially motivated by a report issued this
week detailing two decades of sexual abuse in children's homes in north Wales,
Downing Street acknowledged.

<HEADLINE> Comedian David Brenner Returns  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- David Brenner didn't win the network talk show, the
sitcom or the multimillion-dollar contracts that enriched a fair number of his
comedy peers. But he's still hoping for the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
	   The stand-up comic, who gained fame as a favored visitor to Johnny Carson's
"Tonight Show," is betting that his weekend HBO show from Las Vegas will
re-energize a career interrupted by family discord.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm gonna take my place back at the front of the parade," Brenner says in a
matter-of-fact tone.
</P>
<P>
	   He's not playing it safe. "David Brenner: Back with a Vengeance" (10 p.m.
EST Saturday), his first solo HBO special in two decades, is live. And the jokes
will be spontaneous: Brenner plans to riff on newspaper headlines of the moment.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm raising the wire up, high as I can get it, and I'm making it real
thin," said Brenner. "I'm going to walk a wire that few if any comedians would
dare to walk. ... This is my moment for people to say, 'Do you know anyone who
can hit the ball out of the park that way?"'
</P>
<P>
	   Brenner's cockiness, which could be off-putting, is instead engaging. Maybe
it's the mixed metaphors. Or the endearingly goony grin, unchanged despite his
54 years. Maybe it's the sympathetic response to a talented comedian who seems
to have suffered, ironically, from bad timing.
</P>
<P>
	   Or perhaps it's that, as Brenner tells it, he took a pass on stardom to put
his son's welfare first. A long, bruising custody battle forced him to curtail
his TV appearances and visibility beginning in the mid-1980s, when Brenner lived
in Aspen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
	   "In a nutshell, I couldn't work more than 50 nights a year (out of town) or
I'd be an absentee father," he said. "That was when they were giving out the
talk shows, the sitcoms."
</P>
<P>
	   He finally won the fight with a girlfriend over their son Cole, now 17, who
lives with him in Los Angeles. Brenner and his companion of 12 years, artist
Elizabeth Slater, also are raising their two boys, ages 4 and 1.
</P>
<P>
	   No regrets over his decision?
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't even make a decision. I didn't even think about it. How could you
not do it? I don't mean to sound noble," Brenner replies. "Besides, I come from
the slums of Philadelphia and everything in my life is profit. My downside is
what most people would strive a lifetime to get to."
</P>
<P>
	   What he may have lost, however, would have to rankle. After appearing some
200 times as a "Tonight Show" guest and fill-in host, Brenner seemed in the '80s
the natural choice to replace Carson. But it was Jay Leno, after jousting with
David Letterman, who claimed the late-night throne in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Brenner's approach to comedy -- mining everyday events for laughs -- was
reflected in the routines of colleagues like Jerry Seinfeld and Paul Reiser.
That pair graduated to wildly lucrative sitcoms; Brenner stayed on the
comedy-club circuit that couldn't match such rewards.
</P>
<P>
	   He's not entirely blase about that.
</P>
<P>
	   "Someone said 'You must be so proud you opened the door for so many of these
guys, Seinfeld, (Garry) Shandling, that copied you.' I said, 'Lemme tell you
something: I'm still holding the door. I never went through. I'm an idiot."'
</P>
<P>
	   There were misfires in which timing was the culprit. In the late 1980s,
Brenner proposed a sitcom that would take a behind-the-scenes look at a talk
show and its comedian-host; networks rejected it, saying viewers wouldn't care.
</P>
<P>
	   In the '90s, a similar concept flew with Shandling's "The Larry Sanders
Show."
</P>
<P>
	   Back in the '70s, Brenner seemed on the verge of sitcom success with "Snip,"
loosely based on the movie "Shampoo" and from TV hitmaker James Komack ("Chico
and the Man," "Welcome Back Kotter.") With seven episodes filmed and unaired,
NBC pulled the plug.
</P>
<P>
	   "They made up all kinds of excuses, but the reason 'Snip' was pulled is we
had an actor who was gay and who played a gay part. They were afraid to have a
gay on television; this was before 'Soap.'
</P>
<P>
	   "Today, ironically, if you don't have a gay person on the show you don't go
on the air," Brenner concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   More than that has changed. Brenner, who always worked "clean" and still
does for corporate gigs, now allows off-color language in his club routines.
He's busy writing screenplays. And he knows Hollywood's current youth obsession
will shape his comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   Network executives "are not going to offer me 'The David Brenner Show.'
Those days are over. They say 'Oh, the demographic is different, we're looking
for young people.' But there's no reason I can't be a father, the neighbor, the
boss. There's no reason I can't be the Peter Boyle or George Segal of a series."
</P>
<P>
	   Maybe not the front of the parade, but closer.

	   RAGS TO CARNEGIE RICHES: Andrew Carnegie, the self-made man who rose from
poverty to the role of captain of industry, is profiled on PBS' "The American

<HEADLINE> Coke Officially Names Daft CEO  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN BACHMAN AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola's board of directors formally elected Douglas Daft
as the company's new chairman and chief executive today, hastening the departure
of former chief M. Douglas Ivester, who had already ceded control of the soft
drink giant.
</P>
<P>
	   The board also elected Jack L. Stahl president.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement released by the company, Ivester said he would retire
immediately because the transition to Daft's tenure had been completed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The board of directors had asked me to stay on through April to ensure a
smooth transition," Ivester said. "That transition is complete, and I am very
confident that the Coca-Cola Co. is in very good hands under the leadership of
Doug Daft and Jack Stahl."
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 5, the 52-year-old Ivester announced plans to retire after Coke's
annual shareholders meeting April 19. Daft was named his successor shortly
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
	   But in recent weeks, Daft has made several management moves, making it clear
that he was firmly in charge of the world's biggest beverage company and that
Ivester's term had effectively ended.
</P>
<P>
	   While analysts have praised Daft's selection, the company's stock has
continued to flounder. Coke shares were down $1.43 3/4 at $52.12 1/2 in early
afternoon trading today on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   During retirement, Ivester will serve as a company consultant "available to
Daft and other senior management as they deem appropriate," Coke spokesman Rob
Baskin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Daft, 56, began his career with Coke in 1969 in his native Australia. Last
month, he stunned Wall Street and company observers by announcing worldwide job
cuts of 6,000, including 40 percent of the work force at company headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Stahl, 46, has been with Coke since 1980 and has managed Coke's operations
in North America and Latin America and The Minute Maid Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The board also elected Minute Maid president and chief executive Don Knauss
a Coca-Cola vice president.

<HEADLINE> Aeroflex Leaving NYSE for Nasdaq  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A small high-technology company called Aeroflex Inc.
announced Thursday it will become the first publicly traded company to move its
shares from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Companies often move from the Nasdaq to the NYSE as they grow in size and
value. For example, Qwest Communications International, a Denver-based
telecommunications company, jumped to the NYSE earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
	   But no company has ever left the Big Board for the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   The move reflects the shifting attitude of U.S. investors, who have become
increasingly infatuated with the growth potential of small tech-sector
companies, many of which are listed on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   Demand for those stocks fueled an unprecedented 86 percent rise in the
Nasdaq composite index in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Aeroflex President Michael Gorin said at a news conference in Manhattan that
the shift was made to capture the extraordinary valuations currently afforded
many Nasdaq listed tech companies and to boost Aeroflex's exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   All of Aeroflex's peers -- both in size and business model -- are listed on
the Nasdaq, Gorin said.
</P>
<P>
	   A typical NYSE listed company is currently worth about $5.3 billion. The
typical Nasdaq listed company is much smaller.
</P>
<P>
	   Aeroflex, of Plainview, N.Y., makes parts for high-tech communications
systems and has a stock market valuation of about $750 million. It first listed
on the NYSE in 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   "In 1983, the Nasdaq market was 'the other market.' Nasdaq is now at least
on a comparable plain with the NYSE. If we thought otherwise, we wouldn't have
made the change," Gorin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors pushed Aeroflex's stock up $3.81 to $43.06 in midday NYSE trading.
Its shares will begin trading on the Nasdaq on March 21 under the symbol ARXX.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE spokesman Ray Pellecchia said the exchange doesn't think the Aeroflex
move represents the start of a trend. Thirty companies have jumped to the NYSE
in the last six months -- 21 from the Nasdaq and nine from the American Stock
Exchange, which merged last year with the Nasdaq, according to Pellecchia.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Zarb, chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
which overseas the Nasdaq market, said high-profile moves by tech companies from
the NYSE to the Nasdaq will add value to the Nasdaq as it prepares for its own
shift to a for-profit company, a move expected by midyear.

<HEADLINE> Moody's May Downgrade Japan Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's efforts to reinvigorate the economy by taking on a
mountain of debt attracted another influential critic Thursday: Moody's
Investors Services.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. credit ratings agency said it may downgrade Japan's government bond
rating on fears the country can't afford to keep borrowing its way out of its
economic woes.
</P>
<P>
	   While most economists agreed just a year ago that massive public spending
was needed to lift the economy out of its worst recession in decades, many are
now saying the strategy is going to far. The government has even taken the
unusual step of turning to banks to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan, the world's second-largest economy, is also one of the most indebted.
Its public debt exceeds $5.5 trillion, or 128 percent of its gross domestic
product, making it the only major country apart from Italy with debt greater
than GDP. The U.S. national debt is half of GDP.
</P>
<P>
	   The credit rating agency said it will review its Aa1 rating, the second
highest, on bonds issued or backed by the Japanese government. If Moody's issues
a downgrade, it would be the agency's second in two years.
</P>
<P>
	   "The review is prompted by structural problems in Japan's economy that have
resulted in a level of public sector debt that will soon be the highest,
relative to GDP, among the advanced industrial economies," Moody's said.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's spending policy, who now include
prominent members of his own party, say the money is merely going to wasteful
public works projects that benefit bureaucrats and special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the structural reform needed to engineer long-term growth is
stalling and private demand remains stagnant.
</P>
<P>
	   Moody's said that the worst of the 1997-1998 economic downturn is probably
over, but that corporate retrenching and financial system reforms may not be
proceeding fast enough.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is unclear whether the reform and restructuring process will reach a
critical mass to propel Japan's economy into a higher potential growth path,
without which Japan's public-sector debt problem should continue to worsen,"
Moody's said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moody's review will examine whether Japan's economic recovery is sustainable
enough to help the government pare debt. It recognized that immediate efforts to
tackle the budget deficit might wreck the economic rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts agreed with Moody's dark assessment.
</P>
<P>
	   "The government is continuing its fiscal stimuli but a recovery of
private-sector demand has not been in sight," Susumu Takahashi of the Japan
Research Institute, a private think tank, was quoted as saying by Kyodo News.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese officials said the Moody's review is unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see any logic for downgrading the Japanese economy. Japan's
structural reforms are going on, proceeding as scheduled," said Haruhiko Kuroda,
Japan's vice finance minister for international affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week Japan's chief economic planner suggested in a televised interview
that the country's economy may have slipped back into recession. The official,
Taichi Sakaiya, said he expects to see a "considerably large negative figure"
when gross domestic product for the October-December quarter is announced next
month.

<HEADLINE> FTC Eyes Deeper Scrutiny of Mergers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission said Thursday
that the agency's reviews of mergers and acquisitions were becoming stricter
because companies are striking bigger and more complex deals.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have seen more frequent proposals that are so extensive and complex that
it is impossible to predict with any confidence that competition will be
restored and consumer welfare will be protected," FTC chairman Robert Pitofsky
said in a speech before international antitrust lawyers in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Pitofsky said the commission has already begun stiffening the requirements
placed on corporations that suggest spinning off assets and restructuring
companies to meet antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Those plans should be created by the companies, and not the government,
Pitofsky emphasized.
</P>
<P>
	   "It should be clear that the burden of coming forward without restructuring
proposals should be on the sponsors of the merger," he said. "It's not our job
-- we're not the best people to do it. It's your job."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, the commission voted 3 to 2 to block BP Amoco PLC's
acquisition of Atlantic Richfield Co., despite BP Amoco's offer to sell some of
its rights and operations in Alaska, where the company would dominate the
market.
</P>
<P>
	   Pitofsky's comments come on the heels of a blockbuster year of mergers and
acquisitions around the world. There were a total of 31,528 deals last year
worth a total of $3.4 trillion, according to Thomson Financial/Securities Data.

<HEADLINE> Critics Attend Trade Meetings  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID THURBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- They battled riot police on the streets of
Seattle, contributing to the breakdown of free trade talks in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, at this week's meeting of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development,
free trade critics are attending most meetings and eating at the same
restaurants as the official delegates.
</P>
<P>
	   The citizens' groups say their inclusion has helped address their complaints
that ordinary people have been shut out of talks shaping the future of global
trade and development affecting the lives of billions of people.
</P>
<P>
	   Even protesters from groups without accredited status have been allowed to
approach the conference site, despite an initial plan to confine them to a park
about a mile away.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this will be a new pattern for discussions of this nature in the
future," Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said Thursday. "Everybody has to
be on board."
</P>
<P>
	   Each day since the conference began Saturday, different protest groups have
peacefully delivered petitions to conference secretary Awni Behnam.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, 500 Thai farmers opposed to trade liberalization gave him a
basket of organic vegetables; on Monday, 200 environmentalists gave him a red
Valentine rose.
</P>
<P>
	   Activists give much of the credit for their inclusion to Thai organizers and
to UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens Ricupero, who scheduled a pre-conference
caucus of non-governmental organizations to solicit their views.
</P>
<P>
	   The non-governmental organizations have been given a meeting room within the
conference building and are allowed to attend most sessions and hold briefings
and news conferences.
</P>
<P>
	   In Seattle, many activists were accredited to the WTO meeting and allowed
inside to rub elbows with trade ministers and journalists, though they were kept
out of closed negotiating sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   But outside the talks in Seattle, tens of thousands of people protested
globalization, some blocking roads and preventing trade ministers from getting
into meetings. A few people staged violent rampages downtown, prompting the
mayor to declare a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   Bangkok fretted over becoming Seattle, Round II. So Ricupero made including
citizens' groups "a priority task."
</P>
<P>
	   Although a two-hour formal discussion between citizens' groups and Ricupero
failed Tuesday to bridge many differences, the activists said they were
generally pleased.
</P>
<P>
	   "We must credit Mr. Ricupero for working hard to include NGOs in this
process," said Walden Bello, a Philippine activist who heads the Thai-based
Focus on the Global South and who was among peaceful protesters in Seattle. "It
certainly was a sincere process."
</P>
<P>
	   The most notable problem happened when a lone American protester got close
enough to International Monetary Fund chief Michel Camdessus to smash a pie in
his face.
</P>
<P>
	   But while activists praise UNCTAD's attempts at openness, they say they're
still largely locked out of the more powerful World Trade Organization, which
sponsored the trade talks that collapsed in December.
</P>
<P>
	   UNCTAD researches ways that trade can help poor countries. The WTO brings
government negotiators together to seek international agreements that regulate
trade.
</P>
<P>
	   "We still have to pry open the WTO," says Martin Khor, head of the
Malaysia-based Third World Network. "Although the situation is improving
somewhat, by and large NGOs are still in the dark regarding the WTO."
</P>
<P>
	   Worse, he says, is that officials from poor countries are often not included
in key WTO negotiations, which for efficiency typically involve only a few
members -- mostly from rich and powerful countries.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's totally unbelievable," Khor says. "The challenge is how to get our
ministers of trade into the negotiating rooms."
</P>
<P>
	   Of the WTO's 136 members, between 30 and 40 are unable to afford a mission
in Geneva, where the WTO is based, so they can't participate. Others have only
one representative, who cannot attend all meetings, even if invited.	   Thai
Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpaki, who takes over the WTO's leadership
in 2002, says he hopes to find ways to make it more accessible.
</P>
<P>
	   Under consideration are faster declassification of documents and forums at
which citizens' groups can learn about the status of negotiations and express
their views.
</P>
<P>
	   But ultimately, they need to sway the governments that comprise both
organizations, Ricupero says. Governments are reluctant to make room, saying
it's their job to represent their citizens.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lawmakers Target War Criminals  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers worried about the growing number of alleged war
criminals seeking refuge in the United States are considering a bill that would
expand guidelines blocking the entry of Nazi War criminals to include recent
human rights offenders.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would cover persons who committed acts of torture in places like
Rwanda and Yugoslavia. A companion measure has already passed the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to slam the door shut on these thugs and rid our country of those
who have already managed to make their way here,'' said Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla.,
and one of the bill's sponsors.
</P>
<P>
	   One of those alleged criminals, Carl Dorelien, lives in Foley's district.
Dorelien is the former head of personnel for the 7,000-member army that seized
power from Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991 and killed as many
as 4,000 civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   He now lives in a resort community in Port St. Lucie, Fla. and won $3.2
million in the Florida lottery in 1997. Last year, in an interview with The
Boston Globe, Dorelien said the U.S. military got him a five-year visa after the
corrupt Haitian army was forced from power in 1994 by 20,000 U.S. troops.
Fifteen other Haitian military officers have since joined him in the United
States and are living mainly in New York and Florida, according to Dorelien.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is ludicrous that the INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service)
denies citizenship or permanent residency to individuals whose only offense was
to cross the border, but grants citizenship and permanent residency to
perpetrators of human rights violations,'' said Richard Krieger, president of
the International Educational Missions Inc., a group which deals with the issue
of foreign war criminals and refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill allows the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations to
expand its operations to include provisions to bar admission and deport aliens
who engaged in acts of terror abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department supports the bill but also wants to include conduct
such as persecution, war crimes and crimes against humanity, said James
Castello, associate deputy attorney general.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Havana Again Filled With Cars  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Most Cubans can't even think of buying a car in a country
where a tank of gas can cost months of wages. Yet the streets of Havana are
clogged these days with smoke-belching traffic: a testament to Cuban
inventiveness and economic improvement.
</P>
<P>
	   Only five years ago Havana was an automotive ghost town; armies of
bicyclists and pedestrians ruled the streets. Now cars have joined the maze of
bicycles, pedalcabs, motorcycles, motorized bicycles and horse carts dodging
cavernous potholes in the capital's streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Clouds of black smoke spew from the diesel engines of old Russian Kama
trucks and from ancient American cars modified to run on diesel engines.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowded streets are evidence of the U.S. dollars circulating in the
economy since Cuba legalized the possession of dollars in 1993 and then began
selling gas for dollars at special service stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost can be heavy: a gallon of regular costs almost $4, while many
Cubans make only about $10 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, enterprising Cubans are buying. Some have relatives or friends abroad
who send dollars. Others get dollar tips from tourists. Some finance their cars
by using them as taxis -- often without government permits.
</P>
<P>
	   Gasoline or spare parts stolen from the state can also be found on the black
market.
</P>
<P>
	   Old-style gas stations with their rabbit logo and ``Rapido'' signs still dot
Havana, but they're largely dedicated to patching and filling tires. State
rations of cheap gasoline have been slashed to a few gallons a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Havana's streets are a moving museum of automotive history: sleek new
Mercedes and Peugeots fight for position with three-wheel Vespa scooters,
precariously maintained Hudsons and Russian Ladas and Volgas -- even the odd
Model A.
</P>
<P>
	   There are cars that most Americans have never seen: Jeep-like AROs from
Romania, UAZs from the Soviet Union and Ssangyongs from South Korea, along with
Skodas, Moskviches, Polish Fiats and peculiar three-wheeled jitneys shaped and
painted like oranges.
</P>
<P>
	   And there are cars Americans might have forgotten: Simcas, Hillmans and
Morris Minors.
</P>
<P>
	   What rumbles under the hood is often surprising.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Cubans have removed the gas-guzzling engines from the 1950s-era
American cars, replacing them with Romanian or Russian diesels.
</P>
<P>
	   Pistons from Alfa Romeos have found their way into Harley-Davidson
motorcycles. And Cuba's creative mechanics have twisted and milled odd scraps of
metal to keep motors, bodies and suspensions together, more or less.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We repair everything here,'' said William Escalante, a burly mechanic
sitting on the curb of Del Valle Street, a center for street-corner repairs.
``We have to invent a lot.''
</P>
<P>
	   A few feet away, a fellow mechanic was fiddling with wires holding tubes to
the brake master cylinder on a decaying state-owned Moskvich. The car's
windshield bore a seal certifying it had passed a government inspection.
</P>
<P>
	   Worried about pollution and the safety of precariously maintained cars, the
government started mandatory inspections in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Miguel Cabrera Reyes, the vice minister of transportation, said about 25
percent of cars fail their first test and 10 percent fail a second time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not an alarming failure rate,'' he said, though a spot check of
windshields for inspection stickers indicates many drivers of old cars have yet
to put them to the test.
</P>
<P>
	   The challenge frustrates some.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they don't give me gasoline, how are they going to make me pass an
inspection?'' complained a driver waiting on Del Valle Street while a mechanic
fixed the brakes on his 1989 Lada. Saying he didn't want to get into trouble, he
declined to give his name -- though he offered his services as a driver.
</P>
<P>
	   Even some repairs can be risky. With parts hard to find, some Cubans have
found or bought parts diverted from state stocks. Each car's registration book
shows the legal source of its engine and other main pieces. If the numbers don't
match, the car can be seized.
</P>
<P>
	   Felix Perez displayed the book showing that his 1959 Simca had legally been
modified with steering gear from a junked Moskvich.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only thing original is the motor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He drove to Del Valle Street with a friend holding a plastic bottle of
gasoline out the window so fuel could pour through a tube into the carburetor.
Mechanics were trying to fix his gasoline pump.
</P>
<P>
	   Just getting a car can be a challenge. Owners of aging pre-revolutionary
cars can sell them to anybody with money.
</P>
<P>
	   Some professionals have been given permission to buy cars cheaply from the
state over the years -- mostly Ladas or Moskviches. Those cars can only be
resold back to the state, which pays far below the market value. Cars sold
illegally can be seized.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who work for foreign companies also can sometimes get new cars -- but
may have to give them up if they lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   A few people, such as sports stars, have been allowed cars they can freely
sell. But buying such a car can require a signed permit from a vice president or
even from President Fidel Castro himself.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Israel: Avoid Civilians  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department urged Israel today to avoid hurting
civilians in its response to attacks by the militant Islamic group Hezbollah on
Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everything must be done to prevent civilian casualties,'' spokesman James
P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We do not believe that Israeli attacks against civilian infrastructure and
populated areas will solve the problem.'' he said. ``Such actions only add to
the suffering of the people of Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first implied U.S. criticism of Israel's tactics in a
three-week-long duel with Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven Israeli soldiers were killed and more than three dozen Lebanese
civilians injured. Israel has attacked power facilities and other civilian
installations.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said last week that Israel was trying
to send a signal that it wanted the escalation of fighting to stop.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Rubin said Albright had not approved Israel's tactics. He also said
``we have not changed our opinion.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was studiously neutral as to the question of our view of that,'' Rubin
said. ``She merely recounted what the Israelis say that they were doing. She
didn't say that was a good thing, she didn't say that was a bad thing. She
didn't say we supported it, we opposed it. She was noncommittal on that
subject.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. spokesman also reiterated criticism of Hezbollah, saying it
cynically launched attacks from civilian population areas. The latest escalation
in southern Lebanon is cynical, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This escalation, in the first instance, puts Lebanese civilians and the
interests of Lebanon at risk, in addition to undermining the prospects for peace
in the region and the pursuit of Arab-Israeli peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A monitoring group was set up in 1996 by the United States, France, Israel,
Syria and Lebanon to protect civilians from shelling.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel pulled out of the group when Hezbollah killed the seventh Israeli
soldier, and Albright said the group could not meet amid escalating violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said today the American and French co-chairmen would confer in an
effort to shield civilians, but that the monitoring group had not been
dissolved.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann Reports Strong Revenues  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Mannesmann, the German phone company recently
targeted in a heated takeover battle, reported preliminary results for 1999
Thursday that showcased strong results in wireless services -- the very business
coveted so badly by the ultimately victorious suitor, Vodafone AirTouch of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues from overall telecommunications services jumped 93 percent to $8.9
billion, while mobile phone sales accounted for $4.99 billion, growing 37
percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone valued Mannesmann's growing telecommunications division so much
that it agreed this month to pay $180 billion in stock for the whole company,
which includes an engineering and automotive branch, making it the largest
takeover in history. Vodafone plans to spin off the engineering and auto
businesses later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann said net profit was roughly $490 million, below the 1998 level.
But cash flow climbed 37 percent to $4.21 billion while revenues rose 22 percent
to $22.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The preliminary 1999 results met expectations and prove the company was
worth the price tag, said Hermann Reith, a telecom analyst with BHF Bank in
Frankfurt. Still, he predicted that growth would slow this year after the
company merges with Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
	   Duesseldorf-based Mannesmann, which filed according to American accounting
principles, gave no comparative figures for 1998. More complete figures will be
available when the company releases its annual report on April 4.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann attributed the increase in telecom results to a surge in mobile
phone usage. Mannesmann's D2 service, the No. 1 mobile phone service provider in
Germany, more than doubled its number of customers to 10 million last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The results don't include Mannesmann's subsidiary Orange, a British mobile
phone carrier that must be sold off after Vodafone fully merges with Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann chief executive Klaus Esser repeatedly insisted during the 2
1/2-month dogfight with Vodafone that its strategy of fixed-line and mobile
phone services had better growth potential than Vodafone's mobile-only approach.
</P>
<P>
	   He agreed to the merger only after Vodafone came forth with a last minute
sweetened deal that gave Mannesmann a 49.5 percent stake in the combined
company, as opposed to an original offer of 47.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Group Says Chechen Refugees Tortured  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN IAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- A prominent international human-rights group alleged today
that Chechens are being tortured and abused by Russian soldiers at detention
camps.
</P>
<P>
	   Malcolm Hawkes, of the Human Rights Watch group, said that more than 1,000
Chechen males had been rounded up this month, after most rebels abandoned the
capital, Grozny, and were being detained in closed camps while Russians
investigated their possible ties with the militants.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The picture we are getting is a direct repetition of the first Chechen
war,'' Hawkes said. ``Chechen filtration camps are centers of wholesale abuse
and torture.''
</P>
<P>
	   The allegations were echoed by the World Organization Against Torture, which
issued a statement in Geneva today saying, ``We cannot ignore that the
filtration camps are indeed concentration camps where Russian soldiers are
committing the worst atrocities, in all impunity, against their prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the previous war in Chechnya, in 1994-96, there were many allegations
of mistreatment and torture in Russian-run detention camps. Fewer such reports
have emerged during the current campaign, but access to Chechnya for media and
humanitarian organizations is much more restricted this time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The abuse is going on behind closed doors,'' Hawkes said. ``There is no
access for the Red Cross, the United Nations or international human-rights
monitoring groups such as ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hawkes gave no details of the torture described by Chechen refugees in
interviews with monitors in Ingushetia, a Russian region bordering Chechnya.
However, the French daily Le Monde recently published what it described as a
young Chechen's account of life in a detention camp in northern Chechnya called
Chernokozovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The man, identified only by the first name Moussa, said people in masks had
tortured and raped men, women, the elderly and children. Prisoners were given
three meals a week and little water, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky today reiterated previous denials of
reports of torture in Chernokozovo and at a briefing singled out Le Monde's
report that children were being held there.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All this is on your conscience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that European Union observers would be allowed into the camp to see
the situation for themselves, but gave no date of a possible visit or other
details.
</P>
<P>
	   The Council of Europe's human-rights commissioner, Alvaro Gil-Robles, is due
to arrive in Moscow on Feb. 24. His office could give no details of the trip
agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   In a move possibly aimed at deflecting criticism of Russia's human rights
record in Chechnya, acting President Vladimir Putin today appointed Vladimir
Kalamanov as his special representative on human and civil rights in Chechnya,
the Interfax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalamanov is head of the Federal Migration Service, which deals with
displaced people. It is one of the agencies that has been responsible for
accommodating the approximately 250,000 people who have fled Chechnya since
Russian troops entered in September.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson told NTV television on Wednesday that
he had discussed the appointment of a human rights ombudsman for Chechnya with
Putin. Western criticism of Russia's offensive has focused largely on the
military's treatment of civilians.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Inflation Still a Danger  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today declared
the current good times "unprecedented in my half-century of observing the
American economy." But he cautioned that inflation dangers still exist and put
financial markets on notice to expect further interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Presenting the Federal Reserve's twice-a-year report on the economy to
Congress, Greenspan said conditions are remarkable with the 9-year-long
expansion, a record, turning in exceptionally rapid growth that has driven
unemployment to a 30-year low of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Ninety minutes before Greenspan spoke, the Labor Department reported that
wholesale prices were unchanged in January and that when the volatile energy and
food sectors are excluded, the Producer Price Index fell by 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though inflation has remained low outside of a burst in energy prices,
Greenspan said, this favorable condition cannot last unless the growth rate
slows to less than the 4 percent-plus gains of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan tied his worries to the tight labor markets and fears that workers
will begin to demand higher wages that could set off an inflationary spiral.
Since last June, the central bank has been trying to slow the economy, raising a
key interest rate it controls by a full percentage point.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Greenspan said today there is little evidence that those four
quarter-point increases in the federal funds rate have had much impact.
</P>
<P>
	   "To date, interest-sensitive spending has remained robust and the FOMC
(Federal Open Market Committee) will have to stay alert for signs that real
interest rates have not yet risen enough to bring the growth of demand into line
with that of potential supply," Greenspan said in testimony to the House Banking
Committee. "Achieving that alignment seems more pressing today than it did
earlier."
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts believe that the FOMC, the group of Fed board members in Washington
and Fed regional bank presidents that sets interest rate policy, will boost
rates for a fifth time March 21 and very likely will raise rates a sixth time in
May.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mr. Greenspan is telling us to expect higher interest rates," said Sung Won
Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. "He is warning that this
economic prosperity will be jeopardized unless we contain the imbalances."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 100 points before
recovering in early afternoon to a 25-point gain. The technology-heavy Nasdaq
index soared back into record territory, up 125 points.
</P>
<P>
	   David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. said that while
Greenspan "was hawkish in tone ... it doesn't imply anything more than we were
expecting. That is why the markets have not reacted very much."
</P>
<P>
	   In response to questions, Greenspan told the committee that he was concerned
about the recent rise in oil prices, which have pushed the per- barrel price
above $30 for the first time since the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said oil inventories have fallen to exceptionally low levels,
leaving the country vulnerable in coming months to a big price spike if supplies
suddenly drop further.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also noted that because of conservation moves by businesses, the
amount of energy needed in U.S. production has declined significantly in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
	   In his testimony, Greenspan noted that tight labor markets have yet to
increase wage pressures and in fact unit labor costs, a measure of wages tied to
output, actually declined in the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   He tied this good news to a remarkable rebound in the growth of
productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, which helps keep inflation
low by allowing employers to pay for higher salaries through increased
production rather than raising prices.
</P>
<P>
	   But even if the gains in productivity continue, he said, they could have a
downside for the economy by pushing soaring stock prices even higher. The Wall
Street boom has contributed to the surge in consumer demand as investors have
spent their stock gains with abandon.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of his testimony, Greenspan presented the Fed's new economic
forecast for 2000. In terms of growth, the Fed was slightly more optimistic than
the administration or the Congressional Budget Office, predicting the gross
domestic product will expand by around 3.5 percent this year. President Clinton
based his current budget on a slower 2.9 percent prediction.
</P>
<P>
	   "Although the outlook is clouded by a number of uncertainties, the central
tendencies of the projections ... imply continued good economic performance in
the United States," Greenspan told the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed was also more optimistic that inflation will slow this year,
predicting that an inflation gauge tied to the GDP will rise by around 1.75
percent to 2 percent, compared to an increase of 2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
	   As he has in the past, Greenspan urged Congress to devote the huge federal
budget surpluses being generated by the good economic times to paying down the
national debt rather than using the money for increased federal spending or
cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maintaining the surpluses and using them to repay debt over coming years
will continue to be an important way the federal government can encourage
productivity-enhancing investment and rising standards of living," Greenspan
said. "We cannot afford to be lulled into letting down our guard on budgetary
matters."

<HEADLINE> Wholesale Prices Unchanged in Jan.  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wholesale prices held steady in January as a sharp
decline in cigarette prices offset rising costs for gasoline, heating oil and
other energy products, the government said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month's performance in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index,
which measures inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was a better
showing on inflation than many analysts were expecting. It followed a tiny 0.1
percent increase in December, smaller than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
	   Cigarette prices fell by 4.9 percent in January, the largest decline since
August 1993. However, if the decline in cigarette prices were not included,
wholesale prices would have risen 0.2 percent, the government said. That would
have been in line with many analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, outside the volatile energy and food categories, the "core" rate
of inflation at the wholesale level fell by 0.2 percent in January, suggesting
that most other prices are under control. Many analysts predicted that the core
rate would actually rise by 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The government will report on price pressures at the retail level when it
releases its Consumer Price Index on Friday. Many analysts are estimating a
January rise of 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates four times since June in an
effort to slow the sizzling economy and keep inflation from escalating. Many
analysts expect the central bank will boost rates again in March, fearing that
the economy continues to grow at a too-rapid pace that probably can't be
sustained without triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told a House committee today that with the
record economic boom, inflation remains a threat, signaling even-higher interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
	   By afternoon the Dow Jones industrial average of blue-chip stocks had
reversed an earlier plunge and was up 25 points. The technology-heavy Nasdaq
index had gained more than 120.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond prices rose and yields slipped after the inflation report. Prices of
the 30-year Treasury bond were up 1-8 point, or $1.25 for every $1,000 in face
value, pushing their yields down to 6.20 percent from 6.26 percent late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In another report, the number of Americans filing new claims for
unemployment benefits fell by an expected 20,000 to 283,000 for the week ending
Saturday. That was the first decline in four weeks. The four-week moving average
that smooths out week-to-week volatility, however, rose to 281,500.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists consider claims levels below 300,000 an indication of a tight
labor market, meaning it's difficult for employers to find qualified workers.
</P>
<P>
	   While that's good for workers, economists fear employers will attract people
with higher wages and benefits -- increased costs that could lead to inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, wholesales prices grew by 3 percent reflecting a big
rebound in energy costs, which had fallen sharply in 1998 as the Asian currency
crisis depressed global demand. In 1998, wholesale prices were flat.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, all energy prices rose by a solid 0.7 percent, following a 0.4
percent gain the month before. Production limits by oil-producing nations and
increased demand because of winter weather accounted for the rise in energy
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Gasoline prices grew by a sizable 3 percent, while heating oil rose by a
whopping 6.2 percent. But residential natural gas prices fell by 0.2 percent and
residential electric power prices dropped by 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, crude oil prices moved past the $30-a-barrel mark for the first
time since the eve of the Persian Gulf War nine years ago as production cuts
adopted by leading producers squeezed world supply.
</P>
<P>
	   Total food costs rose a slim 0.1 percent in January as falling prices for
vegetables, fruits, turkeys and chickens helped offset rising prices for eggs,
beef, pork and fish.
</P>
<P>
	   Other factors contributing to January's performance in overall wholesale
prices: light-truck prices fell by a sharp 0.8 percent, while car prices rose
0.1 percent. Airplane prices, however, rose a sizable 1 percent, the biggest
gain in five years.

<HEADLINE> FTC Eyes Deeper Scrutiny of Mergers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission said Thursday
that the agency's reviews of mergers and acquisitions were becoming stricter
because companies are striking bigger and more complex deals.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have seen more frequent proposals that are so extensive and complex that
it is impossible to predict with any confidence that competition will be
restored and consumer welfare will be protected," FTC chairman Robert Pitofsky
said in a speech before international antitrust lawyers in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Pitofsky said the commission has already begun stiffening the requirements
placed on corporations that suggest spinning off assets and restructuring
companies to meet antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Those plans should be created by the companies, and not the government,
Pitofsky emphasized.
</P>
<P>
	   "It should be clear that the burden of coming forward without restructuring
proposals should be on the sponsors of the merger," he said. "It's not our job
-- we're not the best people to do it. It's your job."
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, the commission voted 3 to 2 to block BP Amoco PLC's
acquisition of Atlantic Richfield Co., despite BP Amoco's offer to sell some of
its rights and operations in Alaska, where the company would dominate the
market.
</P>
<P>
	   Pitofsky's comments come on the heels of a blockbuster year of mergers and
acquisitions around the world. There were a total of 31,528 deals last year
worth a total of $3.4 trillion, according to Thomson Financial/Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC and the Justice Department both have antitrust authority to review
mergers. After a deal is announced, the two agencies typically consult with each
other to determine which has the best cadre of experts to evaluate that
particular case.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, for example, the FTC has taken the lead on oil deals, while
Justice has examined phone mergers.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other deals in the pipeline, the FTC is reviewing the mammoth $120
billion media deal between America Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc., which also
needs approval from the Federal Communications Commission.

<HEADLINE> Low-Power FM Station Rule Attacked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's broadcasting lobby has asked an appeals court
to set aside a rule adopted by federal regulators to create hundreds of new
low-power FM stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The petition filed Wednesday in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia claims that the decision last month by the Federal
Communications Commission to authorize the stations is ``arbitrary, capricious
and otherwise contrary to law.''
</P>
<P>
	   The head of the National Association of Broadcasters, which made the appeal,
said the FCC's plan would cause significant interference to existing FM
stations. Broadcasters have opposed the idea since its inception, saying their
testing showed serious harm to the sound of existing stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC says its own tests demonstrate that low-power service can be
introduced without harm to FM radio. Last month, it adopted rules so that it
could begin by summer awarding noncommercial, educational licenses to groups
that want to operate 100-watt and 10-watt stations. That's far less than the
6,000 watts to 100,000 watts at which most FM stations now operate.
</P>
<P>
	   In a hearing today on Capitol Hill, the broadcasters' group offered a
demonstration of the interference it believes could ensue from introducing
low-power radio. The organization is also urging passage of House legislation
that would overturn the commission's rules.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Liver Therapies Researched  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL RECER AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Genetic manipulation of liver cells is pointing toward a
promising new therapy that one day might offer hope for the 20 million Americans
who suffer from liver disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Laboratory experiments that restored normal function in rats that had lost
90 percent of their livers suggest that the genetic manipulation of cells grown
in test tubes could rejuvenate failing liver functions.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, to be published in the journal Science, found a way to grow
millions of liver cells, called hepatocytes, and then transplant them into rats
that had virtually no liver function. The new liver cells took over the job of
the failing organ.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have no idea when we could use it in humans" because the technique is
still so experimental, said Dr. Philippe Leboulch of Brigham and Women's
Hospital, the chief researcher on the study. But he said it offers the promise
of one day helping stave off organ failure in patients waiting for a liver
transplant.
</P>
<P>
	   Leboulch, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said
transplanted liver cells have been used in patients with failing organs before,
but the therapy had limited success because doctors were unable to isolate
enough liver cells. Hepatocytes are very difficult to grow in the laboratory, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new technique uses a gene to solve this problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Leboulch and his colleagues inserted into laboratory liver cells a cancer
gene that forced those cells to start reproducing without limit, a technique
known as "immortalizing."
</P>
<P>
	   Although the cells multiplied by the millions, they could not be
transplanted because in the body they would be like a cancer, growing out of
control.
</P>
<P>
	   To solve this problem, the researchers treated the cells with an enzyme that
acts like a "genetic scissors. It cut out and deactivated the inserted cancer
gene, halting the rapid growth of new cells.
</P>
<P>
	   The cells were then injected into the spleens of rats whose livers had been
90 percent removed surgically. About 60 percent of these animals lived normally
after receiving the genetically engineered cells.
</P>
<P>
	   Control animals, which also were missing 90 percent of their livers, did not
receive the manipulated cells and died within three days.
</P>
<P>
	   "This system may do away with the shortage of hepatocytes," Dr. Ira Fox, a
co-author of the study, said in Science. "You could keep (the cells) in the
freezer and take them whenever you needed, which is not possible with primary
hepatocytes."
</P>
<P>
	   Fox is a liver transplant surgeon at the University of Nebraska Medical
Center in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Roy Chowdhury, a liver expert at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine
in New York, said in Science that the study results were "very encouraging," but
he questioned whether rats with 90 percent of their livers surgically removed
represented a true model of human liver failure.
</P>
<P>
	   Human liver failure often involves a virus or a toxin that may persist even
after the liver cells are transplanted, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 400,000 of the 20 million Americans with liver disease die annually.
Liver transplants are the only hope for many of these patients, but there only
enough organs to treat about 4,000 patients each year.

<HEADLINE> UPS Ordered To Add Full-Time Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- An arbitrator has ruled that United Parcel Service must
create 2,000 full-time jobs under the terms of its five-year contract with the
Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
	   In a decision released Wednesday evening, independent arbitrator George
Nicolau gave Atlanta-based UPS 90 days to add the full-time positions. UPS also
must pay back wages and benefits to those workers, who previously were
part-time.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of its 1997 contract with the Teamsters, UPS agreed to hire 2,000
new full-time workers per year for five years -- replacing part-timers -- if UPS
regained and surpassed shipping volume lost to a 15-day strike.
</P>
<P>
	   When package volume dropped because of the strike, UPS officials contended
that the job-creation language was void for the contract's first two years. The
Teamsters then filed grievances for 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's decision covered the 1997 grievance; the 1998 dispute is
pending. With shipping volumes restored, UPS agreed to create 2,000 full-time
jobs for 1999. Teamsters spokesman Bret Caldwell said the union anticipates no
further disputes on that issue for the contract's remaining years.
</P>
<P>
	   UPS spokesman Norman Black said Thursday that the company plans to discuss
the 1998 grievance with union officials since the issues are identical.

<HEADLINE> Prison interview: Market forecaster, Martin A. Armstrong, accused  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Instead of a pinstriped suit, Martin A. Armstrong is
wearing a prison-issue brown jumpsuit. Instead of expensive leather shoes, he
has on blue canvas shoes, no laces.
<P>
	   Just six months ago, the oft-quoted market forecaster from Princeton, N.J.,
drove a BMW, flew first-class, and stayed in the best hotels. He spent summers
at his $2 million beach house on the Jersey shore.
</P>
<P>
	   Now Armstrong, founder of Princeton Economics International Ltd., is accused
of committing one of the biggest securities frauds in history. He was sent to
prison Jan. 14 for contempt of court after failing to turn over corporate assets
and records.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first in-depth interview since the FBI raided his company in
September, Armstrong talked with The Associated Press about his life from riches
to rags.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong, 50, is no easy character sketch. One minute he's talking about
economic theory, the next minute he says he's the target of a U.S. government
conspiracy. But ultimately what is most striking is his will to get up off the
mat again and again.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities allege Armstrong sold $3 billion worth of securities to Japanese
companies, pledging to repay them with interest. Instead of putting the money in
conservative bonds as promised, he made risky bets on currencies and other
investments. Faced with mounting losses, he tried to hide the truth from
investors by giving them false account statements, they allege.
</P>
<P>
	   He repaid $2 billion, but still owes $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong acknowledges he was helping Japanese companies mask and try to
reverse their own losses. But he blames executives at Republic Bank of New York,
where the funds were held, for mishandling the accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   In many ways, the journey that Armstrong took started when he was 13. His
family was preparing for a European vacation. "I wanted to have my own spending
money. So I got a part-time job at a gold and bullion shop," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   But his weekend job helping out behind the counter became his passion in
high school when he saw the 1937 film "The Toast of New York," about Jim Fisk,
the 19th century medicine showman who became a notorious Wall Street financier.
Fisk went bust trying to corner the gold market in 1869.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew gold was $35 an ounce, and there I was in history class watching
Cary Grant (who played Fisk's partner Nick Boyd) reading the ticker tape quoting
gold at $162 an ounce. ... I began to find that very curious, so I started doing
reading on my own," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong's hand makes a wave-motion in the air as he describes learning
about the cyclical nature of gold prices.
</P>
<P>
	   His own life has followed a similar pattern of ups and downs: Armstrong
claims he was a millionaire at 15, but eight years later he was ostracized by
stamp collectors for fraud. He became a commodities consultant and charged
$2,000 an hour, but he owed millions in back taxes. He says he advised foreign
governments on financial issues, yet he filed for personal bankruptcy in 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about this pattern of success and failure, Armstrong blames U.S.
government agencies, saying, "They're paranoid. ... Once you beat them, they
keep coming back at you."
</P>
<P>
	   When Armstrong was a teen-ager, he was probably a lot like a young Jim Fisk.
Armstrong saw an opportunity when the U.S. Mint switched from silver quarters to
coupro-nickle clad quarters between 1964 and 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would go down to the bank and buy $100 and ask for quarters and take out
the silver and sell it," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   But a 15-year-old with $1 million?
</P>
<P>
	   "The '60s was a pretty wild period. ... There were some Canadian pennies
which had - they made a rare variety, and I had kind of lucked out and got some
of them, and then bought some others, and they went up in value quite
dramatically to the point that my mother thought people were crazy. (Coin
collectors) would fly down and buy a roll of pennies from me for $600 apiece and
she wanted to know what was going on," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong's remarkable claims of early success could not be corroborated,
and his business practices later came under fire when he started selling rare
postage stamps.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1972, when Armstrong was 23, he was expelled from a prestigious stamp
collectors' group, the American Philatelic Society.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Lamb, executive director for the organization, says Armstrong was
banned because customers complained he did not fill their mail orders or refund
their money.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's not true," Armstrong says. "There was an old coot there and they
expelled me because I was a minor. I was running a business, and I wasn't 21."
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong went on to write three reference books on stamp collecting, but
his stamp business declined.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong didn't miss a beat. He turned his love of coins and precious
metals into a commodities forecasting newsletter.
</P>
<P>
	   In May 1983, he founded Princeton Economic Consultants in the city of the
same name, with no affiliation to the Ivy League university. His success seemed
instantaneous - one month later he was quoted in The Wall Street Journal as a
high-priced consultant who charged "clients $2,000 an hour for private
consultations. Those who don't need a full hour can talk to Mr. Armstrong for
$33.50 a minute."
</P>
<P>
	   Within two years, by 1985, his company had offices in Geneva and London,
according to The International Herald Tribune, which described Armstrong's
clients as "ranging from South African gold mines to national governments."
</P>
<P>
	   Behind the headlines, though, Armstrong was in trouble again.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a complaint against him in
1985 because he was not a registered commodity adviser, and another complaint in
1987 for not keeping proper records.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong recalls, "They hit me with that subpoena to force me to turn over
all my lists of clients worldwide, which I denied. ... Then they went to the FBI
and accused me of mail fraud saying that I was selling subscriptions (of his
newsletter) and not giving them to some. I was then raided by 30 or so FBI
agents." He says the claims of mail fraud were "total B.S." He was never
prosecuted for mail fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   Around the same time, the state of New Jersey went after Armstrong for
failing to collect sales tax on gold bullion sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong disputed the interpretation of the law, claiming he himself had
written the law at the behest of state Sen. Walter E. Foran. If Armstrong indeed
had a hand in writing the bill, it never became law because Foran's 1980 bill
was vetoed by the governor. Foran died in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong fought the tax case to the state Supreme Court where he lost and
was ordered to pay more than $600,000 in back taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service raided Armstrong's office for not
keeping records on bullion purchases and sales over $10,000. IRS agents seized
his records and kept them for three years, he says, preventing him from filing
tax returns.
</P>
<P>
	   By September 1987, Armstrong's debts totaled $4.4 million, including $2.7
million in unpaid taxes. The day before Capitol State Bank was set to foreclose
on his home, Armstrong filed personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his success, Armstrong's only assets were his $344,000 house in
Pennington, N.J., $350 in cash, a gold ring and some stock in his company that
later turned out to be worthless.
</P>
<P>
	   His dire financial straits were surprising, given his reputation as a savvy
market forecaster. Armstrong and several of his clients, for example, claimed he
predicted the October 1987 stock market crash, which happened less than a month
after Armstrong sought protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Armstrong seemed unfazed by his unpaid bills and continued to expand
his business, opening offices in Hong Kong, Australia and Tokyo. When Armstrong
started raising money from Japanese investors in 1991, he was still in the
process of liquidating his estate.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong says he didn't know his bankruptcy case was still open. His memory
on the dates is poor. "I thought it was discharged in '86 or '87. I didn't find
out about that until the early '90s when the Internal Revenue Service sent me a
bill."
</P>
<P>
	   When Armstrong's bankruptcy case was closed in August 1993, the IRS and the
state of New Jersey each got $10,733 in back taxes. No other creditor got a
dime.
</P>
<P>
	   But Armstrong bounced right back, and three months later bought a $1.24
million beach house using the name of his newest company, Princeton Global
Management Holdings - one in a web of companies with the Princeton name that he
allegedly controls. The home is worth more than $2 million, according to sales
agents.
</P>
<P>
	   That same year, Armstrong lost his fight against the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission when the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against him.
</P>
<P>
	   He has never paid the $12,000 fine to the CFTC, and according to Armstrong,
he won that case.
</P>
<P>
	   Blacklisted by regulators from U.S. commodity markets, Armstrong simply
avoided their scrutiny by managing offshore investments for foreign clients.
</P>
<P>
	   In Japan, he distributed sales literature to companies and spoke at
seminars. His claims about his credentials stretched the truth.
</P>
<P>
	   His resume, for example, said he had been "studying market behavior since
1962." In fact, Armstrong was 13 in 1962. It also said he "holds a degree in
Computer Science and Engineering." It did not mention the degree is from a
two-year program at RCA Institute, a technical school in Cherry Hill, N.J.,
which no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong says he has not seen the marketing resume, which was submitted in
court papers by the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent interviews, Japanese investors said they were unaware of
Armstrong's bankruptcy or trouble with regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we had known, we would never have bought (the securities)," said Takeo
Nakahara, a manager at Maspro Denko, a Japanese electronics company. "In the end
it was all a fraud."
</P>
<P>
	   At least 26 of Armstrong's Japanese clients have filed lawsuits against him
in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging fraud and
racketeering.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutors say Armstrong lost almost $500 million trading the
Japanese yen and other investments between 1997 and 1999. Investigators are
still searching hundreds of accounts and dozens of companies for the other $500
million he owes.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, Armstrong's personal and business assets have been frozen, and U.S.
District Court Judge Richard Owen has thrown Armstrong in jail for failing to
turn over $1 million in gold bars, $1.3 million in gold coins, plus antiques and
corporate records. The judge appeared particularly annoyed that the four
computers Armstrong surrendered had been damaged or their files recently erased.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong testified that he erased the files accidentally. He said he had
done his best to turn over the assets, but wanted more time.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is $1.3 million in coins that are missing. You have pleaded earnestly
with me that you have not had a chance to look for them," Owen said on finding
Armstrong in contempt. "I don't believe that. I believe you know exactly where
they are."
</P>
<P>
	   If Armstrong does not agree to turn over the missing assets, he must prove
he does not have them. Otherwise, he may spend the next 18 months in jail while
his civil and criminal trials proceed.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the many peaks and valleys in Armstrong's life, this appears to be a new
low. And yet, he is unbowed.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am a pretty good (computer) programmer," says Armstrong, planning his
comeback. "I think I would go into developing products along the line of
Microsoft - computer software."

<HEADLINE> North Korea Showcases Mountain  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DIAMOND MOUNTAIN, North Korea (AP) -- At the icy foot of the mountain, the
North Korean guides wore tennis shoes and drab anoraks. The South Korean
trekkers had flashier gear: aluminum canes, brightly colored windbreakers and,
of course, cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   When the moment came to march, the tourists raised their fists and shouted:
``Diamond Mountain, here we come!''
</P>
<P>
	   It was no ordinary hike, partly because most of the visitors had never
ventured into communist North Korea, which shares a heavily fortified border
with the South. It was also a rare trip to one of the Korean peninsula's most
revered, pristine sites.
</P>
<P>
	   For centuries, Diamond Mountain, or Kumgangsan in Korean, has inspired
poets, singers and artists struck by its beauty. Koreans on both sides of the
border learn about it in school. Now the mountain range is a policy tool in the
Cold War's last standoff.
</P>
<P>
	   At the behest of its government, the South Korean conglomerate Hyundai has
operated cruise boat trips to Diamond Mountain on the east coast of North Korea
since late 1998. In return, poor, isolated North Korea gets desperately needed
hard currency.
</P>
<P>
	   The tours are the centerpiece of South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's
so-called ``sunshine'' policy, which promotes contacts with the North. The aim
is to chip away at the divide between the two Koreas, adversaries in a 1950-53
war.
</P>
<P>
	   For Pyongyang, the tours are a chance to showcase a site rich in nature in a
nation that lacks so much else. Deadly famine hit North Korea in the 1990s, and
food shortages persist. Transport is scarce. Most buildings are unheated.
</P>
<P>
	   Many forests are intact on Diamond Mountain -- a sign of how precious the
place is for North Korea. Elsewhere, hillsides are barren because people have
chopped down trees for firewood.
</P>
<P>
	   The government preserves dozens of ancient Buddhist temples and pavilions in
the area despite state intolerance of religion.
</P>
<P>
	   Local tourist literature describes the mountain in the superlative style
usually reserved for praise of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and his late
father, Kim Il Sung.
</P>
<P>
	   One pamphlet says in English that ``everybody is thrown into ecstasy'' at
the sight of Diamond Mountain. It continues:
</P>
<P>
	   ``The tops of some peaks look like awls or the point of the painting
brushes. So they look sharp. A chain of mountain peaks soaring around remind you
of jockeys on a racing course.''
</P>
<P>
	   At one rest stop, South Korean tourists clustered around a boulder-strewn
stream, filling bottles with spring water that, according to local lore,
delivers eternal life.
</P>
<P>
	   Kim Choon-ja, a 58-year-old South Korean housewife who visited the mountain,
said she had always wondered why it was the subject of so many songs and
paintings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I saw the mountain with my own eyes, I finally understood why. It's
just so beautiful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The totalitarian government has often linked its leaders to nature, which is
widely viewed as a source of purity and inspiration. North Korean botanists
cultivate flowers named ``kimjongilia'' and kimilsungia.''
</P>
<P>
	   Inevitably, Diamond Mountain serves as a billboard for the personality cult
that has dominated North Korea for half a century. Verses and slogans etched in
granite slabs extol Kim Il Sung, whose death in 1994 was met with a nationwide
outpouring of grief.
</P>
<P>
	   Some South Koreans grumble that the carvings sully the mountain, even as
North Korea takes pains to appear environmentally conscious. Guides collect
extra U.S. currency by fining tourists who litter or take soil or plants as
souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
	   Some environmentalists in Seoul are concerned about Hyundai's plans to build
golf courses, ski resorts and hotel complexes at Diamond Mountain. It is unclear
whether North Korea, wary of foreign influence, will approve.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kumgangsan range, which stretches 37 miles from north to south and 25
miles from east and west, is the subject of numerous fables. One tells of
fairies who descend from heaven to bathe in a mountain pool, another talks of
spirits who play checkers.

<HEADLINE> Russia Planes Pound Chechen Rebels  </HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW KRAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Chechen rebels were retreating in the face of the
Russian offensive in southern Chechnya on Thursday and were regrouping deeper in
the mountains, Russian officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian warplanes and artillery continued to batter rebel bases, striking
deep in the mountains to uproot separatist fighters from their hideouts.
</P>
<P>
	   Presidential aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky said the rebels left the villages of
Duba-Yurt, at the entrance of the Argun gorge, and had retreated from separatist
bases in the towns of Khatuni and Makhety, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels were moving southward, deeper into the Argun and Vedeno gorges,
where they were trying to build new defense positions, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the 63 combat missions by federal warplanes and helicopter gunships
carried out in the past 24 hours targeted those gorges, which cut through the
mountains to the Georgian border.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops have been slow to move high into the mountains and directly
confront the estimated 8,000 rebel fighters based there. Instead, the military
prefers to weaken the rebels by incessant shelling and air attacks ahead of what
Kremlin officials are describing as a decisive offensive.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said in Moscow that Russian troops in
Chechnya are employing new tactics of ``remote war, which is advantageous for us
and extremely disadvantageous for the bandits,'' Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, military officials confirmed plans to seal off Chechnya's ruined
capital Grozny starting Friday, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Yastrzhembsky said army commanders cannot allow Grozny residents to return
because of fears that rebels will sneak into the city in civilian disguise. He
said 300 rebels are still hiding in Grozny.

	   He said no date had been set to reopen the city because some 500 sappers
needed time to finish defusing a large number of mines left in abandoned
buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of civilians remaining in the city is unclear, though they are
estimated to number in the thousands. Some 250,000 Chechens fled the fighting
that began last fall, and many have since returned to areas in
Russian-controlled areas of the region. But few see any sense in coming back to
the ruins of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   In the neighboring republic of Ingushetia, Russian security services have
stepped up security at the Sleptsovskaya airport following an alleged rebel
threat to hijack a Russian airplane, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Chechnya has had de-facto independence since the end of Moscow's botched
1994-96 campaign there.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Chechnya-based Islamic militants tried to expand their zone of
control and invaded the neighboring region of Dagestan. Russian authorities also
blame the militants for killing about 300 Russians in a series of apartment
house bombings last fall, and say the offensive is aimed at combating terrorists
responsible for such attacks.

<HEADLINE> One-Man Will Rogers Show Ending  </HEADLINE>
    By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After nearly 30 years of performances, a one-man show
impersonating cowboy humorist Will Rogers, who pioneered good-humored insults of
presidents and politicians, comes to an end Feb. 27 in historic Ford's Theatre.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Republicans nominated Warren Harding in 1920 because Ohio hadn't had a
president since (William Howard) Taft, and they were due one," quotes actor
James Whitmore, 78, chomping a wad of gum and fingering a lariat. "Look at the
United States. We ain't had one since Lincoln."
</P>
<P>
	   And he looks up at the restored box where Lincoln was shot 135 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview, Whitmore said Rogers had once remarked of the grammar he
used on the stage: "I know a lotta people who don't say ain't, but they ain't
eatin'."
</P>
<P>
	   Rogers didn't actually speak that way outside the theater, Whitmore added.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitmore says all his lines come from those spoken or written by Rogers,
killed in an air accident in 1935. Rogers wrote a syndicated column as well as
doing rope tricks and poking fun at both major parties.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't belong to any organized party," is another of Rogers' lines. "I'm a
Democrat."
</P>
<P>
	   Rogers also took aim at legislators, saying that he didn't want a statue of
himself in Washington but if the sponsors insisted, he wanted it to face the
Capitol. That way he could keep an eye on what he once called "the best Congress
money can buy."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitmore has impersonated Presidents Truman and Theodore Roosevelt on stage.
Frankie Hewitt, producing artistic director at Ford's, said she was considering
the play "Inherit the Wind" with Whitmore in the part of attorney Clarence
Darrow. The play tells the story of the trial of a high school teacher for
expounding the theory of evolution, with three-time presidential candidate
William Jennings Bryan as the lawyer opposing Darrow.
</P>
<P>
	   Charles Rogers, Will's grandson and a professional polo player, presented a
"communicator" award to Whitmore at the official opening Wednesday night of the
final run of "Will Rogers' U.S.A." Whitmore performed it first in 1970, also at
Ford's.
</P>
<P>
	   "Will never got one of those awards, so I don't know what to say," Whitmore
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The award was given by the Will Rogers Memorial Commission, which runs a
Will Rogers museum on a 400-acre ranch in Oklahoma, where he was born.

<HEADLINE> Douglas Daft Elected CEO of Coke  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN BACHMAN AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola's board of directors formally elected Douglas Daft
as the company's new chairman and chief executive today, hastening the departure
of former chief M. Douglas Ivester, who had already ceded control of the soft
drink giant.
</P>
<P>
	   The board also elected Jack L. Stahl president.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement released by the company, Ivester said he would retire
immediately because the transition to Daft's tenure had been completed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The board of directors had asked me to stay on through April to ensure a
smooth transition," Ivester said. "That transition is complete, and I am very
confident that the Coca-Cola Co. is in very good hands under the leadership of
Doug Daft and Jack Stahl."
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 5, the 52-year-old Ivester announced plans to retire after Coke's
annual shareholders meeting April 19. Daft was named his successor shortly
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
	   But in recent weeks, Daft has made several management moves, making it clear
that he was firmly in charge of the world's biggest beverage company and that
Ivester's term had effectively ended.
</P>
<P>
	   While analysts have praised Daft's selection, the company's stock has
continued to flounder. Coke shares were down $1.43 3/4 at $52.12 1/2 in early
afternoon trading today on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   During retirement, Ivester will serve as a company consultant "available to
Daft and other senior management as they deem appropriate," Coke spokesman Rob
Baskin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Daft, 56, began his career with Coke in 1969 in his native Australia. Last
month, he stunned Wall Street and company observers by announcing worldwide job
cuts of 6,000, including 40 percent of the work force at company headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Stahl, 46, has been with Coke since 1980 and has managed Coke's operations
in North America and Latin America and The Minute Maid Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The board also elected Minute Maid president and chief executive Don Knauss
a Coca-Cola vice president.

<HEADLINE> Former GOP hopeful stumps state for George W. Bush  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Former presidential hopeful Elizabeth Dole
stumped for an old rival Thursday, telling a crowd of regional business,
community and political leaders that Texas Gov. George W. Bush would attract
more women to politics, cut taxes and bolster education.
<P>
	   "I believe we must have a president for all Americans," Dole said. "We need
a president who has vision and executive experience. I believe that person is
Gov. George Bush."
</P>
<P>
	   In her remarks to about 200 people at a Metro-Hartford Chamber of Commerce
luncheon, Dole said Bush - who was born in New Haven, while his father was a
student at Yale University - has what it takes to beat Al Gore in the general
election. But she never mentioned Bush's main rival for the GOP nomination,
Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut, California, New York and other states hold their presidential
primary March 7. A Quinnipiac College poll released Thursday found McCain
favored over Bush among likely voters in Connecticut's Republican primary, 52
percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll also found that among all registered voters, McCain is the favorite
in matchups for the presidency in November.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was favored 55 percent to 33 percent over Gore, and 50 percent to 34
percent over Democrat Bill Bradley, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Dole praised Bush's proposal for a tax cut, which has drawn fire from
McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   "The average worker is working five months for the government just to pay
his taxes. Isn't it time to give people a break and let them invest?" Dole said.
</P>
<P>
	   She also said Bush's platform will increase competition in education by
allowing local boards of education to take more control of their curricula.
</P>
<P>
	   "What you need is an increase in student performance, not paperwork," Dole
said.
</P>
<P>
	   And she said Bush would get more young people and women interested in
politics. She said two-thirds of the women in Texas voted for Bush in his
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "This gender gap that we hear a lot about is going to turn itself inside
out," she said. "Women are going to help take George Bush to the White House and
Al Gore is going to be the one with the gender gap in the year 2000 election."
</P>
<P>
	   Later Thursday, Dole was scheduled to speak at Sacred Heart University in
Fairfield about involving women in politics.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 118.47; Dow Down 7.25  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks moved higher today, carrying the Nasdaq
composite index past 4,500 for the first time, as the sector was untouched by a
warning of higher interest rates from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
Blue chips fluctuated, leaving the overall market mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   At midafternoon on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was up 118.47 at
4,546.12, running past its record close of 4,485.63 set a week ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, down more than 100 points in earlier
trading, was off 7.25 at 10,557.66. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 8.09
at 1,395.76.
</P>
<P>
	   Presenting his twice-a-year report on the economy to Congress, Greenspan
said the Fed's four quarter-point increases over the past eight months have had
little impact in slowing the economy. Greenspan attributed his concerns about
the economy to tight labor markets and the possibility that workers will begin
to demand higher wages that could set off inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chip stocks tumbled as the market interpreted Greenspan's comments as
implying that the central bank is likely to raise interest rates again-- as it
has already done four times since June.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greenspan's commentary sure indicated there is more than one interest rate
hike to come and that's not what market wanted to hear," said Barry Hyman, chief
market strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Nasdaq kept rising as technology stocks, which lately have been
largely unscathed by interest rate concerns, continued their advance. "The
Nasdaq is a different ball game. It's not a credit-sensitive sector," Hyman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel, up 4  1/2 to 111  5/8 and biotech giant Amgen, up 3 to 72, powered
the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial stocks were hurt by the prospect of higher interest rates. Dow
component American Express fell 6 5/16 to 147  3/8. Wal-Mart, the nation's
biggest retailer, was down 3  5/8 to 48 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan's comments came after a government report today said wholesale
prices held steady in January as a sharp decline in cigarette prices offset
rising costs for gasoline, heating oil and other energy products. The
performance was a better showing on inflation than analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 704.1 million shares, up from Wednesday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index, reflecting the performance of smaller-company stocks
including many high-tech issues, rose 11.04 to 558.80.

<HEADLINE> FTC Eyes Deeper Scrutiny of Mergers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission said Thursday
that the agency's reviews of mergers and acquisitions were becoming stricter
because companies are striking bigger and more complex deals.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have seen more frequent proposals that are so extensive and complex that
it is impossible to predict with any confidence that competition will be
restored and consumer welfare will be protected," FTC chairman Robert Pitofsky
said in a speech before international antitrust lawyers in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Pitofsky said the commission has already begun stiffening the requirements
placed on corporations that suggest spinning off assets and restructuring
companies to meet antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   Those plans should be created by the companies, and not the government,
Pitofsky emphasized.
</P>
<P>
	   "It should be clear that the burden of coming forward without restructuring
proposals should be on the sponsors of the merger," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, the commission voted 3 to 2 to block BP Amoco PLC's
acquisition of Atlantic Richfield Co., despite BP Amoco's offer to sell some of
its rights and operations in Alaska, where the company would dominate the
market.
</P>
<P>
	   Pitofsky's comments come on the heels of a blockbuster year of mergers and
acquisitions around the world. There were a total of 31,528 deals last year
worth a total of $3.4 trillion, according to Thomson Financial/Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC and the Justice Department both have antitrust authority to review
mergers. After a deal is announced, the two agencies typically consult with each
other to determine which has the best cadre of experts to evaluate that
particular case.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, for example, the FTC has taken the lead on oil deals, while
Justice has examined phone mergers.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other deals in the pipeline, the FTC is reviewing the mammoth $120
billion media deal between America Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc., which also
needs approval from the Federal Communications Commission.

<HEADLINE> Nickelodeon Unveils Hispanic Leads  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Striking a blow for diversity, the kids' cable network
Nickelodeon has plans for three new series with Hispanic leads.
</P>
<P>
	   The new shows are "a rounding out of our efforts to reflect the world of
kids," said Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Among eight new series for the 2000-2001 season, Nick will launch "Taina," a
multigenerational series about a 14-year-old Hispanic girl in New York City and
another live-action show, "The Brothers Garcia," which revolves around a
Mexican-American family in San Antonio. Told from the perspective of the
youngest of four siblings, "Garcia" is described as an Hispanic "Wonder Years."
</P>
<P>
	   An interactive animated series, "Dora the Explorer," will feature a
7-year-old Hispanic girl who lives inside a computer. In every episode, young
viewers will be invited to participate in an adventure.
</P>
<P>
	   Although no premiere dates were announced Wednesday, the new series are
expected to roll out between this summer and early next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Other new shows include:
</P>
<P>
	   -- "Noah Knows Best," a live-action comedy about New Yorker Noah Beznick and
his sister Megan that focuses on sibling rivalry.
</P>
<P>
	   -- "Invader Zim," a cartoon series about an alien who spies on Earth by
masquerading as a kid and attending elementary school.
</P>
<P>
	   -- "As Told By Ginger," about a sixth-grade girl caught with one foot in
dorkiness and the other in the world of blooming popularity. It's from
Klasky-Csupo, creators of the network's popular "Rugrats," "The Wild
Thornberrys" and "Rocket Power."
</P>
<P>
	   -- "Chalk Zone," which follows the adventures of a boy who discovers a magic
piece of chalk that allows him to enter a world beyond the chalkboard.
</P>
<P>
	   -- "The Fairly Oddparents," which bestows upon 10-year-old Timmy two magical
helpmates: bumbling godparents.
</P>
<P>
	   Nickelodeon next season also will air some 150 new hours of 17 ongoing
series including "Blue's Clues," "Rugrats" and "SpongeBob SquarePants."
</P>
<P>
	   Nickelodeon is the top-rated basic cable channel in households and among
children.

<HEADLINE> Uganda To Vote on Political Parties  </HEADLINE>
   By HRVOJE HRANJSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- He has been the darling of donors. He has been
championed by Western governments. But in his 14 years as Uganda's president,
Yoweri Museveni has never eased his tight grip on power.
</P>
<P>
	   That could all change soon, when Ugandans vote whether to scrap Museveni's
self-styled ``no-party democracy'' and permit political parties to run
candidates and to campaign freely in parliamentary and presidential elections
next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Museveni engineered the ban after leading a rebellion in 1986 that rescued
Uganda from two decades of bloodshed, factional turmoil and corruption. Many
view his rule as a model for dodging the political and ethnic conflicts that
have bedeviled Uganda's neighbors in central Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   But critics say ``no-party democracy'' has become less a tool to shield
Uganda from strife than to ensure Museveni's political domination. Now, five
years after the ban on official party activity was encoded in Uganda's
constitution, the system is facing a vote. Under the constitution adopted in
1995, the ballot must be held on or before July 2, but no date has been set.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's about power. If Museveni wins, than Uganda becomes a one-party state
and he stays in power,'' said Paul Ssemogerere, leader of the opposition
Democratic Party, which is boycotting the vote. ``Museveni will use fear, money
and blackmail to manipulate people to secure a majority vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since overthrowing a military junta after a five-year bush war 14 years ago,
Museveni and his National Resistance Movement have been credited with
transforming one of the world's poorest, most volatile nations to a fast-growing
liberal economy with political stability.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, Museveni defeated Ssemogerere and won five years in office.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, like now, political parties were not allowed to campaign by party
affiliation. People run as individuals, and everyone is a member of the Movement
-- which acts like a political system. Political parties can exist in name but
cannot display their colors, hold conventions, campaign or run for office.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the question is whether the country, whose stability is seen as
crucial for anchoring a region beset by civil wars in neighboring Congo and
Sudan, is confident enough to survive a possible change in power that Museveni
fears may stir up religious, tribal and regional divisions of the past.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have changed the state from terrorizing the people to protecting the
people,'' said Hope Kivengere, Museveni's spokeswoman and an architect of the
no-party system. ``(But) we fear the nature of political parties, not political
parties per se.''
</P>
<P>
	   Political referendums in Africa have produced stunning turnabouts, not
always favoring the leaders who organized the ballots. In 1993, voters in Malawi
replaced one-party rule with multiparty democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   In Zimbabwe this week, voters repudiated President Robert Mugabe, turning
away his bid for constitutional reforms that would have strengthened the
president's powers.
</P>
<P>
	   In Uganda, it is impossible to measure Museveni's popularity because the
political playing field is heavily tilted in favor of the Movement, which
behaves like a ruling party despite its insistence on being called a system,
according to diplomats, pundits and opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Museveni's base of support is not in Kampala, which is believed to contain
sizable opposition, but in rural Uganda, where many people rely on his army to
ward off rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Ssemogerere, who was Museveni's interior and foreign minister until
resigning in 1995, noted that the Movement and its officials receive state
funding. Money has yet to be dispersed equally among political parties
campaigning in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The referendum is conceived in fraud because the Movement is perceived not
as a party but as a system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ssemogerere's party said it supports multiparty democracy but will boycott
the vote, calling the issue a fundamental political right. The United People's
Congress, the second-leading opposition party, is also boycotting.
</P>
<P>
	   Some wonder if the Democratic Party and the United People's Congress,
tainted by its association with former dictator Milton Obote, can successfully
compete with Museveni.
</P>
<P>
	   And international donors, whose assistance is vital to Uganda, have
criticized the government for delaying a bill that would amend the constitution
to allow campaigning by political parties ahead of the referendum.

<HEADLINE> Pacific Island Tuvalu Joins U.N.  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The South Pacific nation of Tuvalu, population 9,000,
won support from the Security Council on Thursday for its bid to become the
189th member of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   By a vote of 14-0, the council recommended to the General Assembly that the
nation of nine coral atolls 620 miles north of Fiji be admitted as a member.
China abstained because of Tuvalu's diplomatic ties to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   The General Assembly has not set a date to vote on Tuvalu's application.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuvalu's Prime Minister Ionatana Ionatana applied for U.N. membership in
January, and the Security Council's committee on admissions backed the
application earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   China's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Shen Guofang said his government could not
support Tuvalu's admission because it has not implemented the General Assembly
resolution which recognizes Beijing as China's representative in the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At the same time, proceeding from the long-term interests of the peoples
of China and Tuvalu, and also taking into consideration the requests from
different parties including the South Pacific countries, we are not going to
block this recommendation,'' Shen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwan, under the name Republic of China, held the Chinese U.N. seat until
1971. It walked out of the United Nations just before other members voted to
give its seat to the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
	   China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province with no right to international
recognition.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Beijing delayed consideration of U.N. membership for the Pacific
island nation of Nauru for a month because of Nauru's diplomatic relations with
Taiwan. Eventually, it abstained when the Security Council voted to recommend
Nauru's membership.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations also accepted two other South Pacific island nations as
members last year, Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuvalu, formerly called the Ellice Islands, was ruled by Britain from the
1890s until 1978 when it became independent.
</P>
<P>
	   It has a total land area of 10 square miles and ranks second to Vatican City
as the world's smallest nation in population and the fourth smallest in area
after Vatican City, Monaco and Nauru.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuvalu subsists on fishing license fees, fishing, income from a national
investment trust fund, earnings by seamen who work on foreign ships and foreign
aid.
</P>
<P>
	   It is also believed to earn more than $1 million annually from a ``sex
chat'' telephone service that pays for permission to use Tuvalu's country
telephone code.

<HEADLINE> Phone Service for Disabled Expanded  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Phone companies must expand the services they offer to
Americans with disabilities by next spring under federal rules adopted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Communications Commission voted 5-0 to require a new service
nationwide that allows users to speak directly to a special operator -- trained
to identify speech patterns of those with disabilities -- who would relay the
message to the person on the other end of the line.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency is also requiring companies to bolster the quality of existing
services. For example, the commission set a minimum speed of 60 words a minute
for operators handling text telephone or TTY calls -- that are currently
available nationwide. It also ordered that Spanish language relay service be
available for interstate calls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we are doing is not just for the disabled community but for all
Americans,'' said the agency's chief, William Kennard.
</P>
<P>
	   Commissioner Susan Ness added that while most Americans don't think twice
about using the phone, those with hearing impairments and speech disabilities
may have a tough time making simple calls or even reaching emergency personnel
over the phone.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1990 federal law ordered that phone companies providing voice service had
to ensure that relay services were available throughout the region they serve.
All states now offer TTY services in which the user types a message and an
operator reads it out loud to the person on the other end.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten states offer the speech-to-speech service already in which people with
speech disabilities can use their own voice or a voice synthesizer to talk on
the telephone, using special relay operators.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the FCC action, phone carriers would have to make available the new
speech-to-speech service by March 1, 2001. Commission officials said they expect
the resulting cost increase to be minimal, possibly adding a few million dollars
to the federal pool of money -- set at $44 million for 2000 -- used to pay for
interstate relay services.
</P>
<P>
	   All telecommunications carriers pay into that fund and typically recover the
costs from consumers. Their contribution is less than 0.04 percent of their
gross revenues. Each state handles separately the costs for calls within the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators also are encouraging -- but not requiring -- providers to offer
video relay interpreting services. A live demonstration at the commission's
Thursday meeting highlighted the possibilities for using the service: Using a
video camera, a young boy communicated to a specially trained operator in sign
language. The operator, in turn, interpreted the message for a relative on the
other end.
</P>
<P>
	   The video system is particularly useful for young children who may have a
hearing impairment but may not yet be able to write or use TTY.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC also sought comments on ways to bolster public awareness of relay
services among all callers. Those who offer such services say outreach is
important so that people know they are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
at no direct cost.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's really important to get the word out,'' said Gil Becker, director of
the telecommunications access project of Maryland, which offers both text
telephone and speech-to-speech services.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton and Gore to campaign together  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton and Al Gore will campaign
Sunday in New York in the same place, at the same time, for the first time this
year as they appeal for minority votes crucial to them both.
<P>
	   Aides said Thursday that the two will attend a church service Sunday morning
in Albany that is a highlight of the annual weekend gathering of the state
Legislature's black and Hispanic legislative caucus. Both are expected to speak
at the service.
</P>
<P>
	   While Gore is planning to leave after the service to prepare for Monday's
debate in New York City against former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Clinton
expects to stay in Albany through the day and attend the caucus' banquet Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   The caucus weekend annually brings together hundreds of the state's top
black and Hispanic leaders. The minority community in New York is an
increasingly powerful voting bloc. Blacks and Hispanics made up 15 percent of
voters in the state's 1998 election for governor and U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   A big test of that minority voting power comes in the state's March 7
presidential primary, considered a major showdown for Gore and the former New
York Knicks basketball star. Both have made major appeals to minorities in their
bids for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The fact that presidential candidate Gore and Senate candidate Clinton
haven't yet campaigned together in New York has raised some eyebrows. It
prompted a front-page article in Thursday's editions of The New York Times that
carried the headline: "Gore and Mrs. Clinton Keeping A Wary Distance as
Candidates."
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Gore was asked if he and the first lady would be crossing paths
in Albany. "Don't know," he responded. Asked if he would like to, he said:
"Sure."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said there was no intentional
distancing of the two candidates and Gore's New York team appeared ready
Thursday to embrace the first lady, at least until after March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the next 19 days, she helps us tremendously," one Gore adviser said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. "Her numbers are just off the charts with
Democratic primary voters."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked recently why they hadn't been campaigning together, Gore told one
television interviewer that, "It's a matter of scheduling. Not just me, but also
her."
</P>
<P>
	   Both have made it clear that they feel they must step out of the shadow of
President Clinton. As part of that effort, Hillary Rodham Clinton has become
simply "Hillary" in campaign posters and news releases.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates have had nice things to say about each other.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm all for her. I think she's going to win," Gore said recently. "I think
she will be a great senator. I look forward to campaigning with her."
</P>
<P>
	   "I will do whatever I can in whatever way is open to me in supporting his
candidacy because I truly believe he would be the best person we could have to
lead our country into this new century," she said last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Key members of their New York campaign staffs have close relationships from
past campaigns and their offices are located in the same Manhattan office
building, three floors apart.

<HEADLINE> Judge blocks Woodbridge ordinance banning ATM fees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - At the request of bankers, a federal judge on
Thursday blocked a Woodbridge ordinance that sought to keep banks there from
charging non-customers for using their automatic teller machines.
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Joseph A. Greenaway Jr. said the banks provided
"overwhelming evidence" that the ordinance was pre-empted by federal and state
banking laws.
</P>
<P>
	   In issuing a temporary restraining order, Greenaway also ruled that the
banks would have no way to recover those fees if the ordinance went into effect
and was later overturned.
</P>
<P>
	   The restraint is to last until April 10, after which Greenaway will consider
additional arguments and decide whether to issue a preliminary injunction that
could lead to the law being permanently blocked.
</P>
<P>
	   The Woodbridge ordinance was adopted on Tuesday and would have become
effective next month. It set fines of $1,000 a day for each ATM that charged
fees. More than 25 ATMs would be affected.
</P>
<P>
	   Woodbridge Mayor Jim McGreevey, reached after the hearing, said he proposed
the ordinance because Congress has been unable to pass similar legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today, the average ATM transaction cost for a bank is approximately 10
cents, as against the average $2.43 which is charged to a consumer by one's own
bank, as well as the bank where the ATM is located," said McGreevey, whose
Middlesex County municipality is the fourth-largest in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   A banking association representative was not immediately available Thursday
to comment on ATM costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Woodbridge law is the first of its kind in New Jersey, said William K.
Heine, spokesman for the state Department of Banking and Insurance. The Newark
City Council this week began considering a similar rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Such ordinances have been stopped in other states.
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, a statewide ban on ATM fees has been upheld only for banks
chartered by the state government. The state Supreme Court in Connecticut
rejected a statewide ban similar to Woodbridge's proposal. In California, the
bans are on hold in San Francisco and Santa Monica while the courts consider the
issue.
</P>
<P>
	   At Thursday's hearing before Greenaway, Woodbridge lawyer Brian M. Hak
contended that New Jersey law permits a municipality to adopt ordinances for the
protection and "well-being" of its residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Timothy J. O'Neill, a lawyer for the New Jersey Bankers Association,
countered that a "vast" network of federal and state statutes and regulations
trump the "general catchall provision" cited by Hak.
</P>
<P>
	   Hak said the township would consent to a restraining order if the judge
permitted the text of the ordinance to be published as a legal advertisement in
newspapers, which is required to occur 20 days before the law can take effect.
</P>
<P>
	   The banks objected, arguing that even if the ordinance were restrained,
publication could subject them to consumer fraud lawsuits if they continued to
charge fees.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenaway banned publication, saying that if the ordinance is ultimately
found acceptable, the township can publish it then.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic: End NATO Kosovo Mission  </HEADLINE>
   By DUSAN STOJANOVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic rallied his
supporters Thursday at a Socialist Party congress, calling for an end to the
NATO-led Kosovo peace mission and blasting his opponents as ``weaklings and
thieves.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the congress, the first since NATO intervention left the country divided
and isolated, Milosevic sought to portray Yugoslavia as strong and stable under
his leadership, and his aides denounced America in fiery language. But opponents
said there was nothing to cheer about.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Movement, said in a
statement that congress delegates can only applaud ``the ruined country that has
been turned into a concentration camp isolated in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of Socialist supporters -- waving flags and chanting ``Slobo,
Slobo'' -- were bused in from rural Serbia, Milosevic's stronghold, for a rally
in front of the congress hall. Most were given the day off from work.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside, more than 2,000 delegates and as many guests attended the
conference, the fourth since Milosevic's Socialists mutated from the former
Communist party in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Milosevic, the only candidate, was re-elected as party chief. No major
policy change or reshuffle in the ranks resulted from the one-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   In a rare public appearance, Milosevic used harsh language to signal a
possible crackdown on the opposition, denouncing its leaders as pro-Western
``colonizers, toadies and cowards.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``In fact, Serbia doesn't have a real opposition,'' Milosevic said in his
closing speech. ``We have a group of paid weaklings, speculators and thieves
who, using money from abroad and the fact that the population lives poorly,
manipulate the people, especially the young.''
</P>
<P>
	   The opposition charges that Milosevic and his party have turned Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, into a pariah state because of four wars he has
started in the Balkans. The opposition has demanded Milosevic's resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbia has virtually lost control over its southern province of Kosovo after
a 78-day NATO bombing campaign to stop Milosevic's crackdown against ethnic
Albanians there. The economy is ruined and living standards have dropped to
among Europe's lowest.
</P>
<P>
	   Blaming NATO-led peacekeepers deployed in Kosovo for failing to protect
minority Serbs there, Milosevic called for an end to their mission.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This shameful mission of the so-called international community has
suffered a complete breakdown,'' Milosevic said. ``It has to end as soon as
possible and this country has to assume authority over the whole of its
territory.''
</P>
<P>
	   Protest was apparent throughout Belgrade. Several huge party posters
announcing the congress were sprayed over with slogans such as ``The Last
Congress,'' ``Down With Slobo,'' and ``Thieves.''
</P>
<P>
	   A popular anti-Milosevic university students' group called Otpor, or
Resistance, held its own mock ``congress'' across the Sava River in downtown
Belgrade, attended by over a thousand ``delegates'' and several opposition
leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make a clear distinction between the old and corrupt Serbia at
that (Socialist) congress, and a young Serbia that wants to live in freedom,''
said Ivan Marovic, a Resistance leader.
</P>
<P>
	   In her keynote speech at Milosevic's congress, Socialist Party General
Secretary Gorica Gajevic denounced what she called the ``brutal pressure by the
American administration,'' saying it aimed to split Kosovo and the other
Yugoslav republic, Montenegro, away from the federation.
</P>
<P>
	   She, like several other delegates, denounced Serbia's opposition for
allegedly ``hiding behind'' the Western powers that bombed Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to frequent meetings opposition leaders have had recently with
Western officials, Dragan Tomic, a leading Socialist official, said they are
``kneeling down and kissing hands of the killers of their own people.''
</P>
<P>
	   All journalists working for major independent domestic media outlets were
denied accreditation to cover the congress. Foreign media, however, were allowed
inside.

<HEADLINE> House Panel: Suspend Anthrax Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE STRONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The program to inoculate all 2.4 million American
military personnel against anthrax as protection against biological warfare is
based on ``a paucity of science'' and should be suspended, a House panel says in
a report sharply critical of the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, the Pentagon defended its program and vowed to continue the
inoculations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a very safe and effective vaccine against a very deadly biologic
agent that we know to be in the hands of many of our adversaries, and could be
used against our forces,'' Sue Bailey, the assistant secretary of defense for
health affairs, told reporters. ``That would imply were they not vaccinated and
exposed to this agent, they would die a horrible death. It is our mission to
protect those forces.''
</P>
<P>
	   The anthrax vaccine should be considered experimental because its
effectiveness against biological warfare is uncertain and the safety of troops
taking the anthrax shots is not being monitored adequately, according to the
report released today by the House Government Reform national security
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At best, the vaccine provides some measure of protection to most who
receive it,'' says a draft of the report obtained by The Associated Press.
``Just how much protection is acquired, by whom, for how long ... are questions
the Defense Department answers with an excess of faith but a paucity of
science.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Plagued by uncertain supplies, uncertain safety and unproven efficacy
against the anthrax threat, the mandatory, force-wide immunization program
should be suspended until the Department of Defense gets approval to use an
improved vaccine,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., chairman of the
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is an unrealistically broad undertaking built on a dangerously narrow
scientific, medical and industrial base,'' he said. ``The consequences are we
have some men and women getting sick.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon and Food and Drug Administration officials have said repeatedly the
vaccine is safe and effective. FDA officials also say there is no basis for
demoting the approved vaccine to an investigational drug category.
</P>
<P>
	   The 80-page report was written by the subcommittee's Republican majority
after five hearings on the immunization program.
</P>
<P>
	   The vaccine has come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers as soldiers
have expressed concerns about taking the six-shot regimen. Complaints included
fevers, muscle pain and dizziness. Reserve and National Guard pilots testified
that morale was plummeting and colleagues would resign rather than take the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are also flying our domestic planes, and if there are side-effects,
the airlines have to worry about this too,'' said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered all active duty and reserve
troops to get the shots, starting with soldiers most likely to encounter
biological warfare overseas. More than 380,000 service members have been
immunized so far.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 to 300 have refused to take it because of concerns about its
safety and efficacy, Pentagon officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 400 reports of adverse reactions have been filed, but Defense
officials said only 72 were serious enough to require hospitalization or a day
off from work. While FDA officials have linked the vaccine to few of the
reactions with a high level of confidence, the agency has not been able to rule
it out entirely.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthrax has never been used in combat, but the Pentagon fears Iraq, North
Korea and other countries -- or terrorist groups -- might try. Anthrax is a
naturally occurring bacteria found in domesticated animals; it can be produced
as dry spores that, when inhaled, cause death within a few days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feel the program is a vital force protection program against a known
threat,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the House panel's report called the program unrealistic in providing
protection against only one form of biological attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The vaccine was studied mostly for its effectiveness in protecting mill
workers and livestock handlers decades ago against infection from touching
animals or animal hides.
</P>
<P>
	   There is little research on the inhalation of anthrax spores by humans and
no long-term health research on the vaccine, the report says; therefore, the
vaccine should be regarded as an investigational drug, requiring the approval of
troops to be administered.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also says the program should be suspended because some troops do
not trust medical information provided by a Defense Department that has engaged
in ``heavy-handed propaganda,'' labeling critics as paranoid rather than
answering their questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of encouraging reporting of adverse reactions, the lawmakers said,
the military may have underreported problems with shots due to an
``institutional culture that is hostile, even resistant, to reports.''
</P>
<P>
	   The lawmakers also were critical of BioPort Corp. of Lansing, Mich., the
vaccine's sole supplier. The report recommended research and development of a
second-generation vaccine, allowing other companies to compete to alleviate
supply shortages and cost increases.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed higher Thursday as investors sought
refuge in stocks less vulnerable to higher interest rates, such as food and
utilities, in anticipation of warnings of rate hikes from U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
	   European investors expected Greenspan to indicate more interest rate rises
were on the way to prevent the U.S. economy from overheating. Greenspan didn't
disappoint when he presented the Federal Reserve's twice-a-year report on the
economy to Congress, warning of inflation threats on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
	   Other stocks less susceptible to interest rate rises, such as chemicals,
beverages and, to a lesser extent, pharmaceuticals, also rose in Europe.
</P>

<HEADLINE> AG charges that GE deceived home consumers during recall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - General Electric Co. dishwashers recalled due to a
fire hazard, with a minimal refund to customers, could have been fixed easily
and cheaply, though individuals were not offered the option, New York's attorney
general charged Thursday.
<P>
	   "The company knew how its dishwashers could be fixed - and actually provided
inexpensive repair kits to commercial customers," Attorney General Eliot Spitzer
said.
</P>
<P>
	   GE encouraged individual consumers, however, to "spend hundreds of dollars
on new machines when clearly they did not need to do so," Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorney general said he would file a lawsuit against GE later this
month seeking restitution and damages for customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The company dismissed Spitzer's claim as "grandstanding," noting that its
October 1999 recall arrangement was approved by the federal Consumer Product
Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are working very hard to communicate effectively about this recall with
our consumers and to satisfy all of them during our implementation," GE
spokesman Terry Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 3.1 million of the defective dishwashers were sold in the 1980s under
the General Electric and Hotpoint labels. The defect in the machines was in a
slide switch.
</P>
<P>
	   GE told individuals the switch could not be fixed and offered them rebates
of $75-$125 for new GE or Hotpoint dishwashers. New GE dishwashers at a Sears
store in Albany on Thursday ranged from $399 to $499.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer's office said labor would have cost about $75 for the ten-minute
procedure to correct the defect.
</P>
<P>
	   Commercial customers like hotels and landlords were provided with repair
kits, a video explaining how to fix the problem, and a $15 labor allowance.
</P>
<P>
	   GE did not deny treating individuals and businesses differently, and
suggested that was part of its agreement with the CPSC.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only winner in this case is GE, not me," Judy Cookinham, of Ilion, near
Utica, said Thursday. She said she feels stuck with her defective dishwasher
since she believes it is unsafe to use and does not want to leave it on the curb
because she could put someone else in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   And Cookinham, who works with her husband at a family auto mechanic
business, said it's too costly to buy a new dishwasher and have it delivered and
installed.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar charges are included in a class-action suit that St. Petersburg,
Fla., attorney John Yanchunis said he was filing Thursday in federal court. The
damages he is seeking - compensation for a defective product and for repairs -
would apply to every customer in the country who bought the dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
	   Yanchunis filed another suit shortly after the recall on behalf of residents
of a condominium who had the dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that in his state, GE's practices were especially problematic for
the elderly on fixed incomes.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer's lawsuit will seek restitution and damages for customers whether or
not they took advantage of the rebate.
</P>
<P>
	   The defective models include those made under General Electric and Hotpoint
names with the model numbers GSD500D, GSD500G, GSD540, HDA467, HDA477, and
HDA487. The recalled models also carry the serial number that has a second
letter of A, M, R, S, T, V or Z.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of the recall, GE and the CPSC said they were aware of 50
incidents in which the slide switch, which selects the heat drying and energy
save functions, melted and ignited fires. Seven of the fires spread beyond the
dishwashers and three damaged homes.
</P>
<P>
	   No injuries were reported.

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today
called the nation's 9 years of economic growth and the current
unemployment rate at a 3-year low remarkable. But he also said
inflation is a danger and indicated to the financial community that
interest rate hikes are highly likely in the future. Greenspan told
Congress that even though inflation has remained relatively low,
the favorable economic conditions cannot last unless growth slows
to less than the 4 percent-plus gains of the last three years.

	   Wholesale Prices Unchanged in Jan.
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wholesale prices held steady in January as a
sharp decline in cigarette prices offset rising costs for gasoline,
heating oil and other energy products, the government said today.
The showing of the Producer Price Index was better than many
analysts had expected and followed an increase of 0.1 percent in
December, the Labor Department said today. Cigarette prices fell by
4.9 percent in January. If that decline were not counted, wholesale
prices would have risen 0l2 percent.

filed tax returns they did themselves so far this year as did last
year. The change is part of an overall 10 percent e-filing increase
reported today by the Internal Revenue Service. Through Feb. 11,
1.2 million taxpayers had done their own tax returns -- usually with
tax preparation computer software or an Internet-based service --
and zapped them via the World Wide Web to the IRS. That's already
half the 1999 total and a 98 percent increase over the same period
last year.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission
said Today that the agency's reviews of mergers and acquisitions

more complex deals. ``We have seen more frequent proposals that are
so extensive and complex that it is impossible to predict with any
confidence that competition will be restored and consumer welfare
will be protected,'' FTC chairman Robert Pitofsky said in a speech
before international antitrust lawyers in New York. Pitofsky said
the commission has already begun stiffening the requirements placed

<HEADLINE> Court says teen-age model can't sue over use of her picture  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A teen model whose picture appeared in an advice
column next to a letter from a girl who "got trashed and had sex with three
guys" can't collect damages because the advice given was newsworthy, the state's
highest court said Thursday.
<P>
	   Jamie Messenger sued because she said Young and Modern magazine made it look
like she was the girl who wrote the letter.
</P>
<P>
	   But the New York Court of Appeals ruled 6-1 that she can't collect damages
because her picture was used to illustrate an article on a matter of public
interest, even though she had nothing to do with the events in the article.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have time and time again held that, where a plaintiff's picture is used
to illustrate an article on a matter of public interest, there can be no
liability," the court's majority said. "That has been so even where a
plaintiff's photograph, when juxtaposed with an article, could reasonably have
been viewed as falsifying or fictionalizing plaintiff's relation to the
article."
</P>
<P>
	   The court said there are only two exceptions to the law: when the picture
has no real relationship to the article or the article is an advertisement in
disguise. Judge Joseph Bellacosa, the lone dissenter, said there should be a
third: when there is "material and substantial falsification."
</P>
<P>
	   "Even though the column enjoys the academic quality of a newsworthy subject
matter, its presentation publicly paraded plaintiff as the epitomized subject
for sensationalized impact," Bellacosa said. "That should not be immune from the
statute's reach."
</P>
<P>
	   The suit now goes back to federal court, where it likely will be dismissed,
said lawyer Robert Sugarman, who represented the magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously we're very pleased," he said. "It basically reaffirms the law as
we've interpreted it that's been in existence for 30 years in connection with
the use of photographs to illustrate articles and columns."
</P>
<P>
	   A call to Ms. Messenger's lawyers was not returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Messenger posed in 1994 or 1995 for the magazine when she was 14 years
old. The magazine later used the photos to illustrate a letter from an
unidentified girl who was seeking advice after drinking and having sex with
three men.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter was printed with the headline "I got trashed and had sex with
three guys," and was signed "Mortified." Ms. Messenger said she never consented
to having her photos used with the advice column.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, her parents never consented to the photo shoot and Ms.
Messenger's mother sued the publisher in federal court in 1998 under sections of
New York's Civil Rights Law, which prohibits the use of commercial use of a
person's name or likeness without written consent. An exception to the law
allows the media to use photos without consent as long as they illustrate
matters of public interest or "newsworthiness."
</P>
<P>
	   The jury in that case found in Ms. Messenger's favor and awarded her
$100,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the magazine's publisher, Gruner &AMP; Jahr Printing and Publishing,
appealed the verdict in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Judges
there asked New York's highest court to decide whether that law applies to the
fictionalized use of a photo to portray a newsworthy issue.
</P>
<P>
	   In court, Ms. Messenger's lawyers conceded that the "Love Crisis" column
where the picture appeared was newsworthy and the pictures had a real
relationship with the article. They also made no allegation that the article was
really an advertisement.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given these facts, (previous case law) dictate that plaintiff may not
recover under the Civil Rights Law, regardless of any false implication that
might be reasonably drawn from the use of her photographs to illustrate the
articles," the court said in an unsigned majority decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Bellacosa disagreed, saying there were other laws that were more applicable.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a purveyor is going to present the photograph of an individual, even in
conjunction with a newsworthy item, the presentation must be legitimately made
without false or misleading material," he said. "That is still good law and
supports the affirmative answer I would give."

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Monitor Iran's Elections  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will watch Iran's parliamentary
elections to see if they signal the possibility of improved ties between Iran
and the rest of the world, the State Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration clearly hopes for a strong showing in Friday's elections
by Iran's reformers, led by President Mohammad Khatemi, but State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said it would be counter-productive for him to discuss
that issue publicly.
</P>
<P>
	   He reiterated the long-standing U.S. goal of opening a dialogue with Iran.
Iran has said the relationship should be limited to people-to-people contacts.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said President Clinton and other top U.S. officials ``will obviously
be interested to see and intrigued to see what the results of the elections will
be, in terms of what it might signal for the rule of law inside Iran and the
prospect of improved links between Iran and the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
	   At stake in the election are 290 seats. In the outgoing parliament,
conservatives hold a slight majority.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, urged voters to disappoint
the United States by shunning pro-Western candidates.

<HEADLINE> Romania Acknowledges Spill Severity  </HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MUTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAIA MARE, Romania (AP) -- The top EU environmental official demanded to
know Thursday how tons of cyanide contaminated two major rivers, killing masses
of plant and fish life in its path.
</P>
<P>
	   The cyanide poured into streams from a containment dam at the gold mine in
Baia Mare, passing through Hungary and Yugoslavia in the Szamos and Tisza rivers
before returning to Romania on the Danube.
</P>
<P>
	   EU Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstroem called the spill a ``major
environmental accident, and to the people living by the rivers, this is a
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking in Szolnok, Hungary, where she inspected the Tisza, Wallstroem said
she wanted answers as to ``what happened, how bad is the damage, and what can be
done to rehabilitate the environment.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wallstroem also called for a task force to be set up to assess and control
the damage and prevent future accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, Romanian Environment Minister Romica Tomescu acknowledged for
the first time the magnitude of the pollution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Romania did not ever want to hide or play down the magnitude of the
accident,'' Tomescu said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallstroem later arrived in Baia Mare, where angry farmers near the mine
told her of earlier spills they learned of only after their livestock died or
was blinded.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallstroem said the public should be told the truth about what happened and
the mine, which used the cyanide to process ore, should be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
	   The Australia-based Esmeralda Exploration Ltd., co-owner of the gold mine,
has denied responsibility, and its chairman said Thursday there was no
conclusive proof the company was to blame.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Quite clearly there has been contamination of parts of the river system in
the region and my heart goes out to those who may be suffering,'' Brett
Montgomery said in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange. ``I stress,
however, that there is no evidence to confirm that the contamination and the
damage said to have been caused is as a result of the tailings dam overflow at
Baia Mare.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Vienna, Austria, Philip Weller, director of the World Wildlife Fund's
Danube Carpathian Program, described the spill as ``clearly one of the major
river disasters that has happened in Europe in the last decade.''
</P>
<P>
	   He compared it to the 1987 spill of tons of agricultural chemicals into the
Rhine at Basel, Switzerland, after fire damaged a chemical warehouse owned by
Sandoz AG.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists said then that it might take a decade for the Rhine to
fully recover. Wallstroem on Thursday told reporters that the full impact of the
cyanide spill may ``come in 20 or 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tomescu said the disaster came at a particularly bad time for Romania, which
has begun negotiating eventual EU membership. He said it would not cause
tensions between Hungary and Romania, adding, ``We must show we are worthy of
the trust invested in us'' by the EU.
</P>
<P>
	   International officials say preliminary findings indicate about 100 tons of
cyanide escaped, along with tons of toxic heavy metals.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungarian Environment Minister Pal Pepo said Thursday an estimated 110 tons
of fish died in Hungary and rehabilitation of the rivers could take up to 10
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Petre Marinescu, who heads the Romanian state water company, said the fish
weren't killed by the cyanide but because of substances used to neutralize the
poison.
</P>
<P>
	   A joint commission of experts from both countries is currently investigating
the cause of the spill. International officials are reluctant to apportion blame
before their probe is completed.
</P>
<P>
	   The World Health Organization has expressed concern that heavy metals such
as lead and cadmium also might have escaped into the water, posing a potentially
far greater health threat.
</P>
<P>
	   In Yugoslavia, ecologists warned of long-term food poisoning, not only
through the cyanide but also because of dangerous concentrations of lead and
other toxic metals.
</P>
<P>
	   Fishermen in northern Bulgaria found dead fish in the Danube on Thursday,
state radio reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Health officials who inspected the water from the Danube in Bulgaria's
western Vidin region earlier Thursday did not detect any increase over the
normal level of cyanide.
</P>
<P>
	   The main crest of contaminated water was expected to reach Bulgaria on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Budapest late Wednesday, unknown assailants threw bottles of dead fish at
the Romanian Embassy. Hungary's foreign ministry expressed regret over the
attack.

<HEADLINE> Mandelson: IRA Has Key to Peace  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Confronting a deepening crisis just four months into his job,
Britain's governor for Northern Ireland said Thursday that he still didn't know
whether the Irish Republican Army would ever disarm -- ``and that is the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   Briefing American journalists in his London office, Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson defended his high-stakes decision a week ago to strip
powers from the province's 2-month-old Catholic-Protestant administration and
resume direct British rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson emphasized that if he hadn't made the move, the four-party
coalition's key Protestant party and its leader, David Trimble, would have
withdrawn within hours. That in turn would have crushed the Cabinet, whose
creation was the key objective of the province's 1998 Good Friday accord.
</P>
<P>
	   ``David Trimble would have resigned. If he hadn't resigned, he would have
been sacked,'' Mandelson said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that it was ``an elementary fact of life'' that without the Ulster
Unionists, the Cabinet would be ``a one-legged stool on its way to certain
collapse.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson's candid assessment came as Northern Ireland's roller-coaster
peace process faced a period of dangerous limbo, with the Ulster Unionists and
the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party entrenched in mutually hostile positions.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble -- who agreed to form the Cabinet alongside Sinn Fein only with the
expectation that the IRA would disarm -- now insists the outlawed group make a
cast-iron promise before he will share power with Sinn Fein again.
</P>
<P>
	   For their part, Sinn Fein leaders are furious Mandelson didn't accept a
last-minute offer from the IRA to the province's independent disarmament
commission suggesting the group's hidden arsenal might be ``put beyond use'' at
some unspecified point.
</P>
<P>
	   In retaliation for Mandelson's resumption of direct rule, the IRA broke off
contact with the commission and withdrew its vague offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked whether he thought the IRA would ever disarm, Mandelson said: ``I
don't know -- and that is the problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many people in Northern Ireland would be prepared to settle for anything
on (weapons) decommissioning, so long as they knew where they stood -- when it
was going to start, and roughly how long it was going to take,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The withdrawal of the IRA offer made even less likely the achievement of one
goal of the Good Friday accord: the total disarmament by May of the IRA and
pro-British paramilitary gangs.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson confirmed that the Irish government relayed the first details of
the IRA's offer about seven hours before he suspended the Cabinet's powers, not
afterward as had previously been suggested.
</P>
<P>
	   But he noted that the offer came nowhere near meeting the Ulster Unionists'
demand for a promise to disarm. He said it reflected ``the seeds of clear intent
by the IRA to decommission (weapons), but not a firm commitment.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson conceded that dissidents opposed to the IRA's 1997 truce might try
to poison the atmosphere further with bombings. But the dissident groups are
small, he said, and although they ``can pack a punch, they don't have any
following.''
</P>
<P>
	   He emphasized that he didn't expect the IRA to offer any fresh initiative
immediately, but that it eventually must come -- because while Sinn Fein
couldn't be blocked from its two posts in the 12-member Cabinet, the Ulster
Unionists ``can't be forced to take part.''

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Allegedly Rebuilding Army  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is rebuilding his
forces and soon may seek to test his military might again, perhaps in
pro-Western Montenegro, NATO's retiring supreme commander said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gen. Wesley Clark also suggested U.S. peacekeepers may have to stay in
Bosnia and Kosovo indefinitely, or at least as long as Milosevic clings to power
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's still a threat'' Milosevic will trigger another war, the four-star
Army general said in a grim assessment of the situation in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
	   Other than being ousted from Kosovo, Milosevic's Serbian troops, tanks and
artillery came through last spring's 78-day NATO air bombardment relatively
unscathed, said Clark, who leaves his European post in April and plans to end
his 34-year military career at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark told the House Armed Services Committee that Milosevic remains firmly
in power and that his military is training again, with ``some generals talking
about going back into Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clark cited potential ``flash points in Montenegro,'' a mountainous republic
of 600,000 people that affords Yugoslavia its last outlet to the Adriatic Sea.
It has a pro-Western government and a strong independence movement.
</P>
<P>
	   Furthermore, ``There is still Milosevic meddling going on in Bosnia,'' Clark
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Milosevic has triggered four wars over the past 10 years and while he
remains in power, people in the Balkans do not feel safe, Clark said. ``Until
he's taken to trial as a war criminal, we're not going to see a resolution to
the problem,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said Milosevic retains a chemcial-weapons capacity.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark's advocacy of a more aggressive campaign in Kosovo often put him at
odds with Defense Secretary William Cohen and other senior Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark, who remains popular on Capitol Hill, is leaving his NATO job in
April, when Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston takes over. Clark, 55, plans to retire
June 30. He has not said what he will do after that.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Pentagon has a timetable for reducing forces in Bosnia and
hopes to develop a similar one for Kosovo, Clark brushed aside attempts by
committee members to pin him down on when all the troops can come home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let me go out on a limb and give you my personal opinion,'' Clark said.
``We're not going to be able to complete that mission and wipe our hands of
responsibility until that regime in Belgrade is replaced by a democratic
government.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. troops have served in Bosnia since late 1995 and now number about
4,600. Overall, there are about 24,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia, mostly from NATO
countries. Of 37,500 peacekeepers in Kosovo, about 5,300 are Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of Congress increasingly have been critical about continued U.S.
deployments in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The introduction of ground forces to a peacekeeping operation in Kosovo
and the continuing mission in Bosnia has had a significant negative impact on
the Army,'' said Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., the committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark would not join U.S. policy-makers, including Cohen, who have
criticized European allies for relying too heavily on the United States and not
spending enough for their own defense.
</P>

	   He said European countries are willing to pay more in the future -- and
already contribute the majority of peacekeeping troops in both Bosnia and
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Furthermore, Clark said, the United States continues to have ``vital
interests in Europe. That's the reality. We learned that lesson after World War
II.''
</P>
<P>
	   Conditions in Kosovo remain dangerous, he said. Morale among U.N. forces is
low, sniper attacks continue, civilian police are massively understaffed and
there is no political consensus on the ultimate status of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Board Votes on Affirmative Action  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID MARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- With college students arriving by the busload to
protest, the State University System's Board of Regents convened Thursday to
vote on Gov. Jeb Bush's plan to drop affirmative action in admissions.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plan, the 10-university system will ban consideration of race and
gender and instead admit the top 20 percent of every high school graduating
class in the state. It is called the Talented 20 program.
</P>
<P>
	   The regents were also voting on whether state universities should take into
account such factors as socioeconomic status, whether a student's parents went
to college, and the quality of the student's high school.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics, many of them students bused in from around the state, began filling
the meeting room at the University of Central Florida more than two hours ahead
of time.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican governor has said that the proposal -- part of a larger plan
to bar consideration of race and gender in admissions and state contracting --
will increase diversity. Opponents dispute that.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a shame they are pushing forth the Talented 20 program as a hope for
minorities, when those benefiting most will not be minorities,'' said Democratic
state Sen. Daryl Jones of Miami, chairman of the Florida Conference of Black
State Legislators. He said white suburban teen-agers would benefit the most.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by the board, the rule changes must still go before the
independently elected Cabinet, which is to consider the matter Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Bones May Belong to Ancient Greeks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) -- Archaeological finds uncovered at a construction
site in Athens include human remains, possibly those of citizen-soldiers from
the Peloponnesian War eulogized by Pericles in one of history's best-known
orations.
</P>
<P>
	   The remains have been sent to New York to undergo analysis by Dr. Anagnostis
Agelarakis, a forensic anthropologist at Adelphi University and specialist in
Greek archaeology.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The discovery of state burials containing bones dating from the early
years of the Peloponnesian War brings a new sense of reality to the story of
that crucial time in Greek history,'' Dr. Andrew Szegedy-Maszak, a scholar of
classical studies at Wesleyan University, said in an article in the current
issue of Archaeology magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   Historians believe that the statesman Pericles spoke in 431 B.C. at the mass
burial for Athenian soldiers killed in battle against the Spartans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is for such a city, then, that these men nobly died in battle,'' he
declared, ``thinking it right not to be deprived of her, just as each of their
survivors should be willing to toil for her sake.''
</P>
<P>
	   Archaeologists said the evidence is strong that the bones, found three years
ago during excavation for a theater, could be those of the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   All the remains appear to be those of men. The site of the burials matches
descriptions in literature of the honored burial ground for statesmen, generals
and soldiers who died in combat. Also, the style of pottery dated the tombs to
431 to 421 B.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the cremation of the bodies -- a custom for heroes in classical
Greece -- many recognizable pieces of arm and leg bones, skull and jaw and
vertebra and pelvis fragments can be found among the 200 pounds of bones.
Agelarakis first thought there were 200 to 250 soldiers represented in the
collection, but said Thursday he thinks the number is far lower, although he
refused to estimate.
</P>
<P>
	   Agelarakis, who was chosen by Greek authorities, said further analysis would
focus on determining the age and physical range of the soldiers, their diets,
the diseases and accidents they suffered. He also said he would look for any
evidence of broken bones being treated, as well as traces of heavy metals they
might have ingested.
</P>
<P>
	   He said, however, that cremation would have destroyed organic material in
the bones, including DNA.
</P>
<P>
	   The process is expected to take several years.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Above 4,500; Dow Off 51.19  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks moved higher today, carrying the Nasdaq
composite index past 4,500 for the first time, as the sector was untouched by a
warning of higher interest rates from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
Blue chips were down, leaving the overall market mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   In late afternoon on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was up 98.25 at
4,525.90, running past its record close of 4,485.63 set a week ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, off more than 100 points in earlier
trading, was down 51.19 at 10,454.92. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down
0.26 at 1,387.41.
</P>
<P>
	   Presenting his twice-a-year report on the economy to Congress, Greenspan
said the Fed's four quarter-point increases over the past eight months have had
little effect in slowing the economy. Greenspan attributed his concerns about
the economy to tight labor markets and the possibility that workers will begin
to demand higher wages that could set off inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chip stocks tumbled as the market interpreted Greenspan's comments as
implying that the central bank is likely to raise interest rates again-- as it
has already done four times since June.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greenspan's commentary sure indicated there is more than one interest rate
hike to come and that's not what market wanted to hear," said Barry Hyman, chief
market strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Nasdaq kept rising as technology stocks, which have been largely
unscathed by recent interest rate concerns, continued their advance. "The Nasdaq
is a different ball game. It's not a credit-sensitive sector," Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel, up 4  1/2 to 111  5/8 and biotech giant Amgen, up 3 to 72, powered
the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial stocks were hurt by the prospect of higher interest rates. Dow
component American Express fell 6 15/16 to 146 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Retailers also tumbled with Wal-Mart down 3 1/2 to 48 5/8 and Home Depot
down 3 5/8 53  7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan's comments came after a government report today said wholesale
prices held steady in January as a sharp decline in cigarette prices offset
rising costs for gasoline, heating oil and other energy products. The
performance was a better showing on inflation than analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 828.6 million shares, up from Wednesday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index, reflecting the performance of smaller-company stocks
including many high-tech issues, rose 8.13 to 555.93.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Mrs. Clinton Campaign Together  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton and Al Gore will campaign Sunday
in New York in the same place, at the same time, for the first time this year,
as they appeal for minority votes crucial to them both.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said Thursday that the two will attend a church service Sunday morning
in Albany that is a highlight of the annual weekend gathering of the state
Legislature's black and Hispanic legislative caucus. Both candidates are
expected to speak at the service.
</P>
<P>
	   While the vice president is planning to leave after the service to prepare
for Monday's debate in New York City against former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley, Clinton expects to stay in Albany through the day and attend the
caucus' banquet Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The minority community in New York is an increasingly powerful voting bloc.
Blacks and Hispanics made up 15 percent of voters in the state's 1998 election
for governor and Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   A big test of that minority voting power comes in the state's March 7
presidential primary, considered a major showdown for Gore and the former New
York Knicks basketball star. Both have made major appeals to minorities in their
bids for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The fact that presidential candidate Gore and Senate candidate Clinton
haven't yet campaigned together in New York has raised some eyebrows. It
prompted a front-page article in Thursday's New York Times headlined: ``Gore and
Mrs. Clinton Keeping a Wary Distance as Candidates.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked recently why they hadn't been campaigning together, Gore told a TV
interviewer: ``It's a matter of scheduling. Not just me, but also her.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said that there was no intentional
distancing of the two candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Both have made it clear that they feel they must step out of the shadow of
President Clinton. As part of that effort, Hillary Rodham Clinton has become
simply ``Hillary'' in campaign posters and news releases.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates have had nice things to say about each other.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm all for her. I think she's going to win,'' Gore said recently. ``I
think she will be a great senator. I look forward to campaigning with her.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said last summer: ``I will do whatever I can in whatever way is open
to me in supporting his candidacy because I truly believe he would be the best
person we could have to lead our country into this new century.''
</P>
<P>
	   Key members of their New York campaign staffs have close relationships from
past campaigns and their offices are in the same Manhattan office building,
three floors apart.

<HEADLINE> Family Wants Sri Lanka Boy in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW WELSH-HUGGINS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Relatives of an 11-year-old Sri Lankan boy are
fighting to keep him in the United States, fearing he will be forced to fight in
a civil war if he is sent back to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   His aunt and uncle won permanent custody Wednesday, giving them a second
avenue to fight deportation, said Dennis Muchnicki, an attorney representing
Senthan Mahendrarajah.
</P>
<P>
	   Senthan has been in the United States since June and is in fifth grade in a
suburban Columbis public school.
</P>
<P>
	   His uncle, physicist Ambalavanar Thavendrarajah, has said the boy will be
killed if he is deported to Sri Lanka, where his mother still lives.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service detained Senthan in June at
Sea-Tac International Airport in Seattle because he had entered the United
States without a valid visa, court papers say. He was brought to Columbus after
relatives posted $2,500 bail.
</P>
<P>
	   By seeking custody for a U.S. relative, Muchnicki is trying a tactic used in
the case of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy the INS ordered returned from
Miami to his father in Cuba. One big difference is that the surviving parent in
Sri Lanka is said to want Senthan to be here, while Elian's father wants him
back in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   An INS hearing for Senthan is scheduled in Cincinnati next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Hansen, district director with the INS in Cleveland, said an
immigration judge will decide whether the custody decision has any bearing on
the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Generally, it doesn't have an impact, but I can't speak specifically to
this case,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Senthan was traveling alone and changing planes on his way to live with a
relative in Canada when he was detained, said his aunt, Dr. Vasanthy
Thavendrarajah. Both she and her husband have been in the United States since
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Senthan's father died last year as a result of inadequate medical treatment
for a failing kidney, Mrs. Thavendrarajah said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Senthan and his family belong to the Tamil ethnic minority in Sri Lanka,
where the Sinhalese majority controls the government. Tamil rebels recruit boys
to assist military and terrorist operations in the island nation south of India,
papers filed in juvenile court said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Abduction and summary executions of young Tamil boys is a common tactic
employed by Sinhalese security forces,'' according to the papers.
</P>
<P>
	   In Sri Lanka, Senthan was jailed on suspicion of being an accomplice of a
Tamil rebel group, the court filings say. He was beaten in jail and told he
would either have to become a counter-informant or be killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Relatives in Sri Lanka sold their possessions to raise money to get him out
of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Senthan's mother, after learning he was in the United States, indicated in a
letter that she wanted him to remain there, court papers said. At Wednesday's
court hearing, his uncle testified that 20 civilians were recently killed in a
market bombing in the boy's mother's village.
</P>
<P>
	   When he first arrived in Ohio, Senthan would hold his hand his hand like a
gun and pretend to shoot things, Mrs. Thavendrarajah has said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is well-disciplined now. He enjoys playing with games and toys,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> Son of Watergate Judge Decries Book  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The son of the federal judge who presided over the
Watergate criminal trials is angry over a new book that describes his late
father as corrupt, dishonest and having ``clear ties'' to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
	   John J. Sirica Jr. said Thursday he asked the book's publisher this week to
issue a retraction and remove the statement from future editions of ``Gone: The
Last Days of The New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
	   The book by Renata Adler focuses on The New Yorker magazine. Adler wrote
that when she was asked to review a book by U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica
she found that ``contrary to his reputation as a hero, Sirica was in fact a
corrupt, incompetent, and dishonest figure, with a close connection to Senator
Joseph McCarthy and clear ties to organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sirica, who died in 1992, presided over the main Watergate criminal trials
and ordered the production of the White House tapes that ultimately proved to be
President Nixon's downfall.
</P>
<P>
	   His son said Thursday the allegation that the judge had ties to organized
crime was ``patently false and absurd.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it's not malicious, it's so egregiously ill-informed and without any
checking behind it as far as I can see, to be ludicrous,'' said the younger
Sirica, a Newsday reporter. ``I'm very angry about it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sirica said it was true that his father had been friends with McCarthy
during the early 1950s and, before he became a judge, turned down an offer to be
chief counsel during what became the Army-McCarthy hearings.
</P>
<P>
	   Editors at Simon &AMP; Schuster, which published the book in December, did not
immediately return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Sirica said he did not know if any legal action was possible because a libel
case cannot be brought on behalf of someone who is dead.

<HEADLINE> Bush Says McCain Is on 'Low Road'  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain likened himself Thursday to Ronald
Reagan and Bill Clinton, two-term presidents who reached across party lines to
forge victorious coalitions. ``If we win here, I don't see how we can be
stopped,'' McCain said, hoping for a cross-party surge in Saturday's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Two days before the South Carolina contest, national front-runner George W.
Bush kept up his case against McCain by suggesting the Arizona senator was a
hypocrite riding his ``high horse'' down a ``low road.''
</P>
<P>
	   With polls predicting a tight race, Bush's supporters fear that a defeat in
South Carolina could lead to follow-up losses in Michigan next Tuesday and in
Virginia seven days later. Backers in Congress and elsewhere could begin to peel
away, even allies say.
</P>
<P>
	   New polls out Thursday showed McCain faring as well as or better than Bush
in a match-up against Democratic front-runner Al Gore, another improvement for
the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a rising belief that McCain could win as well,'' said Rep. Billy
Tauzin, R-La. The question now is whether Bush ``can survive McCain, and I think
he can.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, whose financial and political standing improved dramatically after
his victory in New Hampshire, believes he can win Michigan and Arizona, even if
South Carolina goes to Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can lose here and go on,'' McCain told 300 veterans. ``But I'll tell
you what, my friends: If we win here, I don't see how we can be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said South Carolina is not do-or-die. ``I'm continuing one way or
another,'' he told reporters, acknowledging a scenario that would have been
unthinkable just a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The key will be turnout, and both campaigns are contacting thousands of
supporters in the contest's closing days. Bush is especially aggressive,
deploying the GOP establishment and conservative special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing far behind Bush among self-identified GOP voters, McCain stepped up
his appeal to independents and Democrats by promising a new political force and
a dedication to senior citizens, children and veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These things are part of an inclusive party, the party of Abraham Lincoln
and Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. That's what this is really about,'' he
said. ``So I view this campaign as sort of a seminal event for our party and
this country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Aboard his campaign bus, McCain also said Clinton has done a ``marvelous
job'' broadening the Democratic Party, and said he can do the same for the GOP.
``You can't help but admire the job President Clinton did in assembling a
coalition -- moving to attract the great center in political life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning amid the resorts of Hilton Head, Bush said McCain's high-minded
rhetoric belied a below-the-radar campaign to discredit him. He waved a McCain
flier that criticized Bush's tax-cutting plan, saying it was filled with false
information and calling it evidence of negative campaigning. It was the same
prop Bush used in Tuesday night's debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't accept this high horse and low road attitude of Senator McCain,''
Bush said, sticking to his strategy of trying to undermine McCain's reformist
image. ``I am saying this is a man who says one thing and does another.''
</P>
<P>
	   The effects of the campaign began to show on both candidates. McCain
bristled aboard his campaign bus when questioned about his persistent criticisms
of Bush, and the governor was unusually terse in his news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Turn that off,'' Bush said curtly when a pager interrupted him.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is getting help from all quarters of the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Adjutant General Stan Spears, commander of the South Carolina National
Guard, signed a glowing letter of endorsement for distribution by the Bush
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he was shocked that a military commander would engage in
political activity.
</P>
<P>
	   Spears said in a telephone interview that he is an elected official, not
bound by rules against political activity that federal employees in the Guard
must abide by. ``I don't answer to anybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   E-mails are being circulated in the Asian-American community criticizing
McCain for calling Asians ``gooks.'' The former Vietnam prisoner of war said he
has used the term for his prison guards.
</P>
<P>
	   There also are taped phone calls going out from Bush, his wife, Laura, and
Sen. Strom Thurmond. Letters have been sent out signed by former presidential
candidate Elizabeth Dole and by Bush's mother, Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   With fewer resources, McCain is relying on volunteer phone banks aiming at
150,000 supporters, including veterans and independents.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Want Rapist Executed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) -- Chanting ``execution, execution,'' some 3,000
Palestinians took to the streets Thursday and demanded that a man suspected of
raping a 5-year-old girl at knifepoint be put to death.
</P>
<P>
	   Gunmen fired shots in the air and marchers carried banners reading, ``Our
children have the right to live in security.''
</P>
<P>
	   The suspect, Bilal Shuko, a 22-year-old baker's assistant, was put on trial
Thursday before a military tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   Three people have been executed in Palestinian-controlled areas in the past
six years. In two dozen other cases, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat commuted a
death penalty to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat's Fatah group organized Thursday's street protest and distributed
leaflets calling for Shuko's execution.
</P>
<P>
	   With an independent judiciary not firmly established, human rights groups
worry that death sentences are handed to appease the public.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What matters to the Palestinian Authority is to defuse public pressure as
soon as possible,'' said Bassem Eid, a Palestinian human rights activist.
</P>
<P>
	   Shuko was initially to be tried by a civil court, but the case was later
transferred to a military tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   Eid and other human rights activists have said military tribunals deny
defendants the most basic rights. All death sentences handed down so far were
imposed by military tribunals.
</P>
<P>
	   Nablus police said the 5-year-old girl was raped Monday. The suspect dragged
the victim at knifepoint to a deserted house as she walked home from
kindergarten, said Col. Firas al-Emleh, head of police in Nablus.
</P>
<P>
	   The girl was hospitalized in Nablus.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Israel: Avoid Civilians  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department said Thursday that Israel was
contributing to the suffering of the people of Lebanon by shelling civilian
targets in retaliating to attacks by the militant Islamic group Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first implied criticism of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's handling
of Israel's bloody duel with the Iranian-backed fighters in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We do not believe that Israeli attacks against civilian infrastructure and
populated areas will solve the problem,'' spokesman James P. Rubin said. ``Such
actions only add to the suffering of the people of Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to Hezbollah attacks that have killed seven soldiers, Israel has
struck at power facilities and other civilian installations. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said last week it was Israel's way of signaling that it
wanted to reverse the escalation of violence in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   However, on Thursday, Rubin said ``everything must be done to prevent
civilian casualties.'' More than three dozen Lebanese civilians have been
injured in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin also condemned Hezbollah for firing at Israeli forces from villages,
thereby attracting a response that put civilian lives in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There should be no attacks from populated areas in order to ensure that
there are no attacks against populated areas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to say, however, whether Israel was justified in retaliating.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Rubin said Hezbollah had violated a 1996 accord designed
to protect civilians from the fighting by shelling from villages. The fighting
prompted the United States and France to convene the monitoring group
established by the agreement. But Israel walked out when its seventh soldier was
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin acknowledged Hezbollah had succeeded in suspending any meetings for at
least several days.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he said, ``we are working on ways to have the co-chairmen be in contact
with the capitals to begin to allow this process to take place.''
</P>
<P>
	   This, Rubin said, ``would avoid giving the Hezbollah the opportunity to
wreck the process of peace in Lebanon and the process of peace in the region.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and France co-chair the monitoring group. Israel, Syria
and Lebanon are the other members.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said Albright had not approved Israel's tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She was studiously neutral,'' he said. ``She merely recounted what the
Israelis say that they were doing. She didn't say that was a good thing, she
didn't say that was a bad thing. She didn't say we supported it, we opposed it.
She was noncommittal on that subject.''

<HEADLINE> Board Votes on Affirmative Action  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID MARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- With college students arriving by the busload to
protest, the State University System's Board of Regents convened Thursday to
vote on Gov. Jeb Bush's plan to drop affirmative action in admissions.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plan, the university system will ban consideration of race and
gender and instead admit the top 20 percent of every high school graduating
class in the state. It is called the Talented 20 program.
</P>
<P>
	   The regents were also voting on whether state universities should take into
account such factors as socioeconomic status, whether a student's parents went
to college, and the quality of the student's high school.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida's 10-school university system has about 219,000 full-time students.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican governor has said that the proposal -- part of a larger plan
to bar consideration of race and gender in admissions and state contracting --
will increase diversity. Opponents dispute that.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics, many of them students bused in from around the state, began filling
the meeting room at the University of Central Florida more than two hours ahead
of time.
</P>
<P>
	   Sylus Green, who was at the meeting to speak against Bush's plan, said he
had a 1.7 grade-point average as a high school student from Chicago's South
Side. The 20-year-old psychology major said he has a 4.0 at the University of
Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I weren't given an opportunity to go to college. I wouldn't have had my
chance to soar,'' said Green, who is black.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a shame they are pushing forth the Talented 20 program as a hope for
minorities, when those benefiting most will not be minorities,'' said Democratic
state Sen. Daryl Jones of Miami, chairman of the Florida Conference of Black
State Legislators. He said white suburban teen-agers would benefit the most.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by the board, the rule changes must still go before the
independently elected Cabinet, which is to consider the matter Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Highest Since 1996  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mortgage rates continued their upward climb this week
hitting their highest level since July 1996 amid fears that the Federal Reserve
will boost interest rates again next month.
</P>
<P>
	   The average interest rate on 30-year mortgages climbed to 8.38 percent for
the week ending Feb. 18, up from 8.36 percent the week before, according to a
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage company.
</P>
<P>
	   This week's rate was the highest since a 8.42 percent rate for the week
ending July 12, 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, also rose this
week with an average rate of 8 percent, compared with the average rate of 7.96
percent last week.
</P>
<P>
	   On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average
initial rate of 6.77 percent this week, up from 6.73 percent the previous week.
</P>
<P>
	   The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which averaged at or
just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three types of mortgages.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market is convinced that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates
again" at its March 21 meeting, said Freddie Mac's chief economist, Robert Van
Order. "This has spooked the market driving up interest rates."
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said that mortgage
loan applications for the week ending Feb. 11 decreased 8.6 percent from the
previous week and were down 28.4 percent compared with the same week last year.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Gang Murder in Macau  </HEADLINE>
   By PRISCILLA CHEUNG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MACAU (AP) -- A Hong Kong man linked to the casino business was shot and
killed Thursday, the first suspected gangland slaying since China regained
control over Macau two months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The killing raised concerns that gang violence, which rocked the former
Portuguese enclave in recent years, would recur despite the new government's
pledge to be tough on crime.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a little worried that this would be just the beginning of more
trouble,'' said Chou Ying-cho, a 39-year-old tailor. ``I'm worried that security
will deteriorate and our life would be back to how it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gunmen fired two shots into the head of Fung Kum-lun, 21, while he was in
his car parked in a residential district, said Joao Manhao, senior assistant
director of Macau's judicial police.
</P>
<P>
	   Fung was found slumped over the steering wheel, blood streaming down his
face, and police discovered a bullet from a Russian-made handgun inside the car.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We initially suspect that (the killing) was linked to an argument over a
private matter or revenge,'' Manhao said. He said he did not know how many
gunmen took part in the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Another police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, that
investigators suspect the killing was linked to a dispute over casino profits.
</P>
<P>
	   The territory's Chinese ``triad'' gangs were believed to be involved in the
killing, but it was not immediately clear whether Fung belonged to any gang, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fung, a Macau resident, was known to be involved with the Golden Dragon
hall, a VIP gambling room at Casino Lisboa, the largest of Macau's 10 casinos,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Manhao said, however, that it was unclear whether Fung was a casino
employee. Fung had spent the night at a karaoke bar and was waiting in his car
after dropping off a friend, Manhao said.
</P>
<P>
	   The killing was the first suspected gang-related assassination since China
regained control over Macau on Dec. 20, ending 442 years of Portuguese rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty people died last year in a spate of shootings, bombings and knife
attacks in a turf war over dwindling casino profits, which plunged during the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Executive Edmund Ho has pledged to clean up the police force and curb
gang violence. Chinese troops have been stationed in Macau.
</P>
<P>
	   Ines Lam, a government spokeswoman, reiterated Ho's pledge to improve
security, adding, ``it would also be impossible to wipe out crime completely in
any city.''
</P>
<P>
	   Macau is 40 miles west of Hong Kong. The local economy relies heavily taxes
from the casinos.

<HEADLINE> New York Life OK'd for U.S. Thrift  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have given New York Life Insurance
Co., one of the nation's biggest insurers, permission to operate a
federally-insured thrift specializing in trust services.
</P>
<P>
	   The Office of Thrift Supervision announced Thursday its approval for New
York Life, which is owned by its policyholders, to open New York Life Trust Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The move came a day after the federal agency announced it had granted
similar thrift charters to the National Association of Mutual Insurance
Companies, a group representing insurance firms owned by policyholders, and to
AXA Financial Inc., parent of Equitable Life Assurance Society and brokerage
firm Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   New York Life, based in Manhattan, has some $90.4 billion in assets, 3
million policyholders and 10,000 agents nationwide. The new thrift will offer
trust services, which include acting as an investment adviser or custodian of
trust funds or property held in trust, executing wills and acting as guardian of
an estate or trustee of an IRA account.
</P>
<P>
	   Several big U.S. insurance companies have gone public recently or plan to,
transforming themselves from mutual companies owned by policyholders to stock
companies owned by shareholders. The companies are making the move to raise
capital for new acquisitions in the rapidly consolidating financial services
industry, spurred by legislation enacted last November allowing banks,
securities firms and insurers to get into each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   New York Life, however, has said it plans to retain its mutual structure for
the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal approvals make New York Life and AXA Financial the latest in a
string of insurance companies, securities firms and other businesses outside the
banking industry to get new federal savings and loan charters in recent months.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year the thrift agency, part of the Treasury Department, granted
similar charters to Aetna Inc., one of the nation's largest life and health
insurers, mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments and American International
Group Inc., another major U.S. insurance company.
</P>
<P>
	   So far this year, the thrift regulators have approved online brokerage
ETrade Group Inc.'s acquisition of Telebanc Financial Corp., which created the
first financial services company entirely based on the Internet, and new thrifts
to be operated by Southwest Securities Group Inc. and 1st Virtual Inc.

<HEADLINE> Volpe says Wiese, not Schwarz, was there for Louima assault  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In his first sworn testimony about the incident, rogue
cop Justin Volpe insisted Thursday that an officer convicted of helping him
sodomize Abner Louima with a broken broomstick was never in the room when the
brutality occurred.
<P>
	   Officer Charles Schwarz, who faces a possible life sentence on his
conviction for holding Louima down, had no part in the assault, Volpe said.
Another officer, Thomas Wiese, was the only person present in a police station
bathroom during the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never saw Schwarz in the bathroom at any time," Volpe repeatedly told a
packed and tense Brooklyn federal courtroom. "When I was in the bathroom, the
only officer who assaulted Mr. Louima was myself."
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe, sentenced to 30 years after pleading guilty last year to the August
1997 assault, was the first defense witness in the trial of Schwarz, 34, Wiese,
34, and Thomas Bruder, 37, for conspiring to conceal Schwarz's role in the
attack on the Haitian immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe said Wiese stood by the entire time, making no move to take part or
intercede in the attack. That conflicted sharply with Wiese's assertion, to
detectives and Brooklyn district attorney investigators, that he had entered the
bathroom during the attack and intervened by dragging a prostrate, bleeding
Louima from a toilet stall by his legs.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz faces a possible life sentence after his 1999 conviction for
violating Louima's civil rights by holding him down during the attack. Volpe, at
his own sentencing last December, said for the first time that Wiese, not
Schwarz, was the second officer in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   The courtroom was rapt as Volpe, speaking in a voice edged with emotion,
elaborated on his story for the first time during two hours and 15 minutes on
the stand.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to do my time with a clear mind, with a clear conscience," he said,
"and I can't live with myself and do my time in peace, knowing that another man
is paying for the crime that I committed."
</P>
<P>
	   Seeking to counter suggestions that Volpe was speaking only to save a police
crony from trouble, defense attorney Ronald Fischetti asked if the two officers
had socialized during their years on the job in Brooklyn's Flatbush section.
</P>
<P>
	   "We never had a relationship of any kind," Volpe said. "We weren't friends.
... I never knew him as Chuck. I knew him as Schwarz, a guy who worked in my
precinct."
</P>
<P>
	   Nervous and presenting himself as deeply contrite, the 27-year-old ex-cop
told of punching the handcuffed prisoner repeatedly, throwing him to the floor
and threatening the suspect before attacking him with the broomstick.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe said he mistakenly believed that Louima had punched him during a
street riot outside a Haitian nightclub. When Louima became defiant and profane
after his arrest, Volpe grew "frustrated and angry."
</P>
<P>
	   "I was looking for some answers or an apology," Volpe said under strenuous
cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Resnick. "But I'm not blaming
Mr. Louima or trying to say it's his fault. I was the one who assaulted him."
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe's dramatic appearance came after the prosecution rested its case, but
was delayed briefly after U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson objected to the
witness showing up in blue prison fatigues and sneakers. U.S. marshals scrambled
to find a dark blue blazer, white shirt and tie that would fit the burly Volpe.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution ended its presentation by focusing on phone records showing
the contacts between the accused officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad briefly recalled an FBI agent who has
testified that the trio made an unusual number of calls to each other in the
days after Volpe sodomized the Haitian immigrant with a broken broomstick in a
precinct bathroom.

<HEADLINE> Corn Falls; Soybeans Rally  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat and corn futures prices fell in dealings
Thursday on the Chicago Board of trade, while soybean futures
rallied -- once again boosted by gains in soymeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat futures prices fell amid long-term forecasts for more rain
in the central Plains growing regions. The thought is that
precipitation could benefit the winter wheat crop, boosting the
supply.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn futures prices dropped after the U.S. Department of
Agriculture released a report showing lower-than-expected corn
exports.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, soybean prices fell early in the day on forecasts for
more rain in key Brazilian growing regions but rallied later in the
day as soymeal prices began to rise.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery fell 2 3/4 cents to $2.62 1/2 a bushel; March
corn dropped 1 3/4 cents to $2.21 1/4 a bushel; March oats fell 1 cent to
$1.07 1/2 a bushel; and March soybeans rose  1/2 cent to $5.08 a bushel.

	   Pork and beef futures prices were mostly higher in trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Supports Tuvalu Membership  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The South Pacific nation of Tuvalu, population 9,000,
won support from the Security Council on Thursday for its bid to become the
189th member of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   By a vote of 14-0, the council recommended to the General Assembly that the
nation of nine coral atolls 620 miles north of Fiji be admitted as a member.
China abstained because of Tuvalu's diplomatic ties to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   The General Assembly has not set a date to vote on Tuvalu's application.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuvalu's Prime Minister Ionatana Ionatana applied for U.N. membership in
January, and the Security Council's committee on admissions backed the
application earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   China's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Shen Guofang said his government could not
support Tuvalu's admission because it has not implemented the General Assembly
resolution which recognizes Beijing as China's representative in the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At the same time, proceeding from the long-term interests of the peoples
of China and Tuvalu, and also taking into consideration the requests from
different parties including the South Pacific countries, we are not going to
block this recommendation,'' Shen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Taiwan, under the name Republic of China, held the Chinese U.N. seat until
1971. It walked out of the United Nations just before other members voted to
give its seat to the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
	   China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province with no right to international
recognition.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Beijing delayed consideration of U.N. membership for the Pacific
island nation of Nauru for a month because of Nauru's diplomatic relations with
Taiwan. Eventually, it abstained when the Security Council voted to recommend
Nauru's membership.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations also accepted two other South Pacific island nations as
members last year, Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuvalu, formerly called the Ellice Islands, was ruled by Britain from the
1890s until 1978 when it became independent.
</P>
<P>
	   It has a total land area of 10 square miles and ranks second to Vatican City
as the world's smallest nation in population and the fourth smallest in area
after Vatican City, Monaco and Nauru.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuvalu subsists on fishing license fees, fishing, income from a national
investment trust fund, earnings by seamen who work on foreign ships and foreign
aid.
</P>
<P>
	   It is also believed to earn more than $1 million annually from a ``sex
chat'' telephone service that pays for permission to use Tuvalu's country
telephone code.

<HEADLINE> Meningitis Vaccine Approved  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A vaccine to protect infants and toddlers from
life-threatening meningitis and blood poisoning caused by pneumococcal bacteria
won government approval Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The vaccine, called Prevnar, prevents invasive pneumococcal infections.
</P>
<P>
	   A different pneumococcal vaccine for adults has been available for years.
</P>
<P>
	   But children under 5 suffer some 16,000 pneumococcal blood infections and
1,400 pneumococcal meningitis cases every year -- and until now there has been
no way to prevent them, the Food and Drug Administration said.
</P>
<P>
	   Children under age 2 are at highest risk. In up to half the cases of
meningitis, children suffer brain damage or hearing loss -- and about 10 percent
die.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're very excited and think this vaccine is going to make a major
contribution to the health of children," said FDA vaccine chief Dr. Kathryn
Zoon. "It is really a major advance."
</P>
<P>
	   Some pediatricians -- and parents -- had excitedly awaited Prevnar because
of preliminary evidence that it might also fight ear infections caused by the
same bacterium, formally called Streptococcus pneumoniae. But the FDA cautioned
Thursday that so far it is proved to prevent only meningitis and blood
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
	   Another vaccine already has dramatically slashed childhood meningitis caused
by another bacterium, called Haemophilus influenzae B or Hib. The new vaccine
could prove just as important, the FDA said.
</P>
<P>
	   The vaccine will available to physicians within a few weeks, and will cost
$58 per shot, said manufacturer Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, a subsidiary of
American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
	   Infants would receive a four-dose series of shots starting at age 2 months.
At a total cost of $232, that makes the new vaccine one of the costliest for
infants.
</P>
<P>
	   Older babies, however, need fewer of the $58 shots -- because the older the
children got, the better they responded to the vaccine, said Peter Paradiso,
Wyeth's vice president of science.
</P>
<P>
	   Babies who begin the vaccination series between ages 7 months to 11 months
require just three shots; those ages 1 to 2 years require 2 shots, and after
their second birthday children would need just one shot, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   FDA approval of Prevnar's sale came one day after a government advisory
committee that helps set vaccination schedules recommended all children under 2
be immunized with Prevnar once it becomes available.
</P>
<P>
	   That committee also recommended Prevnar for children between ages 2 and 5
only if they are at high risk for pneumococcal infections -- a group that
includes black and native American children and those with certain chronic
diseases.
</P>
<P>
	   Wyeth-Ayerst, which recently changed the vaccine's name from its original
Prevenar, sponsored studies of 38,000 children. Half received Prevnar in
addition to already mandated shots for Hib and DTP -- diphtheria, tetanus and
pertussis. The other half received just Hib and DTP for comparison.
</P>
<P>
	   The vaccine was approximately 90 percent effective in preventing
pneumococcal-caused meningitis and blood poisoning, the FDA said. It protects
against the seven most common pneumococcal strains, but not all of them.
</P>
<P>
	   Like all vaccines, it can cause some temporary side effects, but the studies
uncovered no severe problems, Zoon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 12 percent and 20 percent of children had such injection-site
reactions as redness, swelling or tenderness -- common to every injected
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
	   Children also may experience temporary fever, irritability, drowsiness or
restless sleep. About 33 percent of children had fevers over 100 degrees after
the first dose of Prevnar, compared with 29 percent of children who had similar
fevers after receiving the DTP and Hib vaccines, Zoon said.

<HEADLINE> Son of Watergate Judge Decries Book  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The son of the federal judge who presided over the
Watergate criminal trials is angry over a new book that describes his late
father as corrupt, dishonest and having ``clear ties'' to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
	   John J. Sirica Jr. said Thursday he asked the book's publisher this week to
issue a retraction and remove the statement from future editions of ``Gone: The
Last Days of The New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
	   The book by Renata Adler focuses on The New Yorker magazine. Adler wrote
that when she was asked to review a book by U.S. District Judge John J. Sirica
she found that ``contrary to his reputation as a hero, Sirica was in fact a
corrupt, incompetent, and dishonest figure, with a close connection to Senator
Joseph McCarthy and clear ties to organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sirica, who died in 1992, presided over the main Watergate criminal trials
and ordered the production of the White House tapes that ultimately proved to be
President Nixon's downfall.
</P>
<P>
	   His son said Thursday the allegation that the judge had ties to organized
crime was ``patently false and absurd.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it's not malicious, it's so egregiously ill-informed and without any
checking behind it as far as I can see, to be ludicrous,'' said the younger
Sirica, a Newsday reporter. ``I'm very angry about it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sirica said it was true that his father had been friends with McCarthy
during the early 1950s and, before he became a judge, turned down an offer to be
chief counsel during what became the Army-McCarthy hearings.
</P>
<P>
	   Adler, interviewed by phone, said the statements in the book were true.
``Naturally I can document them or I wouldn't have put them in,'' she said. She
declined to give details but said, ``I'll just have to document it myself.'' She
said she would do it ``soon and in whatever way seems appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Simon &AMP; Schuster published the book in December.
</P>
<P>
	   Sirica said he did not know if any legal action was possible because a libel
case cannot be brought on behalf of someone who is dead.

<HEADLINE> Trial Begins in L.A. Shootout Case  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Three years after bank robbers in body armor shot it out
with police in the streets with automatic weapons, a federal jury began hearing
arguments Thursday on whether officers let one wounded gunman bleed to death.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Stephen Yagman, who brought a civil rights lawsuit on behalf of the
gunman's children, acknowledged in his opening statement that Emil Matasareanu
``did a very bad thing. He robbed a bank and shot a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Matasareanu ``was shot and left to bleed to death on the ground,'' the
lawyer said. ``He bled to death from a nonfatal wound that was survivable.''
</P>
<P>
	   The children are seeking unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial will revisit one of the city's most violent crimes, a Feb. 28,
1997, North Hollywood bank robbery that turned into a 44-minute shootout in
which both robbers died, 11 officers were wounded and a half-dozen civilians
were hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Matasareanu, 30, and Larry Eugene Phillips Jr., 26, wore full body armor and
fired more than 1,200 rounds from automatic weapons in a shootout with officers
who were mostly armed with handguns. Officers had to reload by snatching rifles
from a sporting goods store nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   The shootout prompted the Police Department months later to acquire more
powerful guns.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips died when he shot himself at the same time a police bullet struck
his head. Matasareanu was finally brought down in a close-quarters firefight
with officers in the middle of a street.
</P>
<P>
	   The city has contended that paramedics were needed elsewhere and that there
was fear that the dying gunman might be booby-trapped.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys representing the city of Los Angeles and the officers named in the
lawsuit told the jury there were attempts to get help for the wounded man. But
they also claimed that he resisted treatment and that his wounds were not
survivable.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant City Attorney Don Vincent said Matasareanu had been shot 29 times
and argued that contrary to the plaintiffs' claims that he lay bleeding to death
for a half-hour, he probably died much earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley Gage, an attorney for now-retired Officer John Futrell, told the
jury that if there was a delay in getting treatment for the dying man, ``the
delay in medical treatment came because of the shootout and the brutality of the
bank robbery.''

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Inflation Still a Danger  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called the
economy's record-breaking performance the best in a half century, but he warned
Thursday that inflation remains a threat to the economic good times that many
Americans are enjoying.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street viewed Greenspan's remarks to the House Banking Committee as
confirmation that the Fed will continue to rachet up interest rates this year
until the economy slows to a more sustainable pace.
</P>
<P>
	   In presenting the central bank's twice-a-year report on the economy to
Congress, Greenspan reiterated his concerns that employers seeking scarce
workers in the current "tight" labor market may offer higher wages and benefits,
increased costs that could lead to a sharp runup in product prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "At some point in the continuous reduction in the number of available
workers willing to take jobs ... wage increases must rise above even impressive
gains in productivity" that have helped to keep inflation low, Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This would intensify inflationary pressures or squeeze profit margins, with
either outcome capable of bringing our growing prosperity to an end," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In efforts to slow the barreling economy and keep inflation at bay, the Fed
has bumped up interest rates four times since June, overall pushing up by a full
percentage point key interest rates that the Fed controls.
</P>
<P>
	   But Greenspan said those increases have had little impact.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is little evidence that the American economy ... is slowing
appreciably," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fed policy-makers "will have to stay alert for signs that real interest
rates have not yet risen enough to bring the growth of demand into line with
that of potential supply," Greenspan said. "Achieving that alignment seems more
pressing today than it did earlier."
</P>
<P>
	   Most analysts widely expect Fed policy-makers will boost interest rates
again at their next meeting March 21, and many also anticipate another rate
increase in May.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists said Greenspan's comments appear to support their predictions of
a series of rate increases this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Sung Won Sohn, economist for Wells Fargo, viewed Greenspan's remarks as
saying, "The prescription that we need is high interest rates. I think Chairman
Greenspan is probably getting the message that so far this slow-motion monetary
policy has done nothing to dampen the enthusiasm in the economy and especially
the stock market."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 46 points in
afternoon trading but the Nasdaq rose more than 100.
</P>
<P>
	   "He talked tougher than some had expected," said David Jones, chief
economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though inflation has remained low outside of an energy price surge,
Greenspan said this favorable condition cannot last unless the economy's growth
rate slows to less than the 4 percent-plus gains of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Greenspan marveled at the economy's performance: its record
9-year-long expansion; unemployment at a 30-year low of 4 percent; and strong
gains in worker productivity -- output per hour of work.
</P>
<P>
	   But even if the productivity gains continue, they could have a downside for
the economy by pushing soaring stock prices even higher, Greenspan said. The
Wall Street boom has contributed to the growth in consumer demand as investors
have spent their stock gains with abandon.
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to a question, Greenspan expressed some short-term worries about
the leap in oil prices, which on Monday pushed the per-barrel price above $30 to
the highest levels since the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil inventories have fallen to exceptionally low levels, he said, leaving
the country vulnerable to a big price spike if supplies suddenly drop further.
"Some are joking that we need to measure the fumes to get any measurable
inventory at all these days," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also said conservation moves by businesses in recent years have
significantly reduced manufacturers' energy needs.
</P>
<P>
	   In its outlook for economic growth, the Federal Reserve was more optimistic
than the administration or the Congressional Budget Office, predicting the gross
domestic product will expand by around 3.5 percent this year. President Clinton
based his current budget on a slower 2.9 percent prediction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed also was more optimistic that inflation will slow this year,
predicting that an inflation gauge tied to the GDP will rise by around 1.75
percent to 2 percent, compared with an increase of 2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
	   As he has before, Greenspan urged Congress to devote the huge federal budget
surpluses being generated by the economic boom to paying down the national debt
rather than for increased federal spending or cutting taxes.

<HEADLINE> Officer: Wrong Conviction in Assault  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PYLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Testifying for the first time about one of the most
shocking police brutality cases in New York history, a former officer insisted
Thursday that a colleague convicted of helping him sodomize Abner Louima with a
broken broomstick wasn't even in the room at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Officer Justin Volpe said that Officer Charles Schwarz, who faces a
possible life sentence on his conviction for holding Louima down, had no part in
the assault. Volpe said another officer, Thomas Wiese, was the only person
present in a police station bathroom during the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I never saw Schwarz in the bathroom at any time,'' Volpe repeatedly said
in federal court in Brooklyn. ``When I was in the bathroom, the only officer who
assaulted Mr. Louima was myself.''
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe, sentenced to 30 years after pleading guilty last year to the 1997
assault, was the first defense witness in the trial of Schwarz, 34, Wiese, 34,
and Thomas Bruder, 37. The three officers are charged with conspiring to conceal
Schwarz's role in the attack on the Haitian immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe said Wiese stood by the entire time, making no move to take part or
intercede in the attack. That conflicted sharply with Wiese's assertion, to
detectives and Brooklyn district attorney investigators, that he had entered the
bathroom during the attack and intervened by dragging a prostrate, bleeding
Louima from a toilet stall by his legs.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz faces a possible life sentence after his 1999 conviction for
violating Louima's civil rights by holding him down during the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe, at his own sentencing last December, said for the first time that
Wiese, not Schwarz, was the second officer in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Volpe, 27, testified: ``I want to do my time with a clear mind,
with a clear conscience, and I can't live with myself and do my time in peace,
knowing that another man is paying for the crime that I committed.''

<HEADLINE> Key Issues in Iran Elections  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Associated Press
</P>
<P>
	   Some key domestic and international issues hinge on the outcome of Iran's
legislative elections. Among them:
</P>
<P>
	   -- PRESIDENTIAL POWERS: In the current parliament, the Majlis, moderates and
hard-liners have nearly the same number of seats, but independents have sided
with the hard-liners to block reformist President Mohammad Khatami again and
again.
</P>
<P>
	   If reformers win a majority of the 290 seats, Khatami will have enough
like-minded supporters to push ahead with his reforms. The hard-liners, however,
would retain key strongholds. The country's top authority is hard-line Supreme
Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who enjoys near absolute power.
</P>
<P>
	   -- REFORMS: The most important outcome of Khatami's 1997 election has been
the emergence of a vibrant, free press, which has reshaped public opinion in
favor of the reformists and against the hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, most Western music is banned, watching foreign television programs is
illegal, dating is punishable by lashing or imprisonment, and women must wear
the hijab, a gown that covers everything but the face and hands, in public.
</P>
<P>
	   Although forming political parties without government consent is illegal,
Friday's elections are being contested by groups that are de facto parties.
Khatami has argued for recognition of secular parties and others opposed to an
Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
	   Social and political reforms are likely to quicken in the case of a
reformist victory, but radical moves like abolishing the hijab altogether are
not expected, even with a landslide reformist victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Regardless of which side wins control of the Majlis, it will have to move
forward with reforms in order to keep public opinion on its side. The pace of
reforms is likely to be affected by which side controls the house.
</P>
<P>
	   -- U.S. RELATIONS: With his 1998 call for people-to-people exchanges with
the United States, Khatami broke the taboo of talking about resuming ties that
were severed after militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and took
52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
	   It is within the powers of the Majlis to, among other steps, grant U.S.
consular visits to Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   A compliant Majlis can help Khatami move quickly to capitalize on any
gesture from the United States, such as thawing billions of dollars of Iranian
assets frozen by the United States since 1979, or discontinuing the 1996
Iran-Libya Sanctions Act when it comes up for renewal next year.
</P>
<P>
	   Although there is wide consensus on ending Iran's isolation, the hard-liners
still believe that resuming relations with Washington would sell out the
revolution.

<HEADLINE> Kids Share Memories of Tornadoes  </HEADLINE>
   By ERIN McCLAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) -- Thursday was the first day back at school for
7-year-old Lacresha Spooner, and her first assignment was to tell classmates
what she saw when tornadoes tore through Georgia, killing her aunt and 17
others.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The house flew away,'' she said. ``And people died. Babies died.''
</P>
<P>
	   Teacher May Wingate also asked the class to write in spiral-bound notebooks
about what they could do to help.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can help my family,'' 7-year-old Jessica Collins wrote. ``I can help
pick up sticks, and I can help find dead bodies.''
</P>
<P>
	   The three twisters that touched down in rural Georgia early Monday packed
winds of up to 200 mph that flattened homes, cars and trailers.
</P>
<P>
	   In Mitchell County, where the storms were deadliest, the worst damage was in
a small subdivision and a mobile home park less than two miles from Mitchell
County Primary School. The school has 600 students, and about 65 had
storm-damaged homes, Superintendent Charles Stripling said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schools throughout the area called in extra counselors to handle children's
questions about the disaster. They encouraged teachers to hold class discussions
on what happened.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to let them talk about it,'' assistant principal Vicki Hicks said.
``These children are afraid. They're afraid to go to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
	   Children react to natural disasters by taking cues from their parents,
school counselor Juanita McCall said. Young children who see adults overcome
with grief or panicking about new storms are likely to do the same.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These kids are already talking about the weather,'' McCall said. ``Parents
are afraid, too. The whole community is afraid.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wingate said she will try soon to return the class' focus to the upcoming
Iowa Test of Basic Skills, an important standardized test.
</P>
<P>
	   But Thursday was a day to talk about the storms, to listen to each other's
stories and to look at the clouds and worry about what they held.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Each of these children will work through things on their own,'' McCall
said. ``This is a pain that lasts a long time.''

<HEADLINE> Iran's Young Voters Key to Elections  </HEADLINE>
   By VIJAY JOSHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- The electric blue words scrawled on a white sheet at a
political rally captured the frustrations of Iran's youth: ''20 years of
ideological suppression is enough.''
</P>
<P>
	   As Iran holds parliamentary elections Friday, young people have emerged as
kingmakers, vowing to vote for those who will provide them the freedoms denied
after the Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1979, young Iranians grabbed at the chance to topple the dictatorial and
corrupt regime of the U.S.-backed shah and join the revolution led by Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini. Today, the sons and daughters of those Iranians are battling
what they say is another kind of repression.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-liners have ``used Islam as a tool to fortify their power. They
think they are messengers of God and can tell us what to do, what to wear. We
don't like this,'' said Mehdi, a chemical engineering student at Tehran
University who refused to give his last name. Outspoken students have been
jailed in Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Young people complain that 21 years of Islamic rule by Khomeini's followers
and successors failed to bear the promised fruit: jobs and prosperity. Instead,
youth were barred from mixing freely with the opposite sex, listening to pop and
Western music or watching foreign television programs. Women were told to cover
themselves from head to toe and the clergy, in its role as the interpreter of
God's will, was deemed above criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of Iran's 62 million people are under the age of 25. About 20
million of them are in high schools and universities that have traditionally
been the harbingers of change and the barometers of public discontent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The young people have needs, but they get nothing. It means they are very
angry with everybody,'' said Saeed Laylaz, a newspaper columnist and political
analyst.
</P>
<P>
	   A frequent target of youth anger is former President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani. A former moderate, he has riled many by leaning toward hard-liners
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Tehran University rally Wednesday where the handwritten declaration
was held aloft, men and women chanted anti-Rafsanjani slogans, interrupting
speeches by pro-reform candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Iran's economy, a mix of free-market and socialism, has struggled with high
inflation, a bloated public sector and unemployment. Joblessness is officially
around 20 percent, but unofficially believed to be higher than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Iranians' hopes were raised by the election of reformist President Mohammad
Khatami in May 1997. He has relaxed many strict rules and allowed unprecedented
press freedom. But Khatami's hands will remain tied as long as hard-liners
control key institutions like the 290-member parliament, or Majlis.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if pro-reform candidates win the elections, they have a long way to go.
Laws passed by parliament have to be approved by a 12-member Council of
Guardians, which is now controlled by hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservatives also control other pillars of power -- the judiciary, the
state media and the armed forces. And the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
who is considered a hard-liner, has the final authority on all matters.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say any change will have to flow from the youth.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1953, the students were the main supporters of popular Prime Minister
Mohammed Mosaddaq, whose government was overthrown by a CIA-backed coup that
reinstalled the shah. Since then Iranian universities have been centers of
resistance against the regime.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1979 revolution was preceded by almost daily demonstrations by students
against the shah, providing the impetus to clergy.
</P>
<P>
	   It is clear that the youth are once again frustrated, this time with the
hurdles created by hard-liners against Khatami's reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   After a reformist newspaper was closed by hard-liners last summer, tens of
thousands of Tehran University students flooded the streets for three days. The
protests spread across the country, and scores of student leaders were arrested,
some later sentenced to lengthy jail terms or even death for their roles in the
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say the students' movement fills the vacuum created by the lack of
established political parties, which were allowed only in 1989. Candidates still
contest elections as independents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once we have a professional political party system then the role of this
movement will also decrease,'' said Mohsen Mirdamadi, a professor of law and
political science at Tehran University.

<HEADLINE> Bankers argue that fee ban would limit competition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Legislation that would make it illegal for banks
to charge fees to non-customers who use their automated teller machines would
stifle free-market competition, bankers argued Thursday.
<P>
	   The Connecticut Bankers Association, which represents all but three of the
state's 82 banks, told a legislative committee there should be no law
prohibiting a financial institution from competitively pricing its products.
</P>
<P>
	   The Banks Committee is considering banning the "convenience fees" levied on
customers who use an ATM owned by a bank where they do not have an account.
</P>
<P>
	   The convenience fees are in addition to charges the customer's own bank may
assess for using another bank's ATM.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, House leaders promised a bipartisan push to outlaw the fees. A
similar bill passed the House last year but died in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal says the fees are unnecessary and
unfair. The cost of each transaction is about 27 cents, but banks charge an
average of $1.50 nationwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Connecticut's ban on such fees for several years has produced no harmful or
negative impact on banks or other financial institutions," Blumenthal said.
"Indeed, the number of ATMs has skyrocketed."
</P>
<P>
	   That proves the ban would not stifle competition, backers said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If banks didn't think it was a worthwhile investment, they wouldn't do it,"
said state Sen. John Fonfara, D-Hartford.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Brian McDermott, D-Wallingford, co-chairman of the Banks Committee,
said he would not try to kill the bill in committee. But he said he would not
try to pass it to the General Assembly unless there was widespread support for
it.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have seen how the market has fared in a no-fee environment in
Connecticut," said Thomas H. O'Brien, Jr., regional president for First Union
National Bank. "I recommend that we now allow the market an equal opportunity to
react with fees in place, and let the natural forces of market competition
determine the landscape."
</P>
<P>
	   The state Supreme Court ruled in December that the banking commissioner
could not ban the fees. The state had ordered a ban under a 1970s law that said
banks could not collect fees from non-customers. But the high court said the law
had been written before the era of ATMs.
</P>
<P>
	   After the ruling, large, federally-charted banks began charging
non-customers the convenience fees. Smaller, state-chartered banks are not
charging the fees.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe that it is not unreasonable for non-customers to expect some
nominal charge for the benefit of convenience," said Richard A. Higginbotham,
president and CEO of Fleet Bank Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   At the request of bankers in New Jersey, a federal judge on Thursday blocked
an ordinance that sought to ban the fees in the city of Woodbridge.

<HEADLINE> Bush Denies Using Texas Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Republican Gov. George W. Bush's campaign said
Thursday that none of the money Bush raised for his Texas political operations
went to his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas campaign finance reports show that Bush's gubernatorial campaign
committee paid thousands of dollars last year to two consultants now working on
his presidential campaign -- chief strategist Karl Rove and media consultant
Mark McKinnon.
</P>
<P>
	   Karen Hughes, Bush's chief spokeswoman, said Bush's two political operations
were careful to keep the state and presidential campaign dollars separated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not a penny of gubernatorial money went for a presidential expense. It
would have been illegal for the state committee to subsidize the presidential
effort in any way, and it did not,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the campaign trail, Bush has criticized his chief rival, Sen. John
McCain, for using funds from his Senate account to run for president. Bush on
Tuesday proposed campaign finance changes that would prohibit using money from
one political account to pay for another race.
</P>
<P>
	   According to reports filed with the Texas Ethics Commission, Bush's state
political committee spent about $1.2 million in 1999, the year after his
re-election as Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those expenses were just over $53,100 to Rove, who has been Bush's top
political consultant since his first governor's race in 1994. Payments ranged
from $19,433 in March for consulting to a $19.75 reimbursement in April for
express mail costs.
</P>
<P>
	   McKinnon's Maverick Media received nearly $48,500, all for media production
work. McKinnon made commercials for Bush's re-election campaign and is doing the
same for his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes said Rove was paid from the Texas account during the first half of
1999, when the state Legislature was in session, for providing consulting advice
and newsletters that Bush mailed to Texans. Rove received $222,000 from the
presidential campaign during that period, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes said McKinnon's company was paid for videos from Bush's inaugural and
for other expenses from the governor's 1998 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dallas Morning News, which first reported on Bush's spending, quoted
McCain spokesman Dan Schnur as noting that Bush's consultants continued to get
paid long after the 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most consultants stop working when a campaign is over,'' Schnur said.
``This arrangement was obviously instituted before Governor Bush became a
campaign reformer (Tuesday).''

<HEADLINE> Titanic Exhibit Opens in Chicago  </HEADLINE>
    By JONATHAN LIPMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Suspended above the center of a dark room is a large,
tarnished brass bell that clanged three times on a night to remember 88 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   It's the first thing visitors see upon entering the world's largest display
of original artifacts from the RMS Titanic.
</P>
<P>
	   "Titanic: The Exhibition" opens Friday at the Museum of Science and
Industry. Although the museum expects the exhibit will attract hundreds of
thousands of visitors by the time it closes Sept. 4, critics say the show may
cross the line between history and Hollywood entertainment.
</P>
<P>
	   The exhibit features about 200 relics recovered from the floor of the North
Atlantic, including furniture, unbroken ceramic plates, bottles of wine still
corked and a section of the hull collected by RMS Titanic Inc., the for-profit
company with exclusive rights to salvage the Titanic's wreck.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe the best way to tell the story historically, educationally, and
powerfully, is through the display of real objects, real things," said Joe
Shacter, the museum's director of exhibits.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking up 25,000 square feet, the exhibit designed by SFX Entertainment has
re-created rooms of the ship that present a timeline leading up to the sinking
on the night of April 14-15, 1912.
</P>
<P>
	   One room has an 18-foot model of the ship surrounded by blueprints and
photos, while another features the ornate bedroom of a first-class cabin, lined
with rich burgundy wallpaper and heavy polished furniture. Also on display is
the re-created grand staircase similar to the one featured in the 1997 movie.
</P>
<P>
	   Visitors first see the lookout's bell that clanged three times warning that
the ship was approaching an iceberg.
</P>
<P>
	   The bell is meant to set a solemn tone up front, Shacter said, "letting
people know this exhibit is a memorial" not just to Titanic but to the more than
1,500 people who died after it sank.
</P>
<P>
	   RMS Titanic Inc. has displayed artifacts from the Titanic at convention
centers and museums around the world. The Chicago exhibit is the largest ever.
</P>
<P>
	   Other museums, including the Smithsonian Institution, have rejected the
exhibit. The International Council for Maritime Museums, which represents
hundreds of museums around there world, refuses to accept artifacts recovered
from commercial salvage companies to prevent the plundering of archaeological
sites. It also objects to the Hollywood-style presentation.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's all this confusion about entertainment and serious scholarship,"
said Peter Neill, the council's president. "There may be serious scholarship
associated with this Titanic exhibit, ... but the interrelationship with a
for-profit entertainment company will confuse the issue."
</P>
<P>
	   Shacter, who sought to bring an exhibit to Chicago after seeing a smaller
display in Memphis, Tenn., in 1997, said the Titanic story has a unique place in
a museum dedicated to displays of technology.
</P>
<P>
	   "It goes to show that all the technology in the world cannot make up for the
frailty of human judgment," Shacter said.

<HEADLINE> Activists Protest at Laotian Embassy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 200 people protested Thursday at the Laotian Embassy
for better treatment for the Hmong, an ethnic minority in the Southeast Asian
country, and a full accounting of what happened to two Hmong-American men who
disappeared during a visit last spring.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You are guilty of crimes!'' shouted Yer Ly of St. Paul, Minn., whose
father is one of the missing men. ``You should die! Communists will die at the
hands of innocent people!''
</P>
<P>
	   Houa Ly, 56, of Appleton, Wis., and Michael Vang, 36, of Fresno, Calif.,
disappeared last April while on vacation. They were last seen boarding a boat on
the Mekong River that divides Thailand and Laos.
</P>
<P>
	   Hmong-American groups are convinced the communist government kidnapped,
imprisoned and possibly killed the men. Laotian officials say they know nothing
of the men's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My father and his companion -- you have captured them and tortured them,''
shouted Yer Ly, holding a poster with a photo of her father. ``Come out and deal
with us! Chicken! Chicken! Chicken!''
</P>
<P>
	   The Hmong, who live in the mountains of northern Laos, say they are
mistreated by the government. Houa Ly and other Hmong fought with CIA-backed
forces during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
	   Mai Sayavongs, a spokesman for the Laotian Embassy, denied the government
persecutes Hmong and said it has no information about the missing men.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstration came a day after Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., pressed
Secretary of State Madeline Albright for more information about the missing men.

<HEADLINE> Main Candidates in Iran Elections  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Associated Press
</P>
<P>
	   Here are the key candidates up for election in Iran on Friday:
</P>
<P>
	   Former president for two four-year terms and twice parliament speaker, Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani, 67, is the most seasoned politician running in Friday's
elections. He is also a top contender for the post of parliament speaker.
</P>
<P>
	   Rafsanjani, once considered a moderate, has been criticized for moving
closer to conservatives in recent months. He heads the powerful Expediency
Council, with duties that include advising Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
	   Mohammadreza Khatami, 40, brother of President Mohammad Khatami, heads the
largest and most organized reformist group, the Islamic Iran Participation
Front. A doctor, Khatami is the other top contender for parliament speaker. He
advocates better relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Alireza Nouri, 36, was a relative unknown until his brother, Abdollah Nouri,
a top dissident and former interior minister, was sent to prison on charges of
religious dissent and advocating ties with the United States. Nouri, a surgeon,
has made his elder brother's thoughts his main election campaign program.
</P>
<P>
	   Nouri believes in curtailing the power of the clerics and says the issue of
Iran-U.S. relations should be put to the people in a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   He promises to work for the abolition of the Special Clerical Court, which
put his brother behind bars.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamileh Kadivar is a columnist, the wife of moderate Culture Minister
Ataollah Mohajerani and the sister of Mohsen Kadivar, a well-known cleric jailed
for religious dissent. The 36-year-old strongly supports Khatami's reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Faezeh Hashemi, the 37-year-old daughter of former President Akbar Hashemi,
has been heavily involved in promoting women's sports in Iran. Studying for a
master's degree in international law, she is vying for re-election to the
parliament. She opposes forcing women to wear hijab, the Islamic head-to-toe
covering.
</P>
<P>
	   Majid Ansari is a soft-spoken reformist cleric who led the minority
reformist faction in the outgoing Majlis. Ansari, 45, was instrumental in
blocking several bills in the parliament that would have been unfavorable to the
reformists.
</P>
<P>
	   Mohammmadreza Bahonar is considered the intellectual leader of the
conservative faction.
</P>
<P>
	   A brother of slain Prime Minister Mohammadjavad Bahonar, Bahonar was four
times a parliament member. He played key roles in the voting out of Abdollah
Nouri as interior minister and in the unsuccessful impeachment of Mohajerani,
the moderate culture minister.
</P>
<P>
	   Hassan Ghaffuri-Fard advocates a bill to impose greater restrictions on the
press and is strongly opposed to better ties with the United States. A former
vice president and the head of Physical Training Organization, he concedes the
conservatives have to change their language to win the votes of the youth.

<HEADLINE> Group Says Chechen Refugees Tortured  </HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW KRAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MALGOBEK, Russia (AP) -- Chechens trying to leave their war-ravaged republic
are being tortured in Russian detention camps and subjected to severe beatings,
rapes and other brutality, refugees and human rights groups say.
</P>
<P>
	   The allegations come on the heels of other complaints of human rights abuses
in the Russian offensive in Chechnya, including reports of summary executions of
civilians in Grozny, the Chechen capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials deny the allegations, but Chechens who have fled into
neighboring republics tell similar, grisly accounts of their detention in camps
that Russia says it set up to filter out rebels who are trying to escape
disguised as civilians.
</P>
<P>
	   A 21-year-old Chechen, lying in pain in a bed in Malgobek in neighboring
North Ossetia, said his ordeal began Jan. 22 when police dragged him off a bus
of refugees and took him to a camp in the Chechen village of Chernokozovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The man, who asked that he be identified only by his first name, Ruslan,
said he was forced to run a gantlet of masked policemen swinging truncheons, had
his clothes torn off and was forced to stand naked in a cold storage room.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I asked what they were detaining me for, but they didn't answer,'' he
said. He was released only after his mother paid a bribe to the camp directors,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At least three such camps are operating, according to Peter Bouckaert, a
researcher for the Human Rights Watch group in the region.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Russia appears to have declared any Chechen male to be a suspected rebel,
subject to arbitrary arrest and brutal treatment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The allegations were echoed by the World Organization Against Torture, which
issued a statement in Geneva on Thursday saying, ``We cannot ignore that the
filtration camps are indeed concentration camps where Russian soldiers are
committing the worst atrocities, in all impunity, against their prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Thursday that
``Russia has a clear obligation to investigate the numerous credible reports of
civilian killings and alleged misconduct by its soldiers promptly.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, who is acting President Vladimir Putin's aide for
Chechnya information, on Thursday reiterated denials of torture at Chernokozovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The allegations are ``the No. 1 topic in the information war the Western
mass media have unleashed,'' he said on Russia's ORT television. ``Routine work
like in any other detention center is going on there.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said that European Union observers would be allowed into the camp to see
the situation for themselves, but gave no date of a possible visit. The Council
of Europe's human rights commissioner, Alvaro Gil-Robles, is due to arrive in
Moscow on Feb. 24, but his office could give no details of the trip.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruslan, the refugee, told of a routine of torment, in which detainees were
often beaten in a hallway in the early morning, their cries awakening others in
their cells.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruslan said guards told him ``don't look me in the eyes, you black face,''
and then one hit him in the spine with a hammer. He says he has not been able to
stand erect since then.
</P>
<P>
	   An investigator accused him of fighting on the side of the Islamic rebel
groups that have battled Russian soldiers during the six-month war and demanded
names and addresses of rebels, Ruslan said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those who signed confessions, or said they could identify other men who
were fighters, did not come back to the cells,'' according to another refugee
who said he had also been at Chernokozovo.
</P>
<P>
	   The refugee, Eli, said a masked policeman once opened a peephole to the cell
and said, ``Who wants a smoke?''
</P>
<P>
	   When a prisoner approached the hole, the guard sprayed tear gas into the
cell and those inside reeled and were racked by coughs for minutes, Eli said.
</P>
<P>
	   Eli said a man from their cell was called out and he heard guards rape him.
Then a guard said he should answer to a woman's name, Fatima. Other detainees
described similar acts.
</P>
<P>
	   After this event, when guards rapped on the cell door with a truncheon, the
detainees were to call out the number of people in the cell as ``fifteen men and
one woman,'' said Eli.
</P>
<P>
	   Yastrzhembsky said Thursday there are 16 women among the 235 people
currently held in Chernokozovo. But he rejected a report by the French newspaper
Le Monde that said there were children in the camp.
</P>
<P>
	   In a move possibly aimed at deflecting criticism of Russia's human rights
record in Chechnya, Putin on Thursday appointed Federal Migration Service head
Vladimir Kalamanov as his special representative on human and civil rights in
Chechnya, the Interfax news agency said.

<HEADLINE> 'Charitable immunity' may limit damages in any Seton Hall fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Survivors of a fire that killed three Seton Hall
University students and relatives of those who died in the blaze may find it
difficult to win lawsuits against the college because of a legal doctrine
limiting liability for such institutions.
<P>
	   The doctrine of "charitable immunity" sharply limits the amount of damages
that can be assessed in lawsuits against educational and religious institutions
on the theory that they have limited funding and might not be able to survive a
costly court judgment.
</P>
<P>
	   And although no lawsuits have yet been filed against Seton Hall in
connection with the Jan. 19 fire that killed three freshmen in a dormitory,
several New Jersey personal injury lawyers said such litigation is inevitable.
They said they expect Seton Hall to invoke the charitable immunity doctrine in
any such lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   "The lawyers for Seton Hall will no doubt be taking a hard look at a
charitable immunity defense," Morristown attorney Stephen Weinstein told The
Star-Ledger of Newark in Thursday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   University spokeswoman Laurie Pine said Seton Hall would not comment on
possible litigation or any defense tactics it might employ.
</P>
<P>
	   Weinstein noted that a state appeals court reaffirmed Seton Hall's
charitable immunity status when it dismissed a suit by a student who suffered a
fall on campus.
</P>
<P>
	   "It involved a case of a student slipping in a puddle of water in what was
then a university-run pub on the campus," Weinstein said. "The appeals court
held that Seton Hall has immunity and the case was dismissed. The immunity was
extended, mind you, to cover activities at a campus pub."
</P>
<P>
	   Weinstein said applying the immunity doctrine to a student dormitory should
be an easier legal maneuver.
</P>
<P>
	   But he and other lawyers, including Harrison J. Gordon of West Orange,
cautioned that charitable immunity does not always offer absolute protection
from court judgments.
</P>
<P>
	   "It only shields them for what is known as ordinary negligence," Gordon
said. "In the event of gross negligence, a carelessness and negligence above the
usual, they could be held liable."
</P>
<P>
	   He said a jury could find the lack of sprinklers in Boland Hall, where the
fire broke out, constituted gross negligence. Seton Hall has since begun
installing sprinklers in all its dorms, and upgrading existing systems.
</P>
<P>
	   But not all schools are covered by the doctrine. In a related move, two
Superior Court judges on Wednesday ruled that the charitable immunity doctrine
does not extend to New Jersey's public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruling in the case of a Clearview student who left school grounds in
February 1994 with an unlicensed, underage driver and was severely injured in an
automobile accident, the judges rejected applying the immunity doctrine to
public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   A lawyer for the school district warned that the decision could have
expensive consequences.
</P>
<P>
	   "It means that a school board will be exposed to runaway verdicts,"
Clearview Board of Education lawyer Edward J. Tucker told the Philadelphia
Inquirer in Thursday's editions. "It means that they don't have the immunization
that public colleges or perhaps other kinds of private schools have."
</P>
<P>
	   Tucker said he did not know if the district would appeal.

<HEADLINE> Board Votes on Affirmative Action  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID MARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- With college students arriving by the busload to
protest, the State University System's Board of Regents convened Thursday to
vote on Gov. Jeb Bush's plan to drop affirmative action in admissions.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plan, the university system will ban consideration of race and
gender and instead admit the top 20 percent of every high school graduating
class in the state. It is called the Talented 20 program.
</P>
<P>
	   The regents were also voting on whether state universities should take into
account such factors as socioeconomic status, whether a student's parents went
to college, and the quality of the student's high school.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida's 10-school university system has about 219,000 full-time students.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican governor has said the proposal -- part of his larger One
Florida plan to bar consideration of race and gender in admissions and state
contracting -- will increase diversity. Opponents dispute that.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics, many of them students bused in from around the state, began filling
the meeting room at the University of Central Florida more than two hours ahead
of time.
</P>
<P>
	   Sylus Green, who was at the meeting to speak against Bush's plan, said he
had a 1.7 grade-point average as a high school student from Chicago's South
Side. The 20-year-old psychology major said he has a 4.0 at the University of
Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Bush's education plan, Green's dismal GPA might have prevented him
from going to the university and from receiving a minority scholarship.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I weren't given an opportunity to go to college. I wouldn't have had my
chance to soar,'' said Green, who is black.
</P>
<P>
	   Minority students attending the meeting said they supported parts of Bush's
plan, such as increased funding to improve the state's struggling public schools
and $20 million more in financial aid for college students.
</P>
<P>
	   But many said it won't work unless the gap in resources is narrowed between
mostly black public schools and mostly white ones.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some schools don't even have enough chalk,'' said Gerald Jones, who is
black and recently graduated with a master's degree in public administration.
``Our public school system isn't balanced.''
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic state Sen. Daryl Jones of Miami, chairman of the Florida
Conference of Black State Legislators, said white suburban teen-agers would
benefit the most under the governor's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a shame they are pushing forth the Talented 20 program as a hope for
minorities, when those benefiting most will not be minorities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kim Hunter, a UCF junior, was more optimistic about the changes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whoever has the best qualifications should be the ones that get the
reward,'' she said, who is white.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by the board, the rule changes must still go before the
independently elected Cabinet, which is to consider the matter Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 46.81; New Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks soared higher today, carrying the Nasdaq
composite index past 4,500 for the first time, as the sector was untouched by a
warning of higher interest rates from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
Blue chips, more vulnerable to interest rate concerns, closed lower, leaving the
overall market mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   According to preliminary calculations, the Nasdaq composite index ended up
121.30 at 4,548.95, surpassing its record close of 4,485.63, reached a week ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, off more than 100 points in earlier
trading, finished down 46.81 at 10,514.57.
</P>
<P>
	   Presenting his twice-a-year report on the economy to Congress, Greenspan
said the Fed's four quarter-point increases over the past eight months have had
little effect in slowing the economy. Greenspan attributed his concerns about
the economy to tight labor markets and the possibility that workers will begin
to demand higher wages that could set off inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue-chip stocks tumbled as the market interpreted Greenspan's comments as
implying that the central bank is likely to raise interest rates again-- as it
has already done four times since June.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greenspan's commentary sure indicated there is more than one interest rate
hike to come and that's not what market wanted to hear," said Barry Hyman, chief
market strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Nasdaq kept rising as technology stocks, which have been largely
unscathed by recent interest rate concerns, continued their advance. "The Nasdaq
is a different ball game. It's not a credit-sensitive sector," Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel and biotech giant Amgen powered the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial stocks were hurt by the prospect of higher interest rates,
including Dow component American Express.
</P>
<P>
	   Retailers also tumbled with Wal-Mart and Home Depot down.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan's comments came after a government report today said wholesale
prices held steady in January as a sharp decline in cigarette prices offset
rising costs for gasoline, heating oil and other energy products. The
performance was a better showing on inflation than analysts expected.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Bank of NY Aide Pleads Innocent  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A former Bank of New York employee pleaded innocent
Thursday to charges that she lied in connection with the government's probe of
money laundering by Russians using the bank's accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Svetlana Kudryavtsev entered the plea in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
where her former boss at the Bank of New York named her a day earlier as someone
who aided the illegal transfer of money.
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev's lawyer, Charles D. Adler, declined to comment after the brief
appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Douglas F. Eaton.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Lucy Edwards, the bank's former vice president in the Eastern
European Division, and her husband, Peter Berlin, pleaded guilty to money
laundering charges, admitting they helped Russian bankers funnel more than $7
billion through the accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said she started the scheme to help launder money after she was
approached by Russian bankers in late 1995. She said she was transferred to
London in 1996 and began paying Kudryavtsev $500 monthly to continue to look
after the money laundering accounts in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "She received these payments from us in return for serving as a point of
contact at the Bank of New York in the event there were problems with transfers
and to send my husband account statements so that he could calculate commissions
we were owed," Edwards said during her plea.
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev was an associate in the bank's Eastern European division in
August when she was questioned by the FBI as it investigated several bank
accounts, according to a criminal complaint.
</P>
<P>
	   She was later fired as it became publicly known that the Russians allegedly
illegally washed billions of dollars through the Bank of New York, the nation's
15th-largest bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Kudryavtsev remained free on $30,000 bail after Thursday's court appearance.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege that Kudryavtsev lied about whether she or her husband
had ever received any money or loans from Edwards or Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   In separate developments in Washington Thursday, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa,
chairman of the House Banking Committee, said he planned to subpoena Edwards and
Berlin to testify about the flow of money out of Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bank of New York case "represents a verifiable incident where the
financial system has been corrupted," Leach said in a statement. "It is critical
to review whether this is an (aberration) ... or symbolic of an endemic problem
in the international banking system."
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Rep. John LaFalce of New York, senior Democrat on the House
Banking Committee, said the guilty pleas by Edwards and Berlin "raise very
troubling questions" about banks' compliance with federal rules designed to
prevent money laundering.
</P>
<P>
	   The Banking Committee held hearings on the case in September at which Bank
of New York Chairman Thomas A. Renyi defended the bank's reputation but
acknowledged "a lapse" by its internal supervisors in allowing questionable
accounts to stay open. Some key figures in the investigation have declined to
testify voluntarily before the panel.

	   Snow and thunderstorms darkened the Rockies and Plains on Thursday, while
fair and dry weather dominated the East and West.
</P>
<P>
	   An area of low pressure spun near the Four Corners area. Snow, moderate to
heavy at times, fell over Utah, southern Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico and
northern Arizona. The snow was heaviest over western Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   The southern Plains also felt the effects of this southern Rockies storm
system. Showers and thunderstorms were located from southeastern Kansas and
southern Missouri, southward into eastern Oklahoma, Arkansas and northern
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
	   Damaging winds to 60 mph and large hail were the primary threats with these
storms.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defends Meeting With Chechens  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Responding to a Russian protest, the State Department on
Thursday defended its meeting with a Chechen separatist leader.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're concerned about the situation in Chechnya. We need to get a wide
range of information,'' department spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian foreign ministry said earlier Thursday that ``contacts between
U.S. officials and Chechen terrorists and separatists are absolutely
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said Chechen parliament speaker Seilam Beshayev met Monday only with
U.S. officials who deal with humanitarian and human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We felt to hold that meeting in our offices that deal with that was
appropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department has publicly and strenuously criticized Russia's
military campaign in Chechnya for its impact on civilians. At the same time, the
department has opposed a breakaway of the rebellious province and said Moscow
had a right to try to counter terrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia has reacted hotly to criticism of its offensive and has said other
countries should not receive Chechen representatives, whom it considers
illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We expect the U.S. administration to avoid any official contacts with the
representatives of Chechen terrorists and to practically follow its declarations
about adherence to a joint fight against international terrorism,'' the foreign
ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department officials met with another Chechen official several weeks
ago, prompting a similar protest from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said Thursday, ``we have very carefully calibrated our contact to not
give the impression that it has changed our view on the recognition of Chechnya,
which has not changed.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, he said, ``we're concerned about the situation in Chechnya. We need
to get a wide range of information.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said if Russia permitted journalists to go to the area, ``we wouldn't
all be operating from this vacuum of information, and then we could have less of
a need to seek information from sources they might not wish us to speak to.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Needs Victories Soon  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- For Al Gore, it's not enough to be far ahead of Bill
Bradley in the polls. The vice president, piling up endorsements from
abortion-rights, gay-rights and labor groups, is bent on not just beating his
rival but burying him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All I'm concentrating on is pouring the gas on ... and making sure that I
drive the message home,'' Gore said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Talking tough, he has called Bradley a ``special agent'' for the Republicans
and charged him with one of the worst sins a Democrat could commit: trying to
``starve Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was sounding philosophical Thursday, addressing high school and
college athletes in Providence, R.I.: ``When you encounter those moments in life
that are tough, those moments are not like a hammer hitting a clay pot,
shattering it, but like a hammer hitting metal, tempering it and making it
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he knows he needs real victories, and soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I clearly have to win a number of states on March 7 and 14, no question
about that,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   He told reporters in Boston that Gore could expect a two-week ``bump'' in
support from the vice president's Feb. 1 victory in New Hampshire, and ``now
we're in the third week.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is concentrating on the Northeast, where he is strongest, and on
California, where he is 40 percent behind in public opinion polls. His forays to
Washington state, which holds a primary on Feb. 29 but does not elect delegates
until March 7, suggest he's bidding for an invigorating, symbolic victory there.
</P>
<P>
	   Acknowledging Gore's lead, Bradley said, ``I don't think it's impossible to
overcome when the public focuses again.'' To try and command that focus,
campaign strategist Anita Dunn promised sharper ads raising questions about
Gore's record -- on abortion and gun control, for example.
</P>
<P>
	   But, in the abortion ad he began airing Thursday in Michigan, Ohio, Maryland
and Washington, Bradley mentions only his own consistently pro-abortion-rights
record.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Gore, top-heavy with Democratic Party support but anxious for
insulation, has wrangled endorsements from the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League and the gay-rights Human Rights Campaign --
two groups that had planned to remain neutral in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm campaigning as if I'm one vote behind,'' Gore said Thursday. Asked
this week how often he would be back campaigning in New York, Gore cracked that
the better question was: ``How often am I going to leave?''
</P>
<P>
	   New York, where Bradley was a pro basketball star with the Knicks, was a
neck-and-neck race one month ago. The latest poll, on Feb. 10, put Gore ahead
56-32.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's hard to make a souffle rise twice,'' Democratic consultant Bill
Carrick observed. And getting Democrats to take a second look will be tough for
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Nick Record, a 21-year-old University of Rochester student leaning toward
Gore, told a reporter this week all he knows about Bradley: ``He used to play
for the Knicks and he's not so much for education.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't know anything about him. Never have,'' said New Orleans electrical
worker Eddie Cordes.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from personal feelings -- confidants on both sides make clear that
Gore thinks Bradley arrogant; to Bradley, Gore is a liar who ``made my blood
boil'' -- practical considerations drive Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Having used up millions of dollars early last year on a campaign that even
he now regards as a waste, Gore cannot afford a war of attrition.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley can: He has $2 million more in the bank than Gore and has already
made some $3 million in commitments to California TV ad time that Gore won't
match.
</P>
<P>
	   Recognizing that most Americans still see Gore as President Clinton's No. 2,
the vice president's advisers say blowout victories on March 7 and again on
March 14 would show him as a winner in his own right.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A national fight is good for Al Gore. It increases his credentials with
the American people and shows him as a fighter. That's the image that's
important,'' said campaign chairman Tony Coelho, hastening to add, ``It's the
reality, too, of course.''
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic consultant David Doak warned there is such a thing as overkill.
</P>
<P>
	   Doak was in the San Jose convention center last weekend, when Gore railed
against Bradley as a Republican agent, not a ``real Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only effect that speech would have is to cause Bradley to pick up the
phone to his media person and say, 'Take off the Michael Jordan endorsement spot
and put up the Buddhist temple ad,''' Doak said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The last thing he needs is to give Bradley, with his $20 million, an
excuse to go negative in TV ads.''

<HEADLINE> Mayor: Pay Suits With Tobacco Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT JABLON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mayor Richard Riordan recommended Thursday that Los
Angeles set aside its entire $300 million share of the national tobacco
settlement to cover lawsuits brought by victims of the city's police corruption
scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the best use of these dollars,'' Riordan said at a news
conference. ``Though we have no way of knowing the dollar amount, we must expect
and prepare for tens of millions of dollars of liability.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor said the move would safeguard against possible cuts in city
services or new taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   City officials have estimated that lawsuits associated with the scandal in
the police department's Rampart Division will cost at least $125 million.
Lawsuits already have been filed on behalf of some men wrongly imprisoned
police.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators say rogue cops planted evidence, made up testimony, staged
crime scenes and in some cases shot unarmed suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the national $206 billion tobacco settlement, Los Angeles is to get up
to $300 million over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, a judge agreed to throw out the convictions of nine more
people whose cases prosecutors say were tainted by police misconduct. The
dismissals bring to 40 the number of convictions overturned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have dozens of more cases under review,'' District Attorney Gil
Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 20 officers have been relieved of duty, fired, suspended or have
quit since the investigation started last fall. Police have refused to say how
many officers are still under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcetti said he is doubling the number of prosecutors assigned to the
investigation, with a staff of 19 expected to be on board within the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Former undercover officer Rafael Perez, convicted of stealing cocaine from
an evidence locker, has detailed the corruption in his former unit and suggested
it went beyond Rampart.
</P>
<P>
	   No charges have been filed against any officers implicated in the
corruption, though police have recommended prosecuting three officers and
Garcetti has said he expects his investigation to result in charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Four cities, including Los Angeles, and all 58 counties in the state will
share in the estimated $25 billion California will receive over the next 25
years from the nationwide settlement. The money is intended to repay states,
cities and counties for health care costs associated with smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   Riordan said the city does not have a formal spending plan for the money but
it probably would have been spent on anti-smoking programs and street
improvements. His proposal requires approval from the City Council.

<HEADLINE> Gore Meeting With AFL-CIO Leaders  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- AFL-CIO leaders met with Al Gore on Thursday for the
first time since their fall endorsement of his presidential campaign and got
some reassurances on top union concerns in exchange for the votes they are
promising to deliver.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said he will continue to support the Clinton administration's push to
permanently grant China normal trade status this year -- something the AFL-CIO
has pledged to fight because of China's poor worker-rights record.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sweeney said the vice president stressed his sympathy with unions'
position that future trade agreements should include worker protections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The vice president has committed himself to being stronger on core labor
standards in trade agreements when he is president,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
	   United Steel Workers of America president George Becker said that although
unions will work hard to fight the China initiative as it stands, ``We're going
to give the Gore administration an opportunity to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the generally warm reception Gore received, the leaders of two major
unions that have not joined the AFL-CIO's endorsement -- the Teamsters and the
United Auto Workers -- skipped Thursday's closed-door meeting with the vice
president, saying they had other commitments.
</P>
<P>
	   The Teamsters hosted Gore's rival for the Democratic nomination, former New
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, at a meeting in Atlantic City, N.J., earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
	   The union is trying plan a private meeting with Gore soon said Teamsters
director of government affairs Mike Mathis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're listening carefully for the vice president to solidify his
positions,'' Mathis said.
</P>
<P>
	   On another matter of importance to the labor movement, Gore ``committed
himself to support changes in the laws, if necessary, regarding the right of
workers to organize,'' said Sweeney.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO has complained that it is too easy for companies to use
harassment and intimidation tactics to thwart workers who are trying to join
unions.
</P>
<P>
	   Sweeney has promised a no-holds-barred campaign by labor on behalf of Gore
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Gore's meeting with AFL-CIO leaders, Sweeney took him to shake hands
during an early-morning shift change at the Avondale shipyard, where last fall
workers won a six-year campaign to unionize.
</P>
<P>
	   Recognizing that union members are doing a lot of groundwork for his
campaign, Gore told one well-wisher, ``They always say when you pray, move your
feet.''
</P>
<P>
	   Glenda Southall, who has worked 10 years as an insulator at the shipyard and
is a Gore supporter said, ``I just hope that he can make things better for us
all.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``You see a lot of people on television, but he's the first candidate to
take the time to come here. It makes a difference,'' said sheet metal worker
George Weiss, 39.
</P>
<P>
	   White House Chief of Staff John Podesta, wearing a Gore campaign button,
also met with the union leaders on Thursday, the closing day of their annual
midwinter meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Podesta said the administration and the AFL-CIO share common ground on many
issues, including the need for more money for school construction, patient
protection laws and a Medicare prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   On China, they may have to agree to disagree, Podesta said. But he added,
``I think it's a disagreement among friends.''

<HEADLINE> UPS Ordered To Add Full-Time Jobs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- An arbitrator has ruled that United Parcel Service must
create 2,000 full-time jobs under the terms of its five-year contract with the
Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
	   In a decision released Wednesday evening, independent arbitrator George
Nicolau gave Atlanta-based UPS 90 days to add the full-time positions. UPS also
must pay back wages and benefits to those workers, who previously were
part-time.
</P>
<P>
	   Teamsters officials estimated Thursday their members would realize at least
$80 million from the arbitration decision, which they said was among the largest
in union history.
</P>
<P>
	   UPS spokesman Norman Black called the $80 million figure "ridiculous" and
said the company had not yet determined any costs.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of its 1997 contract with the Teamsters, UPS agreed to hire 2,000
new full-time workers per year for five years -- replacing part-timers -- if UPS
regained and surpassed shipping volume lost to a 15-day strike.
</P>
<P>
	   When package volume dropped because of the strike, UPS officials contended
that the job-creation language was void for the contract's first two years. The
Teamsters then filed grievances for 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday's decision covered the 1997 grievance; the 1998 dispute is
pending. With shipping volumes restored, UPS agreed to create 2,000 full-time
jobs for 1999. Teamsters spokesman Bret Caldwell said the union anticipates no
further disputes on that issue for the contract's remaining years.
</P>
<P>
	   Black said the company plans to discuss the 1998 grievance with union
officials since the issues are identical.

<HEADLINE> PNC Bank CEO O'Brien Stepping Down  </HEADLINE>
    By JEFFREY BAIR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- PNC Bank Corp. chairman and chief executive Thomas H.
O'Brien said Thursday he will retire after 39 years with the banking company.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brien, 63, will be replaced as CEO on May 1 by James Rohr, the bank's
president and chief operating officer. O'Brien will stay on as chairman for
another year following, at which point Rohr will take over.
</P>
<P>
	   Rohr, 51 said Thursday he will push the bank further into electronic
commerce and try to boost its brand name beyond that of "just a regional bank."
</P>
<P>
	   Only half of the bank's business is now traditional banking, Rohr said. The
rest includes the managing of corporate accounts, financial advice and mortgage
banking.
</P>
<P>
	   "I look at the industry and the pace of change that is going on all around,
and I see it as a tremendous opportunity," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rohr said the advent of Internet banking is the biggest development in the
field in the last 25 years and perhaps the entire century. He has shepherded
projects at PNC including CollegeLink.com, a site where people can obtain
college loans from PNC.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brien, 63, who has been chairman since 1985, said he was glad the bank was
able to stay independent as larger banks have merged. Rohr said he will try to
keep PNC that way.
</P>
<P>
	   PNC went from 7,000 to 27,000 employees and $15 billion to $75 billion in
assets in 15 years under O'Brien. It is now the 14th-largest bank holding
company in terms of assets in the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see anything ahead but the continuity of things we have been doing
and gaining momentum," O'Brien said. "I looked on the horizon, and it was clear
that it was not necessary to work until age 65."

<HEADLINE> Pentagon To Keep Anthrax Program  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon on Thursday rejected a House panel's call to
halt troop inoculations against anthrax, insisting that the vaccine is safe and
that the threat of biological warfare is real.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very important that we use the existing and available, safe and
effective vaccine to give our troops that go in harm's way the protection that
they deserve,'' Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Randy West told a Pentagon news
conference. The former Gulf War commander is a special adviser on biological
warfare.
</P>
<P>
	   Sue Bailey, the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said the
Defense Department intends to continue toward its goal of immunizing all 2.4
million members of the active and reserve military against anthrax, which is a
naturally occurring bacteria that, when inhaled, can cause death within a few
days.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon believes Iraq and other nations hostile to the United States
have produced anthrax weapons. The first U.S. troops to get the vaccinations are
deployed in Korea and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report released Thursday, the House Government Reform national security
subcommittee said the anthrax vaccine does provide a degree of protection to
those who receive it. ``Just how much protection is acquired, by whom, for how
long ... are questions the Defense Department answers with an excess of faith
but a paucity of science.'' it said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Plagued by uncertain supplies, uncertain safety and unproven efficacy
against the anthrax threat, the mandatory, force-wide immunization program
should be suspended until the Department of Defense gets approval to use an
improved vaccine,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., chairman of the
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon says it is searching for an improved vaccine but may not get
one for years.
</P>
<P>
	   So far more than 400,000 troops have been given approximately 1.5 million
shots, Bailey said. There have been 620 reported adverse reactions, 26 of which
required hospitalization, and only six of the hospitalizations are known to be
related to the vaccine, she said. The illnesses of the 20 others were unrelated
to the vaccine, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a very safe and effective vaccine against a very deadly biologic
agent that we know to be in the hands of many of our adversaries and could be
used against our forces,'' Bailey told reporters. ``That would imply were they
not vaccinated and exposed to this agent, they would die a horrible death.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vaccine has come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers as a growing
number of troops have refused to take the six-shot regimen. Complaints have
included fevers, muscle pain and dizziness. Some military members testified in
hearings held by Shays' panel that the vaccine controversy is hurting morale.
</P>
<P>
	   West, who was with Marine units that routed the Iraqi army from Kuwait in
the 1991 Gulf War, said he is concerned that an Internet-driven campaign to stop
the Pentagon's vaccination program is taking a toll.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I do worry about divisiveness'' within the military, he said. ``I worry
about any serviceman or woman that would leave the military or face any kind of
disciplinary action for no reason other than the fact that he refused to take a
shot that was designed only to be good for him.''
</P>
<P>
	   West said 351 members of the active and reserve forces have refused to take
the vaccine since the program started in 1998. That is the largest and most
specific figure the Pentagon has offered on resisters; it previously had said
the number was between 200 and 300.
</P>
<P>
	   The Shays report said that because there is little research on the
inhalation of anthrax spores by humans, the vaccine should be regarded as an
investigational drug, requiring the approval of troops to be administered. The
Pentagon counters by saying research on humans is not possible because anthrax
is deadly.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also says the inoculation program should be suspended because
some troops do not trust medical information provided by a Defense Department
that has engaged in ``heavy-handed propaganda,'' labeling critics as paranoid
rather than answering their questions.
</P>
<P>
	   West criticized the Shays report for repeating criticisms without including
the rebuttals made by Pentagon officials during committee hearings last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you take the meaning of the negative comments that are made in the
report, then go back and bounce them against the testimony that was given,
you'll find many of those concerns were adequately addressed,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bishops Ask Bush To Halt Executions  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The Catholic bishops of Texas have asked Gov. George
W. Bush to suspend the death penalty and review capital punishment in the state,
which leads the nation in executions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is essential that if the state is going to impose the ultimate
punishment that there be no margin of error,'' the bishops said in a letter to
Bush made public Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, a death penalty supporter who has presided over 119 executions since
taking office in January 1995, has no plans to halt executions, spokeswoman
Linda Edwards said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Two Texas convicts are scheduled to die by lethal injection next week,
including Betty Lou Beets, who was convicted of killing her fifth husband in
1983. She was indicted, but never tried, on a charge of killing her fourth
husband.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards said Bush ``is sworn to uphold the laws of Texas, including the
death penalty, and he believes we have a fair process in Texas with many checks
-- including a thorough and exhaustive review by the courts -- to prevent an
innocent person from being put to death.''
</P>
<P>
	   Texas has conducted 206 executions under four governors since capital
punishment resumed in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's letter, written on behalf of all the Catholic bishops and signed
by Richard Daly, executive director of the Texas Catholic Conference, said seven
of the 85 individuals released from U.S. death rows were in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The bishops urged Bush and the state Board of Pardons and Paroles to suspend
future executions on a case-by-case basis and ``conduct a thorough examination
of the system by which condemned persons in Texas are executed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bishops also said they would join other death penalty opponents in
trying to convince the Legislature next year to impose a moratorium on
executions while a review is conducted.
</P>
<P>
	   The death penalty issue has received renewed attention since Illinois Gov.
George Ryan -- a Bush supporter -- halted executions this month due to the
exoneration of 13 death row inmates in his state over two decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush defended the Texas death penalty system Tuesday when asked about the
issue during a Republican presidential debate in South Carolina, where he has
been campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are people who were found guilty by a jury of their peers. These are
people who have had full access to the courts of law. There's no doubt in my
mind that each person who's been executed in our state was guilty of the crime
committed,'' Bush replied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I support the death penalty for this reason: When the death penalty is
administered in a ... sure and fair way, it will save lives. It will save
lives,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Executed Italian 'Heretic' Honored  </HEADLINE>
   By ELLEN KNICKMEYER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME (AP) -- They laid wreaths, heaped roses and, in the sincerest tribute
of all, they argued, interrupted and expounded -- pilgrims of free thought,
paying homage Thursday at the spot where the Inquisition burned an outspoken
philosopher-priest at the stake four centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
	   From the Vatican, Secretary of State Cardinal Angelo Sodano called the Feb.
17, 1600, execution of Renaissance heretic Giordano Bruno ``a sad episode of
modern Christian history.''
</P>
<P>
	   A contemporary of Galileo, Bruno, unlike Galileo, refused to recant such
heretical ideas as the Earth possibly being other than the center of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno argued instead that the universe might well be infinite and its worlds
beyond number.
</P>
<P>
	   After a seven-year trial, executioners stripped him, gagged him, and burned
him in the center of Rome's Campo di Fiori square.
</P>
<P>
	   Admirers from across Europe gathered there Thursday, piling poems and tall
wreaths at the foot of a looming, hooded statue erected by their 19th-century
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
	   Followers of Italy's Radical Party set up shop with banners and a
loudspeaker, only to be drowned out by earnest objections from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is insupportable! It should be a day to come lay a rose, shed a
tear,'' said German Johannes Wackerbarth, who had been coming yearly to do just
that. ``And you're making politics of it!''
</P>
<P>
	   A peripatetic Dominican priest who rejected papal authority, Bruno traveled
Europe in the last decades of the 16th century, outraging Protestants almost as
quickly as they embraced him.
</P>
<P>
	   In Geneva, Bruno joined the Calvinist church but was soon excommunicated
over a broadsheet that held one of its leaders up to ridicule. At Oxford, the
English drummed him out of town for his ideas challenging classic astronomy.
</P>
<P>
	   In Rome, Bruno stuck to his guns throughout his imprisonment and trial from
1593 to 1600.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He said he neither had to nor wanted to repent, and didn't know what to
repent, nor what he had to repent,'' a transcript of the trial noted.
</P>
<P>
	   Three decades later, Galileo avoided the threat of a similar fate through a
statement in which he formally ``abjured, cursed and detested'' his own espousal
of a Copernican-based astronomy that posited the solar system revolved around
the sun, not the Earth.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1992, after Vatican study, Pope John Paul II overruled the Inquisition
verdict on Galileo, declaring the conviction a result of ``tragic mutual
incomprehension.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Bruno had gone farther than Galileo in wrapping astronomy into beliefs
that challenged what remain basic church principles, such as the Trinity of
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They pardoned Galileo. But we're still waiting on Bruno,'' said Eleanora
Caparrotti, a Radical Party follower.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement to a Naples forum on Bruno, Sodano, the Vatican's secretary
of state, called the drama that ended 400 years ago in the Campo di Fiori a
``sad episode'' and a ``matter of deep regret.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was killed because he thought freely,'' a cardboard sign at the base of
Bruno's statue declared. It denounced the ``infamous homicide'' as if it were
yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Kids Share Memories of Tornadoes  </HEADLINE>
   By ERIN McCLAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) -- Thursday was the first day back at school for
7-year-old Lacresha Spooner, and her first assignment was to tell classmates
what she saw when tornadoes tore through Georgia, killing her aunt and 17
others.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The house flew away,'' she said. ``And people died. Babies died.''
</P>
<P>
	   Teacher May Wingate also asked the class to write in spiral-bound notebooks
about what they could do to help.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can help my family,'' 7-year-old Jessica Collins wrote. ``I can help
pick up sticks, and I can help find dead bodies.''
</P>
<P>
	   The three twisters that touched down in rural Georgia early Monday packed
winds of up to 200 mph that flattened homes, cars and trailers.
</P>
<P>
	   In Mitchell County, where the storms were deadliest, the worst damage was in
a small subdivision and a mobile home park less than two miles from Mitchell
County Primary School. The school has 600 students, and about 65 had
storm-damaged homes, Superintendent Charles Stripling said.
</P>
<P>
	   The skies were gray and ominous Thursday, the first day since the storms
without bright sunshine. Both teachers and parents worried that a threat of rain
would rekindle children's terrifying memories.
</P>
<P>
	   Schools throughout the area called in extra counselors to handle children's
questions about the disaster and encouraged teachers to hold class discussions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to let them talk about it,'' assistant principal Vicki Hicks said.
``These children are afraid. They're afraid to go to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
	   Children react to natural disasters by taking cues from their parents,
school counselor Juanita McCall said. Young children who see adults overcome
with grief or panicking about new storms are likely to do the same.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These kids are already talking about the weather,'' McCall said. ``Parents
are afraid, too. The whole community is afraid.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forecasters predicted possible thunderstorms -- though not nearly as severe
as Monday's -- for southwest Georgia late Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's one (storm) after another every few days,'' said Paul Duval, a
meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, Fla. ``When the
skies get cloudy, people are going to be jumpy for many months.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wingate said she will try soon to return the class' focus to the upcoming
Iowa Test of Basic Skills, an important standardized test. But Thursday was a
day to talk about the storms, to listen to each other's stories, to look at the
clouds and worry about what they held.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Each of these children will work through things on their own,'' McCall
said. ``This is a pain that lasts a long time.''

<HEADLINE> Budget Chief Backs Coverage Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eliminating the rich from President Clinton's proposal to
provide new prescription drug benefits to all Medicare recipients would save
little money and help open the door to Republican tax-cutting plans, White House
budget chief Jack Lew said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, Lew said that if Clinton's plan
were to be reconfigured to make it less costly, ``the vast majority of people
who would not benefit ... are not rich people. They're not the Bill Gateses.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added, ``Having an income cutoff at a very moderate income level is the
only way to save substantial amounts of money.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lew offered no figures. But his defense of the president's program showed
that Democrats see Clinton's prescription drug coverage plan as a political
winner in this election year, whether or not it becomes law.
</P>
<P>
	   Lew also said that given the long stream of budget surpluses the
administration is projecting, the president's universal prescription drug plan
is affordable -- and a wiser use of the surplus than the tax cuts Republicans
want.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a false choice to say we ought to provide prescription drug benefits
to some but not all the elderly,'' Lew said. ``The real debate is, is there room
for a tax cut much larger than we proposed?''
</P>
<P>
	   In the fiscal 2001 budget he introduced on Feb. 7, Clinton proposed $351
billion in tax cuts over the coming decade. Congressional Republicans have not
offered their own tax proposal, but have said Clinton's was too small.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle over how to use projected surpluses will be the focus of this
year's budget fight on Capitol Hill. Generally speaking, Clinton wants to use
much of it for spending, while Republicans want to emphasize tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   After taking no action last year on a similar proposal by Clinton,
congressional Republicans have said they will produce their own prescription
drug plan this year.
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has said the GOP will focus on aiding
elderly people who lack access to or cannot afford private prescription
coverage. Among the options suggested are tax credits and block grants to
states.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about Lew's comments, Hastert spokesman John Feehery said 70 percent
of America's elderly already have ``very good'' prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The real choice is do you want to have the government take over
prescription drugs, or have a program that helps seniors get drugs they need
without encouraging a government takeover of the prescription drug industry?''
Feehery said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats traditionally have opposed proposals to restrict Medicare and
Social Security benefits to lower-income people. They worry that such limits
would risk eroding the two programs' political support, which long has come from
across the income spectrum.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's prescription drug proposal would cost $195 billion over the next
10 years, including $35 billion for extra coverage for seriously ill people
whose drug costs soar. Most of it would be paid for from anticipated budget
surpluses, though about one-third the cost would come from proposed savings to
be extracted from Medicare health-care providers.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan envisions an optional Medicare drug benefit for the elderly
beginning in 2002. It would cover half of retirees' prescription costs up to a
$5,000 cap by 2009, when it would be fully phased in.
</P>
<P>
	   On other issues, Lew said:
</P>
<P>
	   --Over time, repealing the Social Security earnings limit for thousands of
elderly people would be ``free'' because it would keep extra people working and
paying taxes. Republicans have put a 10-year price tag of $22.7 billion on the
proposal. The plan, supported by Clinton, would end the practice of trimming
Social Security benefits for many people age 65-69 who continue working.
</P>
<P>
	   --Amid rising heating-oil costs, the White House is monitoring energy prices
``carefully'' and will watch whether any long-term economic trends develop as a
result.
</P>
<P>
	   --He hopes the White House and Congress will strike a broad budget agreement
this year on spending, taxes and debt reduction. But if not, he said the
administration priorities are so strong that ``Democrats are comfortable
defending them in the political process.''

<HEADLINE> Police To Question Netanyahu  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Police will question former Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu one more time next week before recommending that he be indicted for
receiving favors and keeping state gifts, Israeli media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Police refused comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Radio and TV reports said Netanyahu is to be questioned Sunday. The
interrogation is aimed at wrapping up loose ends before the file is transferred
to the state attorney with a recommendation to prosecute, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting last October, Netanyahu and his wife Sara were interrogated several
times on suspicion of bribery, after a contractor presented the government with
a bill for $100,000 for work he said he did for the couple without being paid.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, gifts received by the couple while Netanyahu was in office were found
in storage. Some of the labels marking gifts as state property were removed,
according to the police.
</P>
<P>
	   Netanyahu has denied wrongdoing, calling the investigation politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
	   Yaakov Weinroth, one of Netanyahu's lawyers, said Thursday that police had
made up their minds from the start to recommend an indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even if Moses himself comes along now and says these things never
happened, the way this investigation was conducted, it won't change anything,''
Weinroth told Israel TV's Channel 2.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision about filing charges is made by the state attorney, who can
accept or reject police recommendations. ``We have full confidence ... that they
will make the right decisions,'' said David Shimron, another Netanyahu attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   Netanyahu, a political hard-liner, was defeated by moderate Ehud Barak in
his bid for re-election last May.

<HEADLINE> Zhirinovsky Won't Make Russia Ballot  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM HEINTZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- The Central Election Commission on Thursday rejected fiery
nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky's application to run for president, saying he
failed to report all his assets.
</P>
<P>
	   Zhirinovsky, whose erratic behavior and hectoring statements in parliament
sessions have made him widely visible, had not been expected to perform well in
the March 26 balloting in which acting President Vladimir Putin is the clear
favorite.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he would appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission rejected his application because it said his assets report
failed to include a small apartment belonging to his son. Candidates have to
report on their family members' financial standing, as well as their own.
</P>
<P>
	   Zhirinovsky, speaking at the commission session, argued that the property
constituted just 1 percent of his declared assets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do I cite 99 percent and conceal 1 percent in order to harm myself? I'm
not seeking a ticket to a rest home ... but aspire to occupy the highest post in
the country,'' Zhirinovsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   But commission chairman Alexander Veshnyakov rejected the argument, saying,
``Is it really a problem for normal citizens to take account of their own
possessions?''
</P>
<P>
	   Last fall, the commission rejected the candidate list of Zhirinovsky's
Liberal Democratic Party for parliamentary elections after it found two of the
party's top candidates had provided false information about their assets.
Zhirinovsky reregistered the party under another name.
</P>
<P>
	   The deadline for submitting applications to run in the election was Sunday
and Zhirinovsky is the second of 15 applicants to be rejected. The commission
approved a fifth candidate Thursday: Konstantin Titov, the reformist governor of
the Samara region of central Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission has already registered Putin, Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov, leftist Alexei Podberyozkin and Aman Tuleyev, the hard-line Kemerovo
region governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Zyuganov, Putin's nearest rival in opinion polls, unveiled a hard-line,
socialist economic platform on Thursday, which focused on increased state
support for ailing industries and agriculture, state regulation of energy prices
and promises to boost wages and pensions.
</P>
<P>
	   Zyuganov, who has the support of about 20 percent of voters, according to
recent polls -- compared to around 60 percent for Putin -- alleged Thursday that
the participation of Tuleyev and Podberyozkin was part of a strategy by
unspecified authorities to split the leftist vote, the news agency ITAR-Tass
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   But ``the population is well aware of it and won't rise to the bait
easily,'' he said, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, the electoral commission rejected a referendum proposed by
the reformist Union of Right Forces that was to have included questions on
possibly limiting presidential powers. The commission said the party had failed
to come up with the 2 million petition signatures necessary.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 46.81; New Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks soared higher today, carrying the Nasdaq
composite index past 4,500 for the first time, as the sector was untouched by a
warning of higher interest rates from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
Blue chips, more vulnerable to interest rate concerns, closed lower, leaving the
overall market mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index ended up 121.30 at 4,548.95, surpassing its
record close of 4,485.63, reached a week ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, off more than 100 points in earlier
trading, finished down 46.81 at 10,514.57.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 0.60 at 1,388.27.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index, reflecting the performance of smaller-company stocks
including many high-tech issues, rose 10.66 to 558.42, setting a closing record
for a second straight day.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,447 up, 1,561 down and 504 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.03 billion shares as of 4 p.m., down from Wednesday's
1.04 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Presenting his twice-a-year report on the economy to Congress, Greenspan
said the Fed's four quarter-point increases over the past eight months have had
little effect in slowing the economy. Greenspan attributed his concerns about
the economy to tight labor markets and the possibility that workers will begin
to demand higher wages that could set off inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue-chip stocks tumbled as the market interpreted Greenspan's comments as
implying that the central bank is likely to raise interest rates again-- as it
has already done four times since June.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greenspan's commentary sure indicated there is more than one interest rate
hike to come and that's not what market wanted to hear," said Barry Hyman, chief
market strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Nasdaq kept rising as technology stocks, which have been largely
unscathed by recent interest rate concerns, continued their advance. "The Nasdaq
is a different ball game. It's not a credit-sensitive sector," Hyman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel and biotech giant Amgen powered the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial stocks were hurt by the prospect of higher interest rates,
including Dow component American Express.
</P>
<P>
	   Retailers also tumbled with Wal-Mart and Home Depot down.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan's comments came after a government report today said wholesale
prices held steady in January as a sharp decline in cigarette prices offset
rising costs for gasoline, heating oil and other energy products. The
performance was a better showing on inflation than analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1 percent, Germany's DAX index
was up 1.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1 percent, and France's CAC-40
was up 1.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Diallo Jurors Mull Lesser Charges  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The jury in the trial of four police officers accused
of murdering an unarmed man in a barrage of 41 bullets will have the option of
convicting them on lesser charges of manslaughter or criminally negligent
homicide, a judge ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Joseph Teresi also ruled the jury can acquit if it believes the
officers thought they were arresting a dangerous criminal.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors had tried to convince Teresi that the evidence showed the
defendants illegally stopped an innocent man and had therefore forfeited the
right to cite the ``justification'' protections the law gives police.
</P>
<P>
	   The four white New York City officers still face second-degree murder
charges for killing Amadou Diallo, a black West African immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   But Teresi granted a prosecution request -- unopposed by the defense -- that
the jury be allowed to consider manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide
when it begins deliberating next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi gave no explanation for his ruling. But both sides appeared to be
hedging their bets -- the prosecution against the exoneration of the defendants,
the defense against harsh prison terms for their clients.
</P>
<P>
	   Barry Kluger, chief assistant district attorney in the Bronx, insisted
prosecutors often ask for lesser charges and ``no special significance should be
given to that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Second-degree murder carries a minimum 15-year sentence, and a maximum of 25
years to life.
</P>
<P>
	   First-degree manslaughter -- intent to cause injury resulting in death --
carries 5 to 25 years. Second-degree manslaughter -- recklessly causing death --
carries a minimum sentence of probation, and a maximum of 5 to 15 years.
Criminally negligent homicide -- failing to perceive the risk of death --
carries a minimum of probation and a maximum of 1 1/3 to 4 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants -- Kenneth Boss, 28, Richard Murphy, 27, Sean Carroll, 37,
and Edward McMellon, 27 -- testified this week that they fired at Diallo in the
Bronx a year ago because he refused to stop for questioning, retreated to his
apartment building and pulled out what appeared to be a gun. He was hit 19
times. The object turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution contends the officers never yelled any warnings and
continued firing as Diallo was falling or was down on the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial was adjourned until closing arguments Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi agreed with the defense that the jury should be told that it can find
the shooting was justified under state law, which says officers can use force
against anyone they ``reasonably believe'' is committing a crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial was moved to Albany from New York because of pretrial publicity
and protests alleging widespread police abuse of minorities.

<HEADLINE> Volpe says Wiese, not Schwarz, was there for Louima assault  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In his first sworn testimony about the incident, rogue
cop Justin Volpe insisted Thursday that an officer convicted of helping him
sodomize Abner Louima with a broken broomstick was never in the room when the
brutality occurred.
<P>
	   Officer Charles Schwarz, who faces a possible life sentence on his
conviction for holding Louima down, had no part in the assault, Volpe said.
Another officer, Thomas Wiese, was the only person present in a police station
lavatory during the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never saw Schwarz in the bathroom at any time," Volpe repeatedly told a
packed and tense Brooklyn federal courtroom. "When I was in the bathroom, the
only officer who assaulted Mr. Louima was myself."
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe, sentenced to 30 years after pleading guilty last year to the August
1997 assault, was the first defense witness in the trial of Schwarz, 34, Wiese,
34, and Thomas Bruder, 37, for conspiring to obstruct justice by concealing
Schwarz's role in the attack on the Haitian immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe said Wiese stood by the entire time, making no move to take part or
intercede in the attack. That conflicted sharply with Wiese's assertion, to
detectives and Brooklyn district attorney investigators, that he had entered the
bathroom during the attack and intervened by dragging a prostrate, bleeding
Louima from a toilet stall by his legs.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz faces a possible life sentence after his 1999 conviction for
violating Louima's civil rights by holding him down. Volpe, at his own
sentencing last December, said for the first time that Wiese, not Schwarz, was
the second officer in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
	   The courtroom was rapt as Volpe, speaking in a voice edged with emotion,
elaborated on his story for the first time during two hours and 15 minutes on
the stand.
</P>
<P>
	   As to why he had not come forward sooner to try to exonerate Schwarz of a
false accusation, Volpe said he could not explain "the horrible things I did
that night" to himself or to his family.
</P>
<P>
	   "I couldn't deal with it, think about it, talk about it. As time went on, I
just kept my mouth shut and blocked it out," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since being sentenced to 30 years in prison, Volpe said, "part of me
reclaiming my life is telling the truth about what happened that night ... I
want to do my time with a clear mind, with a clear conscience, and I can't live
with myself and do my time in peace, knowing that another man is paying for the
crime that I committed."
</P>
<P>
	   Seeking to counter suggestions that Volpe was only trying to save a cop
crony from trouble, Schwarz attorney Ronald Fischetti asked if the two officers
had socialized during their years on the job in Brooklyn's Flatbush section.
</P>
<P>
	   "We never had a relationship of any kind," Volpe said. "We weren't friends.
... I never knew him as Chuck. I knew him as Schwarz, a guy who worked in my
precinct."
</P>
<P>
	   Nervous and presenting himself as deeply contrite, the 27-year-old ex-cop
told of punching the handcuffed prisoner repeatedly, throwing him to the floor
and threatening the suspect before attacking him with the broomstick.
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe said he mistakenly believed that Louima had punched him during a
street riot outside a Haitian nightclub. When Louima became defiant and profane
after his arrest, Volpe grew "frustrated and angry."
</P>
<P>
	   "I was looking for some answers or an apology," Volpe said under strenuous
cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Resnick. "But I'm not blaming
Mr. Louima or trying to say it's his fault. I was the one who assaulted him."
</P>
<P>
	   Volpe's dramatic appearance came after the prosecution rested its case, but
was delayed briefly after U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson objected to the
witness showing up in blue prison fatigues and sneakers. U.S. marshals scrambled
to find a dark blue blazer, white shirt and tie that would fit the burly Volpe.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution ended its presentation by focusing on phone records showing
the contacts between the accused officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Alan Vinegrad briefly recalled an FBI agent who has
testified that the trio made an unusual number of calls to each other in the
days after Volpe attacked Louima.

<HEADLINE> For Campaigns, the Best TV Is Free  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain gabs on talk radio nearly every day. A George
W. Bush press release is written with a twist for black newspapers. Satellites
beam Al Gore onto the local news in cities carefully chosen for their
demographics.
</P>
<P>
	   With tightening budgets and a crush of states to compete in, the
presidential candidates are using increasingly sophisticated tactics to secure
as much free media time and space as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   While 30-second TV ads garner most of the attention, campaigns regularly
feed stations audio and video sound bites. They also broadcast events over
satellites, allowing stations to easily use the tape without sending a camera
crew. And the candidates flood the Sunday morning talk shows.
</P>
<P>
	   Stations ``rarely say `no' to the guy who might be president,'' said Steve
Rabinowitz, whose company arranges satellite interviews for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has opened a new frontier on free media, allowing reporters to travel
with him on his bus in a nonstop, rolling news conference. Just this week, NBC's
``Today'' show broadcast live from McCain's ``Straight Talk Express,'' and the
McCain campaign is considering installing a videocamera on board to transmit the
chats with reporters onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has used free media to counter the huge financial advantage amassed
by his chief rival, Bush. He's appeared on Sunday morning talk shows 13 times
since October.
</P>
<P>
	   But he is hardly alone in wooing the media.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Gore spoke at Morgan State University in Baltimore on his way
down South. He also did interviews via satellite with TV stations in Albany,
N.Y., Hartford, Conn., Denver and Seattle, all of which have upcoming primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea is to insert Gore into the news on a station that would otherwise
ignore him that day, using the political calendar and demographics to pick the
stations. ``Satellite is one way to have a presence without shipping the whole
road show there,'' Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other targeting is lower tech.
</P>
<P>
	   When Republican Jack Kemp endorsed Bush, the campaign wrote a press release
tailored for minority media that explained how Bush's tax plan helps those ``on
the outskirts of poverty,'' and how Kemp has reached out to low-income
communities. None of that was in the generic press release posted on Bush's
Internet site.
</P>
<P>
	   The generic press release also described Kemp as a ``leading conservative
and former vice presidential nominee.'' For the minority media, he was a
``former Buffalo Bills quarterback, vice presidential nominee and Housing and
Urban Development secretary.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said it is all part of the Texas governor's
effort to reach minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That means it's important to get your message to those who can convey it
to Hispanic-American readers and African-American readers,'' he said. As for the
quarterback reference, Fleisher said: ``No rhyme or reason. It's one of Jack
Kemp's many hats.''
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the courting is over the air. McCain talks to radio talk shows at
least every other day, and Bush phones three or four disc jockeys each morning
in South Carolina, where Republicans vote Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore does satellite interviews about once a week. The campaign pays for the
hookup, picks the target states and chooses markets and individual stations
based on their demographic profiles. A smaller city might be chosen over a
larger one, for instance, if it has a history of supporting Democrats, a
campaign aide said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, the Clinton-Gore campaign refined the targeting, using census data
and Nielsen research to choose stations, and a similar operation is gearing up
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a snap to get local TV stations to go along, even if the candidate has
nothing particularly local to say, said Rabinowitz, who also handled satellite
work for Clinton-Gore four years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Rabinowitz estimates a free interview to be worth 10 times as much as an ad:
``We tell our clients that the local news anchors are among the most trusted
individuals in people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the campaigns use the stations for publicity, the reporters get to ask
the questions. ``They're not stupid,'' Rabinowitz said. ``They can ask as tough
a question as they want.''
</P>
<P>
	   Not quite, said Tracy Egan, an anchor at WTEN in Albany. Her station got
only three and a half minutes with the vice president and the campaign cut off
the sound when the time was up -- just as Egan had begun asking Gore questions
about him being a born-again Christian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a way of controlling,'' Egan said in an interview. ``How can you ask
follow-up questions when they limit the time so much?''
</P>
<P>
	   After the Gore interview, she said, the station got a call from a Gore aide
admonishing it for asking the question.
</P>
<P>
	   Getting on TV is easier in 2000 because of the explosion of cable news
outlets looking to fill time. On Wednesday, MSNBC and Fox News both went live
from Bush events, said Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director.
</P>
<P>
	   ``More and more,'' she said, ``a lot of what happens on the campaign trail
goes out on live television.''

<HEADLINE> Jury find city did not violate First Amendment rights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The city did not violate the First Amendment rights of a
gay Irish group which has tried for a decade to march in the St. Patrick's Day
parade, a jury decided Thursday.
<P>
	   The verdict left city lawyers and an attorney for the parade organizers
elated but disappointed lawyers for the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   They had tried to prove during the three-week trial that the city
unconstitutionally blocked ILGO from marching on Fifth Avenue on St. Patrick's
Day.
</P>
<P>
	   If the jury had ruled the other way, the trial resulting from a lawsuit
filed by ILGO in 1996 could have led to monetary damages against the city and an
order requiring parade organizers to permit the group to march.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl urged both sides after the verdict in
Manhattan to negotiate the issues before another federal judge, but the city and
the Ancient Order of Hibernians said there was little chance of that.
</P>
<P>
	   One juror, Andrew Gardner, said outside court afterwards that the
nine-person jury agreed that ILGO was in a sympathetic position and deserved to
get its message out but the law did not allow the jury to conclude its rights
had been violated.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would have liked to find a way to help everybody with this, including
finding ILGO some comfort, but that wasn't my job," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're disappointed, very disappointed with the verdict," said ILGO lawyer
Steven Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia Waters, a lawyer for the city, said she was "very, very, very
happy" with the verdict, which she said vindicates a city policy not to allow
two groups to march in the same place on the same day.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the city would continue to offer ILGO alternative ways to protest
its exclusion from the St. Patrick's Day parade, including marching on streets
other than Fifth Avenue on the holiday itself.
</P>
<P>
	   The verdict, she added, also was vindication for the city because it showed
the city was not violating anyone's First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Ernest L. Matthews Jr., a lawyer for the Ancient Order of Hibernians, said
the parade organizers he represented believe their First Amendment rights were
protected by the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   He had told jurors that the parade had policies which disallowed groups
marching if they took positions contrary to those of the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
	   He said groups also were not permitted to use the parade to cause
confrontation or for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Protestants and Jews may march. People who hate the church may march, but
not as a group," Matthews had said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the verdict, Matthews said the parade organizers would be pleased.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every time we've gone to court, we've won every case," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gardner said the jury found that witnesses called by ILGO during the trial
were honest but that some city witnesses were coloring their testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   "I certainly thought some of the witnesses seemed to have an evolving story
or seemed to be spending more time trying to stick it to the other side than
stick to the truth," he said of some city witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the jury verdict, the dispute that began in 1991 when ILGO first
lobbied to join the parade was likely to continue, lawyers in the case agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard McKewen, ILGO's treasurer, said the group will continue to stage
protests on parade day.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll be there every year until we're able to get what we deserve," he
said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Die in Calif. Cargo Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif. (AP) -- Moments before his DC-8 cargo plane crashed
into an auction yard of junked cars, the pilot reported problems with the
balance of the aircraft, investigators said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Emery Worldwide Flight 17 plunged into the yard Wednesday night, killing its
three crew members and setting dozens of cars ablaze.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilot described a ``center of gravity'' problem shortly after leaving
Mather Field in suburban Sacramento, investigators said. That could mean, among
other possible causes, a shift in load, incorrect cargo weight or mechanical
problems, Preston Hicks of the National Transportation Safety Board said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators were trying to locate the plane's flight data recorder and
cockpit voice recorder in the smoking wreckage, Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, carrying a load of transmission fluid, clothing and a small
packet of detonators for auto air bags, was at 800 feet when it tried to return
for an emergency landing. It crashed in a fireball about a mile east of the
field shortly before 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   One witness said the plane hit the ground belly first and was immediately
engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
	   Those aboard were dead by the time fire crews arrived at the site, said
Capt. Dan Haverty of the American River Fire Department. Firefighters were
hampered by intense flames, which burned for several hours after the crash.
Smoke was visible in the moonlit night several miles away.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no chance of rescue,'' Haverty said.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims were identified as Capt. Kevin Stables, 43, of Berlin, N.Y., who
had been with Emery for five years; First Officer George Land, 35, of
Placerville, Calif., 3 years; and Second Officer Russell Hicks, 38, Sparks,
Nev., 1 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Company spokesman James Allen said the crash was the first fatal accident in
the company's 50-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   Nobody on the ground was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash at the Insurance Auto Auctions salvage yard set as many as 200
cars on fire, many with gas in their tanks, causing several explosions.
</P>
<P>
	   Motorist Scott Colyn saw the plane as it approached the salvage yard ``at
eye level.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It looked like it was skipped like a stone,'' said Colyn, who saw the
crash while he was driving home. ``I looked in my rear view mirror and there
were flames everywhere, sparks and a big old mushroom cloud.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, fully loaded and carrying 62,000 pounds, was a DC-8 71, a
four-engine plane manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, Allen said. It has a
capacity of 90,000 pounds, he said.

<HEADLINE> Analysis of Latest Bradley TV Ad  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   An analysis of Bill Bradley's latest television commercial on abortion:
</P>
<P>
	   TITLE: ''99 percent.''
</P>
<P>
	   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   PRODUCER: Crystal Team.
</P>
<P>
	   AIRING: In states with primaries on March 7 and March 14 -- California,
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, Maryland, Maine,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, New York, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   SCRIPT: (Female announcer:) ``Of the five men running for president, only
one candidate has been pro-choice for everyone all the time.''
</P>
<P>
	   (Bill Bradley:) This is the kind of issue that you can't straddle. You can't
be on both sides. You have to decide which side you're on. Are you anti-choice?
Or are you pro-choice? And I decided a long time ago that I'm pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   KEY IMAGES: Opens with text on screen reflecting announcer's words. Women at
a Bradley rally, Bradley talking with a woman and then mixing with people at an
outdoor gathering. Ends with Bradley speaking directly to the camera.
</P>
<P>
	   ANALYSIS: Almost identical to an ad that ran in New Hampshire, this spot
continues Bradley's assault on Gore's early record on abortion, an issue
important to many Democrats, particularly women. The ad comes the same week that
the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League endorsed Gore,
partly, because it was angry at Bradley for trying to drive a wedge between
voters who support abortion rights. Hoping for a big bounce, the Bradley
campaign had local supporters release the ad in 25 cities around the country.
Unclear was how effective the ad will be given that Gore and Bradley have
identical positions on abortion today.
</P>
<P>
	   ACCURACY: Both Gore and Bradley support abortion rights, but Bradley has
tried to raise the public's awareness about Gore's earlier opposition to
government funding for abortions for poor women in Medicaid. Given the nature of
Bradley's dispute with Gore on this issue, when the announcer says Bradley is
the only one who has been ``pro-choice for everyone all the time'' that implies
that others -- including the vice president -- haven't always held the same
position. Bradley's comment that he decided ``a long time ago that I'm
pro-choice'' conveys the message that he's the truest supporter of abortion
rights among the presidential field.

<HEADLINE> White Land Seizure Tops Mugabe Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By ANGUS SHAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- The seizure of white-owned land remains at the top
of President Robert Mugabe's agenda, despite voters' rejection of constitutional
revisions that would have entrenched his powers and allowed land confiscation
without compensation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters struck down the revisions over the weekend, providing Mugabe with his
biggest electoral defeat in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mugabe and his colleagues in the Zimbabwe African National Union
politburo promised to push ahead with the land seizures, party spokesman Nathan
Shamuyarira said late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The government intends to take nearly half of the 30 million acres of
``prime agricultural land'' from about 4,000 white farm owners and hand it over
to land-hungry blacks, Shamuyarira said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mugabe-backed revisions called on Britain, the former colonial power, to
pay compensation to landowners, mostly the descendants of British settlers. It
asserted Mugabe's government had no obligation to pay.
</P>
<P>
	   The revisions were rejected with 55 percent in opposition and 45 percent in
favor. But party leaders suggested Wednesday that the Parliament, dominated by
the ruling party, could insert a similar amendment into the existing
constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, several farmers were ordered off their properties, but then were
told to return because the government couldn't pay the prices recommended by
state evaluators.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 70,000 black families have been resettled -- far short of the target of
160,000 families to be given land in the first decade of independence.
</P>
<P>
	   Zimbabwe's economy has plunged to its lowest since the country gained
independence in 1980. Shortages of gasoline and power, blamed on government
ineptness and corruption, have crippled transport, agriculture and industry.
Inflation and unemployment are at record levels.
</P>
<P>
	   In South Africa, President Thabo Mbeki praised the peaceful referendum,
saying Thursday it had been ``a demonstration of the strength of the democratic
process there.''
</P>
<P>
	   But, he said, South Africa couldn't stand by and let the Zimbabwean economy
collapse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It wouldn't be good for the region to have a collapse there,'' Mbeki told
reporters in Cape Town. ``You don't want to see people abandoning their homes in
the hundreds of thousands marching across the border coming to South Africa
because of the crisis.''

<HEADLINE> Government Reverses Waco Statement  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's acknowledgment that a type of infrared
camera the FBI used during the 1993 Waco siege can detect gunfire is a
``stunning reversal'' from its long-held position, Branch Davidian lawyers
contended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the government's lead lawyers in the wrongful death case said
Wednesday that the camera is capable of detecting gunfire ``in some
circumstances.'' But Michael Bradford, a U.S. attorney in Texas, continued to
assert that federal agents did not fire any shots on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   A demonstration planned for next month in Texas will test the Branch
Davidians' claim that federal agents fired their weapons. Both sides hope the
test will determine what caused more than 100 flashes to show up on the infrared
tape the FBI shot of the siege. They plan to compare the FBI tape and aerial
surveillance footage made at the re-creation.
</P>
<P>
	   Branch Davidian lawyers contend Bradford's comment about the Forward Looking
Infrared camera is a tacit admission that the test will detect gunfire.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're seeing is the government can read the handwriting on the wall,
so to speak, and their experts have told them, `Expect to see gunfire flashes on
the (infrared) demonstration tapes that are going to look just like the flashes
on the April 1993 tape,''' said Michael Caddell, the lead counsel for Davidians
suing the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Three months ago, the government appeared skeptical about the camera's
ability to detect gunfire. In a filing in federal court in Waco, Texas, the
Justice Department proposed to test the plaintiffs' ``hypothesis'' that gunfire
can be captured on camera.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI's own camera operators, in more recent depositions, denied the
camera could detect muzzle blasts, Caddell and co-counsel Jim Brannon said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now they see they are going to lose the test, they are shifting gears,''
Brannon said. ``To diminish the test before you ever run it, that's the best
strategy you could ever follow, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
	   The court-ordered field test is expected to play a key role at the trial,
which is set to begin in mid-May. Some 80 Davidians died during the siege, some
from the fire, others from gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
	   In their lawsuit, the survivors and relatives of the dead allege that
government negligence and excessive force contributed to the tragedy. The
government has denied wrongdoing, saying the Davidians set the stage for their
own deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has long insisted that no shots were directed at the
Davidians during the culmination of the 51-day siege, which ended when the
compound was consumed by flames several hours into an FBI tear-gassing operation
designed to flush them out.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview Thursday, Bradford denied any shift in the government's
stance. As for statements made during the depositions, he said the plaintiffs'
lawyers interviewed ``individual FBI agents that we did not offer as experts.''
</P>
<P>
	   The field test, scheduled for an Army outpost in central Texas in mid-March,
is about more than whether FLIR can capture gunfire, Bradford said. Also central
to resolving the controversy is whether the cameras used during the field test
will detect people on the ground, he said, noting the 1993 FLIR did not capture
any agents stationed outside the compound when the bursts of light appear.
</P>
<P>
	   People, like bullets, give off heat, so both should appear, the government
contends.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In our opinion, what will show up on that tape will be so starkly
different from what is on the April 19th tape that it will be evident that (what
occurred) April 19th is not gunfire,'' Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plaintiffs contend the 1993 FLIR didn't record the agents because the
temperature of their clothing, as they lay prone, was similar to the ground
temperature.

<HEADLINE> Cayuga Indian Nation To Get $37M  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM KATES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- A federal jury recommended Thursday that the Cayuga
Indian Nation receive $36.9 million for lost ancestral lands, a figure a lawyer
for the tribe called ridiculously low.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision was one step toward settling a long-standing dispute over how
much the Cayugas should get for 64,015 acres in upstate New York that the state
has had for 204 years. U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn will actually decide the
payment.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, McCurn ruled that New York illegally acquired the land in 1795 and
1807 by purchasing it from the Cayugas without the federal government's required
approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Clint Halftown, a spokesman for the Cayugas, said the tribe had expected at
least $100 million for its lost lands.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have always said this was not about money,'' Halftown said. ``So we
have a little less to buy back our land, to begin rebuilding our nation. It is
enough to start.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tribe attorney Martin Gold was far more critical of the the jury's decision.
``It's ridiculous,'' he said. ``Apparently nine people didn't pay attention to
the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
	   The suggested award was well below the $335 million -- including $70 million
in back rent -- an appraiser for the federal government told the jury the tribe
deserved. But an appraiser for the state testified that the land was worth no
more than $51 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant state Attorney General David Roberts applauded the jury's
recommendation. ``This is an outcome that was better than the alternatives. But
it's just one step,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury had to decide a present-day market value as well as the land's
rental worth for each year from 1796 to the present. The award consisted of a
rental value of $1.9 million -- $17,156.86 per year minus past payments and
compensation already paid by the state. They determined the current market value
of the land to be $35 million.
</P>
<P>
	   A second non-jury trial will determine ``equitable factors,'' such as
interest on the back rent and deductions for public infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
	   About 500 Cayugas live in western New York on and around the Seneca's
Cattaraugus reservation. Two other larger groups of Cayugas, who also are party
to the claim, live in Canada and Oklahoma.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Denies Concession Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By TED BRIDIS AP Technology Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft forcefully denied a published report late
Thursday that billionaire chairman Bill Gates offered a key concession to settle
his company's historic antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bloomberg financial news service said Gates answered "yes" moments after
a televised interview when asked whether he would disclose the secret blueprints
for the Windows operating system to competitors. It said Gates did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   A Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, vigorously denied the report. Gates has
previously rejected any suggestion that Microsoft share the so-called source
code to its flagship product, which has earned the company billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've talked to Bill, and Bill said he never said that," Cullinan said.
"That issue is not even related to this case. All he said was, we would try to
do our best to settle this case."
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute comes just days before the landmark trial resumes. The next
round of courtroom arguments was set for Tuesday, when lawyers will argue about
which specific antitrust laws the company violated, if any.
</P>
<P>
	   Settlement talks are continuing in Chicago under the guidance of a federal
appeals judge, Richard Posner, who has agreed to serve as mediator.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, one of the 19 state
officials suing the company along with the Justice Department, declined to
comment on Bloomberg's report.
</P>
<P>
	   A Justice Department spokesman also couldn't be reached immediately.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco-Backed Security Sales Mulled  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A growing number of states and local governments are
considering plans to issue bonds backed by tobacco settlement money in order to
get the money faster and reduce risk that cigarette companies may not be able to
pay up.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles on Thursday became the 20th entity nationwide to consider such a
plan when Mayor Richard Riordan recommended that the city use tobacco settlement
money to pay the cost of lawsuits arising from a widening police corruption
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City already has adopted a plan to issue $709 million in bonds to
support schools. Nassau and Westchester counties in New York also have issued
tobacco settlement bonds.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar proposals are under consideration in 14 states, Puerto Rico and the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials worry that cigarette companies might escape their obligations
through bankruptcy proceedings. Also, tobacco company profits could be cut by
future lawsuits or declines in cigarette consumption.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a lot of uncertainty," said Mark Drennen, Louisiana's chief
financial officer. "Part of it is nobody knows down the road what's going to
happen with consumption. We've seen a huge drop-off already. There's also
concern about legal loopholes."
</P>
<P>
	   Similar concerns worry the bond industry. Last November bonds issued by
Nassau County failed to get the most favorable rating from Standard and Poor's
because of similar concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   In Los Angeles, a bond issue would reap at least $91 million and as much as
$100 million, about one third of what the city would receive under the tobacco
settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Under terms of the settlement reached last year, big tobacco companies must
shell out $8 billion per year over the next 25 years to compensate states and
local governments for health costs related to smoking-related disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles' share of the money is estimated at $300 million. The city would
sacrifice more than two-thirds of that in exchange for collecting $91 million
from investors, who would get a 6.75 percent annual rate of return for 30 years
under a proposed deal outlined for the city by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal requires City Council approval. If the council endorses the plan,
Morgan Stanley and other investment banks would bid for rights to manage the
bond issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Apart from giving the city a big chunk of cash early, the bond issue would
take away risk that tobacco companies may not be able to meet their obligations,
said Robert Larkins, a principal at Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
	   "What investors are buying is a share in the settlement payments which are
driven primarily by domestic cigarette consumption," said Larkin. "The city is
shifting a large measure of the risk with that transaction."
</P>
<P>
	   Because the tobacco companies' revenue stream depends on cigarette
consumption, officials in several states have expressed concern that declines in
smoking could undermine the companies' ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
	   The bond plan also raised concern among anti-smoking activists who want the
money used for health programs. The California branch of the American Lung
Association has recommended that 15 percent of the state's share of tobacco
settlement money be used to reduce smoking and 85 percent for general health
programs.

<HEADLINE> John Lennon's Piano To Be Auctioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- The piano on which John Lennon composed "Imagine" is to be
auctioned on the Internet in July, online company eOffer.com said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 30-year-old upright Steinway was expected to fetch $1.6 million and
could become the most expensive item of pop memorabilia ever sold, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The wood-finished piano was unveiled to the public Thursday at The Beatles
Story museum in Liverpool. It is to be sold on a new Internet site which is
being set up by Fleetwood Mac musician Mick Fleetwood and auctioneer Ted Owen.
</P>
<P>
	   "The owner is a private collector and a great Lennon fan and he's had it now
for nearly 10 years," said Owen. "He feels, like we do, that it needs to be in a
museum and that's why it's being shown at the Beatles museum until Oct. 9, which
would have been Lennon's 60th birthday."
</P>
<P>
	   "Imagine," originally recorded in 1971, became a number one hit when it was
rereleased shortly after Lennon's death. The former Beatle died outside his New
York home, the Dakota building, 20 years ago at the hands of obsessed fan Mark
Chapman.
</P>
<P>
	   The piano was built in Hamburg in 1970 and bought by Lennon later that year.
Video footage has been recorded of Lennon playing "Imagine" on the piano for the
first time to Yoko Ono and the Plastic Ono Band in 1971.

<HEADLINE> Audit: HMOs Selling at Big Discounts  </HEADLINE>
    By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pharmaceutical companies sold a drug to two HMOs for 34
percent less than what Medicaid programs pay, circumventing federal rules
intended to ensure the government is offered the same prices as other customers,
federal investigators concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general concluded
that the drug companies' practice of giving favored HMO customers better prices
on drugs could cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
	   The practice "provides drug manufacturers the opportunity to sell to favored
customers without offering that price to Medicaid," inspector general June Gibbs
Brown wrote Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who requested the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The inspector general investigates possible waste, fraud and abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   In the two drug purchases reviewed, the inspector general found that
Medicaid programs would have saved $27.8 million if offered the same prices that
the HMOs paid.
</P>
<P>
	   The names of the drug company and the HMOs were not specified in the letter.
</P>
<P>
	   Gibbs also said that drug companies may have adjusted prices for as many as
175 drugs. The investigation, completed last fall, was reported on Thursday by
The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
	   Under federal rules, state Medicaid programs get rebates from drug
manufacturers in order to bring the prices they pay for drugs in line with
prices offered to private companies, such as HMOs.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug manufacturers get around the rules by taking the position that the
HMOs are buying drugs as "repackagers," which purchase drugs and then sell them
under their own brand name, and not as HMOs.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug companies maintain that repackagers are not subject to the Medicaid
"best prices" provisions, which Waxman says is a violation of federal rules.
</P>
<P>
	   He asked HHS Secretary Donna Shalala to launch a fuller investigation and
recoup any lost discounts to Medicaid programs.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Mayor Supports N.Y. Mayor  </HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The mayor of Jerusalem weighed in on the New York Senate
race Thursday, denouncing Hillary Rodham Clinton and calling Rudolph Giuliani
``the greatest friend of the city of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
	   With Jews making up 12 percent of New York's electorate, a candidate
regarded as being anything less than a stalwart supporter of Israel could be at
a disadvantage in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert said he did not want to poke his nose
into American electoral politics by endorsing a candidate, he did not hold back
on his praise for the Republican New York City mayor. Olmert was also speaking
at a Giuliani fund-raiser Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm looking for a friend of Jerusalem,'' Olmert said during a news
conference with Giuliani at the city's emergency command center. ``I have found
no better friend of Jerusalem in America than Rudy Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani supports moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem, an idea that is important to some Jewish groups but opposed by
Palestinians, who want to make the eastern half of the city the capital of their
future state.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady has said she favors an undivided Jerusalem as the capital of
Israel, but she has been criticized in the past for appearing to side with the
Palestinians on the issue of statehood.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Olmert and others also criticized the first lady for her
silence during a speech in which Soha Arafar, the wife of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, claimed that Israeli troops had used poison gas against
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton later repudiated the remarks and said she had feared she would have
caused an international incident by denouncing Mrs. Arafat on the spot. Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak agreed, saying Clinton did the right thing in the
interests of peace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm sure that Mrs. Clinton considers herself a good friend of Israel,''
Olmert said Thursday. ``I was personally very insulted and upset (by the) lack
of her spontaneous reaction to these horrible things expressed by Mrs. Arafat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's campaign did not immediately return a call seeking comment on
Olmert's comments Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady had criticism of her own for the mayor Thursday, saying
Giuliani's decision to bulldoze a community garden in Manhattan to make way for
low-income housing was an example of a ``difference in leadership styles''
between them.
</P>
<P>
	   The state attorney general had requested an injunction to protect all the
city's community gardens, but the lot was bulldozed before a judge could rule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The mayor seems to think that you bulldoze first and ask questions later
and I don't think you can bulldoze your way in the Senate,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Mayor: Pay Suits With Tobacco Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT JABLON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mayor Richard Riordan recommended Thursday that Los
Angeles set aside its share of the national tobacco settlement -- up to $300
million -- to cover lawsuits brought by victims of the city's police corruption
scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the best use of these dollars,'' Riordan said at a news
conference. ``Though we have no way of knowing the dollar amount, we must expect
and prepare for tens of millions of dollars of liability.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor said the move would safeguard against possible cuts in city
services or new taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   City officials have estimated that lawsuits associated with the scandal in
the police department's Rampart Division will cost at least $125 million.
Lawsuits already have been filed on behalf of some men wrongly imprisoned by
police.
</P>
<P>
	   Riordan's announcement came as the scandal took on a higher profile after
months of generating little protest. Chief Bernard C. Parks appeared before the
City Council on Wednesday in his most comprehensive, public review of the
six-month investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators say rogue cops planted evidence, made up testimony, staged
crime scenes and in some cases shot unarmed suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, a judge agreed to throw out the convictions of nine more people
whose cases prosecutors say were tainted by police misconduct. The dismissals
bring to 40 the number of convictions overturned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have dozens of more cases under review,'' District Attorney Gil
Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
	   As many as 20 officers have been relieved of duty, fired, suspended or have
quit since the investigation started last fall. Police have refused to say how
many officers are still under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcetti said he is doubling the number of prosecutors assigned to the
investigation, with a staff of 19 expected to be on board within the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Former undercover officer Rafael Perez, convicted of stealing cocaine from
an evidence locker, has detailed the corruption in his former unit and suggested
it went beyond Rampart.
</P>
<P>
	   No charges have been filed against any officers implicated in the
corruption, though police have recommended prosecuting three officers and
Garcetti has said he expects his investigation to result in charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the national $206 billion tobacco settlement, Los Angeles is to get up
to $300 million over 25 years. The money is intended to repay states, cities and
counties for health care costs associated with smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   Riordan said the city does not have a formal spending plan for the money but
it probably would have been spent on anti-smoking programs and street
improvements. His proposal requires approval from the City Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, the city would issue bonds backed by the tobacco
settlement in order to get money in a lump sum, instead of in the payment stream
over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, the state attorney general's office took a larger role in
scrutinizing the police probe, which is looking at allegations of corruption
between 1995 and 1998. The FBI has contacted Parks about its potential
involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   Council members said the community was losing confidence in the department
and criticized a command structure that allowed officers to behave criminally
for so long.

<HEADLINE> John Hancock's Sales Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- John Hancock Financial Services said Thursday 1999 sales rose
13 percent, boosting operating profits by 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The results were the first since the company held an initial public offering
of stock in January.
</P>
<P>
	   After-tax operating income was $613.2 million in 1999, up from $500.8
million in 1998. The company estimated earnings per share were $1.93 up from
$1.58, based on an estimated 317 million shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue was $7.65 billion in 1999, up from $6.75 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported strong gains from its insurance, asset gathering, and
institutional asset management businesses, and record sales in individual
variable life insurance, long-term care insurance and retail annuities.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding in the costs of converting the company from a mutual insurance
company to a shareholder-owned company and other one-time expenses, the
company's net income fell to $153.2 million, or 48 cents per share, in 1999,
down from $448.5 million, or $1.41 per share, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen L. Brown, chairman and chief executive officer, called January's
demutualization and initial public offering "the most complex undertaking in our
company's 138-year history."
</P>
<P>
	   For the fourth-quarter, operating income was up slightly to $139.8 million,
compared with $139.1 million a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Mexico School Reopening Disrupted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The gradual return of normal academic life to Mexico's
largest university after a prolonged strike was partially disrupted Thursday by
die-hard strikers in several faculties and schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Temporary blockades were reported at the Social Work and Social Science
faculties, while a university-affiliated high school was occupied overnight, and
radical students demanded assemblies to discuss possible occupations in several
other facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   But despite the problems, the slow march towards the full reopening of the
National Autonomous University of Mexico, known as UNAM, continued. Students and
teachers back on the huge campus in southern Mexico City concentrated on getting
the paperwork out the way, the Formato 21 radio station reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Strikers had occupied and effectively paralyzed academic activity at UNAM
from April 20 until Feb. 6, when they were ousted by a dawn police raid in which
hundreds were arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   The continuing detention of some of those arrested in the raid has served as
a rallying cry for the ousted strikers, but although a march last week attracted
tens of thousands, the response to calls for further strikes have received only
a patchy response.
</P>
<P>
	   UNAM rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente announced Thursday that classes
throughout the university would officially begin on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Fuente also said he was setting up a special commission to oversee
preparations for a congress to discuss the future of the troubled university
that is home to 270,000 students.
</P>
<P>
	   He said wide-ranging reform was ``the only way to compensate for this long,
costly and painful last 10 months, that has not yet concluded and will not be
concluded until the reform is completed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The strike was triggered by a proposed hike in annual tuition from a token
few cents to the equivalent of dlrs 140. It developed into a much vaguer protest
movement after the university authorities backed down from the threatened fee.
</P>

Pentagon Defends Anthrax Vaccine
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon today rejected a House panel's call to halt
troop inoculations against anthrax, insisting that the vaccine is safe and that
the threat of biological warfare is real. Some 351 members of the active and
reserve forces are officially said to have refused to take the vaccine since the
program started in 1998. The vaccine has come under increasing scrutiny from
lawmakers as troops have complained of fevers, muscle pain and dizziness. The
Defense Department intends to immunize all 2.4 million members of the active and
reserve military. The Pentagon believes Iraq and other nations hostile to the
United States have produced anthrax weapons.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- More than 4,000 demonstrators marched through
the streets of Kosovo's capital Thursday to protest escalating violence in
Kosovska Mitrovica that has left at least nine people dead and dozens injured.
The protesters called for freedom of movement and equal access to services in
both the city's Serb-majority northern region and its ethnic Albanian southern
parts. Since the arrival of NATO troops, some ethnic Albanian hard-liners have
harassed Kosovo's Serbs and other minority groups. Tens of thousands of
non-Albanians have fled the province.

today that Dr. William Heyward, the former chief of the CDC's HIV vaccine unit,
helped Brisbane, Calif.-based VaxGen land the grant last October before joining
the company in January. Heyward, now VaxGen's vice president for international
trials, told The Associated Press that while he was in favor of the grant when
working for the CDC, several other government officials had to approve it as

L.A. Mayor: Tobacco Funds for Scandal

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mayor Richard Riordan recommended today that Los Angeles
spend its share of the national tobacco settlement -- up to $300 million -- to
cover lawsuits brought by victims of the city's police corruption scandal.
Investigators say rogue cops planted evidence, made up testimony, staged crime
scenes and in some cases shot unarmed suspects. City officials have estimated
that lawsuits associated with the scandal in the police department's Rampart
Division will cost at least $125 million. The mayor said the move would
safeguard against possible cuts in city services or new taxes.

Greenspan Opposes Oil Reserve Use

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today cautioned

the soaring oil prices and tight supplies that have caused heating oil and
diesel fuel prices to skyrocket in recent weeks. He said the reserve, which
holds nearly 600 million barrels, equivalent to about 60 days of oil imports,
should be used only to counter a "serious crisis" in supply such as a total
shutdown of Middle East oil.

<HEADLINE> FTC Eyes Deeper Scrutiny of Mergers  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission said Thursday
that the agency's reviews of mergers and acquisitions are now more rigorous to
protect competition in this era of mega-deals.
</P>
<P>
	   In particular, Robert Pitofsky took aim at corporate mergers that require
spinning off or selling assets before the deal can pass muster with his agency.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have seen more frequent proposals that are so extensive and complex that
it is impossible to predict with any confidence that competition will be
restored and consumer welfare will be protected," Robert Pitofsky said in a
speech before international antitrust lawyers in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Just days ago, the commission voted 3 to 2 to block BP Amoco PLC's
acquisition of Atlantic Richfield Co., despite BP Amoco's offer to sell some of
its rights and operations in Alaska, where the company would dominate the
market. Unwilling to back down, BP Amoco is taking the FTC to court.
</P>
<P>
	   Pitofsky wouldn't discuss the case, but he said that the oil industry has
reached a stage of "moderate concentration" following three very large deals,
including British Petroleum's own $48 billion acquisition of Amoco in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Pitofsky's comments come on the heels of a blockbuster year of mergers and
acquisitions around the world. There were a total of 31,528 deals in 1999 worth
a total of $3.4 trillion, according to Thomson Financial/Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
	   To put things in perspective, the Federal Trade Commission scrutinizes less
than 4 percent of all mergers and acquisitions, and ultimately challenges about
2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the number of mergers has swelled over the past decade, so the number
of cases before the FTC has tripled.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC says it is taking a harsher stance for two main reasons. The first
is that, unlike the mergers of the 1980s, which were largely corporate raiders
looking for financial gain, today's deals are strategic and changing the
competitive landscape.
</P>
<P>
	   Secondly, federal regulators have learned that despite their efforts to
force companies to sell off operations in order to preserve competition, often
times, it doesn't work out that way.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, of the mergers that were restructured between 1990 and 1994, about
25 percent ultimately failed to protect competition, Pitofsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   "To address problems that arise in connection with restructuring
arrangements, the commission has adjusted its process modestly to take those
findings into account," he explained.
</P>
<P>
	   Pitofsky said the commission has already begun stiffening the requirements
placed on corporations that suggest spinning off assets and restructuring
companies to meet antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   "It should be clear that the burden of coming forward with adequate
restructuring proposals should be on the sponsors of the merger," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pitofsky's speech was important because the agency is "explicitly saying
what has always implicitly been their policy," said Mark Schechter, a lawyer
with Howrey, Simon, Arnold &AMP; White in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are going to look carefully to be sure, in their own minds, that
divestiture relief will be effective."
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC and the Justice Department both have antitrust authority to review
mergers. After a deal is announced, the two agencies typically consult with each
other to determine which has the best cadre of experts to evaluate that
particular case.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent years, for example, the FTC has taken the lead on oil deals, while
the Justice Department has examined phone mergers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Trade Commission asked for a second round of information on a
total of just 90 deals in fiscal 1998 and 1999. Of that total, 19 mergers were
abandoned, 23 were cleared, 38 involved restructuring, three went to court, and
seven are still pending.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the deals in the pipeline, the FTC is reviewing the mammoth $120
billion media deal between America Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc., which also
needs approval from the Federal Communications Commission.

<HEADLINE> 3 Die in Calif. Cargo Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif. (AP) -- Flight data and cockpit voice recorders were
retrieved Thursday from the wreckage of a DC-8 cargo plane that crashed into a
salvage yard, killing its three crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators hope the recorders will provide more clues about the pilot's
report of a ``center of gravity'' problem shortly after the plane's takeoff from
Mather Field in suburban Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
	   The recorders, which were damaged by fire but in fairly good shape, were
sent to Washington for analysis, said George Black of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Emery Worldwide Flight 17 plunged into the Insurance Auto Auctions yard just
before 8 p.m. Wednesday, killing its three crew members and setting dozens of
cars ablaze. The plane was bound for Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims' bodies were recovered Thursday afternoon, Black said.
</P>
<P>
	   The center of gravity problem could have several causes, including a
shifting load, incorrect cargo weight and mechanical problems, said Preston
Hicks, also of the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
	   Black said the flight recorder data could indicate weight and balance
problems from the performance of the plane. However, the report of an unsettled
load is not the sole focus of the investigation, Black said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everything is a focus,'' he said. ``We never begin with a prejudged
position.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, carrying a load of transmission fluid, clothing and a small
packet of detonators, was at 800 feet when it tried to return to Mather for an
emergency landing and crashed in a fireball about a mile east of the field.
</P>
<P>
	   Tens of thousands of small pieces from the plane are scattered among the
burned-out cars over five to six acres, Black said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``About the only thing you can recognize as part of an airplane is one
section of fuselage, about 6 to 7 feet high, maybe 15 feet long, with several
windows,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
	   One witness said the plane hit the ground belly first and was immediately
engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
	   Those aboard were dead by the time fire crews arrived at the site, said
Capt. Dan Haverty of the American River Fire Department. Firefighters were
hampered by intense flames, which burned for several hours after the crash.
Smoke was visible in the moonlit night several miles away.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no chance of rescue,'' Haverty said.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims were identified as Capt. Kevin Stables, 43, of Berlin, N.Y., who
had been with Emery for five years; First Officer George Land, 35, of
Placerville, Calif., 3 years; and Second Officer Russell Hicks, 38, Sparks,
Nev., 1 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Company spokesman James Allen said the crash was the first fatal accident in
the company's 50-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   Nobody on the ground was injured.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash set as many as 200 cars on fire, many with gas in their tanks,
causing several explosions.
</P>
<P>
	   Motorist Scott Colyn saw the plane as it approached the salvage yard ``at
eye level.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It looked like it was skipped like a stone,'' said Colyn, who saw the
crash while he was driving home. ``I looked in my rear view mirror and there
were flames everywhere, sparks and a big old mushroom cloud.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plane, carrying 62,000 pounds, was a DC-8 71, a four-engine plane
manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, Allen said. It has a capacity of 90,000
pounds, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Redwood City-based Emery Worldwide specializes in transportation services
for business shippers of heavyweight cargo.
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Oscarson, director of marketing for the Insurance Auto Auctions, said
the company has not started to estimate the damage from the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're very grateful it wasn't during an auction and that it was when the
facility was secured and no one on the ground was injured,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dobson Criticizes McCain Endorsement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- A conservative Republican leader on Thursday
criticized Gary Bauer's endorsement of Sen. John McCain for president.
</P>
<P>
	   James Dobson, leader of Focus on the Family, said McCain ``has offered no
assurances that he intends to appoint a pro-life running mate or pro-life
justices to the U.S. Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dobson, who emphasized he was speaking as a private individual and not as
president of the conservative Christian ministry, also criticized McCain on
campaign financing changes and his acceptance of support from an organization of
gay Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer, who has been an ally of Dobson, quit the presidential race two weeks
ago. On Wednesday, he endorsed McCain, describing the senator as the GOP's
``best shot'' at winning the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Dobson said his statement doesn't imply that he endorses any other
presidential candidate.

Jewish Demonstrators Urge Canada To Watch Austria's Haider
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Moshe Krause joined about 75 Jewish demonstrators outside the
Austrian Embassy on Thursday and urged the world to closely watch Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has all the symptoms of a Nazi,'' Krause, 77, said of Haider, leader of
Austria's right-wing Freedom party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I lost all my family in the Holocaust and I don't want to lose more,''
said Krause, who survived two years in Germany's Bergen-Belsen concentration
camp.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100 of his relatives didn't make it, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We rebuilt and we would like to go on.''
</P>
<P>
	   The protest marked the second day of a mysterious visit to Canada which
Haider, accused by critics of intolerance and extremism, has said is simply
``personal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Haider was in Montreal on Wednesday. He remarked to reporters that things
would be more interesting in Toronto but on Thursday boarded a flight to
Amsterdam at Montreal's Dorval airport.
Aboriginal Group Cites More Allegations of Police Abuse
</P>
<P>
	   SASKATOON, Saskatchewan (AP) -- Saskatchewan's biggest aboriginal group says
it's getting more reports of police abuse in the wake of allegations that
Saskatoon officers may have been involved in the deaths of two native men.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations said it received several calls
Thursday from across the province.
</P>
<P>
	   The calls follow the deaths of two aboriginal men found frozen on the
outskirts of Saskatoon and claims that a third man was driven out of town by
police and forced to walk home as punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are coming out to us and saying, `You should be aware that two
years ago this same thing happened to me,''' said Darcy McKenzie, a federation
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not isolated. This happened not only in Saskatoon, it's happened
... all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 4., Darrell Night complained to police that two officers had driven
him to the power plant, taken his coat and left him in sub-zero temperatures.
</P>
<P>
	   RCMP spokesman Sgt. Rick Wychreschuk said he hasn't heard of any further
complaints against police but promised the force will act on all leads.
Five Winnipeg Police Service Employees Under Investigation

<P>
	   WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- A suspect has been charged and five employees of
the Winnipeg Police Service are being investigated after two women were found
dead in their home more than two hours after the women called 911.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested William John Dunlop about 12 hours after they found the
bodies of Corrine McKeowen, 52 and Doreen Leclair, 51. They didn't explain the
relationship with the victims but said it was a domestic crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have said the call was about a man who was violating a court order,
but they would not say if the suspect was the subject of the order.
</P>
<P>
	   Dunlop, 30, has been charged with two counts of second-degree murder.

Audit Faults System of Awarding Film Grants
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- An internal audit of how the government gives out grants and
tax breaks to the film industry says the system lacks some of the proper
mechanisms to prevent fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   The review, released Thursday by the Heritage Department, looked at four
federal bodies: the Canadian Audio-Visual Certification Office (CAVCO), the
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, the Canadian Television Fund, and Telefilm
Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Heritage Minister Sheila Copps ordered the audit last December after
allegations were raised that some producers were cheating the system to qualify
for tax credits.
</P>
<P>
	   The report highlights several weaknesses within CAVCO, the body that
evaluates whether a project is eligible for tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, there is no audit process in place to evaluate whether projects
that received the tax breaks actually complied with federal guidelines after
they received the money.
</P>
<P>
	   There is also no independent body that would study applications to CAVCO and
point out the potential risks for fraud or business failure.
Meningitis Child Vaccination Program Expanded
</P>
<P>
	   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Bowing to public pressure, health authorities
announced Thursday they will vaccinate another 200,000 children in the Edmonton
region against meningitis over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Public health nurses have already been busy this week giving shots to about
65,000 students between the ages of 15 and 19 in Edmonton and surrounding areas,
following the recent deaths of two teen-agers from the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   But public concern about other age groups has prompted authorities to expand
the free vaccination program to include children from two to 14 years old.
</P>
<P>
	   The move does not mean the risk is higher for the younger age groups than
before, stressed Dr. Gerry Predy, medical health officer for the Capital Health
Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Health officials said they still consider teens between the ages of 15 and
19 to be most vulnerable to the disease.
Consumer-Friendly Airline Legislation Implemented
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- New consumer laws to prevent price gouging by a dominant Air
Canada took flight Thursday, but there are concerns they may not soar as high as

</P>
<P>
	   And if new domestic competitors don't appear in the next few years, Ottawa
may open Canadian skies to foreign carriers, Transport Minister David Collenette
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we have to let the Americans in -- if that's the only way that we can
get competition -- then we'll let the Americans in,'' Collenette said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The long-awaited legislation threatens huge fines and jail terms for
uncompetitive behavior by Air Canada, which now controls 80 per cent of domestic
skies.
Alberta Premier Ralph Klein Lashes Out at Health Care Critics
</P>
<P>
	   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- The Alberta government got back to business
Thursday as Premier Ralph Klein lashed out at healthcare critics who say he is
staining the Maple Leaf by pushing plans to extend private, for-profit health
care.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've done a lot of things in this province that are deemed to be
un-Canadian,'' Klein told reporters just before Lt.-Gov. Lois Hole read the
speech from the throne to launch the spring session of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   Klein said he's been labeled a traitor in the past for privatizing liquor
stores and license registries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I mean, my God, Canadians really expect to take an afternoon off work and
line up at a motor vehicles branch and take a number,'' he said tongue in cheek.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've undertaken a lot of changes and I'm proud of those changes because
we've created a society and an economy in this province that is now
sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
	   His Conservative government will introduce a bill next month to expand the
types of surgeries for-profit doctors can do to allow for overnight patient
stays. Right now only day surgery procedures like cataracts are allowed outside
of public hospitals.
</P>
<P>
	   Klein wants to do it to reduce long waiting lists for procedures such as hip
replacements.
</P>
<P>
	   The work will be paid for by medicare and no one would get to jump ahead in
line by paying more.

<HEADLINE> 'Charitable immunity' may limit damages in any Seton Hall fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Survivors of a fire that killed three Seton Hall
University students and relatives of those who died in the blaze may find it
difficult to win lawsuits against the college because of a legal doctrine
limiting liability for such institutions.
<P>
	   The doctrine of "charitable immunity" sharply limits the amount of damages
that can be assessed in lawsuits against educational and religious institutions
on the theory that they have limited funding and might not be able to survive a
costly court judgment.
</P>
<P>
	   And although no lawsuits have yet been filed against Seton Hall in
connection with the Jan. 19 fire that killed three freshmen in a dormitory,
several New Jersey personal injury lawyers said such litigation is inevitable.
They said they expect Seton Hall to invoke the charitable immunity doctrine in
any such lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   "The lawyers for Seton Hall will no doubt be taking a hard look at a
charitable immunity defense," Morristown attorney Stephen Weinstein told The
Star-Ledger of Newark in Thursday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   University spokeswoman Laurie Pine said Seton Hall would not comment on
possible litigation or any defense tactics it might employ.
</P>
<P>
	   Weinstein noted that a state appeals court reaffirmed Seton Hall's
charitable immunity status when it dismissed a suit by a student who suffered a
fall on campus.
</P>
<P>
	   "It involved a case of a student slipping in a puddle of water in what was
then a university-run pub on the campus," Weinstein said. "The appeals court
held that Seton Hall has immunity and the case was dismissed. The immunity was
extended, mind you, to cover activities at a campus pub."
</P>
<P>
	   Weinstein said applying the immunity doctrine to a student dormitory should
be an easier legal maneuver.
</P>
<P>
	   But he and other lawyers, including Harrison J. Gordon of West Orange,
cautioned that charitable immunity does not always offer absolute protection
from court judgments.
</P>
<P>
	   "It only shields them for what is known as ordinary negligence," Gordon
said. "In the event of gross negligence, a carelessness and negligence above the
usual, they could be held liable."
</P>
<P>
	   He said a jury could find the lack of sprinklers in Boland Hall, where the
fire broke out, constituted gross negligence. Seton Hall has since begun
installing sprinklers in all its dorms, and upgrading existing systems.
</P>
<P>
	   But not all schools are covered by the doctrine. In a related move, two
Superior Court judges on Wednesday ruled that the charitable immunity doctrine
does not extend to New Jersey's public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruling in the case of a student from the Clearview school district in
Gloucester County who left school grounds in February 1994 with an unlicensed,
underage driver and was severely injured in an automobile accident, the judges
rejected applying the immunity doctrine to public schools.

expensive consequences.

	   "It means that a school board will be exposed to runaway verdicts,"

<HEADLINE> US Promotes E-Commerce in Argentina  </HEADLINE>
   By BILL CORMIER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley on
Thursday voiced concern over Argentina's safeguards of intellectual property
rights while on a four-nation trip to promote e-commerce and U.S. business
abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our U.S. companies are truly concerned about their intellectual property
investments and that they be truly protected,'' Daley told a business leaders'
breakfast here.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. authorities perceive Argentine protections for patents and property
rights as inadequate -- an issue that came up during a meeting Thursday with
President Fernando De la Rua, Daley said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it was also in Argentina's interest to defend its own intellectual
property rights. ``Intellectual property is as important to Argentine companies
as to U.S. businesses.''
</P>
<P>
	   For years, U.S. drug companies have complained that protection of
intellectual property rights in Argentina is among the world's weakest, along
with Egypt and India.
</P>
<P>
	   This week Argentine congressional leaders began reviewing patent and
trademark protections, including regulation of the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Daley was on a four-nation tour of South America. He has visited Brazil and
Uruguay, and on Thursday was to leave Argentina for Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   He brought along 19 companies, including AT&AMP;T, which does $2.7 billion in
business in Latin America, and CMS Energy, which built a 600-mile natural gas
pipeline from northern Argentine to Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The business people with me see the long-term potential of this region,''
Daley said. ``They know not only that the economies will be growing again, but
that within five years, this hemisphere will be a Free Trade Area of the
Americas.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Free Trade Area would unite 34 democracies -- nearly 1 billion people --
in the world's single largest trade zone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Negotiations in this hemisphere are well on their way to be completed by
the 2005 deadline,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Deal Expected on Nazi Compensation  </HEADLINE>
   By COLLEEN BARRY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- Racing against time to compensate aging survivors of the
Nazis' slave and forced labor regime, U.S. and German envoys said significant
progress was made Thursday on how to divide $5 billion pledged for a
compensation fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief German negotiator Otto Lambsdorff and U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Stuart Eizenstat expressed confidence that a deal will be reached on how to
broadly allocate the funds during talks in Washington March 7-8. Both men
emphasized an atmosphere of flexibility in the talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are on the bring of achieving something truly historic,'' Eizenstat
said. ``Everyone agreed on the need to accelerate the discussions, recognizing
the urgency of the situation, namely that elderly survivors should not continue
to be made to wait for the dignified payments they so deserve.''
</P>
<P>
	   Estimates of the number of people who could benefit from the fund run to as
many as 2.3 million people, mostly non-Jews from eastern Europe. Eizenstat noted
that eligible survivors were dying at a rate of 1 percent a month.
</P>
<P>
	   German industry and the government agreed in December to contribute equal
shares to the $5-billion fund to compensate long-forgotten Nazi victims. Though
the agreement was hailed as a breakthrough, negotiations to actually launch the
project have been painstaking.
</P>
<P>
	   Eizenstat said that for the first time Thursday all parties presented
recommendations for how the money should be divided among three broad
categories: forced and slave laborers, people whose property was confiscated by
the Nazis and to establish a fund for academic and humanitarian projects
relating to the Nazis. What remains open is the proportion of the total assigned
to each category.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is quite an accomplishment,'' Eizenstat said. ``The proposals were
not that far apart ... Through the discussions we were able to further narrow
our differences so we are now within striking distances of an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
	   All sides agreed that the bulk of the fund will be reserved for compensating
forced and slave laborers.
</P>
<P>
	   But Eizenstat said disagreements still remained about how to divide the fund
among forced laborers -- those deported from their home countries to work in
factories in Germany -- and slave laborers, those held under ``work to death''
conditions in concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
	   The German government is recommending that $3.85 billion be reserved for
slave and forced laborers, $500 million be used to compensate people whose
property was seized by the Nazis and an equal sum for future academic and
humanitarian projects and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
	   The balance, some $150 million, would cover administrative costs and
lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
	   The eastern and central European governments that are in the talks have
generally accepted the entire fund won't be used for compensating forced
laborers, however they have expressed concern about the size of the fund for
academic and humanitarian projects.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter released Wednesday, the governments of Belarus, Poland, Russia,
Ukraine and the Czech Republic warned U.S. and German envoys that money must not
be taken away from the remaining $4.5 billion for other claims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any decrease in that amount would mean that the payments to slave and
forced laborers would become even less than symbolic or that some categories of
victims would have to be excluded from payments,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   German negotiators rejected a proposal Thursday to reduce the academic and
humanitarian project allocation to $50 million.

<HEADLINE> Panel Passes Affirmative Action Ban  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID MARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The State University System's Board of Regents on
Thursday approved rules eliminating race and gender as considerations for
college admissions at Florida's 10 public universities.
</P>
<P>
	   The 14-member panel voted 12-0 in favor of Gov. Jeb Bush's One Florida plan,
which ends racial and gender preferences in admissions to state universities and
in granting state contracts. Two members were not present for the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush contends the plan will enhance diversity by increasing outreach efforts
and by admitting the top 20 percent of each high school senior class into state
universities.
</P>
<P>
	   About 500 college students, elected officials and others came from around
the state to the Regents' meeting at the University of Central Florida. Many
said the One Florida plan would result in fewer minorities attending state
universities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This plan looks very good on paper,'' said student Telisha Terry, 21.
``But if you really think about it, the top 20 percent of students go to college
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
	   Florida is not the first state to take on preference programs. The
University of California system did away with affirmative action beginning with
the undergraduate class that entered in 1998. After a federal court ruling,
Texas ended racial preferences at state schools beginning with students applying
to enter in the fall of 1997. Washington state voters banned race and gender
criteria in admissions starting in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Corrine Brown said the governor and state officials could not be
trusted to oversee a system admitting enough minority students.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We do not live in a colorblind society. Race is still a factor,'' said
Brown, a Democrat from Jacksonville. ``I'm very disappointed with what's going
on in Florida, and it's an example of the ugly side of politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the regents approved a system to admit students who do not meet
minimum admission criteria by using a ``student profile assessment'', which
considers factors like socioeconomic status, whether a student's parents went to
college, and whether a high school is low performing.
</P>
<P>
	   The board also approved a change to the rules eliminating the use of race,
national origin and gender as consideration as admissions decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   The rule changes could not take effect without the Regents' approval. They
must still go before the governor and independently elected Cabinet, which is to
consider the matter Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The regents' decision to implement One Florida will allow our state to
move forward in a system of higher education that embraces diversity and
fundamental fairness for all,'' Gov. Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday's session grew heated with the comments of Frank Williams, a Tampa
minister.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You say Bush, I say 'Heil Hitler','' Williams shouted. ``He is nothing but
a dictator, and I guarantee we as a people in America will not stand for a
dictator in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
	   That raised the ire of Regent Steven Uhlfelder.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For you to compare this governor to Hitler it totally irresponsible, and
I'm not going to sit here and listen to that,'' Uhlfelder replied.
</P>
<P>
	   A few people spoke in favor of the rule changes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We should not cling to policies that are not based on merit,'' said Dennis
Freytes, a trustee of Orlando's Valencia Community College. ``I hope you don't
let demagoguery and group politics affect your vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   And Lew Oliver, chairman of the Orange County Republican Party, said there
were more practical considerations for approving the changes -- a proposed
ballot measure by California businessman Ward Connerly to do away with all
preference programs in Florida, going much further than Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sometimes you don't have a choice,'' Oliver said of Bush's proposal.
``Sometimes you don't have a perfect option.''
</P>
<P>
	   Connerly helped pass similar ballot measures in California and Washington
state. Bush opposes the Connerly measure, and many have said the governor
offered the One Florida plan as a substitute.
</P>
<P>
	   The Florida Board of Regents was supposed to vote a month ago on the rules
changes, but the meeting was delayed after two black lawmakers staged a 25-hour
sit-in inside the governor's office suite. To get them out, Bush agreed to three
public hearings, where the plan later came under withering criticism.

<HEADLINE> McCain Likens Himself to Reagan  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain likened himself Thursday to Ronald
Reagan and Bill Clinton, two-term presidents who reached across party lines.
``If we win here, I don't see how we can be stopped,'' McCain said, hoping for a
surge of Democrats and independents in Saturday's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Two days before the South Carolina contest, national front-runner George W.
Bush kept up his case against McCain by suggesting the Arizona senator was a
hypocrite riding his ``high horse'' down a ``low road.''
</P>
<P>
	   With polls predicting a tight race, Bush's supporters fear that a defeat in
South Carolina would lead to follow-up losses in Michigan next Tuesday and in
Virginia seven days later, setting off a cataclysmic chain reaction. Even his
allies say backers in Congress and elsewhere would begin to peel away.
</P>
<P>
	   New polls out Thursday showed McCain faring as well as or better than Bush
in a match-up against Democratic front-runner Al Gore. This is bad news for
Bush, who courted victory-starved Republicans for months based on polls that
showed him besting his GOP rivals in matchups against the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a rising belief that McCain could win as well,'' said Rep. Billy
Tauzin, R-La., a Bush supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Duprey, chairman of the Republican Party in New Hampshire and neutral
in the race, said, ``If Bush loses South Carolina, it could be a mortal blow to
his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, whose financial and political standing improved dramatically after
his victory in New Hampshire, believes he can win Michigan and his home state of
Arizona, even if South Carolina goes to Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can lose here and go on,'' McCain told 300 veterans. ``But I'll tell
you what, my friends: If we win here, I don't see how we can be stopped.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said South Carolina is not do-or-die. ``I'm continuing one way or
another,'' he told reporters, acknowledging a scenario that would have been
unthinkable just a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The key will be turnout, and both campaigns are contacting thousands of
supporters in the contest's closing days. Bush is especially aggressive,
deploying the GOP establishment and conservative special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing far behind Bush among self-identified GOP voters, McCain stepped up
his appeal to independents and Democrats by promising a new political coalition
and a dedication to senior citizens, children and veterans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These things are part of an inclusive party, the party of Abraham Lincoln
and Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. That's what this is really about,'' he
said. ``So I view this campaign as sort of a seminal event for our party and
this country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Aboard his campaign bus, McCain also said Clinton has done a ``marvelous
job'' broadening the Democratic Party, and said he can do the same for the GOP.
``You can't help but admire the job President Clinton did in assembling a
coalition -- moving to attract the great center in political life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning amid the resorts of Hilton Head, Bush said McCain's high-minded
rhetoric belied a below-the-radar campaign to discredit him. He waved a McCain
flier that criticized Bush's tax-cutting plan, saying it was filled with false
information and calling it evidence of negative campaigning. It was the same
prop Bush used in Tuesday night's debate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't accept this high horse and low road attitude of Senator McCain,''
Bush said, sticking to his strategy of trying to undermine McCain's reformist
image. ``I am saying this is a man who says one thing and does another.''
</P>
<P>
	   The effects of the campaign began to show on both candidates. McCain
bristled aboard his campaign bus when questioned about his persistent criticisms
of Bush, and the governor was unusually terse in his news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Turn that off,'' Bush said curtly when a pager interrupted him.
</P>
<P>
	   He was in better spirits later in the day, when 1,500 people showed up in
Litchfield for a question-and-answer session. One woman asked why so many GOP
leaders back him, not McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're sick and tired ... of the people who simply talk the talk,'' Bush
said, digging at McCain. ``They're interested in having a leader who knows how
to walk the walk.''
</P>
<P>
	   Behind the scenes, McCain's staff appeared upbeat, happy to be within
striking distance of Bush. The governor's advisers were clearly more tense,
perhaps because they have more to lose.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is getting help from all quarters of the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
	   Adjutant General Stan Spears, commander of the South Carolina National
Guard, signed a glowing letter of endorsement for distribution by the Bush
campaign. Without naming McCain, it also implied that the Arizonan would
sacrifice his principles to impress the media.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he was shocked that a military commander would engage in
political activity.
</P>
<P>
	   Spears said in a telephone interview that he is an elected official, not
bound by rules against political activity that federal employees in the Guard
must abide by. ``I don't answer to anybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   E-mails are being circulated in the Asian-American community criticizing
McCain for calling Asians ``gooks.'' The former Vietnam prisoner of war said he
has used the term for his prison guards.
</P>
<P>
	   There also are taped phone calls going out from Bush, his wife, Laura, and
Sen. Strom Thurmond. Letters have been sent out signed by former presidential
candidate Elizabeth Dole and by Bush's mother, Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   With fewer resources, McCain is relying on volunteer phone banks aiming at
150,000 supporters, including veterans and independents. The campaign also is
having taped messages from Gary Bauer, the former GOP rival who endorsed McCain
this week, phoned into the homes of conservative voters. Bauer's also doing
Christian radio interviews on McCain's behalf.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Denies Concession Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By TED BRIDIS AP Technology Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft forcefully denied a published report late
Thursday that billionaire chairman Bill Gates offered a key concession to settle
his company's historic antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Bloomberg News said it did a television interview with Gates and moments
later asked him whether he would disclose the secret blueprints for the Windows
operating system to competitors to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes, if that's all it took," Gates said, according to Bloomberg. It said
Gates did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   A Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, vigorously denied the report. Gates has
previously rejected any suggestion that Microsoft share the so-called source
code to its flagship product, which has earned the company billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've talked to Bill, and Bill said he never said that," Cullinan said.
"That issue is not even related to this case. All he said was we would try to do
our best to settle this case."
</P>
<P>
	   Bloomberg, a business-oriented news service, said its story was accurate.
</P>
<P>
	   "We stand by our story," Editor-in-Chief Matthew Winkler said. "He was asked
specifically, and the answer that he gave was yes."
</P>
<P>
	   Winkler said Gates' response came after the televised interview and was not
captured on video or audio tape.
</P>
<P>
	   During the interview, Bloomberg asked Gates whether Microsoft would consider
opening the source code, and Gates appeared to rule out the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not holding back any information," Gates said, according to a
transcript supplied by Microsoft. "In order to have the great reliability that
we promise with Windows, you can't have all these variant versions where
somebody has gone and tinkered with source code here and tinkered with source
code there."
</P>
<P>
	   A Justice Department lawyer in the case declined to comment on Bloomberg's
report. Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, one of the 19 state
officials suing the company along with Justice, also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute comes just days before the landmark trial resumes. The next
round of courtroom arguments was set for Tuesday, when lawyers will argue about
which specific antitrust laws the company violated, if any.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found in November that Microsoft
was a monopoly that had abused its influence in the technology industry. The
company's Windows software runs most of the world's personal computers.
</P>
<P>
	   Settlement talks are continuing in Chicago under the guidance of a federal
appeals judge, Richard Posner, who has agreed to serve as mediator. The sides
are under strict orders not to discuss the talks, but settlement is considered
highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft has previously rejected any suggestion that it disclose the
Windows blueprints to competitors, one of the remedies against the company that
the government has considered.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked specifically about the prospect of opening Windows source code, Gates
told Time magazine last November: "The only thing we know for sure would be bad
for consumers is anything that blocks us from being able to innovate Windows or
anything that made it so that when people buy Windows they don't know what's in
it."

<HEADLINE> Judge Upholds Anti-swearing Law  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN FLESHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STANDISH, Mich. (AP) -- A judge Thursday upheld the conviction of a man who
cursed in front of children after falling out of a canoe, ruling that Michigan's
102-year-old anti-swearing law is constitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   A district court jury last summer convicted Timothy Boomer, a 26-year-old
computer programmer, of violating the ban when he let loose with a stream of
profanities. He was fined $75 and ordered to work four days in a child-care
program. The sentence was deferred while the case was appealed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every noise or utterance does not constitute protected free speech that
falls within the ... First Amendment,'' Arenac County Judge Ronald Bergeron
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing
Boomer, said they expected to appeal the latest ruling. They contend Boomer's
freedom of speech was violated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the First Amendment means anything, it means people may speak their
minds, even walking down the street or canoeing up the river,'' said Michael
Steinberg, legal director for the ACLU in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   Bergeron ordered the matter returned to district court for a decision on
whether to continue delaying Boomer's sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Boomer did not immediately return a phone message Thursday. He has said that
his words have been exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
	   A sheriff's deputy said he heard Boomer explode in a three-minute barrage of
profanity after the mishap on the Rifle River last August. A woman and her two
young children were nearby.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Needs Victories Soon  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- For Al Gore, it's not enough to be far ahead of Bill
Bradley in the polls. The vice president, piling up endorsements from
abortion-rights, gay-rights and labor groups, is bent on not just beating his
rival but burying him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All I'm concentrating on is pouring the gas on ... and making sure that I
drive the message home,'' Gore said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Talking tough, he has called Bradley a ``special agent'' for the Republicans
and charged him with one of the worst sins a Democrat could commit: trying to
``starve Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was sounding philosophical Thursday, addressing high school and
college athletes in Providence, R.I.: ``When you encounter those moments in life
that are tough, those moments are not like a hammer hitting a clay pot,
shattering it, but like a hammer hitting metal, tempering it and making it
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he knows he needs real victories, and soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I clearly have to win a number of states on March 7 and 14, no question
about that,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   He told reporters in Boston that Gore could expect a two-week ``bump'' in
support from the vice president's Feb. 1 victory in New Hampshire, and ``now
we're in the third week.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is concentrating on the Northeast, where he is strongest, and on
California, where he is 40 percent behind in public opinion polls. His forays to
Washington state, which holds a primary on Feb. 29 but does not elect delegates
until March 7, suggest he's bidding for an invigorating, symbolic victory there.
</P>
<P>
	   One of his top New York supporters, former Mayor Ed Koch, said Bradley has
lost the intensity he needs to win the Democratic nomination and must win the
state on March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he doesn't win New York, he's finished, so I hope he wins New York,''
Koch said Thursday in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Acknowledging Gore's lead, Bradley said, ``I don't think it's impossible to
overcome when the public focuses again.'' To try and command that focus,
campaign strategist Anita Dunn promised sharper ads raising questions about
Gore's record -- on abortion and gun control, for example.
</P>
<P>
	   But, in the abortion ad he began airing Thursday in Michigan, Ohio, Maryland
and Washington, Bradley mentions only his own consistently pro-abortion-rights
record.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Gore, top-heavy with Democratic Party support but anxious for
insulation, has wrangled endorsements from the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League and the gay-rights Human Rights Campaign --
two groups that had planned to remain neutral in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm campaigning as if I'm one vote behind,'' Gore said Thursday. Asked
this week how often he would be back campaigning in New York, Gore cracked that
the better question was: ``How often am I going to leave?''
</P>
<P>
	   New York, where Bradley was a pro basketball star with the Knicks, was a
neck-and-neck race one month ago. The latest poll, on Feb. 10, put Gore ahead
56-32.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's hard to make a souffle rise twice,'' Democratic consultant Bill
Carrick observed. And getting Democrats to take a second look will be tough for
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Nick Record, a 21-year-old University of Rochester student leaning toward
Gore, told a reporter this week all he knows about Bradley: ``He used to play
for the Knicks and he's not so much for education.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Don't know anything about him. Never have,'' said New Orleans electrical
worker Eddie Cordes.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from personal feelings -- confidants on both sides make clear that
Gore thinks Bradley arrogant; to Bradley, Gore is a liar who ``made my blood
boil'' -- practical considerations drive Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Having used up millions of dollars early last year on a campaign that even
he now regards as a waste, Gore cannot afford a war of attrition.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley can: He has $2 million more in the bank than Gore and has already
made some $3 million in commitments to California TV ad time that Gore won't
match.
</P>
<P>
	   Recognizing that most Americans still see Gore as President Clinton's No. 2,
the vice president's advisers say blowout victories on March 7 and again on
March 14 would show him as a winner in his own right.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A national fight is good for Al Gore. It increases his credentials with
the American people and shows him as a fighter. That's the image that's
important,'' said campaign chairman Tony Coelho, hastening to add, ``It's the
reality, too, of course.''
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic consultant David Doak warned there is such a thing as overkill.
</P>
<P>
	   Doak was in the San Jose convention center last weekend, when Gore railed
against Bradley as a Republican agent, not a ``real Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only effect that speech would have is to cause Bradley to pick up the
phone to his media person and say, 'Take off the Michael Jordan endorsement spot
and put up the Buddhist temple ad,''' Doak said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The last thing he needs is to give Bradley, with his $20 million, an
excuse to go negative in TV ads.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Mixed in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar edged higher against the yen early Friday amid
expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board may raise interest rates.
Japanese stocks were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 110.40 yen, up 0.26 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but
below its late New York level of 110.59 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 14.82 points, or 0.07
percent, to 19,776.58 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Thursday,
the average closed up 192.22 points, or 0.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar is expected to keep its recent
bullish tone, as some players interpreted Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's remarks
Thursday as indication that the Fed may raise interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
	   Higher interest rates tend to make a nation's currency more attractive to
investors as interest-bearing securities yield higher returns.
</P>
<P>
	   In his congressional testimony, Greenspan said he remained cautious that
employers seeking scarce workers may offer higher wages and benefits, increased
costs that could lead to a sharp runup in product prices.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior official of Japan's Finance Ministry, however, said the yen may
still recover against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   "Taking a wide view, the trend of yen strengthening hasn't changed," Zembei
Mizoguchi, the head of the ministry's international bureau, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 109.34 yen, up from 108.73 yen
late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices started little changed Friday with investors
focusing on adjusting their positions ahead of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's basically a mixed market," said Masaaki Higashida, general manager of
investment information at Nomura Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.84 points, or 0.4
percent, to 10,514.57 at Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 1.98 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,719.09 points. The TOPIX
closed up 25.99 points, or 1.54 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was unquoted in
early trading. On Thursday, it settled at 1.8500 percent and its priced stood at
98.72. (km-dj)

<HEADLINE> Trial Begins in L.A. Shootout Case  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Three years after bank robbers in body armor shot it out
with police in the streets with automatic weapons, a federal jury began hearing
arguments Thursday on whether officers let one wounded gunman bleed to death.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Stephen Yagman, who brought a civil rights lawsuit on behalf of the
gunman's children, acknowledged in his opening statement that Emil Matasareanu
``did a very bad thing. He robbed a bank and shot a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Matasareanu ``was shot and left to bleed to death on the ground,'' the
lawyer said. ``He bled to death from a nonfatal wound that was survivable.''
</P>
<P>
	   The children are seeking unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
	   An officer who stood guard over the dying robber told the U.S. District
Court jury that he initially canceled an ambulance call in a situation that was
tense and fearful.
</P>
<P>
	   John Futrell, now retired, said he radioed that an ambulance should not come
to rescue Emil Matasareanu, but later made two calls trying to get an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
	   Futrell also testified that he was convinced at the time that there were at
least four suspects in the robbery and that at least two of them were at large
in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Was that a scene where you felt in danger and tense?'' asked Yagman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Definitely,'' said the ex-officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Under questioning by his own attorney, Futrell described a chaotic scene.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was a frantic voice screaming on the radio. There were numerous
officers and citizens down and where are the ambulances?'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is revisiting one of the city's most violent crimes, a Feb. 28,
1997, North Hollywood bank robbery that turned into a 44-minute shootout in
which both robbers died, 11 officers were wounded and a half-dozen civilians
were hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Matasareanu, 30, and Larry Eugene Phillips Jr., 26, wore full body armor and
fired more than 1,200 rounds from automatic weapons in a shootout with officers
who were mostly armed with handguns. Officers had to reload by snatching rifles
from a sporting goods store nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   The shootout prompted the Police Department months later to acquire more
powerful guns.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips died when he shot himself at the same time a police bullet struck
his head. Matasareanu was finally brought down in a close-quarters firefight
with officers in the middle of a street.
</P>
<P>
	   The city has contended that paramedics were needed elsewhere and that there
was fear that the dying gunman might be booby-trapped.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys representing the city of Los Angeles and the officers named in the
lawsuit told the jury there were attempts to get help for the wounded man. But
they also claimed that he resisted treatment and that his wounds were not
survivable.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant City Attorney Don Vincent said Matasareanu had been shot 29 times
and argued that contrary to the plaintiffs' claims that he lay bleeding to death
for a half-hour, he probably died much earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley Gage, an attorney for Futrell, told the jury that if there was a
delay in getting treatment for the dying man, ``the delay in medical treatment
came because of the shootout and the brutality of the bank robbery.''

Audit: HMOs Selling at Big Discounts
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal investigators have concluded pharmaceutical
companies sold a drug to two HMOs for 34 percent less than what Medicaid
programs pay, circumventing federal rules intended to ensure the government is
offered the same prices as other customers. The Department of Health and Human
Services' inspector general found that Medicaid programs would have saved $27.8
million if offered the same prices that the HMOs paid. The names of the drug
company and the HMOs have not been specified. Inspector general June Gibbs
Brownsaid that drug companies may have adjusted prices for as many as 175 drugs.

to visiting Pakistan and offered to help mediate the volatile Kashmir dispute.
But Clinton's willingness may be academic. India never has accepted outside

Mexico School Reopening Disrupted
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The gradual return of normal academic life to Mexico's
largest university after a prolonged strike was partially disrupted today by
die-hard strikers in several faculties and schools. Temporary blockades were
reported at the Social Work and Social Science faculties, while a
university-affiliated high school was occupied overnight, and radical students
demanded assemblies to discuss possible occupations in several other facilities.
Strikers had occupied UNAM from April 20 until Feb. 6, when they were ousted by
a dawn police raid in which hundreds were arrested. The strike, which forced
withdrawal of a proposed hike in annual tuition from a token few cents to the
equivalent $140, expanded into a vague protest movement.

Flaw Found in Mars Lander's Design

<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A flaw in the design of NASA's Mars Polar Lander
could have caused its engines to cut off prematurely while the $165 million
spacecraft was descending to the surface, engineers said today. The glitch is
the latest of several possibilities under investigation into why the spacecraft
has not made contact since Dec. 3, when it was to have gently landed to begin a
90-day mission to study Mars' climate history. Other scenarios include the
possibility that the spacecraft landed on the steep side of a canyon and toppled
over, or that its radios broke down. It was not known if any have been ruled
out.

returns they did themselves so far this year compared with 1999, a factor in the
overall 10 percent e-filing increase reported by the Internal Revenue Service
today. Through Feb. 11, 1.2 million taxpayers had done their own tax returns --
usually with tax preparation computer software or an Internet-based service --
and zapped them via the World Wide Web to the IRS. That's already half the 1999
total and a 98 percent increase over the same period last year.

Elliott; Rudd Win Qualifying Races
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- With no caution flags and just one pass for the
lead, the 100 laps of racing at the Daytona 500 qualifying races offered little
drama today. "That's the worst racing I've seen at Daytona in a long time," said
seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt, the 1998 Daytona 500 winner.
Bill Elliott, a two-time Daytona 500 winner who had not won any kind of race
since the Southern 500 in 1994, was never challenged in the first of two
125-mile qualifiers. From the outside of the front row, he passed Dale Jarrett
at the very start and led a three-Ford breakaway, easily finishing ahead of
Jarrett and Rusty Wallace.

<HEADLINE> Cheese Ad Puts NC Race in Limelight  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL NOWELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- A TV ad touting ``the power of cheese'' in a
make-believe campaign between candidates Taylor and Hayes is having a real
impact in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because there really is a congressional race featuring a Taylor and
Hayes here.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My jaw almost hit the floor the first time I saw it,'' said Mike Taylor, a
Democrat running against Republican Rep. Robin Hayes in the state's 8th
Congressional District. ``In my wildest imagination I could never dream this
up.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the American Dairy Association ad, presidential candidate John Hayes
spurns a piece of cheese, and his jubilant opponent, Peter Taylor, is acclaimed
for announcing he loves cheese.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't walk down the street without someone asking me if I still love
cheese,'' the real-life Taylor said. ``People ask me about it in the grocery
store.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hayes says he loves cheese, too, but doesn't watch a lot of TV. He learned
about the ad from a friend.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's humorous and kind of fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad, created by the Chicago advertising firm DDB Worldwide, shows voters
protesting and derisively refusing to shake the hand of fictional candidate
Hayes. Bob Dole even weighs in, saying, ``Bob Dole thinks he's a doofus.''
</P>
<P>
	   Fictional rival Taylor jumps on the cheese bandwagon. ``Unlike my opponent,
I love cheese!'' he says as camera flashes pop.
</P>
<P>
	   As the lights go out in a quiet Hayes campaign office, the announcer
intones: ``Ah, the power of cheese!''
</P>
<P>
	   The real-life Hayes said he likes the ad, but dislikes Dole's cameo because
Dole campaigned for him two years ago when Hayes beat Taylor by a slim margin.
He said Elizabeth Dole's family, who are from nearby Salisbury, and his have
been friends for years.
</P>
<P>
	   Adam Glickman, the ad's art director, said he was unaware of the real-life
Hayes-Taylor race until after the ad aired. He said he even previewed it with
Dole, who said nothing about the connection.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor is thrilled with all the attention the ad has attracted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's an old saying about lawyers and politicians,'' Taylor said.
``Write what you want about me but spell my name right. Sure, getting my name
out there is helpful.''
</P>
<P>
	   Until Hayes' election in 1998, the 8th District was considered a Democratic
district. Now, Democrats are hoping Taylor can win the district back for them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I guess we'll find out who the big cheese is this fall,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hayes countered: ``It's going to be a winning race for Hayes, the guy who is
the original cheese head.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Denies Concession Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By TED BRIDIS AP Technology Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft forcefully denied a news report Thursday that
billionaire chairman Bill Gates offered a key concession to settle his company's
historic antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Bloomberg News said it did a television interview with Gates and moments
after it finished asked whether he would disclose the secret blueprints for the
Windows operating system to competitors to settle the case.
</P>
<P>
	   "Yes, if that's all it took," Gates said, according to Bloomberg. It said
Gates did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   A Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, vigorously denied the report. Gates has
previously rejected any suggestion that Microsoft share the so-called source
code to its flagship product, which has earned the company billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've talked to Bill, and Bill said he never said that," Cullinan said.
"That issue is not even related to this case. All he said was we would try to do
our best to settle this case."
</P>
<P>
	   Bloomberg, a business-oriented news service, said its story was accurate.
</P>
<P>
	   "We stand by our story," Editor-in-Chief Matthew Winkler said. "He was asked
specifically, and the answer that he gave was yes."
</P>
<P>
	   Winkler said Gates' response came after the televised interview and was not
captured on video or audio tape.
</P>
<P>
	   During the interview, Bloomberg asked Gates whether Microsoft would consider
opening the source code, and Gates appeared to rule out the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not holding back any information," Gates said, according to a
transcript supplied by Microsoft. "In order to have the great reliability that
we promise with Windows, you can't have all these variant versions where
somebody has gone and tinkered with source code here and tinkered with source
code there."
</P>
<P>
	   A Justice Department lawyer in the case declined to comment on Bloomberg's
report. Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, one of the 19 state
officials suing the company along with Justice, also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Microsoft rejected in e-mail sent to Congress any plans
to break the company into pieces as the "worst kind of regulation."
</P>
<P>
	   The message, sent Wednesday by one of its lobbyists in Washington, predicted
that a breakup "would end up being the most onerous type of regulatory remedy."
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft's e-mail also said the company was "serious about trying to settle
this case, and we believe a common-sense settlement should be possible."
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute comes just days before the landmark trial resumes. The next
round of courtroom arguments was set for Tuesday, when lawyers will argue about
which specific antitrust laws the company violated, if any.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson found in November that Microsoft
was a monopoly that had abused its influence in the technology industry. The
company's Windows software runs most of the world's personal computers.
</P>
<P>
	   Settlement talks are continuing in Chicago under the guidance of a federal
appeals judge, Richard Posner, who has agreed to serve as mediator. The sides
are under strict orders not to discuss the talks, but settlement is considered
highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft has previously rejected any suggestion that it disclose the
Windows blueprints to competitors, one of the remedies against the company that
the government has considered.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked specifically about the prospect of opening Windows source code, Gates
told Time magazine last November: "The only thing we know for sure would be bad
for consumers is anything that blocks us from being able to innovate Windows or
anything that made it so that when people buy Windows they don't know what's in
it."

<HEADLINE> 6 Tons of Cocaine Seized in Pacific  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- An American naval ship intercepted a fishing boat
in the Pacific laden with six tons of cocaine, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombian Navy chief Adm. Sergio Garcia said the Colombian-flagged vessel
named ``Rebel'' was seized in international waters Wednesday, 1,530 miles
northwest of the South American country's port of Buenaventura.
</P>
<P>
	   The 66-foot vessel and its seven-member Colombian crew left the Pacific port
on Jan. 22 with the ``approximately six tons'' of cocaine hidden stashed in its
fuel compartment, Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcia attributed the seizure to enhanced anti-narcotics cooperation under a
maritime agreement between the United States and Colombia. He said the
Colombians aboard would be taken to the United States to face charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The giant drug seizure follows the opening of debate in the U.S. Congress
this week on the Clinton Administration's proposed $1.6 billion anti-narcotics
package for the South American country.
</P>
<P>
	   The aid would pay largely for military helicopters and training of new army
battalions tasked with helping police eradicate the illegal crops used to make
cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombia produces 80 percent of the global supply of cocaine and is becoming
a major heroin exporter to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Hypnosis Researcher Martin Orne Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Dr. Martin T. Orne, a psychiatrist whose work on
hypnosis helped limit its role in criminal investigations, has died of cancer.
He was 72.
</P>
<P>
	   Orne died Friday at Paoli Memorial Hospital in Paoli.
</P>
<P>
	   A longtime University of Pennsylvania researcher, Orne gained fame for his
role in two high-profile criminal cases in California in the 1970s and 1980s:
the Patricia Hearst kidnapping and bank robbery, and the Hillside Strangler
serial killings.
</P>
<P>
	   His taped therapy sessions with Anne Sexton were woven into a biography
after the 1974 suicide of the tormented Pulitzer Prize-winning poet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've lost a remarkable intellect,'' said David Dinges, director of Penn's
Unit for Experimental Psychology, which Orne founded in 1964. ``He had an
intuitive sense of what it meant to be human and how that expressed itself in
the way we behave, in our mental illnesses.''
</P>
<P>
	   As a young doctoral student at Harvard, Orne did a study that concluded that
people under hypnosis do not re-experience or relive moments from very early in
their development. Also in the 1950s came his seminal study showing that people
try to please psychologists in experiments by telling them what they think they
are looking for.
</P>
<P>
	   Orne and his wife, psychologist Emily Carota Orne, did research showing that
people's memories are altered and often tainted with falsehoods after hypnosis.
The work led courts across the nation to adopt rigorous guidelines restricting
the use of hypnosis on crime victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Orne testified that Hearst, a newspaper-fortune heiress, had essentially
been brainwashed during captivity before she robbed a San Francisco bank in
March 1976. President Carter commuted Hearst's sentence in 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1979, Orne established that Kenneth Bianchi, the prime suspect in the
killing of 10 women whose mutilated bodies were found along hillsides in
northeastern Los Angeles, was pretending to have multiple personalities to avoid
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   Orne is survived by his wife, a son, a daughter, and his brother.

   BEIJING (AP) -- China and the United States have made progress in resumed
discussions on strategic security concerns, including Taiwan, a senior U.S.
envoy said Friday as he prepared to wrap up the two-day talks.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was meeting again Friday

been excellent. Substantively, they've been very serious.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if Taiwan had been discussed, he said: ``Of course, it's a very
sensitive issue. As you know we always talk about that as well as many other
things.''
</P>
<P>
	   China's Foreign Ministry and the U.S. Embassy have refused to provide
details except to say the talks covered security issues. Earlier this week,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said China planned to raise its concerns
about U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan and joint plans to build an anti-missile
shield.
</P>
<P>
	   Beijing is worried that U.S. support for Taiwan will counter China's growing
arsenal of missiles, making it easier for the island to resist Chinese overtures
for reunification.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue has taken on added urgency because Taiwan will hold presidential
elections next month. During the island's last presidential elections in 1996,
China tested missiles off Taiwanese waters in a failed attempt to scare voters
away from Lee Teng-hui, who went on to win the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   China suspended contacts with the U.S. military and talks with Washington on
security issues, human rights and arms proliferation in anger over the bombing
of its embassy in Yugoslavia by American warplanes in May. All but the human
rights and proliferation talks have resumed in the past two months, although
Beijing still rejects Washington's explanation that the bombing was an accident.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign of the importance China places on Talbott's visit, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu said Thursday that the dialogue should be seen as a sign
of improving relations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As is known to all, China-U.S. relations have experienced rather big ups
and downs,'' Zhu said. ``Thanks to the joint efforts by the leaders of the two
countries and the two governments, China-U.S. relations have gradually moved
back to the track of restoration and development.''

<HEADLINE> Mayor: Pay Suits With Tobacco Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT JABLON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mayor Richard Riordan recommended Thursday that Los
Angeles set aside its share of the national tobacco settlement -- up to $300
million -- to cover lawsuits brought by victims of the city's police corruption
scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the best use of these dollars,'' Riordan said at a news
conference. ``Though we have no way of knowing the dollar amount, we must expect
and prepare for tens of millions of dollars of liability.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor said the move would safeguard against possible cuts in city
services or new taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Councilwoman Rita Walters said the settlement money already has
been earmarked for the city to comply with the federal Americans with
Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The tobacco money is already committed to address the issue of curb cuts
to make the streets more wheelchair accessible,'' Walters said. ``The tobacco
money, whenever it comes, in whatever amount -- which at this time is unknown --
was committed to that.''
</P>
<P>
	   City officials have estimated that lawsuits associated with the scandal in
the police department's Rampart Division will cost at least $125 million.
Lawsuits already have been filed on behalf of some men wrongly imprisoned by
police.
</P>
<P>
	   Riordan's announcement came as the scandal took on a higher profile after
months of generating little protest. Chief Bernard C. Parks appeared before the
City Council on Wednesday in his most comprehensive, public review of the
six-month investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators say rogue cops planted evidence, made up testimony, staged
crime scenes and in some cases shot unarmed suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, a judge agreed to throw out the convictions of nine more people
whose cases prosecutors say were tainted by police misconduct. The dismissals
bring to 40 the number of convictions overturned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have dozens of more cases under review,'' District Attorney Gil
Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
	   As many as 20 officers have been relieved of duty, fired, suspended or have
quit since the investigation started last fall. Police have refused to say how
many officers are still under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
	   Garcetti said he is doubling the number of prosecutors assigned to the
investigation, with a staff of 19 expected to be on board within the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Former undercover officer Rafael Perez, convicted of stealing cocaine from
an evidence locker, has detailed the corruption in his former unit and suggested
it went beyond Rampart.
</P>
<P>
	   No charges have been filed against any officers implicated in the
corruption, though police have recommended prosecuting three officers and
Garcetti has said he expects his investigation to result in charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the national $206 billion tobacco settlement, Los Angeles is to get up
to $300 million over 25 years. The money is intended to repay states, cities and
counties for health care costs associated with smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   Riordan said the city does not have a formal spending plan for the money but
it probably would have been spent on anti-smoking programs and street
improvements. His proposal requires approval from the City Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, the city would issue bonds backed by the tobacco
settlement in order to get money in a lump sum, instead of in the payment stream
over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, the state attorney general's office took a larger role in
scrutinizing the police probe, which is looking at allegations of corruption
between 1995 and 1998. The FBI has contacted Parks about its potential
involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   Council members said the community was losing confidence in the department
and criticized a command structure that allowed officers to behave criminally
for so long.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Dissident Gets Prison Leave  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Marta Beatriz Roque, one of four dissidents whose prison
sentences drew international protest last year, was granted a 24-hour leave
Thursday after other opponents worried about her health asked for her release.
</P>
<P>
	   Two others also got 24-hour leaves for unexplained reasons, their relatives
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview at her home Thursday, Roque said she must report back by 10
a.m. Friday to a military hospital, where she is undergoing medical treatment.
She said the government officials who authorized the brief leave confirmed that
her prison term of 3 1/2 years had not changed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In prison, your ideas do not change,'' she said. ``Rather, it serves
political maturity.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 54-year-old economist, first jailed in July 1997, was sentenced last
spring for inciting sedition by encouraging businessmen not to invest in Cuba
and by calling on exiles in the United States to ask their relatives on the
island to undertake acts of civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other jailed opponents, lawyer Rene Gomez Manzano and engineer Felix
Bonne, were also given 24-hour leaves, relatives said Thursday. Both men are
serving four-year sentences.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not known why the three were allowed to visit their families. The
move may be aimed at diffusing criticism by human rights activists on the island
about recent detentions of dissidents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is really strange,'' said Magaly de Armas, the wife of Vladimiro Roca,
the only one in the group who did not get a pass. ``I hope that the day that
Vladimiro leaves jail it will be for good.'' Roca is a former military fighter
pilot and son of a revered Communist Party leader. He is serving a sentence of
five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Local dissidents asked for Roque's release on humanitarian grounds in a
letter delivered Feb. 2 to Cuba's Council of State, the government body of which
Fidel Castro is president.
</P>
<P>
	   Roque suffers from a growth in her breasts which has since spread into her
armpits and arms. She reportedly has been hospitalized numerous times since her
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vatican, the European Community, Canada, the United States and others
have called for the release of the four.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Want Rapist Executed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) -- Chanting ``execution, execution,'' 3,000
Palestinians took to the streets Thursday and demanded that a man suspected of
raping a 5-year-old girl at knifepoint be put to death.
</P>
<P>
	   Gunmen fired shots into the air, and marchers carried banners reading: ``Our
children have the right to live in security.''
</P>
<P>
	   The suspect, Bilal Shuko, a 22-year-old baker's assistant, was put on trial
Thursday before a military tribunal and convicted early Friday of the rape. He
was sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   After the sentence was announced, several hundred people in the courtroom
angrily kicked furniture and chanted ``Death penalty, death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Three people have been executed in Palestinian-controlled areas in the past
six years, one for raping a child. In two dozen other cases, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat commuted a death penalty to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat's Fatah group organized Thursday's street protest and distributed
leaflets calling for Shuko's execution.
</P>
<P>
	   With an independent judiciary not firmly established, human rights groups
worry that death sentences are handed to appease the public.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What matters to the Palestinian Authority is to defuse public pressure as
soon as possible,'' said Bassem Eid, a Palestinian human rights activist.
</P>
<P>
	   Shuko was initially to be tried by a civil court, but the case was later
transferred to a military tribunal.
</P>
<P>
	   Eid and other human rights activists have said military tribunals deny
defendants the most basic rights. All death sentences handed down so far were
imposed by military tribunals.
</P>
<P>
	   Nablus police said the 5-year-old girl was raped Monday. The suspect dragged
the victim at knifepoint to a deserted house as she walked home from
kindergarten, said Col. Firas al-Emleh, head of police in Nablus.
</P>
<P>
	   The girl was hospitalized in Nablus.

<HEADLINE> Penn Health System CEO Fired  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The University of Pennsylvania fired the chief
executive of the financially ailing Penn health system on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. William N. Kelley, who also served as dean of the School of Medicine,
was dismissed by school President Judith Rodin. He will remain a faculty member.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Peter Traber, a gastroenterologist and chairman of the medical school's
Department of Medicine, was installed as interim dean and CEO until "we
undertake a thorough, formal search for permanent leadership," Rodin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodin also asked Kelley to take on an expanded role as executive vice
president for health affairs at the university. Kelley has not accepted that
position yet.
</P>
<P>
	   Traber is "an exceptional researcher and clinician whose knowledge of UPHS
is broad and deep. He has our full confidence," Rodin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Penn Health System, the Philadelphia region's second-biggest health system,
lost more than $300 million, or nearly half its cash reserves, in the last two
years under Kelley. The losses forced the largest reduction in the system's
history -- cuts of 2,800 positions, or 20 percent of its work force, by June.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts said the cuts could have been prevented if Kelley had not
chosen to expand aggressively. In the last few years, Penn bought more than 270
doctors practices and took over two ailing city hospitals, Pennsylvania Hospital
and Presbyterian Medical Center, which had to be nursed back to health at
considerable cost.
</P>
<P>
	   Kelley has blamed the system's situation on lower Medicare and Medicaid
reimbursements, reduced payments from insurance companies and rising costs of
health care technology and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
	   Within Penn, many faculty also were critical of Kelley's salary, nearly $1.3
million in 1998, more than double the $548,000 that Rodin made.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A high-ranking U.S. immigration official was arrested Thursday
and charged with spying for the Cuban government, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariano Faget, 54, was being held at the Federal Detention Center in Miami
and scheduled to appear in court Friday, the FBI said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget, a native of Havana, is employed at the Immigration and Naturalization
Service as a supervisory district adjudication officer. He held a ``secret''
security clearance and was responsible for supervising decisions that affected
immigrants and people seeking political asylum, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Faget has access to classified and sensitive INS files relating to
confidential law enforcement sources and Cuban defectors,'' the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency said he had made unauthorized contacts with Cuban intelligence
officers in Miami and in other U.S. cities.

could have caused its engines to cut off prematurely while the $165 million

the latest of several possibilities under investigation into why the spacecraft
has not made contact since Dec. 3, when it was to have gently landed to begin a
90-day mission to study Mars' climate history. Other scenarios include the
possibility that the spacecraft landed on the steep side of a canyon and toppled
over, or that its radios broke down. It was not known if any have been ruled

lead, the 100 laps of racing at the Daytona 500 qualifying races offered little
drama today. Bill Elliott, a two-time Daytona 500 winner who had not won any
kind of race since the Southern 500 in 1994, was never challenged in the first
of two 125-mile qualifiers. From the outside of the front row, he passed Dale
Jarrett at the very start and led a three-Ford breakaway, easily finishing ahead
of Jarrett and Rusty Wallace.

<HEADLINE> Gustafson, Morley Share Hawaii Lead  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN DiPIETRO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KAPOLEI, Hawaii (AP) -- The first round of the Hawaiian Ladies Open had a
distinct European feel as Sophie Gustafson of Sweden and Joanne Morley of
Britain shot 7-under-par 65s on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   They tied the tournament record for low round that was shared by 1998 champ
Wendy Ward and two others. It was the best score ever for both golfers.
</P>
<P>
	   Morley started with an eagle on the first hole when she holed a sand wedge
from 57 yards. She made a 15-foot putt for a birdie on No. 4, two-putted from
eight feet for a birdie on No. 7 and made five pars before a bogey at No. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   On 17 she holed out with a wedge after coming up about 15 feet short of the
green.
</P>
<P>
	   "I really was just thinking about getting the ball up and down for birdie,"
Morley said. "It's just good luck when it goes in."
</P>
<P>
	   Gustafson had an eagle and six birdies against one bogey. She made a 36-foot
putt for eagle on No. 17 and also birdied No. 8 with a 24-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
	   "The putts make all the difference, don't they?" Gustafson said.
</P>
<P>
	   She also missed three birdie putts, including an 8-footer on her last hole.
</P>
<P>
	   "I guess I could have gone lower, but I am really happy with a 65," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing by one stroke was Annika Sorenstam of Sweden, who won this event in
1997, and Mi Hyun Kim of South Korea, who bogeyed her last hole to drop out of a
share of the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm satisfied with my score but I had many chances to make birdies and just
couldn't," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven golfers, including Betsy King, were at 67. Two former Hawaiian Ladies
Open winners, Barb Thomas-Whitehead (1995) and Sherri Turner (1989), were in a
group at 68.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting on the back nine, Gustafson birdied the first two holes, bogeyed
No. 13 and birdied No. 15 before an eagle on the par-5 17th to put her at
4-under.
</P>
<P>
	   She moved 5-under with a birdie on No. 1, then made five straight pars
before birdies at Nos. 7 and 8.
</P>
<P>
	   Gustafson, whose best finish as a pro was second in the 1998 Women's British
Open, said her great round has her on the road to her first victory.
</P>
<P>
	   "It gives me confidence because I know my game is here this week," she said,
especially since she has had problems transferring her success in Europe to the
LPGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would be fun to start playing as well here as I have in Europe. That
would give me a lot of confidence."
</P>
<P>
	   Sorenstam, who had a hole-in-one during the pro-am on Wednesday, had six
birdies Thursday and was confident her strong play would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   "When things go your way, you get fired up," Sorenstam said. "You can hit a
bad shot and know things are going to be OK. A little luck and little confidence
is a good recipe right now."

<HEADLINE> IOC Rips Sydney Organizers  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A day after their ugly spat over sponsorships, the
boss of the Sydney Olympics and the IOC's top marketing official literally
kissed and made up.
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound blasted Sydney organizing chief Michael Knight on
Thursday for having a ``dysfunctional relationship'' with sponsors of the 2000
Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
	Pound accused Knight of ``bad-mouthing'' the most successful marketing program
in Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
	Knight replied by suggesting that Pound's broadside was part of a political
campaign to become International Olympic Committee president.
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the two sought each other out at the IOC executive board meetings
and, with television cameras rolling, Knight planted a kiss on Pound's cheek.
</P>
<P>
	``Dick needed a bit of love and attention,'' Knight said. ``I thought as a good
host it was important to give him some.''
</P>
<P>
	Said Pound: ``It certainly was the most exciting part of my day.''
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch played referee in the dispute, which made
front-page headlines in Australian papers Friday.
</P>
<P>
	``Vice president Pound is absolutely right,'' Samaranch said. ``The marketing
program in Sydney has been the best in Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
	``President Knight is also absolutely right because his aim is to raise as much
money as possible to protect the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	``I think also that I am right. The most important thing for all of us is to
ensure the full success of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, Pound criticized Knight for referring to sponsorship shortfalls
for the games.
</P>
<P>
	``Is there anything about the word `success' you don't understand?'' Pound
said. ``You can't undermine your private sector and sponsors like this.''
</P>
<P>
	Pound said the organizing committee was to blame for its budget problems
because it raised its projections for local sponsorship revenue too high.
</P>
<P>
	``The first time, we thought it was wildly optimistic,'' Pound said. ``The
second time we thought it was foolishly optimistic. The third time we knew it
was nuts and said so. We turned out to be right.''
</P>
<P>
	Knight said Friday that Pound's comments ``might not have been the most
appropriate'' but were useful in focusing attention on the importance of
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
	``Our sponsors are incredibly important to us and we value what they've done,''
Knight said.
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the IOC had full confidence in Knight, and repeated his
assertion that he expects the Sydney Games to be the best ever.
</P>
<P>
	On other issues, Samaranch said he considers the crisis stemming from the Salt
Lake City bidding scandal to be over.
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members were expelled or forced to resign last year for accepting cash,
lavish gifts and other inducements from boosters of Salt Lake's winning bid for
the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Salt Lake problem is in the past,'' Samaranch said.
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch reiterated that he feels the IOC and its members were victims of the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC was maybe a victim because we paid a high price for the misconduct of
some of our members,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he hopes the investigation into the scandal by the Justice
Department and FBI will be concluded ``as soon as possible,'' certainly before
the Salt Lake Games.
</P>
<P>
	Sydney organizers on Thursday cut $22.8 million from their budget. Knight said
the cuts would balance the books without eliminating any jobs or affecting
sports venues or operations for the games.
</P>
<P>
	``There has been no radical surgery here,'' he said. ``It's nip and tuck rather
than amputations.''
</P>
<P>
	UPS withdrew as Sydney's official Olympic ticket distributor in Australia.
</P>
<P>
	Knight said UPS declined to meet requirements for delivering all tickets
door-to-door and organizers are negotiating with three other companies to step
in.
</P>
<P>
	UPS will continue to deliver tickets from the printer to designated
distribution points.
</P>
<P>
	UPS had proposed a door-to-door delivery system along with an alternative
option to provide convenient ticket pickup locations.
</P>
<P>
	``From an operational standpoint, time ran out,'' said IOC marketing director
Michael Payne.

<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- Steve Nash scored 14 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter
as the Dallas Mavericks, playing without suspended Dennis Rodman, beat Detroit
106-97 on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodman was serving a one-game suspension as a result of his ejection in
Tuesday night's loss to Milwaukee. Rodman also was fined $10,000 by the NBA.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mavericks lost each of the two games Rodman played even though the
controversial forward had a total of 29 rebounds. Dallas has won eight of its
last nine games without Rodman.
</P>
<P>
	   Dirk Nowitzki led Dallas with 22 points, 12 rebounds and five assists.
Michael Finley and Cedric Ceballas each had 21 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Nash's 3-pointer with 6:47 to play gave Dallas an 89-88 lead, and the
Mavericks led the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit got as close as 93-91 on Lindsey Hunter's 3-pointer with 4:40 to
play. But Nowitzki hit a 3-pointer with 4:18 left to trigger a 9-2 run capped by
Nash's consecutive baskets that pushed the lead to 102-93.
</P>
<P>
	   Jerry Stackhouse had 22 points for the Pistons, who had won three of their
previous four. Dallas native Grant Hill scored 18 of his 20 points in the first
half, and Jerome Williams had 17 rebounds for the Pistons.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pistons held an 80-70 lead with 1:38 left in the third quarter, but
Dallas hit three consecutive 3-pointers, two by Nowitzki. Nowitzki's second came
with 2.6 seconds left in quarter as Detroit took an 80-79 lead into the fourth
quarter.

<HEADLINE> N. Carolina RB Daniel Davis Jailed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    STAFFORD, Va. (AP) -- North Carolina running back Daniel Davis returned to
Virginia on Thursday, hoping to clear up a probation violation. Instead, he
ended up in jail.
</P>
<P>
	   During a Circuit Court hearing, Davis, 19, was ordered to serve six days but
could be released on good behavior after three.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis rushed for a Group AAA-record 7,080 yards for Brooke Point High School
and was selected Virginia's AAA player of the year by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   On July 23, he was convicted of failing to appear in court on a traffic
violation issued while he was still in high school, court records show. He
received a 10-day suspended jail sentence, was ordered to perform 50 hours of
community service and pay $36 in court costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Stafford County Commonwealth's Attorney Daniel M. Chichester said Davis made
no arrangements to perform the community service, had missed all five of his
scheduled phone calls from his probation officer and failed to pay the court.
Facing extradition, Davis came home.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was given every opportunity to comply, but he never did," Chichester
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The penalty, worked out beforehand by Chichester and Davis' lawyer, Phillip
Sasser, also obligates Davis to perform his community service here during North
Carolina's spring break. Officials said Davis mostly likely would do the work at
a regional landfill.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very disappointed Daniel did not properly attend to his legal
situation. He turned something that began as a traffic violation into a serious
issue," North Carolina coach Carl Torbush said in a statement. "I have made it
clear to him, as well as our entire team, that situations such as this will not
be tolerated."

<HEADLINE> Bulls 83, Heat 76  </HEADLINE>
    By NANCY ARMOUR AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Toni who?
</P>
<P>
	   Playing their first game without Toni Kukoc, the Chicago Bulls got big games
from Elton Brand and Hersey Hawkins and put together one of their best defensive
efforts of the season as they stunned the Miami Heat 83-76 on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Brand had 26 points and 10 rebounds. Hawkins, who had only scored in double
figures once in the 13 games since he returned from the injured list, had 20
points and a season-high nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite four players in double figures, the Heat were held to 41 percent
from the floor. Alonzo Mourning led Miami with 15 points and 11 rebounds, and
Tim Hardaway added 14. Jamal Mashburn had 12 points.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Chicago's second-straight victory over Miami, which has the
second-best record in the Eastern Conference. It was the Heat's second-lowest
point total of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami got within 60-59 on a layup by Chris Carter, but Chris Carr hit a
3-pointer, Brand made two free throws and Hawkins drilled a short jumper and a
3-pointer to put the Bulls back up 70-59. After that, all that was left was the
celebrating.
</P>
<P>
	   When Kukoc, Chicago's leading scorer and the last key piece of the
championship dynasty was traded to Philadelphia on Wednesday, the Bulls' already
dismal fortunes looked even worse. They were 2-22 and flirting with the NBA
record for futility when Kukoc was on the injured list, and their prospects
didn't look much better.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago looked lost for much of the first quarter, scoring just two field
goals in the last 4:15 and shooting just 30 percent overall as Miami took a
23-16 lead. But the Bulls soon realized Kukoc wasn't going to come rescue them
any time soon, opening the second quarter with a 12-3 run of their own.
</P>
<P>
	   Back-to-back 3-pointers by Matt Maloney and Hawkins, followed by Brand's
dunk, gave the Bulls a 28-26 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Any time the Heat seemed on the verge of pulling away, the Bulls came up
with an answer. When P.J. Brown gave Miami a 44-39 lead, Hawkins responded with
a 3-pointer. When Hardaway hit a 3-pointer, Carr scored six straight points to
pull Chicago within one at 49-48.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bulls took the lead on a three-point play from Brand, and he and Maloney
each made a pair of free throws to give the Bulls a 55-53 lead at the start of
the fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> INS Official Charged With Spying  </HEADLINE>
   By MEG RICHARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. immigration official was arrested Thursday and charged
with spying for the Cuban government, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariano Faget, 54, was being held at the Federal Detention Center in Miami
and was to appear in court Friday, the FBI said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget, a native of Havana, is employed at the Immigration and Naturalization
Service as a supervisory district adjudication officer. He held a ``secret''
security clearance and was responsible for supervising decisions that affected
immigrants and people seeking political asylum, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Faget has access to classified and sensitive INS files relating to
confidential law enforcement sources and Cuban defectors,'' the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency said he had made unauthorized contacts with Cuban intelligence
officers in Miami and in other U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
	   Russ Bergeron, director of media relations at INS headquarters in
Washington, said he could not comment on Faget's arrest. He said it is INS
policy to cooperate with such investigations.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Basulto, president of the Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue,
said he believed there were many Cuban spies working in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.S. should be very embarrassed by this finding,'' he said. ``Until
the cancer is removed, which is Castro, this will continue.''
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1998, 14 people were charged in Florida in what authorities
called the largest Cuban espionage ring uncovered in the United States in
decades. Authorities said the group tried to penetrate U.S. military bases,
infiltrate anti-Castro exile groups and manipulate U.S. media and political
organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States severed diplomatic relations with Cuba in January 1961,
two years after Fidel Castro's rise to power, and initiated a trade embargo in
1962. Travel to and from the country is restricted by the U.S. government, but
athletic, cultural and academic exchanges have been allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Relations between the United States and Cuba recently have been strained by
the case of Elian Gonzalez. The INS has said the 6-year-old boy should be
returned to his father in Cuba while his relatives in Miami have been fighting
to keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian survived a crossing from Cuba last November but his mother drowned
when their boat capsized.

</P>
<P>
	   Concannon appeared to have died in his sleep, although the cause and time of
death were not immediately determined.

<P>
	   MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) -- John Gardiner, who ran a string of tennis resorts
and was coach to an array of the rich and famous, died Tuesday of complications
from heart surgery. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1957, Gardiner opened the Carmel Valley Tennis Ranch, later renamed John
Gardiner Tennis Ranch.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the years, those who played at the ranch included presidents George
Bush and Ronald Reagan, entertainers Clint Eastwood and Kirk Douglas, tennis
greats Jack Kramer and Pancho Gonzales, and former Secretary of State Alexander
Haig.
</P>
<P>
	   By the late 1970s, Gardiner controlled 11 tennis resorts in eight states.
</P>

	   At his resort in Scottsdale, Ariz., Gardiner started the annual Senators Cup

Sal J. Foderaro
</P>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Sal J. Foderaro, the former editorial page editor of
the Asbury Park Press of Neptune who was known for his genteel manner and
intelligence, died Thursday of Alzheimer's disease. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to working at several newspapers, Foderaro also was an executive
editor for Encyclopedia Americana.
</P>
<P>
	   Foderaro started his career when he was 22 by answering an ad in the
now-defunct Long Branch Daily Record for a ``female proofreader'' paying $15 per
week.
</P>
<P>
	   He gained national recognition there when he wrote condemnations of Sen.
Joseph McCarthy, who falsely accused many scientists and civilian employees of
being communists.
</P>
<P>
	   After working for two years as city editor of the White Plains (N.Y.)
Reporter Dispatch, he joined the editorial staff of the Encyclopedia Americana
in 1958.
</P>
<P>
	   Foderaro returned to newspapers in 1982 and by 1985 he had been named
editorial page editor of the Asbury Park Press of Neptune. He retired in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors include his wife Jane; daughter Lisa W. Foderaro, a reporter for
The New York Times; son T.J. Foderaro, the night metro editor and a wine
columnist for The Star-Ledger of Newark; brother Joseph of Ocean Township, and a
granddaughter.
Kermit Forbes
</P>
<P>
	   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- Kermit ``Shine'' Forbes, Ernest Hemingway's favorite
sparring partner during the 1940s, died Wednesday. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes and Hemingway first met by accident. Hemingway was refereeing a bout
and Forbes was coaching a young boxer who was having a hard time with a more
experienced pro.
</P>
<P>
	   The 23-year-old Forbes threw a towel into the ring three times to try to
stop the fight and Hemingway refused, hurling the towel in Forbes' face the
third time around.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes resided in a small Key West home not far from the author's residence,
which is now a museum and national literary landmark.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes' walls displayed hundreds of photos and clippings related to the
author, his descendants and Key West's annual Hemingway Days Festival.
Peter Gorseth
</P>
<P>
	   SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Peter Gorseth, an American honored by France last
year for his service in the months following World War I, died Monday. He was
106.
</P>
<P>
	   Gorseth was drafted in 1918 and sent to France as a veterinarian's
assistant. It was an important job in a war in which horses and mules moved
guns, supplies and armies.
</P>
<P>
	   He arrived in Bordeaux, France, on Nov. 12, 1918, one day after the fighting
stopped. He worked the next seven months in a makeshift vet clinic earning $24
per month.
</P>
<P>
	   Last February, the French government tracked Gorseth down and awarded him
the Insignia of Chevalier of the Legion of Honor -- the highest decoration the
French government can give to a non-national.
</P>
<P>
	   The French have attempted to award the honor to all living American veterans
of the war -- estimated at fewer than 1,500.
Martin T. Orne
</P>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Dr. Martin T. Orne, a psychiatrist whose work on
hypnosis helped limit its role in criminal investigations, died Friday of
cancer. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
	   He gained fame for his role in two high-profile criminal cases in California
in the 1970s and 1980s: the Patricia Hearst kidnapping and bank robbery, and the
Hillside Strangler serial killings. His taped therapy sessions with Anne Sexton
were woven into a biography after the 1974 suicide of the tormented Pulitzer
Prize-winning poet.
</P>
<P>
	   As a young doctoral student at Harvard, Orne did a study that concluded that
people under hypnosis do not re-experience or relive moments from very early in
their development. Also in the 1950s came his seminal study showing that people
try to please psychologists in experiments by telling them what they think they
are looking for.
</P>
<P>
	   Orne testified that Hearst, a newspaper-fortune heiress, had essentially
been brainwashed during captivity before she robbed a San Francisco bank in
March 1976. President Carter commuted Hearst's sentence in 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1979, Orne proved that Kenneth Bianchi, the prime suspect in the killing
of 10 women whose mutilated bodies were found along hillsides in northeastern
Los Angeles, was pretending to have multiple personalities to avoid prosecution.
Earl F. Riley
</P>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Retired Superior Court Judge Earl F. Riley, who presided
over early civil consumer protection trials involving asbestos and the Dalkon
Shield, died Sunday. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
	   In the case of the Dalkon Shield contraceptive device, which many users
claimed caused injuries, Riley approved damages but refused to permit punitive
damages against the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
	   After his appointment to the bench by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, Riley
supervised the Family Law Court, where divorces and custody cases are handled.
</P>
<P>
	   Riley had his share of palimony cases in which an unmarried partner sues
another for support. He made key rulings in cases brought by Scott Thorson,
live-in chauffeur, against the late entertainer Liberace, and conducted the
trial of Swedish pop star Peter Holm's case involving financial support from
ex-wife Joan Collins.
A. B. Robbs Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- A. B. Robbs Jr., the founder of a local bank that was
eventually sold to Chase Manhattan Corp., died Wednesday. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
	   Robbs founded a mortgage-banking house that was organized into Continental
Bank in 1964. Continental grew into the state's fifth-largest bank by 1986 when
Robbs helped arrange its sale to Chase Manhattan Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Robbs was also a founding director of the Bank of Phoenix, which became
Great Western Bank and was acquired by Citicorp.
</P>
<P>
	   Robbs retired from banking in 1988.
Heinrich Ungar
</P>
<P>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- Heinrich Ungar, who escaped from Nazi-controlled
Austria and went on to publish a Jewish weekly in Switzerland, died Feb. 9. He
was 79.
</P>
<P>
	   Ungar started working for the paper, at the time a small Jewish periodical
called Maccabi, at the end of World War II and eventually became its publisher.
</P>
<P>
	   He and his wife, Claire, turned the publication into a weekly newspaper
focused on Israel. It now has a circulation of some 4,000-5,000, a spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ungar left his native Vienna on his 18th birthday, two months after Nazi
Germany annexed Austria in 1938.
</P>
<P>
	   Ungar is survived by his wife, son and two daughters.

<HEADLINE> Gustafson, Morley Share Hawaii Lead  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN DiPIETRO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KAPOLEI, Hawaii (AP) -- The first round of the Hawaiian Ladies Open had a
distinct European feel as Sophie Gustafson of Sweden and Joanne Morley of
Britain shot 7-under-par 65s on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   They tied the tournament record for low round that was shared by 1998 champ
Wendy Ward and two others. It was the best score ever for both golfers.
</P>
<P>
	   Morley started with an eagle on the first hole when she holed a sand wedge
from 57 yards. She made a 15-foot putt for a birdie on No. 4, two-putted from
eight feet for a birdie on No. 7 and made five pars before a bogey at No. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   On 17 she holed out with a wedge after coming up about 15 feet short of the
green.
</P>
<P>
	   "I really was just thinking about getting the ball up and down for birdie,"
Morley said. "It's just good luck when it goes in."
</P>
<P>
	   Gustafson had an eagle and six birdies against one bogey. She made a 36-foot
putt for eagle on No. 17 and also birdied No. 8 with a 24-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
	   "The putts make all the difference, don't they?" Gustafson said.
</P>
<P>
	   She also missed three birdie putts, including an 8-footer on her last hole.
</P>
<P>
	   "I guess I could have gone lower, but I am really happy with a 65," she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing by one stroke was Annika Sorenstam of Sweden, who won this event in
1997, and Mi Hyun Kim of South Korea, who bogeyed her last hole to drop out of a
share of the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm satisfied with my score but I had many chances to make birdies and just
couldn't," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven golfers, including Betsy King, were at 67. Two former Hawaiian Ladies
Open winners, Barb Thomas-Whitehead (1995) and Sherri Turner (1989), were in a
group at 68.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting on the back nine, Gustafson birdied the first two holes, bogeyed
No. 13 and birdied No. 15 before an eagle on the par-5 17th to put her at
4-under.
</P>
<P>
	   She moved 5-under with a birdie on No. 1, then made five straight pars
before birdies at Nos. 7 and 8.
</P>
<P>
	   Gustafson, whose best finish as a pro was second in the 1998 Women's British
Open, said her great round has her on the road to her first victory.
</P>
<P>
	   "It gives me confidence because I know my game is here this week," she said,
especially since she has had problems transferring her success in Europe to the
LPGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would be fun to start playing as well here as I have in Europe. That
would give me a lot of confidence."
</P>
<P>
	   Sorenstam, who had a hole-in-one during the pro-am on Wednesday, had six
birdies Thursday and was confident her strong play would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   "When things go your way, you get fired up," Sorenstam said. "You can hit a
bad shot and know things are going to be OK. A little luck and little confidence
is a good recipe right now."

<HEADLINE> INS Official Charged With Spying  </HEADLINE>
   By MEG RICHARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A U.S. immigration official with ``secret'' security clearance
was arrested Thursday and charged with spying for the Cuban government, the FBI
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariano Faget, 54, was being held at the Federal Detention Center in Miami
and was to appear in court Friday, the FBI said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Faget, a native of Havana, is employed at the Immigration and Naturalization
Service as a supervisory district adjudication officer. He held a ``secret''
security clearance and was responsible for supervising decisions that affected
immigrants and people seeking political asylum, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Faget has access to classified and sensitive INS files relating to
confidential law enforcement sources and Cuban defectors,'' the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency said he had made unauthorized contacts with Cuban intelligence
officers in Miami and in other U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section, which represents the nation in
Washington, declined comment. The White House also had no comment, spokesman
Mike Hammer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI said it wouldn't release any further details on the case until a
news conference set for Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Russ Bergeron, director of media relations at INS headquarters in
Washington, said he could not comment on Faget's arrest. He said it is INS
policy to cooperate with such investigations.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Basulto, president of the Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue,
said he believed there were many Cuban spies working in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.S. should be very embarrassed by this finding,'' he said. ``Until
the cancer is removed, which is Castro, this will continue.''
</P>
<P>
	   In October 1998, 14 people were charged in Florida in what authorities
called the largest Cuban espionage ring uncovered in the United States in
decades. Authorities said the group tried to penetrate U.S. military bases,
infiltrate anti-Castro exile groups and manipulate U.S. media and political
organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States severed diplomatic relations with Cuba in January 1961,
two years after Fidel Castro's rise to power, and initiated a trade embargo in
1962. Travel to and from the country is restricted by the U.S. government, but
athletic, cultural and academic exchanges have been allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   Relations between the United States and Cuba recently have been strained by
the case of Elian Gonzalez. The INS has said the 6-year-old boy should be
returned to his father in Cuba while his relatives in Miami have been fighting
to keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian survived a crossing from Cuba last November but his mother drowned
when their boat capsized.

<HEADLINE> Islanders 2, Flyers 2 Tie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mark Lawrence scored the tying goal in the third period
Thursday night to give the New York Islanders a 2-2 draw with the Philadelphia
Flyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Krog also scored for the Islanders, who have lost only once in five
games (3-1-1).
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Lindros and Keith Jones scored for the Flyers, who have lost only two
of their last 22 homes games (14-2-6), but are only 4-6-5 in the second half of
the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawrence, who has three goals in six career games against the Flyers, tipped
the puck past the stick side of John Vanbiesbrouck from the doorstep at 9:16.
Lawrence, who scored his first goal this season, took a pass from Jamie Rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   An apparent game-winning goal by Lindros was waived off by referee Paul
Devorski, who called a slashing penalty on the Flyers captain with 5:11 left in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   With John LeClair off for interference, Krog put the Islanders ahead 1-0
with a power-play goal only 59 seconds in. Josh Green dumped the puck to the
crease and Krog tipped it into the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariusz Czerkawski also had an assist on the play to extend his scoring
streak to a career-high 12 games. He has 19 points in that span. Green's assist
stretched his scoring streak to eight games.
</P>
<P>
	   Lindros tied it with a short-handed goal at 4:16 of the second, ramming home
his own rebound after taking a pass from Luke Richardson deep in Philadelphia's
zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones put Philadelphia ahead 2-1 at 13:24 of the second with his first goal
in 15 games. Jones got the shaft of his stick on a Dan McGillis' slap shot, from
just inside the blue line, and deflected it past Kevin Weekes.
</P>
<P>
	   Philadelphia held a 39-26 shots advantage, the 13th time in 14 games that
the Flyers have outshot their opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Islanders did manage to shut down the NHL's best power-play unit,
blanking the Flyers on seven attempts -- including 1:49 of a two-man advantage
that carried over from the end of the second period into the third.
</P>
<P>
	   Philadelphia's final power-play came at the start of overtime, but Weekes
made a brilliant stop on a shot from the point by Eric Desjardins.
</P>
<P>
	   The Islanders are 0-6-2 in their last eight games at Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> No. 1 Cincinnati 77, Houston 65  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL A. LUTZ AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOUSTON (AP) -- Kenyon Martin had 26 points and 17 rebounds as No. 1
Cincinnati held off a second-half charge by Houston for a 77-65 victory Thursday
night that gave the Bearcats their fifth consecutive Conference USA championship
and 16th straight victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bearcats (24-1, 12-0) led 62-44 with 12:48 to play but they needed
Martin, who had 16 points in the second half, to foil the Cougars (8-16, 2-9).
</P>
<P>
	   The Cougars got within seven points twice, the last time with 2:41 to play
on a 3-pointer by Gee Gervin, who had 18 of his 26 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bearcats led 46-28 at halftime but the Cougars started the second half
with a 13-7 run as Gervin scored seven points. Houston made six of its first
eight shots in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   DerMarr Johnson had 19 points for the Bearcats, who have the nation's
longest winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Reserve Roy Spears added 13 points for the Cougars.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston hadn't played hosted to a No. 1 team since the Cougars defeated UCLA
71-69 in "the game of the century" played before 52,693 fans in the Astrodome on
Jan. 20, 1968. It was college basketball's first nationally televised regular
season game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bearcats opened a 24-6 lead as Johnson hit consecutive 3-pointers
baskets and a fast-break layup for the game's first eight points. Cincinnati
made its first five shots and at one point in the big run, Houston missed 12
consecutive shots on the way to shooting 28 percent in the first half.

<HEADLINE> Winter Goodwill Games Begin  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- At long last, the U.S. Luge team again has a home-ice
advantage. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
	Plagued for nearly a decade by a decaying track, which the best lugers in the
world avoided like the plague, the U.S. team christened the brand new
bobsled-luge-skeleton track at Mount Van Hoevenberg with a victory in men's
doubles on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	Brian Martin of Palo Alto, Calif., and Mark Grimmette of Muskegon, Mich., won
the first gold medal of the inaugural Winter Goodwill Games, and by the closest
of margins -- five thousandths of a second over Steffen Skel and Steffen Woeller
of Germany.
</P>
<P>
	The American duo, who won Olympic bronze at Nagano in 1998, built a big lead on
the first run, then nearly lost it all on the second, finishing with a combined
time of 1 minute, 37.823 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	``I was definitely nervous,'' Martin said. ``Going down I was thinking I hadn't
heard anybody's times. I was thinking, well, if we're lucky other people have
screwed up as much as we have. It was far from a good run, and we were a bit
lucky that we held onto it.''
</P>
<P>
	Normally, a lead of nearly a half-second is safe in luge, but with only nine
practice runs on a brand new track that's unlike any other in the world, there
were plenty of chances to make mistakes. During the uphill portion of the second
run out of turn 14, Grimmette put his feet down and it nearly cost them the
race.
</P>
<P>
	``This track is tough,'' Grimmette said. ``We had roughly a four-tenths lead
after the first run, and I knew that wasn't a whole lot of time. We don't have a
whole lot of experience on this track yet. You really can't call this track a
home track yet. Hopefully, in the future we'll be able to say that.''
</P>
<P>
	The other American team of Gordy Sheer of Lake Placid, and Chris Thorpe of
Marquette, Mich., who won silver at Nagano, finished a disappointing fourth. A
mishap on their first run -- also in the uphill section -- cost them a spot on
the podium.
</P>
<P>
	``The sled just broke away over that rise,'' Thorpe said. ``I totally didn't
expect it. I thought we were right on line. It broke away and it was all over.
If we had had that problem in training, we would have been ready for it in the
race. It's just a lesson learned.''
</P>
<P>
	``That was our race,'' added Sheer, who had other worries on this day -- his
band was to play at the awards presentation later. ``That was our medal out the
window.''
</P>
<P>
	The downhill gold medal apparently went out the window for the favored
Austrians in the draw as Vincent Blanc of France scored a surprising victory at
Whiteface Mountain under crystal-clear skies and frigid temperatures.
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Blanc, who failed to finish both World Cup super-G races last
weekend at St. Anton, Austria, finished in 1 minute, 49.84 seconds to edge Chris
Puckett of Boulder, Colo., by 12 hundredths of a second. Canada's Kevin Wert won
the bronze.
</P>
<P>
	The five Austrians in the race had had their pick of starting slots and chose
to go first in the wake of Monday's snowstorm, which dumped 2 feet on the
mountain and softened conditions.
</P>
<P>
	But swirling wind and overnight temperatures near zero hardened the course and
may have cost the Austrians the race. Hannes Trinkl, who won a World Cup
downhill in Canada in December, was fifth; Werner Franz, who won one of last
week's super-Gs, was seventh; and Fritz Strobl, who won the world's toughest
downhill, the Hahnenkamm at Kitzbuhel, Austria, last month, was 11th.
</P>
<P>
	Puckett, the last skier on the course, said his experience on the mountain was
a factor.
</P>
<P>
	``When we went to bed last night and saw it was still snowing. It seemed like
it was going to be difficult to have a race today, especially with the race
being pushed back to 2:30,'' said Puckett, who has cracked the top 20 only twice
this World Cup season. ``But I was totally ready, having skied this pitch a few
times.
</P>
<P>
	``I think some of the Europeans may have been a little intimidated just because
they haven't skied the hill much,'' Puckett said. ``We definitely ski some more
challenging courses in Europe sometimes, but if you haven't skied the hill
before, you're still going to be intimidated once you get in the gates and race.
I felt a lot more comfortable maybe than some of the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
	In snowboarding, Tricia Byrnes and Kelly Clark won the two top spots in
halfpipe for the United States, which led the medal count with six, two of each
color, at day's end. Canada and Italy had two medals each.
</P>
<P>
	``I was just glad I pulled it together,'' said Byrnes, the defending World Cup
champ. ``Practice was really rough for me this morning. I haven't been able to
do a 540 because I'm chicken. Then I just landed a couple in practice and
thought, `You can do this.'''
</P>
<P>
	In short track speedskating, Canada's Francois-Louis Tremblay edged Italy's
Fabio Carta in the 500-meter sprint. American Rusty Smith finished third despite
falling.
</P>
<P>
	In the women's race, China's Yang Yang took gold in the 1,000 meters, with
Evgenia Randanova of Bulgaria second and Amy Peterson of Maplewood, Minn.,
third.
</P>
<P>
	``I really didn't skate the final the way I would have liked,'' Peterson said.
``I just waited too long. Instead of skating my race, I skated their race, but
I'm definitely happy with the way it turned out. It gave me a big confidence
boost going into the world championships next month.''

<P>
	And after one run in women's luge, Germany's Sylke Otto led teammate Silke
Kraushaar by two-tenths of a second. Angelika Neuner of Austria was in third
heading into Friday's final run.
</P>
<P>
	Figure skating got under way in the evening at the Olympic Ice Arena. After the
technical program in pairs, Germany's Mandy Woetzel and Ingo Steuer, bronze
medalists at Nagano, led the three teams competing with a score of 98.3.
</P>
<P>
	In second at 98.0 was the Russian team of Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev,
who won gold at Nagano. Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler, two-time Olympic
bronze medalists, were in third with 96.7.
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. pairs team of Yuka Sato and Jason Dungjen withdrew after he fell and
broke his right cheekbone while attempting a triple twist in practice earlier
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	In dance, Americans Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow were awarded two
perfect 10s in the technical portion and were in first place with a score of
98.8.
</P>
<P>
	``It's a surprise because we were so nervous coming in,'' Punsalan said.
``We've been doing shows and trying to get ready for this, so we've been living
with this stress daily.''
</P>
<P>
	In second place at 98.3 were Maia Usova and Evgeny Platov of Russia, third at
98 was the Russian team of Marina Klimova and Sergei Ponomarenko, and Finland's
Susanna Rahkamo and Petri Kokko were fourth at 96.7.

<P>
	The old guys stole the show in the men's singles. Thirty-six-year-old Brian
Boitano of the United States finished the evening with a flourish, landing one
double jump and five triples to take the lead with a score of 98.7, which
included two 10s for artistry.
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Brian Orser also skated a nearly flawless program, including his first
triple axel in a dozen years, and was second at 98.4.
</P>
<P>
	``I had so much adrenaline after the axel,'' said the 38-year-old Orser,
Olympic champion in 1992 at Albertville. ``I don't even think I was breathing. I
was going strictly on adrenaline.''
</P>
<P>
	Victor Petrenko of Ukraine was in third at 97.8, followed by France's Philippe
Candeloro, Alexei Urmanov of Russia, and Rudy Galindo of the United States.

<HEADLINE> Warriors Introduce New Players  </HEADLINE>
    By DENNIS GEORGATOS AP Sports Writer

<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Golden State Warriors acquired guard Larry
Hughes to spark their offense and the teammate that came with him as part of a
three-way trade said that should be no problem.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're going to be overwhelmed by what he can do on the basketball court,"
guard-forward Billy Owens said Thursday night at a news conference introducing
the team's newest players.
</P>
<P>
	   The two, teammates in Philadelphia, were sent to Golden State in exchange
for guard John Starks and the Warriors' first-round draft pick. Philadelphia
then sent Starks and the draft pick to Chicago along with forward Bruce Bowen in
return for forward Toni Kukoc to complete the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a great day for the Warriors," Golden State coach Garry St. Jean said.
"We're thrilled to have Billy Owens and Larry Hughes aboard. We feel like this
is a significant step toward our future."
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes, 21, the eighth overall pick in the 1998 draft, appeared in five
games this season, averaging 10 points, 3.2 rebounds, 1.5 assists and 20
minutes. He has led all Philadelphia bench players in scoring during the past
two seasons. However, he rarely started because he played behind Allen Iverson,
the league's leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have seen a player we believe is ready to blossom into a prime-time
player," St. Jean said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes had been hoping to go to a team where he would get more playing time.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew something was going to happen," said Hughes, who was the subject of
frequent trade rumors over the last month. "I just wanted it to happen soon. I
just wanted to go to anybody that would give me a chance to play."
</P>
<P>
	   Owens said the Warriors won't be disappointed once they see Hughes play.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think right now he's one of the best players in the league," Owens said.
"He just hasn't had a chance to show it."
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes said he's looking forward to the challenge and disproving the
skeptics who questioned the Warriors' quickness in describing the inexperienced
Hughes as a franchise cornerstone.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not a risk at all. I don't think it was a chance; I think it was a good
call," Hughes said. "And by the time the season is over, everybody will know
it."
</P>
<P>
	   Owens, 30, joins Golden State for the second time. He spent the first three
years of his career with Golden State. He also has also played for Miami and
Sacramento, where he played for St. Jean.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Jean said both Owens and Hughes will be in uniform for Friday night's
game against the Boston Celtics at the Oakland Coliseum Arena.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're looking for a transition game, and I think both of these guys are
capable," St. Jean said. "They're both solid defenders, and I hope they get a
good nights' sleep because I'm planning on playing them a lot (Friday.)"
