<HEADLINE> No. 24 Maryland 73, Wake Forest 51  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GINSBURG AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- No. 24 Maryland made sure this game didn't come
down to a last-second shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Lonny Baxter scored 12 of his 18 points in a game-opening 24-4 run as the
Terrapins finally came up with their first Atlantic Coast Conference victory of
the season, defeating Wake Forest 73-51 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Dixon had 18 points and reserve forward Tahj Holden contributed a
career-high 17 for the Terrapins (12-5, 1-3), who never trailed in emphatically
ending a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of those losses were by a total of three points. This time, the outcome
was all but decided early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was really pleased with our effort. To get your first (ACC) win is
especially exciting for our new guys," Maryland coach Gary Williams said. "Going
in 0-3, there was a lot of pressure to play well. It might have been a critical
game for us, who knows? Everything looks a little better now."
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland may pay a price for the victory -- forward Terence Morris hurt his
left ankle late in the game and limped off the court with the help of a team
aide.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully he's OK," Williams said. "He twisted it. I don't know how bad it
is. Usually with an ankle, you know more the next day."
</P>
<P>
	   Darius Songaila scored 14 points for Wake Forest (11-6, 2-3). The Demon
Deacons, who averaged an ACC-best 14 turnovers per game, had 13 by halftime and
finished with 20. They shot just 29 percent, including 2-for-10 from 3-point
range.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading scorer Robert O'Kelley was 1-for-9 and backcourtmate Craig Dawwson
missed six of nine shots.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had some kids who had some rough nights, there's no denying that," Wake
Forest coach Dave Odom said. "They looked out of sync."
</P>
<P>
	   The game was eerily similar to last season's matchup at Cole Field House
when Maryland raced to a 32-10 lead en route to a 23-point rout. This time,
Maryland once again took command early and led comfortably throughout.
</P>
<P>
	   "We really needed this game," Baxter said. "We've been hanging our heads and
a needed something like this to get back on track."
</P>
<P>
	   Plagued by poor shooting during its three-game slide, Maryland made its
first nine shots for an 18-2 lead with four minutes elapsed. Songaila then
scored for the Demon Deacons, but two dunks and a follow shot by Baxter made it
24-4.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maryland looked about as comfortable shooting the ball as any team possibly
could," Odom said. "They hit some good shots. Give them a lot of credit."
</P>
<P>
	   Minutes later, Baxter scored on a drive to put the Terrapins up 29-10. At
that point, Baxter was 7-for-7 and Wake Forest was 4-for-20 with 11 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Demon Deacons then reeled off eight straight points and trailed by only
10 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Songaila scored the opening basket of the second half to make it 37-29, but
Wake Forest would get no closer. Baxter scored in the lane and Morris added a
three-point play to spark a 9-0 run that put Maryland up by 17.
</P>
<P>
	   It was 49-36 before Holden, a seldom-used freshman, made two free throws and
a three-point play to give the Terrapins an 18-point lead with 8:52 left.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just got the opportunity tonight and made the most of it," Holden said.
"If I get the minutes, hopefully I'll continue to play well."

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 0, Sharks 0, Tie  </HEADLINE>
    By AARON J. LOPEZ AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Evgeni Nabokov, in his first career start for San Jose, made
39 saves as the Sharks forged a scoreless tie Wednesday night with the Colorado
Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado, which ran its home unbeaten streak to 10 games (8-0-2), outshot
San Jose 39-15 -- including 7-1 in overtime -- but was repeatedly turned away by
Nabokov, who had played just 52 minutes in relief.
</P>
<P>
	   Though rarely tested, Colorado's Patrick Roy made key saves at the end of
regulation and in overtime to earn his 47th career shutout as the Avalanche
extended their shutout streak to 161 minutes, 40 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams had a chance to win in regulation, but Colorado's Chris Drury hit
the left post on a 2-on-1 with 2:50 remaining and Jeff Friesen was turned away
by Roy from just outside the crease with 25 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Nabokov's impressive night continued in overtime as San Jose survived a
power play and nearly stole a victory when Vincent Damphousse led a 2-on-1 break
only to be stopped by Roy with 1:14 left.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Colorado's first scoreless game since Dec. 14, 1998, against St.
Louis. San Jose's last 0-0 contest was Nov. 7, 1997 against Toronto.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing without captain Joe Sakic, out with the flu, Colorado failed to
score in the game's first minute for the first time in four games, but the
Avalanche were the clear aggressors throughout.
</P>
<P>
	   San Jose, content to playing a restricted, tight-checking game, killed five
power plays, mainly behind the strong play of Nabokov, who stopped Colorado on
breakaways, wraparounds, deflections and one-timers.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Forsberg was denied by Nabokov several times as his career-high
12-game point-scoring streak came to an end.

<HEADLINE> After 25 years in prison, freed inmate is retried for 1973 murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Since being freed last spring after 25 years in
prison, John Duval has spent weekdays sweeping the floor and filling in the
appointment book at Val's, his mother's neighborhood beauty salon.
<P>
	   "It's not a job," Duval, 47, said with a shrug during a lunch break at his
sister's home nearby. "It's just something I do to keep busy and stay out of
trouble."
</P>
<P>
	   The joy of being on the outside after having his conviction overturned for a
1973 murder is tempered by the prospect that he might soon end up behind bars
again. Prosecutors have opted to retry him, and jury selection opens today.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval concentrates hard on living each day as it comes.
</P>
<P>
	   "With my faith in God, I don't worry about nothing," he said. "I used to
worry, but I don't no more because I know in my heart I'm in the right."
</P>
<P>
	   Duval and a fellow prostitute, Betty Tyson, got 25 years to life
imprisonment in February 1974 for the strangling death of Timothy Haworth, 52, a
Philadelphia business consultant who left his Rochester hotel the night of May
24, 1973, apparently to look for a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
	   In the absence of physical evidence, they were convicted on the basis of
confessions they insist were beaten out of them by a rogue detective, William
Mahoney, and on the testimony of two teen-age runaways, Wayne Wright and Jon
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Wright recanted his account, saying Mahoney had terrorized him into
lying. Prosecutors then came upon a buried synopsis of a police interview with
Jackson in which he also denied seeing Duval or Tyson with the victim.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruling that exculpatory evidence had been wrongfully suppressed, a judge
freed Tyson in May 1998 and Duval last April. While prosecutors decided not to
retry Tyson - the city gave her $1.2 million in compensation - they went after
Duval again. While Tyson had steadfastly maintained her innocence, he had twice
admitted his guilt before a parole board.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you don't show remorse, they're not going to let you go," Duval
explained. "I was very upset about it ... but I didn't have outside support,
anybody saying 'We're trying to get you out Johnny, just hold on."'
</P>
<P>
	   Monroe County District Attorney Howard Relin has no doubt Duval took part in
the slaying. Unlike the Tyson case, two detectives who interviewed Duval are
still alive to testify. In addition, Relin maintained, Mahoney was not directly
involved in Duval's case.
</P>
<P>
	   The chief detective, investigated at least 10 times for allegedly abusing
suspects, resigned in 1980 after fabricating evidence in an unrelated case. He
died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   One of eight children, Duval was a rebellious teen-ager who dabbled with
heroin and entered a shadowy world of prostitutes and transvestites.
</P>
<P>
	   "I probably would have ended up being one of Arthur Shawcross' victims," he
said, referring to the 1980s prostitute serial killer here, "or OD'd off of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I don't think the state saved me or nothing like that," he added with a
bitter laugh. "I could never give them that kind of glory."
</P>
<P>
	   With his future in limbo, Duval's emotions swing between the everyday
travails of adjusting to the outside world and the elation of renewing links
with his family.
</P>
<P>
	   During a reunion with his brother's children last summer, "they called me
uncle," he said. "That tore me up. The sounds of 'Uncle Johnny' made me
appreciate my freedom."
</P>
<P>
	   He enjoys his solitude, listening to jazz in his sister's house at night and
crocheting stuffed animals he sells to pay for his defense.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh, it's exciting to have him home, never a dull moment," said Sonya Duval,
40, stirring a pot of chicken wings. "He tells me about his time in prison.
Sometimes we laugh, sometimes we cry. We're trying to deal with it the best we
can. Nothing we can do but pray."
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago, Duval said prosecutors offered him the assurance that he
would remain free if he pleaded guilty and, in effect, gave up any chance of
compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would rather die in prison an old man," Duval said defiantly, adding that
"no amount of money could give me what they took from me."
</P>
<P>
	   Before long, Duval said he hopes to start life anew as a youth counselor.
"It's important that kids know the consequences of hanging in the streets," he
said. "Because if you hang out on the street, sooner or later your number is
going to pop up."

<HEADLINE> Grocer shows signs of regaining shoppers, profits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - The Penn Traffic Co.'s comeback is building even
if profits aren't yet piling up, says the company's top executive.
<P>
	   "We've come back," company president and chief executive officer Joseph V.
Fisher told a gathering this week as he helped open a remodeled P&AMP;C store in
suburban Syracuse, where the regional grocer is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've stabilized this company and we're moving forward. This is the bright
new beginning," Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   The reborn company emerged from bankruptcy six months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The store in Fairmount is the first of Penn Traffic's 63 P&AMP;C stores to get
significant upgrades under the company's 18-month, $100 million capital
investment program. Penn Traffic's Big Bear division, reeling from intense
competition among giant grocery chains in Ohio, got some of the money and
upgrades first.
</P>
<P>
	   Penn Traffic operates 213 stores in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and West
Virginia under five trade names: P&AMP;C Foods, Big Bear, Big Bear Plus, Bi-Lo Foods
and Quality Markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-four P&AMP;C stores are scheduled to undergo design changes, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new stores feature a mini-market that operates as a store-within-a-store
with its own outside entrance and cash register. Penn Traffic first tried the
mini-market concept at a Big Bear store in West Virginia, where it met with
success, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   There's also a dining area with a new takeout section and an in-store
supervised child care center for children 3 to 9. Parents shopping in the store
will get an ID bracelet matching their children's. Monitors throughout the store
carry a live video feed that allows parents to see their children at all times.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, thousands of grocery items were added to the store, as well as
a new organic and natural foods section, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a very strong financial foundation and are going forward, we know
what we have to do and we now have the financial resources to do those things,
to remain very competitive and to continue to grow," Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company lost more than $324 million between 1994 and 1998 before
declaring bankruptcy. In a prearranged plan with creditors, Penn Traffic closed
more than four dozen stores and shed $1.13 billion in debts by selling them.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, for the first time since its financial problems began, Penn
Traffic reported an increase in same-store sales, a fiscal barometer that
reflects customer satisfaction and repeat business.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore picks up, Bush GOP choice among New Yorkers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Democrats are watching New Hampshire to see if its
Feb. 1 primary breaks open a tight race for the Democratic vote in New York.
<P>
	   A Quinnipiac College Polling Institute survey released Wednesday found the
race between Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley a
statistical tie - just like it was in December.
</P>
<P>
	   But either Democrat would have an edge in a general election against
Republican favorites George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, according
to the poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Maurice Carroll, director of the polling institute, emphasized that a big
win by Bradley in New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary could pay off in unstoppable
momentum for the former New York Knicks star in New York's March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   "A Bradley win in New Hampshire next month could scramble the mix in New
York," Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Polls go up and polls go down," said Julia Rothwax of the Bradley campaign,
downplaying the slight rise for Gore. The former senator has consistently polled
well against Republicans, so the picture in New York is no surprise, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore camp says it isn't surprised by the neck-and-neck battle.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've always known we'd face a tough fight in Bill Bradley's backyard,"
said Gore spokesman Peter Ragone, "and Al Gore intends to fight his heart and
soul out for every vote in New York."
</P>
<P>
	   The poll questioned 812 registered voters in the state from Jan. 11-17. It
found Gore and Bradley in a statistical tie: 44 percent for Gore, 39 percent for
Bradley. In December, the same pollsters found Gore supported by 42 percent and
Bradley by 39 percent - also a statistical tie. Bradley led in November,
however, 47 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll released Wednesday has a margin of error of 3 percentage points
when both Republicans and Democrats were questioned. The margin of error
increased to 5.5 percentage points for the answers from the 330 Democrats
questioned, and to 6 percent for the responses of the 246 Republicans
questioned.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Texas governor, maintained a solid lead in the Republican race
with 47 percent to the 28 percent for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   New York's primary is seen as a critical test for Bradley because of his
near favorite-son status here.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley led Bush 52 percent to 35 percent, according to the poll. Gore had a
47 percent-to-39 percent lead over the Texas governor, the poll showed.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore would beat McCain 47 percent to 38 percent and Bradley would beat
McCain 49 percent to 39 percent, according to the Quinnipiac pollster.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a Democratic town," Carroll said, referring to the state. "And
Bradley looks better with independents."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not surprising," said Daniel Allen, spokesman for the state Republican
Committee of the Democrats' apparent narrow edge. He said the front-runner is
often the target of other candidates and reporters and that can hurt Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   However, there's time before the primary, Allen emphasized.
</P>
<P>
	   "Governor Bush has a message that really resonates with the families of New
York more than Gore or Bradley," he said.

<HEADLINE> Senator invites New York Jets to move to Yonkers as bidding war  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Yonkers Jets?
<P>
	   State Sen. Nick Spano of Westchester thinks the team and the town would be
great together.
</P>
<P>
	   Spano, a Republican, wrote new Jets owner Robert Wood Johnson Wednesday and
asked him to think about moving the team up the Hudson River to the Yonkers
Raceway when its lease is up at the New Jersey Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yonkers facility has 97 acres of land just waiting for someone to do
something with it and "Jets Stadium" would be the perfect fit, the senator said.
"It's feasible, it's accessible and it's available," Spano said.
</P>
<P>
	   And it already has an NFL connection: The Yonkers Raceway is owned by the
Rooney family, owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Spano said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Yonkers, for sure, is ready for the big time," said Spano, noting
the recent additions of Home Depot, Costco and Stew Leonard's to the city of
180,000 that sits 17 miles north of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   New York Jets spokesman Frank Ramos refused to comment, saying he had not
heard about Spano's offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Yonkers Mayor John Spencer cheered the proposal, saying it would be great if
all of the details could be worked out. "You're talking to a lifelong Giants
fan, but I'd gladly be a Jets fan if they moved to Yonkers," Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jets still have eight more years to play in New Jersey but jockeying for
the football team has already begun. Johnson noted in his inaugural news
conference that the Jets have never had their own stadium.
</P>
<P>
	   After starting in the Polo Grounds, former owner Leon Hess moved the Jets
out of Shea Stadium in 1984 and since then they have shared Giants Stadium in
East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have been in the Mets Stadium, Shea Stadium and now this since 1984,
and we want to do everything in our power to provide them with their own
stadium," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has raised the possibility of
constructing a stadium on the West Side and Newark also could be a possibility
for the nomadic team. The Meadowlands also wants the Jets to stay but is feeling
pressure with all the speculation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only things that's changed about your call is the place," New Jersey
Sports Authority spokesman Dan Emmer said. "Yesterday, it was Mayor Giuliani
with a stadium on the West Side, then it was Newark, and now it's Yonkers."
</P>
<P>
	   Spano thinks he has the best idea, however. "Geographically, there's no
better place" than Yonkers, Spano said. "It's located just eight miles from the
George Washington Bridge, less than five miles from the Tappan Zee, and it's
easily accessible to several major highways."
</P>
<P>
	   And "let's face it, are there sites in New York City that are accessible,
that are available and that are feasible?" Spano said. "I don't think so. Let's
not lose the Jets to New Jersey again."
</P>
<P>
	   Spano is trying to recruit Gov. George Pataki to his cause, forwarding him a
copy of his letter.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are a number of communities in New York that would love to be home to
the Jets," Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said. "We would love to put the New
York back in the New York Jets."
</P>
<P>
	   However, if his plan works, Spano still wouldn't be in favor of an offical
name change to the Yonkers Jets. "Let's keep it the way it is," he said,
laughing.

<HEADLINE> Report: Hunger Persists in America  </HEADLINE>
    By ROBIN ESTRIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- In these times of low unemployment and overnight stock market
fortunes, 30 million Americans worry about where they will get their next meals,
according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of Americans who go hungry has held steady for the last four
years, despite unprecedented economic growth, the Center on Hunger and Poverty
at Tufts University found.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think people assume that the rising tide lifts all boats and, in fact, at
the lowest end of the spectrum, there are as many hungry people as ever," said
Deborah Leff, president of America's Second Harvest, a Chicago-based agency that
delivers 1 billion pounds of food to food banks annually.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tufts study is billed as the most comprehensive analysis of domestic
hunger since welfare was overhauled in 1996. Researchers pulled together federal
and state estimates on hunger, along with reports from food banks and shelters,
to provide a detailed picture of hunger and so-called "food insecurity" -- the
fear that there won't be enough to eat.
</P>
<P>
	   America is now in the longest economic expansion since the Vietnam War. The
stock market is soaring. The national unemployment rate of 4.1 percent is the
lowest in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet, the study found that nearly one in six children lives in a household
where meals are an endless concern. Some families face a harsh choice: heat the
home or feed the children.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're constantly hearing these great economic forecasts," said Ashley
Sullivan, a co-author of the Tufts report, which was to be released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems like one wouldn't expect to see the persistence of hunger and food
insecurity in a society that has such wealth and low unemployment," Sullivan
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tufts study makes several recommendations to Congress, including:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Ensure that those eligible for food stamps receive them.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Increase the allowable assets for food stamp eligibility so a family can
own a car and still get necessary government food assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Create savings incentives to provide financial safety nets for the
working poor.

<HEADLINE> Grocer shows signs of regaining shoppers, profits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - The Penn Traffic Co.'s comeback is building even
if profits aren't yet piling up, says the company's top executive.
<P>
	   "We've come back," company president and chief executive officer Joseph V.
Fisher told a gathering this week as he helped open a remodeled P&AMP;C store in
suburban Syracuse, where the regional grocer is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've stabilized this company and we're moving forward. This is the bright
new beginning," Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   The reborn company emerged from bankruptcy six months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The store in Fairmount is the first of Penn Traffic's 63 P&AMP;C stores to get
significant upgrades under the company's 18-month, $100 million capital
investment program. Penn Traffic's Big Bear division, reeling from intense
competition among giant grocery chains in Ohio, got some of the money and
upgrades first.
</P>
<P>
	   Penn Traffic operates 213 stores in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and West
Virginia under five trade names: P&AMP;C Foods, Big Bear, Big Bear Plus, Bi-Lo Foods
and Quality Markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty-four P&AMP;C stores are scheduled to undergo design changes, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new stores feature a mini-market that operates as a store-within-a-store
with its own outside entrance and cash register. Penn Traffic first tried the
mini-market concept at a Big Bear store in West Virginia, where it met with
success, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   There's also a dining area with a new takeout section and an in-store
supervised child care center for children 3 to 9. Parents shopping in the store
will get an ID bracelet matching their children's. Monitors throughout the store
carry a live video feed that allows parents to see their children at all times.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, thousands of grocery items were added to the store, as well as
a new organic and natural foods section, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a very strong financial foundation and are going forward, we know
what we have to do and we now have the financial resources to do those things,
to remain very competitive and to continue to grow," Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company lost more than $324 million between 1994 and 1998 before
declaring bankruptcy. In a prearranged plan with creditors, Penn Traffic closed
more than four dozen stores and shed $1.13 billion in debts by selling them.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, for the first time since its financial problems began, Penn
Traffic reported an increase in same-store sales, a fiscal barometer that
reflects customer satisfaction and repeat business.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore picks up, Bush GOP choice among New Yorkers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Democrats are watching New Hampshire to see if its
Feb. 1 primary breaks open a tight race for the Democratic vote in New York.
<P>
	   A Quinnipiac College Polling Institute survey released Wednesday found the
race between Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley a
statistical tie - just like it was in December.
</P>
<P>
	   But either Democrat would have an edge in a general election against
Republican favorites George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, according
to the poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Maurice Carroll, director of the polling institute, emphasized that a big
win by Bradley in New Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary could pay off in unstoppable
momentum for the former New York Knicks star in New York's March 7 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   "A Bradley win in New Hampshire next month could scramble the mix in New
York," Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Polls go up and polls go down," said Julia Rothwax of the Bradley campaign,
downplaying the slight rise for Gore. The former senator has consistently polled
well against Republicans, so the picture in New York is no surprise, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore camp says it isn't surprised by the neck-and-neck battle.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've always known we'd face a tough fight in Bill Bradley's backyard,"
said Gore spokesman Peter Ragone, "and Al Gore intends to fight his heart and
soul out for every vote in New York."
</P>
<P>
	   The poll questioned 812 registered voters in the state from Jan. 11-17. It
found Gore and Bradley in a statistical tie: 44 percent for Gore, 39 percent for
Bradley. In December, the same pollsters found Gore supported by 42 percent and
Bradley by 39 percent - also a statistical tie. Bradley led in November,
however, 47 percent to 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll released Wednesday has a margin of error of 3 percentage points
when both Republicans and Democrats were questioned. The margin of error
increased to 5.5 percentage points for the answers from the 330 Democrats
questioned, and to 6 percent for the responses of the 246 Republicans
questioned.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Texas governor, maintained a solid lead in the Republican race
with 47 percent to the 28 percent for McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   New York's primary is seen as a critical test for Bradley because of his
near favorite-son status here.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley led Bush 52 percent to 35 percent, according to the poll. Gore had a
47 percent-to-39 percent lead over the Texas governor, the poll showed.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore would beat McCain 47 percent to 38 percent and Bradley would beat
McCain 49 percent to 39 percent, according to the Quinnipiac pollster.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a Democratic town," Carroll said, referring to the state. "And
Bradley looks better with independents."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not surprising," said Daniel Allen, spokesman for the state Republican
Committee of the Democrats' apparent narrow edge. He said the front-runner is
often the target of other candidates and reporters and that can hurt Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   However, there's time before the primary, Allen emphasized.
</P>
<P>
	   "Governor Bush has a message that really resonates with the families of New
York more than Gore or Bradley," he said.

<HEADLINE> A hard sell: arguing that $40 an hour is grossly unfair  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Here is the challenge Chief Judge Judith Kaye is
taking on in 2000: convincing people that paying someone $40 an hour is, as she
puts it, "absolutely ludicrous" and "totally unrealistic."
<P>
	   She doesn't mean ludicrously too much, she means ludicrously too little.
Kaye wants to substantially raise the amount earned by lawyers assigned by
courts to represent indigent defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to convince taxpayers that more of their money should go to
"underpaid" lawyers - especially to represent possible criminals - is about as
easy a sell as ... say hawking suntan lotion in January in Syracuse or selling
Tennessee Titans jerseys at a Buffalo Bills game.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, "assigned" counsels in New York get $40 an hour for in-court work
and $25 an hour for out-of-court work. Those pay levels have been unchanged
since 1986. Kaye wants the fees to go up to $75 an hour for felony and Family
Court cases and $60 an hour for nonfelony cases.
</P>
<P>
	   She said it would cost about $71.8 million a year to pay for the higher
assigned counsel fees. Court administrators are starting a program they think
could ultimately generate that kind of money - hiring private collection
agencies to go after court-imposed fines and surcharges which now are not being
paid.
</P>
<P>
	   This is not a matter of the state's legal system looking out for its own,
Kaye insists. She said assigned counsels are a bulwark of the justice process
because they guarantee that the poorest defendants still get adequate
representation in court. The entire legal system suffers if any class of
defendants are disenfranchised because of money, the chief judge argued.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the "low" $40 and $25 fee levels, the pools of lawyers willing to
be assigned have shrunk and the whole assigned counsel system is in "crisis,"
according to the chief judge. Lawyers with too little experience are handling
too many cases as assigned counsels, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1989 in the judicial system's Eastern Department - encompassing most of
eastern New York north of New York City - 940 lawyers were taking court
assignments in criminal cases. Today, only about 300 attorneys are doing so,
court administrators say.
</P>
<P>
	   While the pool of available lawyers has been shrinking, the number of cases
in criminal and Family Courts have been skyrocketing.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Office of Court Administration released a report this month
designed to bolster Kaye's argument for boosting the lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
	   It found that only New Jersey, with a $30-an-hour in-court and $25-an-hour
out-of-court scale, pays assigned counsels less. Massachusetts' payment
schedule, more complicated than New York's, is roughly equivalent.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the states New Yorkers like to think of as poorer and more backward
than New York allot their assigned counsels more, including Arkansas (an average
of $80 to $85 an hour), Georgia (up to $60 an hour) and Alabama (up to $50 an
hour).
</P>
<P>
	   Other court-appointed experts in New York get much more for their time than
assigned lawyers, the report noted. They include psychologists ($90 an hour),
psychiatrists ($125 an hour) and physicians ($200 an hour).
</P>
<P>
	   As persuasive as Kaye's argument for giving assigned counsels higher fees
is, she is laboring against both perception and reality in her campaign to get
the governor and Legislature to approve higher fees.
</P>
<P>
	   Her State of the Judiciary address this month noted that the reputations of
the legal and judicial systems are in need of burnishing. Lawyers rarely finish
high in polls of professionals held in high esteem.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to make sure that the public understands that courts provide more
than just prime time plotlines," she said. "Courts protect our fundamental
liberties. And lawyers aren't just fodder for punch lines. Lawyers help keep
this society orderly and free, a model for the world."
</P>
<P>
	   The reality of the working lives of New Yorkers is that the state's per
capita income is about $30,000. That translates to a per-hour wage of $14 for a
40-hour week. That makes $40 an hour seem pretty generous, especially if the
taxpayers making $14 an hour are footing the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   That's apparently the mathematics Gov. George Pataki is looking at. He says
he does "not intend" to agree to higher assigned counsel rates. State Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver, on the other hand, said the rates are too low and wants
to see them go up.
</P>
<P>
	   To be fair, $40 an hour is poor compensation in the realm of the legal
profession, where a good defense lawyer in upstate New York can command
$200-$250 an hour in a criminal case from well-heeled clients. Top-notch
defenders in New York City, where a lawyer's overhead costs are higher, charge
even more.
</P>
<P>
	   With that in mind, the state Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers has a
different opinion about the fee schedule. It said $30 or $45 an hour for
assigned counsels is "abysmally" low, and $60 or $75 isn't that much better.
</P>
<P>
	   Its president-elect, Kathryn Kase, is urging Kaye to push for $100 an hour.

<HEADLINE> Bruno pledges support for expanded program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Senate will approve a measure to double
the number of elderly New Yorkers eligible for a state-subsidized prescription
drug program, Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno pledged Wednesday.
<P>
	   "New Yorkers don't need to go to Canada," Bruno said, recounting tales of
seniors crossing the border to obtain affordable medications. "They need to stay
in New York to buy prescriptions."
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate measure would raise income ceilings for eligibility in the
state's 12-year-old Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Program (EPIC), which
subsidizes prescription drug costs for some senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   Seniors who earn less than $35,000 and couples who earn less than $50,000
would qualify for the program - doubling the eligibility pool to about 229,900
senior citizens statewide. The current cutoff is $18,500 for individuals and
$24,400 for couples. The proposal also cuts average out-of-pocket expenses for
seniors' pharmaceutical purchases from $549 to $429 - or by about 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   New Yorkers age 65 and older are eligible for the program.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno proposed dedicating $125 million of the state's settlement with
tobacco companies to pay for the program's expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an offer no one can refuse," said Sen. Thomas Morahan, the Rockland
County Republican who is cosponsoring the bill with Sen. George Maziarz, a
Niagara County Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the American Association of Retired Persons, Americans age 65
and older account for one third of all prescription drug spending, despite
making up only 12 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
	   Families USA, a consumer group based in Washington, found that the price of
the 50 prescription drugs most often used by senior citizens is rising at four
times the rate of the consumer price index.
</P>
<P>
	   For the elderly, it can become a choice of "paying their bills or taking
their pills," AARP Spokeswoman Jo Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if the bill sails through the Republican-controlled Senate next week,
its fate in the Democrat-controlled Assembly is unclear.
</P>
<P>
	   Eileen Larrabee, spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, said
Assembly Democrats have long advocated broadened EPIC and would be drawing up
their own suggestions.
</P>
<P>
	   "We welcome the Senate aboard," Larrabee said. "The Assembly has been
working to make prescription drugs more affordable for years."
</P>
<P>
	   Though he did not include funding increases for EPIC in his 2000-01 budget
proposal, Gov. George E. Pataki is behind the Senate's efforts, Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, Bruno said the Senate would soon begin investigating
disparities between prescription drug prices in New York and in other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John Marchi, a Staten Island Republican, has filed a bill to prohibit
prescription drugs from being sold at prices higher in New York than in other
jurisdictions and nations.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want pharmaceutical manufacturers to explain to us why this is the
case," Bruno said.

<HEADLINE> Group calls on Bush not to pick pro-casino Pataki as VP  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - George Bush should not pick George Pataki as a
running mate because the New York governor has authorized Indian casinos and
wants to legalize non-Indian casinos as well, a group is contending.
<P>
	   The organization, the New York Institute for Law in Society, took out a
full-page advertisement in Wednesday's Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader newspaper
urging Bush not to select Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   The Union Leader will be the first of several newspapers to run the ad as
the Republican presidential primaries near, according to the group.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad is designed as an open letter to Texas Gov. Bush, the frontrunner to
capture the Republican nomination for president in 2000. It urges Bush to
"review" Pataki's record on casinos before considering him as a vice
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   "The 2000 Republican National ticket cannot have a candidate who supports
the proliferation of casino gambling," the organization said.
</P>
<P>
	   A leader of the Rome, N.Y.-based group, Tom Hunter, said it believes Pataki
has illegally entered into a compact which is allowing Mohawk Indians to operate
a casino on their land near the United States-Canadian border. The group is
arguing - along with other gambling foes and Democratic state legislators - that
Pataki needed the approval of the Legislature before the state could enter into
any gaming compacts with tribes.
</P>
<P>
	   Indians are also seeking to open other casinos in New York, and the Pataki
administration is involved in wide-ranging discussions with New York tribes
about casinos, Indian land claims and other issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki has said he does not like casinos, but believes that since two Indian
casinos are already operating, the state should allow non-Indian casinos to open
in some areas of New York. That way, the state can profit from the gambling
revenues, he said. The Legislature has refused to go along with his casino
legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Hunter said the group may take out the ad again in New Hampshire, where the
first-in-the-nation presidential primary will be held Feb. 1. The group also
plans to run the ad in Thursday's Des Moines Register in Iowa, which is holding
its presidential caucuses on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad will also be in the Albany (N.Y.) Times Union on Thursday, group
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope people pay attention to it," said Hunter, who lives in Syracuse.
"We hope George W. Bush pays attention to it."
</P>
<P>
	   Hunter said his group is conservative in philosophy and is not aligned with
a political party. He refused to disclose its sources of money or how much it
planned to spend on the anti-Pataki ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki is considered a long-shot to be tapped by Bush as a running mate.
Pataki and most of the rest of the New York Republican Party organization have
endorsed Bush for president.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said it is "way too
premature" to be discussing Bush's vice presidential selection.
</P>
<P>
	   "Gov. Bush is focused on earning the presidential nomination," McClellan
said. "Gov. Pataki is a good friend, a strong supporter and Gov. Bush
appreciates his serving as his state campaign chair in New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokeswoman and political adviser Zenia Mucha called the ad "silly"
and "not even accurate."

<HEADLINE> Senator invites New York Jets to move to Yonkers as bidding war  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Yonkers Jets?
<P>
	   State Sen. Nick Spano of Westchester thinks the team and the town would be
great together.
</P>
<P>
	   Spano, a Republican, wrote new Jets owner Robert Wood Johnson Wednesday and
asked him to think about moving the team up the Hudson River to the Yonkers
Raceway when its lease is up at the New Jersey Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
	   The Yonkers facility has 97 acres of land just waiting for someone to do
something with it and "Jets Stadium" would be the perfect fit, the senator said.
"It's feasible, it's accessible and it's available," Spano said.
</P>
<P>
	   And it already has an NFL connection: The Yonkers Raceway is owned by the
Rooney family, owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Spano said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Yonkers, for sure, is ready for the big time," said Spano, noting
the recent additions of Home Depot, Costco and Stew Leonard's to the city of
180,000 that sits 17 miles north of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   New York Jets spokesman Frank Ramos refused to comment, saying he had not
heard about Spano's offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Yonkers Mayor John Spencer cheered the proposal, saying it would be great if
all of the details could be worked out. "You're talking to a lifelong Giants
fan, but I'd gladly be a Jets fan if they moved to Yonkers," Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jets still have eight more years to play in New Jersey but jockeying for
the football team has already begun. Johnson noted in his inaugural news
conference that the Jets have never had their own stadium.
</P>
<P>
	   After starting in the Polo Grounds, former owner Leon Hess moved the Jets
out of Shea Stadium in 1984 and since then they have shared Giants Stadium in
East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have been in the Mets Stadium, Shea Stadium and now this since 1984,
and we want to do everything in our power to provide them with their own
stadium," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has raised the possibility of
constructing a stadium on the West Side and Newark also could be a possibility
for the nomadic team. The Meadowlands also wants the Jets to stay but is feeling
pressure with all the speculation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only things that's changed about your call is the place," New Jersey
Sports Authority spokesman Dan Emmer said. "Yesterday, it was Mayor Giuliani
with a stadium on the West Side, then it was Newark, and now it's Yonkers."
</P>
<P>
	   Spano thinks he has the best idea, however. "Geographically, there's no
better place" than Yonkers, Spano said. "It's located just eight miles from the
George Washington Bridge, less than five miles from the Tappan Zee, and it's
easily accessible to several major highways."
</P>
<P>
	   And "let's face it, are there sites in New York City that are accessible,
that are available and that are feasible?" Spano said. "I don't think so. Let's
not lose the Jets to New Jersey again."
</P>
<P>
	   Spano is trying to recruit Gov. George Pataki to his cause, forwarding him a
copy of his letter.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are a number of communities in New York that would love to be home to
the Jets," Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said. "We would love to put the New
York back in the New York Jets."
</P>
<P>
	   However, if his plan works, Spano still wouldn't be in favor of an offical
name change to the Yonkers Jets. "Let's keep it the way it is," he said,
laughing.

<HEADLINE> Bruno pledges support for expanded program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state Senate will approve a measure to double
the number of elderly New Yorkers eligible for a state-subsidized prescription
drug program, Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno pledged Wednesday.
<P>
	   "New Yorkers don't need to go to Canada," Bruno said, recounting tales of
seniors crossing the border to obtain affordable medications. "They need to stay
in New York to buy prescriptions."
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate measure would raise income ceilings for eligibility in the
state's 12-year-old Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Program (EPIC), which
subsidizes prescription drug costs for some senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   Seniors who earn less than $35,000 and couples who earn less than $50,000
would qualify for the program - doubling the eligibility pool to about 229,900
senior citizens statewide. The current cutoff is $18,500 for individuals and
$24,400 for couples. The proposal also cuts average out-of-pocket expenses for
seniors' pharmaceutical purchases from $549 to $429 - or by about 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   New Yorkers age 65 and older are eligible for the program.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno proposed dedicating $125 million of the state's settlement with
tobacco companies to pay for the program's expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an offer no one can refuse," said Sen. Thomas Morahan, the Rockland
County Republican who is cosponsoring the bill with Sen. George Maziarz, a
Niagara County Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the American Association of Retired Persons, Americans age 65
and older account for one third of all prescription drug spending, despite
making up only 12 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
	   Families USA, a consumer group based in Washington, found that the price of
the 50 prescription drugs most often used by senior citizens is rising at four
times the rate of the consumer price index.
</P>
<P>
	   For the elderly, it can become a choice of "paying their bills or taking
their pills," AARP Spokeswoman Jo Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if the bill sails through the Republican-controlled Senate next week,
its fate in the Democrat-controlled Assembly is unclear.
</P>
<P>
	   Eileen Larrabee, spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, said
Assembly Democrats have long advocated broadened EPIC and would be drawing up
their own suggestions.
</P>
<P>
	   "We welcome the Senate aboard," Larrabee said. "The Assembly has been
working to make prescription drugs more affordable for years."
</P>
<P>
	   Though he did not include funding increases for EPIC in his 2000-01 budget
proposal, Gov. George E. Pataki is behind the Senate's efforts, Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Wednesday, Bruno said the Senate would soon begin investigating
disparities between prescription drug prices in New York and in other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John Marchi, a Staten Island Republican, has filed a bill to prohibit
prescription drugs from being sold at prices higher in New York than in other
jurisdictions and nations.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want pharmaceutical manufacturers to explain to us why this is the
case," Bruno said.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton faces questions on personal life, marriage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - On a day when she hoped the talk would center on
such things as her plans for announcing her Senate candidacy, Hillary Rodham
Clinton instead found herself being questioned about her marital fidelity.
<P>
	   For a second straight day, the first lady fielded questions Wednesday about
her personal life, and reluctantly answered them.
</P>
<P>
	   She told a radio talk show host she had never been unfaithful to her husband
and denied rumors she had an affair with former White House Deputy Counsel Vince
Foster, who committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
	   She also told the interviewer what she thought of such inquiries.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think those questions are out of bounds," she told WGR-FM morning host
Tom Bauerle in Buffalo during a campaign swing through New York's second largest
city.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauerle had prefaced his questions by telling the first lady, "You're going
to hate me for this."
</P>
<P>
	   "I do hate you for that," Mrs. Clinton told him.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauerle wasn't done.
</P>
<P>
	   "Have you ever used pot or cocaine?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tom, what did you have breakfast for this morning?" Mrs. Clinton responded.
"No."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked later whether questions about her personal life were fair, she said:
"I don't know that it's fair or unfair. It is on some peoples' minds, but most
of what people talk to me about is the state of their families and their jobs
and their schools and that's what I'm going to be talking about."
</P>
<P>
	   But a short while later, at a senior citizens community center in the
Buffalo suburb of Cheektowaga, Mrs. Clinton said she had been hearing from
people in the audience about the personal questions she had been asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking a microphone, she told the several hundred people that "sometimes in
public life people ask inappropriate, off-the-wall kinds of questions, don't
they? But I want you to know none of that is going to deter me from coming back
time after time to western New York and being part of building a better future
here."
</P>
<P>
	   A day earlier, Mrs. Clinton had told an inquiring television interviewer
that she planned to "spend the rest of my life" with Bill Clinton, the president
whose affair with a White House intern led to his impeachment and a failed vote
in the Senate last year to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
	   That seemed to set the stage for Wednesday's new round of questions by the
media about her personal life as she prepares for a campaign that is expected to
pit her against New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   After her interview with Bauerle, Mrs. Clinton was on WKBW-TV's "AM Buffalo
Show" where she defended the choices she has made in her marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think anybody who's ever been married knows that you have ups and downs
and there are high points and low points," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know people are interested, but this is something that - I'm going to
have to live my own way and make my own decisions about," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the subject she DID want to talk about, Mrs. Clinton told reporters she
would formally announce her candidacy in Westchester County on Feb. 6. Mrs.
Clinton recently moved in to a $1.7 million house she and President Clinton
purchased in the county just north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   After her announcement, Mrs. Clinton said she would embark on a tour of the
state, but that given the season it would not be a reprise of the bus tour that
kicked off her husband's 1992 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it'll be more a van-and-Suburban-and-four-wheel-drive tour, because
I want to go throughout the state," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said they expected the tour to last about a week.

<HEADLINE> A hard sell: arguing that $40 an hour is grossly unfair  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Here is the challenge Chief Judge Judith Kaye is
taking on in 2000: convincing people that paying someone $40 an hour is, as she
puts it, "absolutely ludicrous" and "totally unrealistic."
<P>
	   She doesn't mean ludicrously too much, she means ludicrously too little.
Kaye wants to substantially raise the amount earned by lawyers assigned by
courts to represent indigent defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to convince taxpayers that more of their money should go to
"underpaid" lawyers - especially to represent possible criminals - is about as
easy a sell as ... say hawking suntan lotion in January in Syracuse or selling
Tennessee Titans jerseys at a Buffalo Bills game.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, "assigned" counsels in New York get $40 an hour for in-court work
and $25 an hour for out-of-court work. Those pay levels have been unchanged
since 1986. Kaye wants the fees to go up to $75 an hour for felony and Family
Court cases and $60 an hour for nonfelony cases.
</P>
<P>
	   She said it would cost about $71.8 million a year to pay for the higher
assigned counsel fees. Court administrators are starting a program they think
could ultimately generate that kind of money - hiring private collection
agencies to go after court-imposed fines and surcharges which now are not being
paid.
</P>
<P>
	   This is not a matter of the state's legal system looking out for its own,
Kaye insists. She said assigned counsels are a bulwark of the justice process
because they guarantee that the poorest defendants still get adequate
representation in court. The entire legal system suffers if any class of
defendants are disenfranchised because of money, the chief judge argued.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the "low" $40 and $25 fee levels, the pools of lawyers willing to
be assigned have shrunk and the whole assigned counsel system is in "crisis,"
according to the chief judge. Lawyers with too little experience are handling
too many cases as assigned counsels, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1989 in the judicial system's Eastern Department - encompassing most of
eastern New York north of New York City - 940 lawyers were taking court
assignments in criminal cases. Today, only about 300 attorneys are doing so,
court administrators say.
</P>
<P>
	   While the pool of available lawyers has been shrinking, the number of cases
in criminal and Family Courts have been skyrocketing.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Office of Court Administration released a report this month
designed to bolster Kaye's argument for boosting the lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
	   It found that only New Jersey, with a $30-an-hour in-court and $25-an-hour
out-of-court scale, pays assigned counsels less. Massachusetts' payment
schedule, more complicated than New York's, is roughly equivalent.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the states New Yorkers like to think of as poorer and more backward
than New York allot their assigned counsels more, including Arkansas (an average
of $80 to $85 an hour), Georgia (up to $60 an hour) and Alabama (up to $50 an
hour).
</P>
<P>
	   Other court-appointed experts in New York get much more for their time than
assigned lawyers, the report noted. They include psychologists ($90 an hour),
psychiatrists ($125 an hour) and physicians ($200 an hour).
</P>
<P>
	   As persuasive as Kaye's argument for giving assigned counsels higher fees
is, she is laboring against both perception and reality in her campaign to get
the governor and Legislature to approve higher fees.
</P>
<P>
	   Her State of the Judiciary address this month noted that the reputations of
the legal and judicial systems are in need of burnishing. Lawyers rarely finish
high in polls of professionals held in high esteem.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to make sure that the public understands that courts provide more
than just prime time plotlines," she said. "Courts protect our fundamental
liberties. And lawyers aren't just fodder for punch lines. Lawyers help keep
this society orderly and free, a model for the world."
</P>
<P>
	   The reality of the working lives of New Yorkers is that the state's per
capita income is about $30,000. That translates to a per-hour wage of $14 for a
40-hour week. That makes $40 an hour seem pretty generous, especially if the
taxpayers making $14 an hour are footing the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   That's apparently the mathematics Gov. George Pataki is looking at. He says
he does "not intend" to agree to higher assigned counsel rates. State Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver, on the other hand, said the rates are too low and wants
to see them go up.
</P>
<P>
	   To be fair, $40 an hour is poor compensation in the realm of the legal
profession, where a good defense lawyer in upstate New York can command
$200-$250 an hour in a criminal case from well-heeled clients. Top-notch
defenders in New York City, where a lawyer's overhead costs are higher, charge
even more.
</P>
<P>
	   With that in mind, the state Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers has a
different opinion about the fee schedule. It said $30 or $45 an hour for
assigned counsels is "abysmally" low, and $60 or $75 isn't that much better.
</P>
<P>
	   Its president-elect, Kathryn Kase, is urging Kaye to push for $100 an hour.

<HEADLINE> Group calls on Bush not to pick pro-casino Pataki as VP  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - George Bush should not pick George Pataki as a
running mate because the New York governor has authorized Indian casinos and
wants to legalize non-Indian casinos as well, a group is contending.
<P>
	   The organization, the New York Institute for Law in Society, took out a
full-page advertisement in Wednesday's Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader newspaper
urging Bush not to select Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   The Union Leader will be the first of several newspapers to run the ad as
the Republican presidential primaries near, according to the group.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad is designed as an open letter to Texas Gov. Bush, the frontrunner to
capture the Republican nomination for president in 2000. It urges Bush to
"review" Pataki's record on casinos before considering him as a vice
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   "The 2000 Republican National ticket cannot have a candidate who supports
the proliferation of casino gambling," the organization said.
</P>
<P>
	   A leader of the Rome, N.Y.-based group, Tom Hunter, said it believes Pataki
has illegally entered into a compact which is allowing Mohawk Indians to operate
a casino on their land near the United States-Canadian border. The group is
arguing - along with other gambling foes and Democratic state legislators - that
Pataki needed the approval of the Legislature before the state could enter into
any gaming compacts with tribes.
</P>
<P>
	   Indians are also seeking to open other casinos in New York, and the Pataki
administration is involved in wide-ranging discussions with New York tribes
about casinos, Indian land claims and other issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki has said he does not like casinos, but believes that since two Indian
casinos are already operating, the state should allow non-Indian casinos to open
in some areas of New York. That way, the state can profit from the gambling
revenues, he said. The Legislature has refused to go along with his casino
legislation.
</P>
<P>
	   Hunter said the group may take out the ad again in New Hampshire, where the
first-in-the-nation presidential primary will be held Feb. 1. The group also
plans to run the ad in Thursday's Des Moines Register in Iowa, which is holding
its presidential caucuses on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The ad will also be in the Albany (N.Y.) Times Union on Thursday, group
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope people pay attention to it," said Hunter, who lives in Syracuse.
"We hope George W. Bush pays attention to it."
</P>
<P>
	   Hunter said his group is conservative in philosophy and is not aligned with
a political party. He refused to disclose its sources of money or how much it
planned to spend on the anti-Pataki ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki is considered a long-shot to be tapped by Bush as a running mate.
Pataki and most of the rest of the New York Republican Party organization have
endorsed Bush for president.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said it is "way too
premature" to be discussing Bush's vice presidential selection.
</P>
<P>
	   "Gov. Bush is focused on earning the presidential nomination," McClellan
said. "Gov. Pataki is a good friend, a strong supporter and Gov. Bush
appreciates his serving as his state campaign chair in New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokeswoman and political adviser Zenia Mucha called the ad "silly"
and "not even accurate."

<HEADLINE> Strong Quake Shakes Northern Laos  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook northwestern Laos and was
felt in northern Thailand early Thursday, but there were no immediate reports of
injury or serious damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The Thai government's earthquake monitoring center said the quake struck at
3:59 a.m. with a magnitude of 5.9. Its epicenter was in northern Laos, 340 miles
north of Bangkok, in the Hongsa district near the border with Thailand.
</P>
<P>
	   In the main provincial town of Sayaboury, villagers began shooting rifles in
the air after about five seconds of ``strong shaking,'' said Sisamouth, a United
Nations Development Program official.
</P>
<P>
	   The rattling of doors and shutters from the tremor made people think
intruders were trying to break into their houses, said Sisamouth, who like some
Laotians uses only one name.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the border, the mayor of the Thai town of Thung Chang, Boonraum
Sinsakulvivat, said he was woken by the shaking and told his family to run out
of the house.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have no high buildings here,'' he said, adding that there was no damage
to large storage buildings.

<HEADLINE> Mashburn, Hughes Trade Near  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN BERGER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Miami and Philadelphia were close to a five-player
trade Wednesday night that would send Jamal Mashburn to the 76ers for Larry
Hughes, Billy Owens and two other players, three league sources told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   The trade was expected to be completed Wednesday but was not yet approved by
club executives on both sides. The sources, who had knowledge of the trade and
spoke on condition of anonymity, said an announcement could come as early as
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Hughes and Owens, the Sixers would trade center Nazr Mohammed
and guard Bruce Bowen to make the deal work under salary cap rules, one source
said. Mashburn makes $5.6 million, Owens $2.1 million and Hughes $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Word of the deal sent shockwaves through the Sixers locker room after a
107-89 victory over Atlanta. General manager Billy King declined comment through
club spokespeople, and Larry Brown wouldn't comment, either. The players did the
talking.
</P>
<P>
	   "I say Larry is going to be right here with this team," said Allen Iverson,
Hughes' mentor and best friend on the team. "I mean, why wouldn't they tell me
if something like that was going to happen?"
</P>
<P>
	   Matt Geiger, who also has been named in other trade rumors, said, "We're
improving every night and it's not a smart decision to try to stir something up
like this."
</P>
<P>
	   The deal would leave the Heat with 18 players on the roster, making it
necessary to cut three or make another trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes, a 6-foot-5 guard who turns 21 Sunday, said he'd heard about the
possibility of going to Miami for Mashburn -- but not from anyone in charge with
the Sixers.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes, who scored 18 points Wednesday night, said he talked with King on
Wednesday, but "not about anything going down."
</P>
<P>
	   "We talked. There's no bad blood," Hughes said. "We speak every day. I'm in
a tough situation, they're in a tough situation. There's no bad blood."
</P>
<P>
	   Mashburn, a 27-year-old small forward, is the Heat's second-leading scorer
with 17.3 points per game. He is the kind of swingman and scorer the Sixers
believe they need to advance in the playoffs. The 6-foot-8 Mashburn is in his
seventh year and has played for Dallas and Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes has been an enigmatic talent since Philadelphia drafted him eighth
overall in 1998. A natural No. 2 guard, Hughes doesn't fit the Sixers' plans
because Iverson prefers to play there instead of the point.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes, nicknamed "Smooth" for his silky style, is close friends with
Iverson but has quietly clashed with Brown -- specifically over his defensive
play. Hughes is averaging 10.6 points and 22 minutes per game, but his playing
time has steadily declined. He logged only six minutes Saturday in Atlanta and
11 last Friday against Orlando.
</P>
<P>
	   Owens, a 30-year-old small forward, was acquired from Orlando on Aug. 14 for
Harvey Grant and Anthony Parker. He is averaging 6.6 points and 22 minutes a
game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sixers hosted the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night. Hughes came off the
bench in the second quarter and scored 12 points. Iverson and Hughes, known in
Philadelphia as the "Flight Brothers," mistimed an alley-oop in the final
seconds of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown was not on the bench in the second quarter, but he had the stomach
flu. Asked to comment on the trade as he left the postgame news conference,
Brown declined. The Heat had the night off.

<P>
    EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Tommy Salo stopped 24 shots Wednesday night to
record his first Edmonton shutout as the Oilers snapped the Calgary's four-game
winning streak with a 7-0 victory against the Flames.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Poti and Mike Grier scored short-handed goals 21 seconds apart in the
third period while Doug Weight, Sean Brown, Ryan Smyth, Alex Selivanov and Bill
Guerin also scored for the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
	   Poti scored at 3:56 when he stole the puck at the Calgary blue line and his
light shot was mishandled by a Flames defender and beat Fred Brathwaite.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-one seconds later, Grier and Todd Marchant broke in on a 2-on-1 and
Grier converted Marchant's perfect pass from the boards.
</P>
<P>
	   After Grier's goal, Calgary coach Brian Sutter pulled Brathwaite in favor of
Jean-Sebastien Giguere.
</P>
<P>
	   Weight scored on Edmonton's eighth shot with a long slap shot on a power
play at 6:56 of the first.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown made it 2-0 after taking a drop pass off a faceoff and unloading a
heavy slap shot at 12:51 of the first.
</P>
<P>
	   Smyth increased the Oilers' lead, deflecting Jim Dowd's point shot on a
power play, at 11:02 of the second.
</P>
<P>
	   Selivanov's slap shot from the top of the faceoff circle beat Giguere at
5:28 of the third. It was Selivanov's first goal in 21 games, dating to Dec. 1
against the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
	   Guerin scored Edmonton's third power-play goal with 1:31 remaining.

<HEADLINE> Pay Phones Hit by Cellular Flourish  </HEADLINE>
    By HOPE YEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Raymond Spera says he is almost always on the phone
checking messages at work, calling kids at home or making appointments with
friends and associates.
</P>
<P>
	   But these days, he doesn't bother to hunt down a public telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   "Quite honestly, I don't use a pay phone at all, because I have this," said
Spera, 34, waving a cellular phone, which rang insistently on a recent Sunday
afternoon in the city's upscale Rittenhouse Square.
</P>
<P>
	   "Before, I would run into vandalized or out-of-order pay phones all the
time. I would only use them when I had to," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spera is among a fast-growing number of consumers who shun pay phones in
favor of increasingly affordable wireless phones that can be used to send or
receive calls anytime, anywhere and then tucked away in a pocket or purse.
</P>
<P>
	   Pay phone providers are feeling the pinch.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationwide figures are not kept on the decline, but pay phone providers
across the country say it is noticeable, especially in larger cities where the
volume of calls is bigger.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there is any question that wireless phone usage has had a
definite impact," said Vince Sandusky of the American Public Communications
Council, which represents independent phone companies. "Most of the companies
... don't just throw up a pay phone wherever they might want one anymore."
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic Corp., which operates 90 percent of the public booths in the
Northeast, says it had a 14 percent drop in 1999 pay phone revenue, following a
10 percent decline in 1998. Pacific Bell said a similar decline seemed
"intuitively correct," though it did not have figures.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a far cry from the days of the first coin-operated telephone,
introduced in 1889 by William Gray in Hartford, Conn., said Sheldon Hochheiser,
a historian for AT&AMP;T Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   "The story goes that he had a wife who had taken ill," he said. "He didn't
subscribe to a phone. So he went to the nearest place -- a local shop -- but the
foreman wouldn't let him use the phone. It got him thinking there should be
another way."
</P>
<P>
	   It was a clunky wooden thing, with a listening receiver, a speaker to talk
into and no coin return, Hochheiser said. But Gray's coin-operated phone worked,
and it got rid of an earlier generation of pay phones, which required costly
attendants who collected fees.
</P>
<P>
	   It also opened up service to about 90 percent of the population who could
not afford a home line. In 1902, more than 81,000 pay phones were in use
nationwide, a figure that increased considerably in 1912 when New York City
installed 25,000 pay phones. By that time, companies had switched to a
standardized metal design which basically remained until the 1960s, Hochheiser
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, there are about 1.6 million pay phones in the United States at a time
when only 3 percent of the population lacks home service, officials say. But the
number of pay phones is likely to decline as several companies are tearing down
underused phones, concentrating those that remain in more lucrative locations
such as transportation centers, downtown street corners and office buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   The chief reason for this re-evaluation comes from the roughly 80 million
cell phones now in use nationwide, a number that continues to grow rapidly as
the devices become smaller and cheaper, according to the Washington-based
Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the rise of prepaid calling cards and dial-around calling plans
-- such as the 10-10 discount programs -- have siphoned away revenue, since pay
phone providers only receive small compensation when a competitors' card or
calling plan is used at their public booths.
</P>
<P>
	   And then there's the image and upkeep. In larger cities, companies say
vandalism can be commonplace, leaving phones run-down and out-of-order.
</P>
<P>
	   All of these factors could lead to the extinction of pay phones, says Anand
Anandalingam, a professor of information management at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.
</P>
<P>
	   "The chances are, the traditional pay phones that are wired are going to
become obsolete," he said. "They may be replaced by a wireless equivalent ... so
when you enter a mall, you can pick up some kind of cordless phone to make a
call."
</P>
<P>
	   Nicholas Economides, an economics professor at New York University's Stern
School of Business, agreed. Already, at least one entrepreneur is developing a
prototype for a "disposable" cell phone, which comes with prepaid minutes,
Economides said.
</P>
<P>
	   But fans of pay phones aren't writing them off just yet, contending they
still offer the greatest protection from dropped calls, static interference and
even bugged lines.
</P>
<P>
	   And that may have benefited at least one group.
</P>
<P>
	   "Amongst gangsters, they're reluctant to talk on cell phones and in their
homes because their lines could be wiretapped or picked up," said Fred Martens,
former executive director of the now-defunct Pennsylvania Crime Commission,
which tracked the Philadelphia crime family and other groups.
</P>
<P>
	   "So a pay phone is still a vehicle for them," he said. "As long as the mob
is alive, pay phones will have a viable market."

<HEADLINE> Blazers 105, Spurs 95  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Rasheed Wallace scored 22 points and helped end Tim
Duncan's streak of 61 straight double-figure scoring games as the Portland
Trailblazers beat the San Antonio Spurs 105-95 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the first meeting between the teams since the Spurs swept the Blazers
4-0 in the Western Conference finals last season on their way to the NBA title.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Blazers wanted to make a statement against the defending champs, it
came across loud and clear. Bouncing back from its first two-game losing streak
of the season, Portland never trailed and held a double-figure lead most of the
second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Duncan, who entered the game averaging 24.8 points, scored just nine points
and had six rebounds in 38 minutes. He did not connect on his first field goal
until dropping in a jump hook from the corner with 8:06 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallace hit seven of his first nine shots in the first half to lead a
balanced Blazers attack. Arvydas Sabonis added 17 points, Bonzi Wells 21 and
Detlef Schrempf 11.
</P>
<P>
	   David Robinson led the Spurs with 29 points and 12 rebounds and Avery
Johnson added 18. But Johnson, the Spurs point guard, had just one assist.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spurs made a late charge when they trimmed a 17-point fourth-quarter
lead to five with about three minutes left. But after Horace Grant snared a key
offensive rebound, Scottie Pippen swished a 3-pointer from the top of the key
with 1:57 left to increase the lead to 98-90.

Mideast Peace Deadline May Be Missed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration acknowledged Wednesday that
Israel and the Palestinians may miss a mid-February deadline for concluding the
outline of a final settlement of their long dispute. With Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat due to call at the White House on Thursday, State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said if Israel and the Palestinians delayed there would
be no framework agreement by Feb. 13 or a formal settlement by the fall, as
planned. "It's our view that the parties have some tough decisions to make," he
said. These include whether the Palestinians are to have a state, whether
Jerusalem is to be shared by Israel with Arafat and how much more land Israel
will turn over to his Authority.

Seattle, said Mike Moore after addressing a U.N. senior management meeting

according to a new study. The number of Americans who go hungry has held steady
for the last four years, despite unprecedented economic growth, the Center on

1996. Researchers pulled together federal and state estimates on hunger, along

Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged the Security Council deploy a total of 5,537

Researchers Warn About La Nina

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Unusual weather driven by La Nina cooling in the Pacific

Wednesday after analyzing new satellite data. If the interpretation is correct,
the Southern states, as well as the Southwest, could be in for 20 years or more
of mild and relatively dry winters while the Pacific Northwest and the East
could get socked by strong winter storms. The Pacific Ocean's surface water
temperature is a dominant force behind storm intensity as well as the path of

billion package of health insurance initiatives for his final year in office,
asking the Republican-dominated Congress to approve the largest investment in
health care since Medicare was created in 1965. Less expensive versions of the
programs died last year, in part because of the president's own veto of the
Republicans' $792 billion tax-cutting plan. "These proposals are a significant
investment in the health of Americans, another step toward giving every American

<HEADLINE> Indians Sale to Dolan Approved  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Acting with unusual speed, baseball owners voted Wednesday
to approve the $320 million sale of the Cleveland Indians to Larry Dolan and his
family trusts.
</P>
<P>
	   Dolan, the managing partner of a small law firm in the suburb of Chardon,
Ohio, doesn't plan any changes in the management of the Indians, who have won
five straight AL Central titles and advanced to the World Series in 1995 and
1997 -- losing to Atlanta and Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very, very pleased with them," he said of the Indians' staff, headed by
general manager John Hart. "The old axiom, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'
applies here."
</P>
<P>
	   The sale, which needs approval from the team's public shareholders when they
meet Feb. 7, will be a record for a baseball team, topping the $311 million paid
by the Fox division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. for the Los Angeles Dodgers
in 1998. The Indians said the sale should close next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobs and his late brother, David, bought the struggling franchise for
about $45 million on Dec. 9, 1986. The team, without a Series title since 1948,
endured five straight losing seasons through 1993 but turned around when it
moved into Jacobs Field in 1994. The Indians have sold out every home game since
early in the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Under an agreement already in place, the ballpark name will remain Jacobs
Field at least through the 2006 season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Under Dick Jacobs' stewardship, the Cleveland Indians' story is one of the
most remarkable I've ever seen," commissioner Bud Selig said. "The club is in
wonderful hands now with Larry Dolan."
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobs, who had the Indians sell stock to the public in June 1998, predicted
the team will continue to prosper.
</P>
<P>
	   "The industry is on the right track," he said. "I have total confidence in
the industry."
</P>
<P>
	   Dolan wasn't concerned that money could be taken away from the Indians --
one of baseball's top revenue producers -- by Selig under the sweeping powers he
was given Wednesday to restore competitive balance.
</P>
<P>
	   "We may be one of the losers in that category, but if you look at the long
term, it's something that has to happen," Dolan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobs and Dolan agreed to the sale Nov. 4. Most baseball sales have taken
6-18 months to gain approval from owners.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Snub Miffs Sprinter Bailey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- If sprinter Donovan Bailey wants to race at the 2000 Sydney
Olympics, he's going to have to earn the chance.
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Olympic Association on Wednesday released a list of athletes who
already have achieved the selection standard for the Summer Games, and Bailey
was not among them.
</P>
<P>
	That means, despite winning the gold medal at the previous Olympics in Atlanta
in 1996, Bailey has to run the 100 meters in 10.23 seconds or better by Aug. 13
or miss out on the Games.
</P>
<P>
	Bailey, 32, suffered a rupture of his Achilles tendon in September 1998 and
returned to competitive track on June 12, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	While he was healthy for most of last season, he was never in top race shape,
and his best time was 10.19. Because the time was wind-aided, however, it was
not considered an official time and does not count toward team qualification.
</P>
<P>
	Athletics Canada president John Thresher said it would be ``an interesting
idea'' for the COA to consider pre-selecting defending Olympic champions to the
team without forcing them to make domestic standards. But Thresher said he is
confident Bailey will achieve the standard this season without much difficulty.
</P>
<P>
	``It would (have been nice),'' Bailey said when asked if he should have been
pre-selected to the team. ``But I can't worry about that. I have got to do what
I've got to do and that is get ready to compete.
</P>
<P>
	``I am not running for accolades, but a little bit of respect would be nice.''

<HEADLINE> Red Wings 3, Canucks 3, Tie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Brendan Shanahan scored two power-play
goals Wednesday night as the Detroit Red Wings overcame an early three-goal
deficit to earn a 3-3 tie with the Vancouver Canucks.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Lapointe capped a three-goal second-period and Pat Verbeek and Chris
Chelios had two assists for the Red Wings, 8-0-3 in their last 11 meetings
against Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
	   Verbeek has 501 career assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit, winless in five games (0-3-2), took over first place in the Western
Conference, one point ahead of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Schaefer, Vadim Sharifijanov and Greg Hawgood scored first-period
power-play goals for the Canucks, 2-7-2 in their last 11 games, and 0-5-1 in
last six home games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canucks only had 10 shots after the first period.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver did have an opportunity to win before overtime. With goalie Chris
Osgood out of position, Hawgood chipped the puck over the net with 53 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
	   Lapointe knotted the game 3-3 with 1:08 left in the second.
</P>
<P>
	   Shanahan started the rally with power-play goals at 4:21 and 13:11 of the
period. Shanahan, who ended a five-game goal drought, has 26 on the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaefer opened the scoring 4:58 in, stuffing in loose puck at the side of
the net. Sharifijanov, acquired last week from New Jersey, scored his second
goal in three games with Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawgood made it 3-0 when he fired a shot in through a crowd with 22.6
seconds left in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   The three power-play goals marked the 12th time in franchise history that
Vancouver has scored three power-play goals in one period -- the last time Jan.
4, 1997 against Toronto.
</P>
<P>
	   It also matched a Red Wings mark, accomplished many times, for most
power-play goals given up in one period.
</P>
<P>
	   The Red Wings, one of the league's better penalty-killing teams, have
surrendered six power-play goals in their last three games.
</P>
<P>
	   Osgood, winless in his last five starts (0-4-1), has gone 1-6-1 -- and given
up 28 goals -- since returning after missing 15 games with a fracture in his
blocker hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Potvin, who faced 24 shots, is 0-5-2 since the Canucks acquired him last
month from the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
	   The Red Wings were without Sergei Fedorov, who missed his second straight
game with a sore neck.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A jury will not be allowed to hear that three of the
four New York City police officers accused of fatally shooting an African
immigrant were involved in past shootings.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Joseph C. Teresi also rejected a motion filed by eight news
organizations seeking to open all hearings and papers to the press.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be horrific to have similar circumstances concerning publicity
occur again,'' he wrote in Wednesday's decision. An appeals court moved the
trial to Albany because of pretrial publicity.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Richard Murphy and Kenneth Boss were
indicted on second-degree murder charges in March after they fired 41 bullets at
Diallo while searching a neighborhood for a rape suspect. Defense attorneys say
the officers mistakenly believed Diallo was reaching for a gun.

<HEADLINE> N.M. OKs Foreign-Language Jurors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court has upheld a ruling that
people cannot be disqualified from serving as jurors because they don't speak
English.
</P>
<P>
	   The court unanimously denied a request from Dona Ana County District
Attorney Susana Martinez to overturn a ruling by a judge in Las Cruces. That
judge had ruled that non-English-speaking people could not be kept off juries
and required the court to provide interpreters to accompany jurors who do not
speak English.
</P>
<P>
	   In Wednesday's high court ruling, Chief Justice Pamela Minzner quoted the
state Constitution, which says residents cannot be restricted from sitting on
juries on account of an inability to speak, read or write English or Spanish.
</P>
<P>
	   Melissa Reeves, an attorney for the state, said statewide procedures will be
set up for non-English-speaking jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the ruling we expected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dona Ana County district attorney's office had argued against allowing
non-English-speaking jurors, warning that inexact translations could cause
problems.

<HEADLINE> Union Membership Rises in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM VERDIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Claudia Johnson divides her working career into two
phases: pre-union and afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   She is one of more than 70,000 Los Angeles County home care workers who
unionized last year, helping propel union membership nationwide to its largest
increase in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationwide, the number of union members was 16.5 million in 1999, an
increase of 265,000 from the year before, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor
Statistics reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor leaders estimated that at least 600,000 workers joined up in 1999,
although the net gain was 265,000. And while the country added 2.7 million jobs
last year, the overall percentage of workers who carry a union card remained at
13.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, one particularly bright spot for labor leaders was the number of
workers who organized in fields not traditionally associated with unions,
including doctors and the Los Angeles home care aides.
</P>
<P>
	   Before voting to join the Service Employees International Union last
February, home care workers were subjected to a variety of poor working
conditions, said Johnson, 65, who has bathed, fed, medicated and cleaned up for
elderly or disabled clients for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Workers' checks would sometimes arrive months late, they had to work when
sick because there was no one to cover for them and many worked overtime for
which they were never paid, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The union negotiated an 8 percent raise, implemented a screening process for
applicants and instituted a number of work rules that have better defined the
job.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it made us feel better about the job we do,'' Johnson said. ``A
lot of people want to get into it now because of the union.''
</P>
<P>
	   Labor leaders are hoping for more of the same in other fields. They said the
growth in union numbers should translate into more political clout for organized
labor in this year's elections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the year 2000, you're going to see the largest and most significant
activity that grassroots workers have exercised in any political election,''
said AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney, whose organization has endorsed Vice
President Al Gore for president.
</P>
<P>
	   Expected to add to that clout are the 112,493 new members working in the
private sector that unions added to their rolls in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Traditionally, government employees and contractors have been the stronghold
of the labor movement. While that remains the case, union organizers note that
this year's gain in the private sector reverses a membership decline in that
area that had been going on since 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The private sector growth is a clear sign that our efforts to think
strategically and creatively are beginning to bear fruit,'' said Kirk Adams, the
AFL-CIO's organizing director.
</P>
<P>
	   The novel approach has been to spread the union gospel through a variety of
occupations, not just the jobs that require hard hats. For example, in the last
year, 45,000 doctors joined unions.
</P>
<P>
	   Some high-tech and communications workers also are beginning to explore
unions at computer giant Microsoft, Internet retailer Amazon.com, computer maker
IBM and telecommunications giant AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the Labor Department reports that 37 percent of government workers,
including local police and firefighters are union members, compared with only
about 9 percent of private sector employees.
</P>
<P>
	   It is too early for unions to declare a high-tech victory, said economist
Ken Goldstein of the Conference Board, a business-sponsored study group in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unless they can start to organize the office, days like this are going to
be few and far between,'' he said. ``For all the good news this is from their
point of view, this is a quite limited and perhaps a quite temporary
celebration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Adams said that for unions to continue to grow in a rapidly expanding
economy they must add between 500,000 and a million workers a year -- not a
small hurdle because so many union jobs are lost to attrition. Labor leaders
estimated that at least 600,000 workers joined up in 1999, although the net gain
was 265,000.
</P>
<P>
	   And while the country added 2.7 million jobs last year, the overall
percentage of workers who carry a union card remained at 13.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Unions now are trying to win over future workers before they hit the job
market. For example, Sweeney on Wednesday was headed to Dartmouth College in New
Hampshire to woo students.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're turning the corner, but we're not at our destination yet,'' Sweeney
said. ``Our challenge for the future is to remain focused and to broaden our
efforts.''

<HEADLINE> German FM Poised for Top IMF Post  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German officials have renewed their campaign to
promote German Deputy Finance Minister Caio Koch-Weser as the next head of the
International Monetary Fund, creating a stir as finance ministers from the
world's seven richest nations head to Tokyo for a weekend meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Brazilian-born German is viewed by supporters as a balanced
representative of the developing countries, which get help from the
international fund -- and the rich, Western nations, which are its largest
contributors.
</P>
<P>
	   Picking a successor to current head Michel Camdessus is not officially on
the Group of Seven agenda, but there will be plenty of talk in the hallways when
the finance ministers meet Saturday, given Camdessus' scheduled exit next month.
</P>
<P>
	   With both France and the United States cool on Koch-Weser for lacking a
high-profile and hard-core financial background, German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder has intensified the campaign to put his candidate at the helm of the
182-nation organization based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Ahead of the G7 finance meeting, Schroeder sent letters to the 24 countries
that make up the IMF's executive committee promoting Koch-Weser as a competent
adviser and good negotiator. Schroeder's chief foreign policy adviser, Michael
Steiner, summoned ambassadors of 42 countries to further pitch the Koch-Weser
candidacy on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Schroeder put the push in high gear after France indicated last week it was
promoting former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius. But France has already chosen
three of the last four IMF heads, including Camdessus, and Fabius described
speculation that he was a candidate "flattering" but untrue.
</P>
<P>
	   Others vying for the job -- which has always been held by a European --
include Italian Treasury Director Mario Draghi and two Brits -- British
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown and Andrew Crockett, who heads the Bank
of International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan also is promoting former vice finance minister for international
affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara -- known as "Mr. Yen" for his influence on currency
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   A German has never held the job, and Koch-Weser -- who has 26 years of
international experience at the World Bank -- would be a natural choice, his
supporters say.
</P>
<P>
	   "Germany is growing in influence and it is playing a more important role in
the international forum, so I think it would be very healthy for the world, if
you could find Germans like Koch-Weser to play a bigger role," said Peter Eigen,
a former World Bank colleague who now leads Transparency International, a
Berlin-based group dedicated to fighting political corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch-Weser rose quickly through the ranks at the World Bank, serving first
as an economist and then as a health projects officer for the organization,
which works closely with the IMF to finance development projects, mostly in
poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
	   He also created and administered a joint IMF-World Bank project in Ghana
that retrained workers in the bloated public sector for private sector jobs, and
worked on an anti-corruption campaign to ensure bank funds actually reached
their intended recipients.
</P>
<P>
	   He had been promoted to managing director at the bank when Germany's Finance
Ministry recruited him in April to strengthen Schroeder's Cabinet after
then-Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine resigned in a political spat.
</P>
<P>
	   Eigen said Koch-Weser's strength is being able to build consensus without
twisting arms -- a key to dealing with some of the critical issues the IMF now
faces, including the integration of Russia and Africa into the world economy, as
well as bringing China into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   But Koch-Weser also has no experience as a top finance minister or central
bank governor, and that makes him a less attractive candidate to IMF members who
value a foundation in economics and finance.
</P>
<P>
	   That will play a major role as pressure mounts for the IMF to restructure
itself -- particularly in the United States, which has criticized the fund for
its loans to Russia and its handling of the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   There are also political obstacles to his candidacy. Japan is the IMF's
second-largest financial contributor after the United States, and has repeatedly
demanded a bigger voice in the organization. Already several major Asian
nations, as well as Russia, have openly supported Sakakibara's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the United States has given Koch-Weser a lukewarm
reception -- partly from an interest in keeping the spot open for U.S. Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, who could lose his job after the upcoming
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Camdessus' deputy, Stanley Fischer, is expected to fill in
for at least part of his boss' remaining two-year term.

<HEADLINE> Haitian Slum-Dwellers Dream of U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By DAN PERRY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- In a rocky ravine painted orange by the
setting sun, children scoop water from an open sewer for a bath. Vendors make a
halfhearted effort at a last sale. And eight members of the Charles family
huddle inside a one-room cinderblock shack that is their home.
</P>
<P>
	   On this day the family has scraped together enough for a pot of corn mush
that, lacking charcoal, they have heated over a fire of sticks and plastic
bottles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I dream of going to the United States,'' Willy Charles says wistfully. The
gaunt former sugar mill worker has been unemployed for years. ``I want my kids
to go to school, and to have enough to eat,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
	   Millions of Haitians share Willy's dream. In recent years, many thousands
have tried to make it to the United States -- illegally -- only to be caught and
sent back.
</P>
<P>
	   Their plight was underscored by the case of two Haitian children who were
separated from their mother, Yvena Rhinvil, after a boat smuggling 411 Haitians
ran aground off Florida on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Rhinvil was brought ashore for medical treatment. Her daughter and son, ages
8 and 9, were returned to Haiti. Only after a storm of protest by
Haitian-Americans did U.S. officials agree to reunite the children with their
mother, who is seeking asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   Willy Charles' family had no such luck.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, using family connections, they boarded a U.S.-bound boat without
paying smugglers' fees. Within hours the overloaded vessel was spotted by the
U.S. Coast Guard. The six months of detention that followed at the U.S. Navy
base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are remembered as a wondrous time of thrice-daily
meals and hopes for asylum -- before the sad trip back home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I could, I'd try again,'' says Willy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The United States doesn't owe us anything,'' he says. ``But here there's
no hope for me and my kids.''
</P>
<P>
	   His six children don't go to school; the only ones nearby are privately run
and unaffordable on the $1-a-day his wife, Ginette, earns sweeping streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Over years of wishful thinking, Willy and Ginette gave the children
American-seeming names: Witchy, and Jeff, and five-year-old John, born during
the detention at Guantanamo Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Here is not my country,'' insists the boy, wearing only a shirt, his arm
badly infected from sleeping on a dirty floor. ``I have no food. I am always
hungry.''
</P>
<P>
	   A world away, in Miami, Haitian-Americans are in an uproar over the
immigration standards applied by the United States. Cubans, aided by a 1966 law,
are usually allowed to stay if they reach U.S. shores. Haitians and others,
however desperate, usually get the boot. Accusations of racism have been aired.
</P>
<P>
	   Here in Haiti, most have never heard of the protests or of Elian Gonzalez,
the Cuban boy whose saga sparked them.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because there are only four TVs and 41 radios per 1,000 Haitians.
Only a third of adults can read. In a country of 8 million, only a few thousand
newspaper copies are distributed daily -- and few can afford them. Haiti's
annual per capita income of $250 is the lowest in the hemisphere; an estimated
60 percent of the workforce is unemployed.
</P>
<P>
	   Misery cascades into every aspect of life, and death. Infant mortality is a
whopping 74 per 1,000 births. Life expectancy is around 55.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If, today, the United States opened wide its borders to Haitians, I'm sure
50 percent of the adult population would leave immediately,'' says Carol Joseph,
director of the Haitian National Migration Office.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, there are some 400,000 naturalized Haitians living in the United
States. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates another
105,000 Haitians reside in the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
	   Haitian-Americans send home more than $300 million a year, according to U.S.
Embassy estimates -- fueling much of Haiti's economy and adding to the mystique
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Haitian boat people began heading north some 20 years ago, fleeing the rule
of Jean Claude Duvalier, the notorious second-generation dictator also known as
Baby Doc. Duvalier's regime was toppled in 1986, and the country's first free
vote, in 1990, elected former Catholic priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide. A year
later Aristide was overthrown, replaced by a bloodthirsty military regime.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States forced out that regime in 1994, reinstalled Aristide, and
backed up Haitian democracy with 20,000 troops. The remains of that force --
several hundred troops on a humanitarian mission -- depart this month, to be
replaced by temporary reservist missions.
</P>
<P>
	   Parliamentary and presidential elections are scheduled for later this year,
but most Haitians seem to no longer care. Although random violence has been
reduced, poverty and corruption endure.
</P>
<P>
	   Willy Charles doesn't plan to vote. ``Our politicians are evil,'' he says
flatly.

<HEADLINE> Oregon, Cuban Students Debate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Oregon and Cuban high school students formally debated
international relations, agreeing that baseball contacts should continue between
the two countries and that the U.S. trade embargo should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities barred most of the foreign press from covering Wednesday's
exchange, but a reporter from The (Portland) Oregonian was allowed into the hall
for part of the debate sponsored by the Union of Young Communists at the Lenin
Technical School on the outskirts of Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite protests in both the United States and Cuba over Elian Gonzalez, the
6-year-old boy's case was not a topic of Wednesday's debate, at least not for
the brief time that the Oregonian reporter was allowed to watch. The debate was
scheduled before Elian was rescued off the coast of Florida in late November,
sparking a fight over whether he should stay with his Miami relatives or be
returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Cuban students unaccustomed to hearing local criticism of their
system during formal events gasped when Misha Isaak of Lincoln High School said
Cuba would have to improve its human rights record as part of a reconciliation
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The American students also found the Cubans better informed debaters than
some had expected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are not these programmed robots,'' said Skye Mathison, 18, of Ashland
High School. ``They are very good at defending their country and picking apart
your logic.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 27 American students and nine chaperones arrived in Havana on Monday for
the visit. Members of the American team, led by Ashland High School debate coach
John Tredway, are from a number of schools, including Ashland High School and
Portland's Lincoln High School.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-six Cuban students also took part in the debates and 40 Cuban
students watched.
</P>
<P>
	   The students unanimously agreed after a debate that baseball contacts
between the two countries should be continued. They also voted 45-3 that the
U.S. trade embargo of Cuba should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
	   And after a wrangle over wording, the two sides both endorsed the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Cubans grow up in a society where the U.S. embargo is an ever-present topic
of discussion. And some Cubans said that left the visiting students at a
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Enrique Aparicio, cultural affairs director of the Cuban school, said
the U.S. students sometimes seemed lost when the Cubans discussed specific parts
of the embargo. ``The embargo affects us so much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The debates were held in a congress format, with the two teams arguing
resolutions and then voting on them.
</P>
<P>
	   The trip was possible because of President Clinton's announcement a year ago
of policy changes to increase contacts between American and Cuban citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the policy shift, the Baltimore Orioles and Cuba's national team
were able to play baseball games both here and in Baltimore last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has also allowed an increase in direct flights
from the United States to Cuba for a limited group of Americans allowed to visit
the communist country, such as journalists, academics and others granted special
licenses from the U.S. Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the U.S. economic embargo imposed in the early 1960s, most Americans
are effectively barred from visiting Cuba because they are prohibited from
spending money there.

<HEADLINE> Tribes Turn to Former Military Bases  </HEADLINE>
   By BART JANSEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dozen California tribes, some facing desperate poverty,
are trying to reclaim prime waterfront property in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   They have filed a federal lawsuit claiming ancestral right to the land,
onetime home of the Naval Training Center that the city of San Diego wants to
develop.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're coastal Indians, but we have no coast,'' said Louis Guassac, a
member of the Mesa Grande Band and elected leader of the lawsuit consortium of
Kumeyaay Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit is another example of a trend: tribes seeking rights to former
military bases. Several rounds of military base closings in the last decade have
offered land-starved tribes the chance to add acreage and economic development
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
	   When the military decides to close a base, other federal agencies and Indian
tribes get first crack at the land. If initial claims are rejected, the Defense
Department designates a local board to determine what should happen to a base.
Competing proposals are whittled down to a winner.
</P>
<P>
	   In Arizona, the Gila River Indian Community south of Phoenix last year
acquired a golf course and a 10 percent stake in development of the former
Williams Air Force Base. In Washington, the Muckleshoot Tribe reached a
settlement with Seattle officials in 1995, giving the city most of the former
Sand Point Naval Base in exchange for cash and help restoring fish runs.
</P>
<P>
	   The need for land for economic development is particularly acute in
California, where reservations tend to be small. The neediest tribes are unable
to raise enough money to expand.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite publicity about casinos, less than one-third of the 558 tribes
nationwide had casinos in 1996 and only 54 made profits worth more than $10,000
per tribal member, according to a recent Bureau of Indian Affairs study.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The general public has this misperception. It's simply not true,'' said
Ron Allen, chairman of Jamestown S'Klallam Tribal Council in Washington state
and first vice president of the National Congress of American Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 464,000 acres the military has identified so far as excess property,
the federal government kept nearly half the land, with most going to the Fish
and Wildlife Service, according to a 1999 General Accounting Office study. State
and local authorities got about one-third of the land.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kumeyaay, a collection of tribes that ranged across Southern California
for 10,000 years before being displaced by white settlers in the 1800s, competed
with five federal agencies for a direct transfer of the 550-acre former base.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Department rejected all the claims in 1994 and designated the
San Diego City Council to decide what to do with the land. The military later
approved the council's plan to accept the base for development, parks and
airport expansion. The city has chosen a private developer, the Corky McMillin
Cos., to build housing and resort hotels at the site at an estimated cost of
$142 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The city must also pay the federal government a negotiated fee for the land
that hasn't been disclosed. By contrast, the Indians would have gotten the land
for free. Payments have ranged from $350,000 to $70 million, depending on the
value of the land and steps, such as building demolition, that the military must
take before turning over the land.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribes filed their lawsuit in Washington, D.C., last month against the
city and the federal defense and interior departments. They want a judge to
block the city from moving ahead with its plans and order that the Kumeyaay
proposal be reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribes envision a development similar to what the city has approved. But
under their plan, the land would be held in federal trust for the Indians and
they would lease it to developers. The deal would yield an estimated $1 million
a year to the city and $30 million per year for the 5,000 tribal members.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal lawyers declined to comment on the lawsuit before their formal reply
is due in mid-February. An attorney for the city who hasn't seen the lawsuit
said San Diego followed proper procedures.

	   Rookie Andre Miller led the Cavaliers with 20 points. Brevin Knight added 15
points and Shawn Kemp, limited to 23 minutes by foul problems, had 14 points and
eight rebounds before fouling out with 5:14 left.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers, who trailed most of the way, scored 10 straight points -- four
each by O'Neal and Bryant -- to take an 83-79 lead with 5:14 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers led the rest of the way. A 3-point shot by Derek Fisher, who had
11 points, made it 88-81 with 2:22 remaining, and the Lakers pulled away from
there.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers, who shot just 34 percent in a lethargic first half, fell behind
63-48 midway through the third quarter when the Cavaliers scored 11 straight
points -- seven by Kemp.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers responded by outscoring Cleveland 19-10 in the final 5:55 of the
period, making it 73-67 entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers made just 6-of-21 shots and were outrebounded 19-14 in the first
quarter, but trailed just 24-21.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal had only two points in the opening 12 minutes, but scored his team's
first 10 of the second quarter. However, with Miller providing a spark off the
bench, the Cavaliers stayed on top throughout the period.
</P>
<P>
	   It was 50-42 at halftime, and some in the sellout crowd of 18,997 at Staples
Center booed as the Lakers left the court.

<HEADLINE> Another Big Musical Nixes Broadway  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL KUCHWARA AP Drama Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- For the second time this season, a major musical production
has canceled plans to arrive on Broadway during what is generally the busiest
time of the theater year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Martin Guerre," producer Cameron Mackintosh's successor to "Cats," "Les
Miserables," "The Phantom of the Opera," and "Miss Saigon," has postponed its
New York opening indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
	   In a carefully worded statement, Mackintosh said Tuesday that because no
appropriate theater was available "we have no alternative but to close the
current scheduled tour following the conclusion of the Los Angeles engagement at
the Ahmanson Theater in April."
</P>
<P>
	   The producer said the show's sets would be stored with the hope that the
musical could be remounted "when the right New York theater becomes available."
</P>
<P>
	   Mackintosh's announcement comes two months after a decision by the producers
of "Wise Guys," a new Stephen Sondheim musical, to bypass Broadway this season
for major reworking.
</P>
<P>
	   "Martin Guerre" already has been reworked -- and reworked -- by composer
Claude-Michel Schonberg and lyricist Alain Boublil. The two also wrote two of
Mackintosh's biggest successes, "Les Miserables" and "Miss Saigon."
</P>
<P>
	   "Martin Guerre" tells the story of a 16th century soldier who assumes
another man's identity. Its current incarnation is a third version of the show,
which originally opened in London in 1996 to tepid reviews.
</P>
<P>
	   This version began a long American tour in September at the Guthrie Theater
in Minneapolis and has done good business on the road, despite critical reviews
from several major publications.
</P>
<P>
	   The Washington Post said the show "humbly plods its way to a new musical
theater combination: ludicrous but tasteful." Variety sniffed that the musical
"lacks the emotional wallop it will need to join the American branch of the
Cameron Mackintosh hall of fame."
</P>
<P>
	   "Wise Guys" went through a monthlong workshop production, starring Nathan
Lane and Victor Garber, last November, before its producers decided not to
proceed to Broadway. The musical about the entreprenurial Mizner brothers and
the Florida land boom of 1920s went back into rewrite.
</P>
<P>
	   Broadway still won't be totally bereft of song and dance in the coming
months. In March, "Contact," a highly praised dance musical, reopens at the
Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center, and Disney unveils its Elton John-Tim
Rice version of "Aida."
</P>
<P>
	   And April brings one of this season's two versions of "The Wild Party," this
one starring Mandy Patinkin, Eartha Kitt and Toni Collette. The other version
opens in February off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
	   For those weary of new work, there will be one more revival, a remounting of
"The Music Man," with Craig Bierko as Professor Harold Hill and Rebecca Luker as
Marian the librarian.

<HEADLINE> New High-tech 'Bull Market'  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSH HOFFNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Craig Kemmet normally hauls his cattle to auctions
and gets a price that fluctuates with the amount of bidding activity.
</P>
<P>
	   But for his current sale, the Tappen, N.D., rancher doesn't have to leave
his computer. An Internet site allows him and others to market cattle throughout
the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can eliminate the guesswork of knowing what you're going to get at the
sale barn," Kemmet said.
</P>
<P>
	   With CattleSale.com, Kemmet lists his livestock information, including
number of animals, weight and price. This week, he advertised 60 steers for a
price of 85 cents per pound.
</P>
<P>
	   Buyers can accept the listed price or make an offer, and when one party
accepts, the deal is done. CattleSale.com, based in Idaho, has field agents who
come to farms and take pictures of herds so buyers can go online and see what
the cattle look like.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's just a world of advantages to marketing cattle that way," said John
Freeman, CattleSale.com founder and president. "The most obvious one is the
number of buyers that a consigner can expose his cattle to."
</P>
<P>
	   Freeman also said the Internet provides farmers with a fast and efficient
means of selling their cattle. Once the cattle information is posted, a deal can
be made within minutes. And ranchers don't have to rely on auction prices that
could wind up being lower, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "A guy can set his price and he can try and get it," Freeman said. "You're
just not committed to throwing the dice on one particular day, let alone one
particular moment."
</P>
<P>
	   Internet livestock marketing has its downfalls, however. Kemmet said the
commission cost of 1.5 percent with CattleSale.com is higher than what auctions
charge. And some buyers like to actually see the cattle they are buying.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's still a desire by everybody to see the cattle, to physically see
them," said Wade Moser, executive vice president of the North Dakota Stockmen's
Association. "Five-hundred-pound steers come in all sizes, shapes and colors."
</P>
<P>
	   North Dakota livestock auctions have been slow to join the online craze, but
some managers acknowledge that "cyber cattle" could become an option as
technology advances and the Internet gains acceptance from producers.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are really very few farmers and ranchers that have anything to do
with the Internet," said Larry Schnell, manager of Stockmen's Livestock Exchange
in Dickinson. "These are mostly older people.
</P>
<P>
	   "The younger generation is a lot more interested in it, and you'll see more
of that," he added. "But the reality is that in North Dakota most of our farmers
and ranchers are at least over 50."
</P>
<P>
	   Moser said he thinks Internet cattle sales will evolve, "but it's not going
to be an overnight deal."
</P>
<P>
	   CattleSale.com has an Internet auction of its own, but Freeman said it
hasn't been popular because ranchers have opted for the page that allows
negotiation between buyers and sellers. He said the popularity makes perfect
sense.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got a live animal that is a long ways from his market. It's not
uncommon for cattle to take a 1,000-mile truck ride, and very common to take a
300- or 400-mile truck ride," Freeman said. "What we need to do is communicate
information across great distances, and that's what the Internet does."

<HEADLINE> Korean Peninsula Nukes Opposed  </HEADLINE>
   By SANG-HUN CHOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- In a rare joint stand, China and South Korea
warned today that proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction
on the Korean Peninsula would touch off an arms race in the region.
</P>
<P>
	   The two former adversaries took that view when their defense chiefs met and
reviewed security on the peninsula, the world's last Cold War frontier, South
Korean officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The two defense ministers voiced their opposition to proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction on the Korean Peninsula, such as nuclear and
biological and chemical weapons,'' South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Yoon
Il-young said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian flew into Seoul on Wednesday for a
five-day visit and met President Kim Dae-jung. The first visit to Seoul by a
Chinese defense chief, it was seen by South Korea as a diplomatic coup over its
rival North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   In today's meeting with his South Korean counterpart, Cho Sung-tae, Chi
urged the two Koreas not to develop weapons of mass destruction, saying
stability on the divided peninsula is vital to regional peace, ministry
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chi's remarks were in line with Beijing's policy -- but South Korean
officials saw them as directed more at Pyongyang, a longtime China ally, than
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
	   North Korea has frozen its suspect nuclear weapons program under a 1994
accord with the United States. Its missile, chemical and biological warfare
capabilities have raised a new spate of alarm in the region.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea's 2000 defense white paper, released in December, said North
Korea has boosted its stockpile of chemical weapons fivefold over the years to
5,000 tons. The North is also believed to have stockpiled anthrax and nine other
types of biological weapons, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korea says it has no weapons of mass destruction on its soil, but some
U.S. experts believe the Seoul government possesses chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Chi's trip signals closer ties between China and South Korea. While wanting
more investment and trade with the South, Beijing so far has tried to keep its
military contacts to a minimum to avoid offending North Korea. China fought on
North Korea's side during the 1950-53 Korean War and has since remained the
closest ally of the isolated communist country.
</P>
<P>
	   During today's meeting, South Korea's Cho proposed that his country and
China exchange visits of military officers, port calls by navy ships and open a
regular dialogue between the two defense ministries, ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chi's response was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
	   China opened diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992. China is
currently South Korea's third-largest trading partner, while South Korea is
China's fifth largest.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides South Korea, Chi's visit is part of a tour of stops in Britain,
Russia and Mongolia.

<HEADLINE> Helms To Visit U.N., Talk About Dues  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms, one of the harshest congressional
critics of the United Nations, is offering the world body a truce.
</P>
<P>
	   But he's mixing his overture with a pitch for structural change and a
smaller U.S. share of the peacekeeping burden.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservative chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who in
the past has ridiculed U.N. leaders as ``dysfunctional'' and ``cry babies,'' is
ready to plead for better relations, a spokesman says.
</P>
<P>
	   But at the same time, Helms, R-N.C., plans to tell the Security Council
exactly what he expects in return for a congressional agreement to pay nearly $1
billion in back dues owed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms was to address the Security Council today, becoming the first
legislator from any nation to do so. He was invited to speak by the current
council chairman, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms plans to ``express his hope for new, better relations with the United
Nations,'' said Marc Thiessen, Helms' spokesman. But Thiessen also said Helms
would assert his view that reforms are needed at the world organization and that
it must know its limitations.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other criticisms, Helms has taken issue with Secretary General Kofi
Annan's calls for increased ``global engagement.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, other members of the Foreign Relations Committee will join Helms
for a meeting with Annan, lunch at U.N. headquarters, and a committee hearing at
a nearby office building that will look into recent developments at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We in the Congress don't do nearly enough of this sort of thing,'' said
committee member Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be a good exchange in general areas. We'll get into things like
Iraq, peacekeeping in the Balkans. We want to hear a little more about Africa,''
Hagel said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Hagel said that ``you always run the risk'' that some committee members
might use the session as a platform for hurling new invectives at the United
Nations. But, he said, ``I think it's critically important for us to get out of
Washington, to get where the world is real.''
</P>
<P>
	   In late 1999, Congress voted to pay $926 million in U.N. arrears over three
years, ending years of debate on unrelated issues like international abortion
programs that had held up the payments.
</P>
<P>
	   But the legislation also included about two dozen conditions, which must be
met for all the money to be released. One of the conditions is that the United
Nations maintain a zero-growth budget. Other conditions call for a reduction in
the U.S. share of the U.N. peacekeeping budget from the current 31 percent to 25
percent; and in the regular budget from 25 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States now must try to persuade the other 187 U.N. members to go
along with these demands.
</P>
<P>
	   The leadoff witness at Friday's hearing will be Holbrooke. After a rocky
confirmation process last year that wound up with Holbrooke's winning Helms'
support, Holbrooke invited Helms to bring his committee to New York to observe
the organization in action.
</P>
<P>
	   The Security Council first planned to accept Helms' testimony behind closed
doors. But at the urging of Helms and Holbrooke, the panel agreed to open the
session.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms arrived in New York on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to public appearances, Helms and committee members have various
private meetings over the next two days scheduled with Holbrooke and other U.N.
officials, said Holbrooke spokeswoman Mary Ellen Glynn.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Women's I.D. Finally Discovered  </HEADLINE>
   By DANNY M. BOYD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- After nearly two years, Mary Joyce Howard has an
identity again.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Howard, 39, was known as Jane Doe as she lay in a near-vegetative state
in a nursing home for most of the past two years. She had no identification when
she was found run down and left for dead on Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma on
Feb. 13, 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The first clue to her identity came in July, when she objected to being
called Jane. Though her speech was slow and hard to understand, she insisted her
name was ``Joyce.''
</P>
<P>
	   The final piece to the puzzle was gleaned last week, after Ms. Howard was
transferred to Presbyterian Hospital with pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
	   Nurse technician Jamie Carey had befriended her and talked to her daily.
When she asked for a Social Security number, Ms. Howard mumbled four digits. Ms.
Carey kept asking.
</P>
<P>
	   A week ago, Ms. Carey decided to look in on Ms. Howard before leaving work.
That's when she got the answer she wanted -- all nine digits of that Social
Security number.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think everything was starting to come back to her day by day,'' Ms.
Carey said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation took fingerprints, which the FBI
matched Tuesday, said Lorna Palmer, a spokeswoman for state investigators. The
FBI was unable to find a match two years ago but the Social Security number led
to her identity, and authorities tracked down her father in High Point, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Presbyterian Hospital and Skyview Nursing Center are raising money to have
Ms. Howard transferred to a North Carolina nursing home. Ms. Howard also said
she has a daughter and two brothers.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Carey said Ms. Howard talked to her father Wednesday and looked forward
to seeing him. The hospital wouldn't provide his name, saying he didn't want to
be contacted.
</P>
<P>
	   No one is sure how Ms. Howard got to Oklahoma or of the circumstances that
led to the hit-and-run that nearly killed her. Ms. Carey said the family
indicated Ms. Howard left North Carolina 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Howard speaks a little bit more as time goes on, but her recovery will
likely be limited, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked the year, she first said 1998 and even gave her age as what she
would have been two years ago, but she comprehends the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She won't get a lot better,'' said hospital spokesman Dennis Gimmel.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Carey said Ms. Howard told her, ``I never thought I'd make it this
far.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Likely To OK Small Stations  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cajun, zydeco, swamp pop, jazz, rock. The Louisiana music
scene boasts a range of styles that the state's artists work to keep alive each
day.
</P>
<P>
	   But getting the eclectic mix of music onto the airwaves poses another
challenge altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of Louisiana music falls through the cracks because of commercial
radio programming,'' said Steve Picou, assistant director of the Louisiana Music
Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal regulators are poised to move ahead with a plan that could help the
music commission and hundreds of other groups tap into local interests: the
creation of low-tech FM radio stations.
</P>
<P>
	   A proposal that would allow for at least 1,000 low-power FM stations run by
community groups, churches and schools to spring up nationwide was expected to
win approval today from the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   It would mark one of the most significant changes in FM radio in decades.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan would let groups obtain noncommercial licenses for 10-watt and
100-watt stations and tailor their broadcasts to the interests of people in
their listening areas. The power of current FM stations ranges from 6,000 watts
up to 100,000 watts.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan has faced opposition from commercial broadcasters, who fear
low-power stations would interfere with existing FM stations.
</P>
<P>
	   One strong proponent is the FCC chairman, Bill Kennard, who hopes the plan
would allow for greater diversity on the airwaves at a time when the media
industry is consolidating.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The airwaves can accommodate lots of voices,'' Kennard said in an
interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He hopes the low-power stations ``will allow some of these nontraditional
voices to speak to their community.''
</P>
<P>
	   For example, high schools could set up their own radio stations or local
broadcasters could serve non-English speaking groups or distinct musical
interests in their regions, Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
	   A 100-watt station, using a 100-foot antenna, could serve a 7-mile area,
according to FCC officials. Smaller stations of 10 watts would cover a 4-mile
radius.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard estimates these power levels will allow for at least 1,000 new
stations around the country. The plan will contain some limitations on the
number of licenses a single entity can own and will have some requirements to
ensure that license holders have a base in the local community, according to
Kennard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to maximize the opportunities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents such as the National Association of Broadcasters have commissioned
studies to document what they say would be the degradation in service to
listeners that could result from such low-power stations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've provided what we believe is unassailable evidence that low-power
stations will add to the interference on an already congested radio band,''
association spokesman Dennis Wharton said. ``Thousands of people won't be able
to hear their hometown radio stations because of this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., a member of the House Commerce Committee, made a
last-minute pitch to the FCC on Wednesday, urging the commission to make sure
all harmful interference issues had been addressed before the commission made
its decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard has said he would not do anything to interfere with standard FM
service. The FCC has said it was confident that low-power stations could coexist
with full-power FM stations.
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to help regular FM stations grow and become financially solid,
the FCC stopped licensing low-powered FM radio stations around 1978. But once
the commission offered a proposal to reintroduce low-power stations last year,
it was flooded with thousands of comments from interested parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Public interest groups say they will welcome the opportunity for more people
to have access to the airwaves, but stress that it's only one step.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wish this could address all of the concerns about mass media
consolidation,'' said Cheryl Leanza of the Media Access Project, a public
interest law firm. ``It's a meaningful step, but it's certainly not a complete
answer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the commission was expected to vote today on rules to ensure
broadcasters and cable companies are recruiting minorities and women to fill
vacancies. This comes after a 1998 court decision that scuttled the FCC's
30-year-old equal employment opportunity rules for TV and radio stations,
declaring them unconstitutional.

<HEADLINE> Former Italian Premier Craxi Dies  </HEADLINE>
   By FRANCES D'EMILIO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROME (AP) -- Bettino Craxi, a Socialist who defied Washington and stood up
to Italy's powerful communists during a record term as premier, died in Tunisia,
where he fled to avoid a prison sentence for corruption convictions. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
	   Craxi died Wednesday of a heart attack at his seaside villa in Hammamet,
said his lawyer, Giannino Giuso.
</P>
<P>
	   Craxi had suffered for years from heart problems and other complications of
diabetes. In November, a Milan court ruled he could return to Italy for bypass
surgery on condition he serve his corruption sentence under house arrest. Craxi
refused.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd only return as a free man. Any different way, I won't return, nor
alive nor dead,'' Craxi said in an interview with RAI Italian state TV.
</P>
<P>
	   His daughter, Stefania, expressed bitterness Wednesday over what she said
was her father's abandonment by his country and many former political allies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They killed him,'' she said, referring to some of Italy's prosecutors and
politicians and ``all the friends who turned their backs on him.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He died like a dog,'' Stefania said, speaking in an interview with RAI
from her father's villa.
</P>
<P>
	   Craxi was Italy's longest-serving premier of the postwar years, holding two
back-to-back terms from August 1983 to March 1987, a remarkable feat in a
country of ``revolving door'' governments.
</P>
<P>
	   He stood up to the United States in 1985, refusing to hand over the
Palestinian commandos who hijacked the Achille Lauro cruise ship and killed an
elderly American passenger, Leon Klinghoffer.
</P>
<P>
	   But Craxi also defied Italian communists -- the largest communist party in
the West and a big-vote getter in Italian politics -- by allowing NATO
nuclear-tipped missiles to be installed in Sicily.
</P>
<P>
	   Craxi was delighted by his political staying power. He once recalled his
reception by other European leaders at a summit in Germany in 1985. ``The other
members looked at me, seemingly relieved -- as if to say, `Oh, we know him, it's
the same guy we saw at the last meeting,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The best vacation is power,'' Craxi once said. Those words came back to
haunt him when his Socialists, along with the Christian Democrats they ruled
with in several coalition governments, were disgraced by the inquiries begun by
Milan's ``Clean Hands'' prosecutors in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   They eventually uncovered a well-oiled system in which businessmen filled
party coffers or politicians' pockets with hundreds of millions of dollars in
exchange for deals with the sprawling state economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout the scandal, Craxi maintained he was an innocent victim of a
vendetta by jealous politicians.
</P>
<P>
	   He fled Italy in 1994, and a year later a Milan court declared him a
fugitive from justice. Two convictions have been upheld by Italy's highest
criminal appeals court, with sentences of 5 1/2 and 4 1/2 years in corruption
cases. He was absolved in three other cases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's not a saint but a politician who did some good for Italians. That's
why he was persecuted by his enemies,'' said Rocco Buttiglione, a former
Christian Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   Born Benedetto Craxi in Milan on Feb. 24, 1934, the future premier was the
son of a Sicilian lawyer who left the island to migrate north. Craxi dropped out
of the University of Milan for the world of politics.
</P>
<P>
	   He was first elected to Parliament in 1968. A decade later, as Socialists
became the key to forming a government without the communists, Craxi worked to
move his party away from the communists and became its leader in 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   Craxi's daughter, Stefania, said he would be buried in Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides his daughter, survivors include his wife, Anna, and son, Bobo.

<HEADLINE> Jury selection begins in second Louima case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal judge began the tedious process of choosing a
jury for the second trial in the Abner Louima police-torture case by selecting
four potential jurors out of a pool of 500.
<P>
	   A teacher who served in the Marines and a Bell Atlantic employee of
Vietnamese descent survived the initial cut Wednesday, saying nothing in their
views or experience would prevent them from being able to reach a fair verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the so-called "blue wall of silence" among police officers, the
silver-haired ex-Marine said, "I think that such behavior occurs in all
professions to some extent."
</P>
<P>
	   He said he believes "cops operate under duress, and not all handle that
duress well."
</P>
<P>
	   Former officer Charles Schwarz, 35, and officers Thomas Wiese, 37, and
Thomas Bruder, 34, are accused of conspiring to obstruct justice by concealing
Schwarz's alleged role in the brutal precinct-house attack on Louima, a Haitian
immigrant, following his arrest on a minor charge in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Former officer Justin Volpe is serving a 30-year term after pleading guilty
to violating Louima's civil rights. Schwarz was convicted and faces a life
sentence, but Volpe now claims Schwarz was not involved.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers, all of whom are white, face five years in prison on the
conspiracy charge. Louima is black.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson wants to pare a jury pool of more than
500 to 75, then pick a panel from that smaller group by Jan. 31. The task is
complicated by widespread publicity and tensions generated by the racially
explosive case.
</P>
<P>
	   By day's end, four prospective jurors, three men and one woman, were
retained and three other men were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
	   Nickerson quizzed the candidates closely about their answers to a written
questionnaire, especially what they knew of the case and whether they had ever
been exposed to racism. Most said they had been.
</P>
<P>
	   The teacher said his son had undergone therapy after suffering "harassment"
by a group of Haitian and Hispanic youths, but said that would not affect his
own ability to reach an honest verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are always going to be some people who are prejudiced to some extent
... I try to look at who that person is rather than the ethnic or racial
background," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under persistent questioning by Nickerson, the man said he believed police
might be justified in using "more force than necessary" if their lives are in
danger.
</P>
<P>
	   Another prospective panelist, a retired engineer, also said the "blue wall
of silence" exists.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it probably happens in some cases, but not in all cases," said the
man, who was excused.
</P>
<P>
	   A defense systems programmer, 60 years old and white, said he had not been
subjected to racism but has known people who were bigoted.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are always bigoted people - there's a lot of that in the world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   That would-be juror also said he had "no respect" for black activist the
Rev. Al Sharpton, who led a series of anti-police marches protesting the Louima
attack. "I don't believe he helps his people at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also questioned Schwarz's conviction, since " the man who committed the
crime said he wasn't there."
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, seated at the defense table, did not visibly react.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz was convicted last year of violating Louima's civil rights by
holding him down while Volpe sodomized him with a broken broom stick. Volpe said
later that Wiese, not Schwarz, was the second officer present in the bathroom in
Brooklyn's 70th Precinct.
</P>
<P>
	   Stuart London and Joseph Tacopina, attorneys for Bruder and Wiese,
respectively, say their clients contend that Schwarz was never in the bathroom.

<HEADLINE> New Dietary Standards Target Fat  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nutrition experts rewriting the nation's dietary
guidelines will likely specify for the first time who might benefit from
moderate consumption of alcohol: middle-aged men and women.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed new guidelines, expected to be made public soon by an 11-member
advisory committee, also will tell Americans to cut down on foods rich in
saturated fats such as meat and dairy products, according to a working draft of
the standards.
</P>
<P>
	   They will include a change in wording intended to make it easier for
consumers to adhere to the maximum fat intake -- renaming the maximum as
"moderate" in fat, instead of "low in fat, according to a working draft of the
new standards.
</P>
<P>
	   The revised guidelines also will put more emphasis on eating whole grains,
fruits and vegetables and will include a special section on food safety.
</P>
<P>
	   "These guidelines will be better than they have ever been," Margo Wootan, a
senior scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition
advocacy group, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   First published in 1980, the guidelines are revised every five years to
reflect the latest developments in scientific research.
</P>
<P>
	   Federally funded nutrition programs, including school lunches and Meals on
Wheels, are required to adhere to the recommendations, and they are also widely
used by professionals and dietitians in advising consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   As for alcohol intake, the existing guideline says "moderate drinking is
associated with a lower risk for coronary heart disease in some individuals."
The draft guideline specifies who those individuals are -- men over 45 and women
over 55 -- and says there is "little health benefit for younger people."
</P>
<P>
	   Moderate drinking is defined as one drink a day for women and no more than
two daily for men.
</P>
<P>
	   The current guidelines on fat recommend that people follow a diet that is
low in total fat. The new recommendation is for a diet that is "moderate in
total fat," but low in saturated fat and cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
	   The recommended maximum fat intake will not change; it will remain 30
percent of total calories, or 65 grams a day in a 2,000 calorie diet.
</P>
<P>
	   Research by the food industry indicates consumers are put off by the term
low-fat and see a moderate-fat diet as easier to follow, even if the fat content
is the same.
</P>
<P>
	   "The goal is not to get people to eat no fat," said Susan Borra, a dietitian
with the International Food Information Council, the food industry's consumer
research arm. "The goal is to get people to manage their fat, to control their
fat. We need to find the word that communicates that."
</P>
<P>
	   Wootan said the wording change emphasizes that "what's really important is
to cut back on is saturated fat."
</P>
<P>
	   Before the guidelines become official, they must be approved by the
departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services. The departments
typically go along with the advisory committee's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
	   Panel members either declined comment on the draft or did not return phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
	   The departments were sued recently by the Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine and other groups. They contend the committee is stacked
with scientists biased toward meat and dairy products because of their ties to
those industries through research or advisory work.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, which seeks to block the committee from releasing its
recommendations, alleges that the guidelines emphasize the consumption of meat,
dairy and egg products, ignoring the special dietary needs of minority groups.
Many blacks, for example, are lactose intolerant.
</P>
<P>
	   "Frankly, it looks to me as if they were written with health interests only
about half weighed-in and the remaining part was written with an eye to the meat
and dairy industries," said Neil Barnard, president of the physicians group.
</P>
<P>
	   The food industry has not necessarily happy with the committee's work,
however.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Cattlemen's Beef Association and the National Pork Producers
Council did not like the emphasis the committee was putting on saturated fat,
telling the committee that it "unfairly indicts all foods of animal origin as
bad."
</P>
<P>
	   The food industry wanted to leave the section on sugar alone. The current
recommendation is for a diet "moderate in sugars." Instead, the section is
expected to be tightened. In its draft, the committee suggests people limit
their intake of foods with added sugars, including desserts, fruit punch and
lemonade.

Israel, Palestinians May Miss Deadline
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration acknowledged Wednesday that
Israel and the Palestinians may miss a mid-February deadline for concluding the
outline of a final settlement of their long dispute. With Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat due to call at the White House on Thursday, State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said if Israel and the Palestinians delayed there would
be no framework agreement by Feb. 13 or a formal settlement by the fall, as
planned. "It's our view that the parties have some tough decisions to make," he
said. These include whether the Palestinians are to have a state, whether
Jerusalem is to be shared by Israel with Arafat and how much more land Israel
will turn over to his Authority.

	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- The cause of the fire that killed three people at
a Seton Hall University dormitory early Wednesday is under investigation. The
fire broke out as hundreds slept, sending terrified students crawling in pajamas
through smoke into the freezing cold. Sixty-two people were injured, one of them
suffering third-degree burns over most of his body. Two of the three male
students killed were found in the lounge and the other was found in a bedroom
nearby. The victims, all 18, were identified by the Essex County medical
examiner's office as Frank S. Caltabilota, John N. Giunta and Aaron C. Karol.
The office did not release their home towns, but friends and relatives said all
were from New Jersey.

Wednesday. There would be no "short-term fix" to the problems highlighted at
Seattle, said Mike Moore after addressing a U.N. senior management meeting

<HEADLINE> Judge bars disclosure of Diallo cops' backgrounds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The jury in the trial of four officers accused of
murdering Amadou Diallo will not learn that three of the officers had been
involved in prior shootings, a judge has ruled.
<P>
	   The decision was one of several pretrial rulings by Justice Joseph C. Teresi
issued after a hearing in Albany on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi also ordered prosecutors to turn over more evidence to the defense
and rejected a prosecution motion asking him to limit testimony by defense
expert witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Teresi, who took over the case after it was moved to
Albany from the Bronx, decided that the new evidence and background information
would not be made public.
</P>
<P>
	   Plainclothes officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Richard Murphy and
Kenneth Boss were indicted on second-degree murder charges in March after they
fired 41 bullets at Diallo while searching a Bronx neighborhood for violent
criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo, struck 19 times, was dead at the scene. Attorneys for the officers
have claimed their clients mistakenly believed the street vendor, a West African
immigrant, was reaching for a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   An appeals court moved the trial upstate after accepting defense lawyers'
claims that pretrial publicity had made it impossible to seat an impartial jury
in the Bronx. The shooting involving white officers and a black victim touched
off weeks of protests alleging brutality against minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   A motion filed by eight news organizations had asked the judge to open all
hearings and papers to the press. But Teresi argued that full disclosure could
taint the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would be horrific to have similar circumstances concerning publicity
occur again," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   According to past reports, Boss shot and killed a man armed with a shotgun
in Brooklyn in 1997, but a grand jury cleared him of wrongdoing. Three civilian
complaints alleging he used excessive force were all found to be
unsubstantiated.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll had three unsubstantiated complaints alleging inappropriate use of
force. In August 1998, a suspect in the Bronx shot at him and Carroll fired
back, but missed.
</P>
<P>
	   McMellon wounded an armed man in Brooklyn in 1998. He has been accused five
times of using excessive force, abuse of authority or racial insensitivity, but
none of the complaints has been substantiated.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy had no prior shooting incidents or civilian complaints.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi argued that "past occurrences" involving the defendants were
"irrelevant and would prejudice the rights of the subject defendants."
</P>
<P>
	   McMellon's attorney, Stephen Worth, said he was confident the defendants,
who were not in court, would get a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our officers shot Amadou Diallo - there's never been a question about
that," he said. "The question is under what circumstances. That's what this
trial is about."
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors declined comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The rulings clear the way for the defense to call two police training and
tactics experts and a psychologist as expert witnesses to try to convince the
jury the officers followed proper procedure. A prosecution motion had warned
that the witnesses may "be asked to offer opinions on ultimate matters which
would invade the province of the jury."
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection is set to begin Jan. 31; the trial is expected to last up to
six weeks.

<HEADLINE> Mighty Ducks 3, Stars 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Antti Aalto and Paul Kariya scored less than five
minutes apart early in the third period and Kariya added an empty-net goal in
the final second as the Mighty Ducks rallied for a 3-1 victory over the Dallas
Stars on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Manny Fernandez, starting in goal because of Ed Belfour's sore groin,
stopped all 20 shots he faced during the first two periods. But the Ducks scored
on their first shot of the third, as Aalto got his fourth goal to spoil
Fernandez's chance at his first NHL shutout.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal ended a scoring drought of 108 minutes and 56 seconds by the Ducks,
who lost 5-0 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Kariya's 21st goal put Anaheim ahead for good, with 13:19 left, and helped
the Ducks to only their second win in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Anaheim's first win in 16 games this season when trailing after two
periods. Dallas has five losses when leading at that point.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Nieuwendyk opened the scoring on a power play at 11:54 of the second
with his first goal since Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stars were on the power play 37 seconds later when Ducks right wing Jeff
Nielsen rammed Nieuwendyk into the boards from behind. Nieuwendyk was forced
from the game with a separated right shoulder that is expected to keep him out
for at least a month.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas forward Jere Lehtinen sustained an ankle injury that will be
re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
	   The 14-year center was playing in only his third game after missing the
previous 10 because of a bruised chest.
</P>
<P>

score 600 goals, hasn't had one in the six games he's played since.

<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged lower against the yen Thursday afternoon
ahead of a weekend meeting of finance officials from advanced nations. Japanese
stocks closed higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 105.36 yen at midafternoon, down 0.16 yen from late
Wednesday, but unchanged from its late New York level of 105.36 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up 110.26 points, or
0.58 percent, to 19,008.01. On Wednesday, the average finished down 298.82
points, or 1.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the greenback moved in a narrow range in quiet trading
ahead of the meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank
governors in Tokyo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar fell overnight to a low of 105.15 yen, but rebounded to 105.37
yen in early Asian trading on bids from some U.S. and Japanese investors ahead
of the G-7 meeting, traders said. Some investors expect the group to publicly
express concern about the strong yen.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese officials have said the yen's rapid rise against the dollar will
hurt Japanese exports and profits, and thus adversely affect the nation's
economy which has begun to recover from a long slump.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 106.60 yen, down from 107.06 yen
late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices rose on buying of several blue chips as
investors were encouraged by a new record close on the technology-rich Nasdaq
Composite Index in New York overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   The market was being led by strong gains in several blue-chip stocks, with
Sony, Toyota Motor and Matsushita Electric Industrial all posting rises
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Three students dead, 62 injured in college dorm fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - The fire alarm blared through the dark
dormitory and most students turned over and went back to sleep, thinking it was
like all the others.
<P>
	   "I thought it was a joke," said Pete Tornatore, 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of a prank, Seton Hall University freshmen woke Wednesday to a smoky
fire that swept through their dormitory, killing three classmates, injuring 62
and sending hundreds of students crawling or jumping out windows into the
predawn cold.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was panic. Everybody was just, "Go, go, go."' said Nicole McFarlane, 19,
of Summit, one of more than 600 students who fled the six-story Boland Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Six students were critically burned, including one who suffered third-degree
burns over most of his body.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the fire, which began in and was largely contained to a
third-floor lounge, was under investigation. Students said that people
frequently smoked illegally in the lounge, but fire officials have ruled out
careless smoking or an electrical problem as the cause, The Star-Ledger of
Newark reported today, citing unspecified sources close to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, investigators are seeking information on three young men whom a
resident adviser had asked to leave the building less than an hour before the
fire broke out, the newspaper reported. Basketball fans had swarmed over the
campus after Seton Hall upset nationally ranked Big East conference rival St.
John's, 78-70, in East Rutherford Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Essex County Prosecutor Donald Campolo declined to comment on what may have
caused the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be a painstaking investigation," Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 48-year-old dormitory was equipped with smoke alarms and 55 fire
extinguishers that had been recently inspected, but did not have a sprinkler
system because it was built before 1984 regulations requiring them, Campolo
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Firehoses had been disconnected last week and piled in the first floor for
removal because the equipment was obsolete, Seton Hall spokeswoman Lisa Grider
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Killed were Frank S. Caltabilota of West Long Branch, John N. Giunta of
Vineland and Aaron C. Karol of Green Brook. All were 18-year-old freshmen. Two
were found in the lounge and the third was found in a nearby bedroom, Campolo
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're pretty devastated," said Karol's father, Joseph, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire stunned the 10,000-student, Roman Catholic university 15 miles from
New York City, bringing hundreds to a prayer service Wednesday night led by
Newark Archbishop Theodore McCarrick.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're glad we're people of faith," McCarrick said. "The mystery of God's
work is always a great mystery."
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the students thought the 4:30 a.m. fire alarm was another in a
string of 18 false alarms that have rung in the building since September. The
university had offered a reward for help finding a prankster.
</P>
<P>
	   But students soon heard screams for help, smelled choking smoke and saw
flames creep under the door.
</P>
<P>
	   "I opened the door just to check," said Yatin Patel. "All the ceiling tiles
were coming down. I saw a ceiling tile fall on someone."
</P>
<P>
	   He put a wet towel under his door, kicked out his window screens and threw
mattresses to the ground in case he would have to jump. Firefighters soon came
and got him and his roommate, who crawled holding on to each other's legs down
the corridor to a stairwell.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicholas Donato, 19, of Sparta, broke his wrist and ankle after leaping from
his third-floor bedroom.
</P>
<P>
	   "He said the smoke was so intense," said Anthony Donato, Nicholas' father.
"He knew where the exit was, and he could not find it."
</P>
<P>
	   Across the street, Mike Williams woke to frantic students banging on his
door, pleading for help. He went to his back yard, got his ladder, and helped
pull 14 students out of the window before firefighters arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   Several students were hanging out their windows, preparing to jump, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were like, 'Please help us. Somebody save us,"' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   After stumbling out into the subfreezing cold, the soot-covered students
milled about the student center, some barefoot, others covering their pajamas
with blankets.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa Sepulveda, an 18-year-old student from New York City, saw one man,
shirtless and burned, moaning as they fled the freshman dorm: "He looked like he
had painted his entire body. It was purple and blue and orange."
</P>
<P>
	   Classes for the university's 10,000 students were canceled for the week and
sports events were postponed through today.
</P>
<P>
	   The injured included two firefighters and two police officers, and injuries
ranged from smoke inhalation to severe burns. The majority had been treated and
released by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hani Mansour, chief of St. Barnabas Medical Center's burn unit, said three
18-year-old males were in the most serious condition with deep burns plus smoke
and heat damage to their throats and lungs.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are on a breathing machine, and they are very heavily sedated,"
Mansour said.

<HEADLINE> Campaigns have raised $20 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Neither candidate has officially declared, but that
hasn't stopped them from raising lots of money.
<P>
	   On Wednesday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's Senate campaign committee announced
that it had raised $12 million in 1999. An hour or so later, first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton's campaign said it had collected $8 million in just six months.
</P>
<P>
	   The figures dwarf the figures raised by then-Sen. Al D'Amato and Sen. Chuck
Schumer the year prior to their 1997 Senate race, in which the two raised a
combined $38 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The Giuliani figures are especially startling because just weeks ago
Giuliani campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum said the goal for the entire campaign
against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was to raise $15 million to $20
million. Additionally, Giuliani has gone on relatively few fundraising trips and
has only a bare-bones campaign staff.
</P>
<P>
	   The race will likely be one of the most expensive Senate campaigns in
history.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're certainly encouraged by the exceptional fund raising," said
Teitelbaum, whose fundraising goal for 1999 had been $8 million. "But given the
Clinton pledge of raising well over $25 million, we expect their fundraising
machine to raise considerably more than we've been able to raise."
</P>
<P>
	   Bill de Blasio, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, said he was happy about the
first lady's numbers because the Giuliani team got a head start in the
fundraising race and the Clinton campaign accepted donations of only $1,000 or
less until October 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're particularly pleased because we started only a few months ago," he
said. "The response has been fantastic."
</P>
<P>
	   De Blasio said he was not surprised at Giuliani's fundraising prowess.
</P>
<P>
	   "We expected him to be very competitive, so this is largely what we
expected," he said. "The mayor has clearly tapped into a national network of
well-funded right-wing donors intent on keeping Hillary Clinton's progressive
policies from the Senate."
</P>
<P>
	   The Giuliani campaign, however, said that a total of 90,000 donors gave an
average of $110, and 63 percent of those donors gave $100 or less.
</P>
<P>
	   A list of donors from either campaign was not available Wednesday. Both
campaigns are required to report their 1999 fundraising totals to the Federal
Elections Commission by Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we're going to see here in the end is both sides raising $25 million
in this thing," said Lee Miringoff, polling director for Marist Institute of
Public Opinion. "What makes it particularly interesting is that even though it
is an open Senate seat, they are like two incumbents in a way."
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton campaign has $4.5 million to $5 million in hand, while the
Giuliani campaign, which has spent heavily on direct mail operations, has
between $7 million and $8 million.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Speed Up Mideast Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Mideast peacemaking in slow-motion, President
Clinton says he is taking on the task of nudging Syria and Israel along, and
that neither side is giving up despite the suspension of talks this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Neither side has decided to back away from the peace talks, call an end,
call a freeze to them, that's not what's going on,'' Clinton said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are having a genuine dispute,'' about which issues to tackle first,
``that I'm trying to work through for both of them,'' Clinton said after a White
House speech promoting a new health care proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The president cast the dispute as fairly minor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're in a little patch here where I've just got a little extra work to
do, and I'm going to work at it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had a scheduled White House meeting
with Clinton as the administration acknowledged Israel and the Palestinians may
miss a mid-February deadline for concluding the outline of a final settlement of
their long dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Wednesday if Israel and the
Palestinians delayed there would be no framework agreement by Feb. 13 or a
formal settlement by the fall, as planned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's our view that the parties have some tough decisions to make,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   These include whether the Palestinians are to have a state, whether
Jerusalem is to be shared by Israel with Arafat and how much more land Israel
will turn over.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning in New Hampshire, Republican presidential hopeful George W. Bush
said the United States should not impose a Mideast settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There can be no lasting peace if the Israelis, for whatever reason, feel
like they must accept an agreement because it makes us happy,'' the Texas
governor said.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, most of the Gaza Strip and 40 percent of the West Bank have been
assigned to the Palestinians. Arafat is claiming the rest of the West Bank and
part of Israel's capital, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe it's very important to talk to Chairman Arafat about his
concerns and his assessment of the Israeli-Palestinian track and the importance
of making progress on that track,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinian leader had lunch planned with Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright at her home in the Georgetown section of the capital before seeing
Clinton at the White House in mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mid-February is rapidly approaching, and it is going to be a formidable
challenge to try to solve the problems that need to be solved,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, ``we have not given up hope.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said Albright may go to the Middle East next month, either after
winding up talks in Moscow on Feb. 1 or on a separate trip. He also left open
the possibility of her going to Damascus for talks with Syrian officials.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, Israel and Syria are due to send experts here later in the
month to work on a U.S.-drafted document that could be the basis for a treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   But the main issues remain unresolved after talks in Washington last month
and in Shepherdstown, W.Va., earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   The issues are how much land Israel will relinquish, the terms of peace, new
security arrangements along the border with Syria and water resources.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has been careful not to blame either Syria or
Israel for the postponement of scheduled peace negotiations this week. The two
sides were to resume talking Wednesday in the United States where the current
round of peace talks began Jan. 3 and then recessed on Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton participated almost daily in the talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak and the head of the Syrian delegation, Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa, and he planned to play a similar role when the two sides returned.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renewing Plan for Education  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is going to push again this year for a
tax credit that's designed to make college education more affordable, officials
familiar with his proposal say.
</P>
<P>
	   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., with
whom Mrs. Clinton would serve alongside were she to win her Senate bid in New
York, were joining the president in making the announcement today at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the education plan is a renewal of Clinton's proposed
``lifelong learning tax credit,'' which died in Congress last year, according to
officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials said Clinton planned to expand upon that proposal -- the
original version of which would have provided a 20 percent tax credit on up to
$5,000 of tuition and fees -- while Mrs. Clinton was announcing a new component
to increase access to education.
</P>
<P>
	   Making college tuition tax deductible was a key campaign pledge of Schumer
in his successful bid to oust Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998. His
proposal was narrowly defeated as an amendment to the tax cut package last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer's plan would have allowed families to deduct up to $12,000 from
their income to cover the costs of college tuition. That would have saved the
average middle-class family as much as $3,360 per student.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer said his plan would cost between $45 billion and $50 billion over 10
years and could be paid for out of the nation's budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is also trying to appeal to middle class suburban voters in the
New York Senate race. Polls show her trailing New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in the politically crucial suburbs.

<HEADLINE> Union Dockworkers Protest in S.C.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Police used dogs to disperse hundreds of dock
workers who pelted police with rocks as a labor dispute boiled over Wednesday
night. Several protesters were hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   As many as 600 International Longshoremen's Association workers were at the
city docks protesting the use of nonunion labor to unload a Nordana Line
freighter.
</P>
<P>
	   They arrived at midnight, hurling rocks and chanting ``ILA, ILA.'' News
photographers and television cameramen were struck with debris and beaten by
protesters before the violence ended two hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   The dogs were brought in as workers began to tear down spotlights police had
set up. Several protesters were hurt, but the extent of their injuries wasn't
immediately known. Police cars moved through the crowd and officers fired a
smoke grenade. One worker was hit by a police car.
</P>
<P>
	   By 1 a.m. Thursday, police began moving the protesters back toward the union
hall. Several protesters were arrested and the crowd was under control by 2
a.m., local media reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Police from across the state had been on the scene since Tuesday afternoon
in anticipation of the protest.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're training for some type of terrorist attack, I can understand
this response,'' Kenneth Riley Jr., president of ILA Local 1422, said earlier in
the day. ``But you're not dealing with a group of thugs here. These guys are
hardworking, good citizens of the city.''
</P>
<P>
	   But when the crowd got out of hand, Riley was unable to calm protesters. He
was escorted away from the scene by other ILA members.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nordana freighter Skodsborg docked Wednesday evening and was being
unloaded. It carried various types of cargo, including containers, said State
Ports Authority spokesman Byron Miller.
</P>
<P>
	   Nordana has refused to comment and no one at the company returned a phone
message left Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Navy Restores Ties With Tailhook  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy is restoring full ties to the Tailhook
Association, the naval aviators organization whose 1991 Las Vegas convention
created a sex scandal that forced the resignation of the Navy's civilian chief
and focused attention on sexual harassment throughout the military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've concluded that the time is right to restore ties,'' Navy Secretary
Richard Danzig said in announcing the decision Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The move means Navy and Marine Corps aviators will once again be allowed to
attend Tailhook conventions and professional development seminars on official
military business. Ties were severed in October 1991 after word got out about
drunken sexual debauchery at the Las Vegas convention a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Female officers were groped by aviators attending parties during the
three-day conference at the Las Vegas Hilton hotel. The Defense Department
inspector general implicated 117 officers in various offenses, ranging from
sexual assault to indecent exposure and other acts, and faulted the Navy's
leaders for failing to stop the behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   The episode triggered the resignation of Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett
and the early retirement of Adm. Frank B. Kelso, then the chief of naval
operations. It also led to lawsuits, multiple investigations and changes in the
Navy -- including more emphasis on ethics and sexual harassment awareness and an
opening of more aviation opportunities for women.
</P>
<P>
	   Paula Coughlin, a Navy lieutenant who was molested at the convention, filed
a lawsuit and received $400,000 from the Tailhook Association and $6.8 million
from Hilton Hotels. Her trial attorney, Dennis Schoville, said in an interview
Wednesday that he realizes the Navy sees professional benefit in having ties to
Tailhook.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But it needs to be properly monitored,'' he said. ``Hopefully people
learned lessons from this and they must not let it happen again.'' He said Ms.
Coughlin was declining requests for interviews on the subject.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tailhook Association is named for the hook on an aircraft that snags an
arresting cable on the landing deck of an aircraft carrier. As of last year, it
had about 10,000 members, down from a 1991 peak of about 16,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides its annual conventions, which include professional seminars, the
group sponsors college scholarships for children of former naval aviators and
publishes a magazine on carrier aviation called Hook.
</P>
<P>
	   Danzig had laid the groundwork for Wednesday's action by deciding last year
to send official Navy and Marine Corps representatives to the Tailhook
Association's August convention in Nevada to observe the proceedings. The
officers who attended recommended to Danzig that he restore official ties to the
organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Olympia Snowe, who heads the Senate Armed Services seapower
subcommittee, said she had sought assurances from Danzig that the association
would enforce policies against sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With this ... announcement, I trust the secretary has received this
commitment and hope his decision sets the bar high enough to ensure the dignity
of our military members and the effectiveness of our armed forces,'' said Snowe,
R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   Danzig, along with the chief of naval operations, Adm. Jay Johnson, and the
commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James Jones, met with Tailhook officials in
the Pentagon Tuesday to tell them of the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Tailhook Association leadership is committed to the changes they have
made,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones, the Marine Corps commandant, added: ``They have made reforms and
deserve our renewed support.''

<HEADLINE> Candidate Surrogates Flood Iowa  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley sighed as he thought back to the early
days when he planned the logistics of his bid for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Iowa is a bigger state than I thought, in terms of media markets and in
terms of distance and in terms of the need to meet with people on a more
intimate basis,'' he said, explaining the reality that almost all politicians
who come here bemoan.
</P>
<P>
	   While Iowa is small in population, its sprawling 55,875 square miles make it
challenging to get around. It's an eight-hour drive from Burlington in the
southeast to Sioux City on the Nebraska border, and a six-hour trek, west to
east, from Council Bluffs to Davenport.
</P>
<P>
	   That means even the most industrious of candidates often need someone to fly
the flag on their behalf when they can't do it themselves. Hence, the stand-ins.
</P>
<P>
	   Even New Hampshire, far smaller than Iowa at 8,969 square miles, presents
some of the same challenges, with borders that extend from Massachusetts north
to Canada, interrupted by the White Mountains and forests in the North Country.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner for the GOP presidential
nomination, left New Hampshire on Wednesday to concentrate on Iowa in advance of
Monday's caucuses. But not to neglect New Hampshire in the meantime, he was
being replaced by another campaign asset: his mother, popular former first lady
Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Brother Jeb, the Florida governor, visited last weekend, and two other
brothers and sister Doro also plan trips before the Feb. 1 New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, with all of the presidential candidates campaigning today in Iowa,
surrogates were left to carry their messages across New Hampshire. Bradley has
former basketball greats Bill Russell, Dave DeBusschere, Tiny Archibald and K.C.
Jones. Commerce Secretary William Daley planned to stump for Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   In Iowa, House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, a stand-in for Gore,
said: ``I have some friends in this state, from being here a lot. I think I've
helped in the early stages in convincing them to be for Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Gephardt won the caucuses in 1988, has maintained a loyal band of
followers and has very close ties with organized labor. He met quietly Wednesday
with a handful of labor activists and inspected a voter turnout operation
humming in the union hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey has been active on Bradley's behalf, bringing a
special appeal to the table. Since Omaha's television market covers the western
part of Iowa, Kerrey is very well known in that part of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are so many surrogates out here that I'm getting outnumbered,'' he
chuckled.
</P>
<P>
	   Some surrogates can help translate support into votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Wayne Ford, the only African-American in the Iowa Legislature, backed Gore
on Wednesday. Less than 2 percent of Iowa's population is black, but Ford is an
important leader in that community. Gore campaign manager Donna Brazile made a
point of being on hand with Ford to stress the importance of turning out the
black vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a small base but it could put us over the top,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Television is part of the mix here, too, and a lot of stand-ins cut
commercials for their candidates. But Iowa activists prefer their politicians in
the flesh.
</P>
<P>
	   If they absolutely, positively can't be there, however, a well-known
stand-in helps.
</P>
<P>
	   There is even a more pragmatic reason to bring in a celebrity, said
Republican activist Steve Roberts. Any activists who want to see a politician
will have had countless chances to do so by now. Celebrities might give them a
reason to go get another look and, in Bradley's case, the former pro basketball
colleagues who appear for, and with him, are a hit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that you can go see Bill Bradley with Bill Russell, someone who
has some glamor, helps build a crowd,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
	   The effort is bipartisan. Bush recently brought in his father, the former
president, to rev up his front-running campaign. ``You can't do it alone,'' the
elder Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, one of the better scenes on the campaign trail is of the diminutive
Republican Gary Bauer next to his much taller, star stand-in, retired football
player Reggie White.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah once trumped that by bringing in Utah Jazz

<HEADLINE> China Defends Tibetan Policies  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China's vice chairman for Tibet says a revered teen-age
monk who fled to India a few days ago would be welcomed back, but the Chinese
government will continue to control ordination of key Buddhist religious
figures.
</P>
<P>
	   At a rare news conference called by the Chinese Embassy, Sun Qi Wen
dismissed concerns that the departure of the Karmapa Lama, who arrived in
Dharamsala Jan. 7, might hurt Chinese relations with India. The 14-year-old monk
has met with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan political and religious leader
whose government in exile is based in Dharamsala.
</P>
<P>
	   Sun also denied any connection between the young monk's departure and
Beijing's official recognition of another child Buddhist leader, the Reting
Lama, on Sunday. He rejected suggestions that China was trying to increase its
control over Tibet by sanctioning young monks who eventually would identify a
new Dalai Lama to lead Tibetan Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
	   The office of the Dalai Lama has rejected the ordination of a new Reting,
saying the Reting Lama has not yet been reborn. Tibetan Buddhists believe high
lamas are reborn over and over to help mankind. Their incarnations are
identified by other monks through mystical clues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no direct connection between the incarnation of the Reting Lama
and the Karmapa Lama's departure,'' Sun said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the Dalai Lama and the government had recognized the Karmapa as a true
reincarnation.
</P>
<P>
	   The two young monks hold different positions. Some of the Karmapa's
supporters said he may have left because the government was denying him promised
access to key teachers and advisers.
</P>
<P>
	   Sun said China's atheist regime allows citizens to believe or not believe in
religion as they please and is merely following ``historical convention'' in
requiring government endorsement for Tibetan religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any installation not ratified by the central government is considered
illegal,'' he said, reflecting growing Chinese efforts to control religious
practices across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Avoiding any criticism of the Karmapa for his escape to India, Sun repeated
government claims that the Karmapa left a letter which declared he would not
betray the monastery, the country or its leaders and was traveling to India to
recover sacred artifacts essential to his office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe the Karmapa will keep his promise,'' Sun said.
</P>
<P>
	   In denying the Karmapa's departure would have any impact on China's
relations with India, Sun said the Karmapa is ``only a child'' and could not
affect the two country's ties. Chinese officials have avoided any request that
India refuse the youth sanctuary.

<HEADLINE> Business Organizing for Republicans  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just as labor unions let their members know which
lawmakers are friendly to their issues, a coalition of business groups is urging
corporate executives to do the same thing with workers.
</P>
<P>
	   The willingness of executives to go along will be important to business'
ability to turn out its vote this fall. Project 2000, a business coalition that
includes such powerhouse lobbying groups as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and
National Restaurant Association, hopes that this grassroots effort will help
elect pro-business candidates in tight congressional races and keep Republicans
in control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Their model is organized labor, which, though outspent by business 11 to 1,
helped their Democratic allies shrink the Republican edge in the House in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not reinventing this wheel,'' said Dave Gribbin, vice president for
government affairs for the Halliburton Co. and chairman of Project 2000. ``Labor
has figured out where elections are won. They're increasingly won on the street,
in terms of grassroots get-out-the-vote activity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Project 2000 will concentrate its resources on a small number of Senate and
House races. The business coalition will select the races to target based on
such factors as how much money the challenger has raised and whether
pro-Democratic labor and trial lawyer groups are involved in the race,
participation that would make the coalition more likely to focus on the race.
</P>
<P>
	   The efforts are expected to buoy Republican candidates, who usually score
higher on corporate scorecards than Democrats do. For example, House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., had a 100 percent pro-business voting record in 1999,
according to Project 2000. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, who
would become speaker if the Democrats win the majority, scored zero.
</P>
<P>
	   Under federal law, company executives can't use the corporate treasury to
run a campaign urging their workers to support a particular candidate. But they
can spend company money on an educational campaign, letting the workers know
which candidates vote the way business would like them to, and which ones do
not. Unions do the same thing with their members.
</P>
<P>
	   Corporate executives can also use company funds to run voter registration
and get-out-the-vote campaigns, inserting flyers in paycheck envelopes or
mailing forms to every employee's home, for example.
</P>
<P>
	   To make it easier for corporate executives to farm the grassroots, Project
2000 has put all of the necessary equipment on a Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   Company executives also can print out a scorecard detailing how their local
lawmaker voted on issues important to the company. They can add their corporate
logo and a personal message and send it to every worker.
</P>
<P>
	   They can register their employees to vote and send mailings or make phone
calls designed to get them to the polls, where, armed with the voting record of
their lawmaker, they can decide which way to vote on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is pure democracy, educating voters with respect to their choices,''
Gribbin said. ``The important followup is then to encourage them to go out and
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's necessary to have PACs, it's necessary to spend soft money, it's
necessary to have issue ads, but if you do all of that and don't do this last
piece, the chances are you will not succeed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hope is that the employees will agree with their bosses that a candidate
who is good for business is good for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Union officials doubt that the workers will toe the company line.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't jury-rig a relationship,'' said Steve Rosenthal, the AFL-CIO's
political director. ``I don't think that just sending something to an employee
saying, 'Your boss is for this candidate, therefore you should be for him,' is
going to translate into support for that candidate.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Debate Escalates  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The failure of a prototype missile interceptor to hit its
target 140 miles above the Pacific Ocean apparently can be traced to the
breakdown of heat-seeking devices aboard the interceptor.
</P>
<P>
	   That is the preliminary assessment of Pentagon and industry technical
experts who are studying what went wrong in the $100 million test Tuesday night
in which the interceptor launched correctly, received in-flight course
correction information as planned, but then missed the mock warhead it was
supposed to smash into and destroy.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Wednesday ``there will be a lot of
data crunching over the next week or so'' to reach a full understanding of why
the interceptor went off course at nearly the last moment.
</P>
<P>
	   The apparent malfunction was in two devices aboard the interceptor which
sense temperature differences in order to ``see'' the intended target, according
to a senior military officer who discussed the preliminary assessment on
condition that he not be identified. It is not yet known why the sensors failed.
</P>
<P>
	   The military officer who briefed reporters Wednesday did not suggest that
the failure was a major technological setback.
</P>
<P>
	   Cheryl Irwin, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the interceptor was ``extremely
close'' to hitting its target but missed at the last moment.
</P>
<P>
	   For all but the last six seconds of the interceptor's approximately eight
minute flight from a U.S. Army range on Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific the
indications were that the interceptor would hit its target, the officer said.
The malfunctioning of the heat-seeking devices, called infrared sensors, meant
the interceptor could not ``see'' the target well enough to steer itself into
the target's path.
</P>
<P>
	   Private experts had said before the test that whatever the outcome, the
missile defense debate would continue to rage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Critics will say it proves the system is not ready, and supporters will
leap on it as proof that the program needs more money,'' said Loren Thompson,
head of national security programs at the Lexington Institute, a think tank.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, both of those assertions are true.
</P>
<P>
	   The failure of the Raytheon Corp.-built interceptor to hit its target -- a
mock warhead launched into space from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. --
demonstrates what the Pentagon already knew: More testing is needed, the project
is bound to encounter setbacks, and its eventual success is far from assured.
</P>
<P>
	   As missile defense doubter Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., put it, ``Obviously
this is a setback for the program. It demonstrates that the technology does not
exist yet to give anybody any confidence that this is going to work.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the Clinton administration intends to ask Congress to add $2.2
billion to next year's budget to pay for more testing and to expand the number
of interceptors that would be fielded. So far, the administration estimates that
building the missile defense system will cost $12.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   That leaves at least two critical questions yet to be answered:
</P>
<P>
	   --Can the Pentagon build a national missile defense that can be counted on
to work in the event of an actual missile attack?
</P>
<P>
	   --Is there enough of a threat of attack -- whether from North Korea or any
other country -- to justify the cost, both in national treasury and diplomatic
complications with Russia and China, which oppose the project and assert that
building it will trigger a new and dangerous arms race? Many critics say no.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said Wednesday she remained optimistic
that reliable missile defenses can be built.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A mix of advances and setbacks mark all technological undertakings of this
size, and our commitment to defend the nation from ballistic missile attack
should not be determined by a single test,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton is scheduled to make a formal decision by late summer on
whether to go ahead with deploying a system designed to protect all 50 U.S.
states against a limited ballistic missile attack.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker: FCC Must Explain Action  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawmaker is putting the pressure on federal regulators
to defend a recent decision which he says inhibits the rights of religious
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to the Federal Communications Commission, Rep. Billy Tauzin,
R-La., asked for answers to 33 questions on a commission action he fears will
suppress the content of religious programming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Frankly, I do not understand how the new policy can possibly be squared
with our nation's traditional commitment to freedom of religious expression,''
wrote Tauzin, chairman of the House Commerce Committee's telecommunications
panel.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy centers on additional guidance offered by the FCC in
December for noncommercial broadcasters who seek licenses for specially reserved
educational TV channels. To qualify for such licenses, the FCC determined that
broadcasters must devote 50 percent of their regularly scheduled air time to
educational programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission also said that programming ``primarily devoted to religious
exhortation, proselytizing or statements of personally held religious views and
beliefs generally would not qualify as 'general educational' programming.'' In a
footnote, it said church services also normally would not qualify as ``general
educational'' programming.
</P>
<P>
	   The language has set off a storm of protest among religious broadcasters.
Tauzin is considering holding hearings on the matter this spring, said spokesman
Ken Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Simply put, big brother is casting a big shadow over free speech,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked more broadly about the fallout since the ruling, the FCC Chairman Bill
Kennard said he was worried about misinterpretation of the commission's action.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm concerned about some of the misunderstanding,'' the chairman said in
an interview. Kennard said he wants to engage in more outreach to help defray
false fears about the decision. He has noted that the ruling does not apply to
the majority of religious broadcasters, who operate on commercial channels.
</P>
<P>
	   For those who seek special educational station licenses, they only have to
meet the requirement that 50 percent of their programming be educational.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Tauzin asked that all five commissioners respond to his queries in
the next two weeks. Among the questions he posed:
</P>
<P>
	   --Why scripture readings which might be part of a worship service do not
contribute to the educational needs of the public?
</P>
<P>
	   --Why did the commission single out religious programming for additional
guidance?
</P>
<P>
	   --What percentage of the population must be interested in a matter before
the FCC will consider a program as serving the community's education and
cultural needs?
</P>
<P>
	   Notably, the Pittsburgh religious broadcaster who had sought to acquire an
educational TV license -- and had triggered the controversial FCC decision --
announced Wednesday that it was backing off its plan because of the commission's
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The financial benefits of the transaction would have been significant, but
there is no benefit that would justify the sacrifice of religious freedom
required by the new FCC standards,'' said Oleen Eagle, president of Cornerstone
Television.

<HEADLINE> Fed Lawsuit Filed in Cuban Boy Case  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- The custody fight over Elian Gonzalez has spilled into federal
court, but some legal experts doubt the gambit by the 6-year-old Cuban's Miami
relatives will succeed.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle, went to federal court
Wednesday to challenge the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling
that Elian must to be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The legal team filed a lawsuit accusing the INS of violating Elian's due
process rights and asked the judge to prevent the agency from returning the boy
before it gives him an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is about protecting Elian's civil and constitutional rights, the same
as if he was any other child,'' said Spencer Eig, a lawyer for the great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
	   Many legal experts insist that Elian's U.S. relatives have no legal standing
because their rights do not trump those of his father, his closest next-of-kin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All along, the legal issue has been who speaks for a 6-year-old boy, and
the answer is the closest surviving relative,'' said David Abraham, an
immigration law professor at the University of Miami. ``That is the father.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been living with his Miami relatives since he was rescued in
November by the Coast Guard while clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic off
the Florida coast. His mother and stepfather were among 11 people who drowned
fleeing Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The legal fate of the boy has drawn international attention and strained
U.S.-Cuban relations. Congress has considered intervening and the topic has
become fodder for White House candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   No hearing date was immediately set on Wednesday's motion. The Justice
Department and the INS said in a statement they would ask the court ``to
expeditiously address this matter.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is important for the well-being of Elian Gonzalez that the status of
this 6-year-old boy be resolved as quickly as possible,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno has postponed an INS deadline to return the boy
in order to give Elian's U.S. relatives time to challenge the INS decision in
federal court. The INS also has rejected a second asylum petition filed last
week on behalf of Elian by Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   Eig said Lazaro Gonzalez now was asking the court ``not to decide the issues
in the case, not to take custody away from Elian's father, not to decide whether
or not Elian should go back to Cuba, simply to compel the U.S. government to
give Elian a fair hearing and his day in court.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, Ricardo Alarcon, the president of the National Assembly, called
Elian's Miami relatives ``a bunch of kidnappers'' Wednesday and said their
attempt to keep the boy in the United States ``ignores the American government,
showing disrespect for its institutions.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Die, 58 Hurt in Seton Hall Fire  </HEADLINE>
   By AMY WESTFELDT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- Fire broke out at a university dormitory early
Wednesday as hundreds slept, killing three people, injuring 62 and sending
terrified students crawling in pajamas through smoke into the freezing cold.
</P>
<P>
	   Six Seton Hall University students were critically burned. One of them
suffered third-degree burns over most of his body.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the 640 residents of Boland Hall went back to sleep when they first
heard the alarm about 4:30 a.m., thinking it was another in a string of 18 false
alarms set off in the six-floor building since September.
</P>
<P>
	   But many soon heard screams for help and smelled the smoke.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I opened the door just to check,'' Yatin Patel said. ``All the ceiling
tiles were coming down. I saw a ceiling tile fall on someone.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was panic. Everybody was just, `Go! Go! Go!''' said Nicole McFarlane,
19. She was treated for exposure because she left her room in only a short
nightgown, a jacket and hiking boots.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the fire was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The tragedy cast a pall of grief over the campus of the Roman Catholic
school 15 miles southwest of New York City. Classes for the 10,000 students were
canceled for the week. A memorial service was planned for later Wednesday.
Sports events also were postponed through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's not much you can say at this time,'' said Newark Archbishop
Theodore McCarrick, who came to offer support. ``We're glad we're people of
faith. The mystery of God's work is always a great mystery.''
</P>
<P>
	   Patel, who lives on the third floor down the hall from the lounge where the
blaze broke out, said he put a wet towel under his door, kicked out his window
screens and threw his mattresses on the ground in case he had to jump.
</P>
<P>
	   At least two students did jump, witnesses said. Tim Van Wie, 18, of
Flanders, said a friend jumped from the third floor and suffered a broken wrist
and sprained ankle. Others tied sheets together to climb down from the windows,
but firefighters arrived and rescued them by ladder.
</P>
<P>
	   Keara Sauber, 18, saw one fellow student shivering in a T-shirt and boxers,
his skin completely blackened by burns. ``His skin was, like, smoking,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the three male students killed were found in the lounge and the other
was found in a bedroom nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims, all 18, were identified by the Essex County medical examiner's
office as Frank S. Caltabilota, John N. Giunta and Aaron C. Karol. The office
did not release their home towns, but friends and relatives said all were from
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Two firefighters and two police officers were among those hurt. The injuries
ranged from exposure and smoke inhalation to burns.
</P>
<P>
	   The blaze was largely confined to the lounge. Students said they frequently
saw people smoking in the lounge, even though it is prohibited in lounges and
hallways.
</P>
<P>
	   Essex County Prosecutor Donald C. Campolo declined comment Wednesday on a
possible cause.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be a painstaking investigation,'' he said. ``We are taking
statements from individuals who may have witnessed the fire or the moments
leading up to it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Star-Ledger of Newark, citing unidentified sources close to the
investigation, reported Thursday that fire officials have ruled out careless
smoking or an electrical problem as the cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators are seeking information on three young men whom a resident
adviser had asked to leave the building less than an hour before the fire broke
out, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The 48-year-old building was equipped with smoke alarms and extinguishers
but did not have a sprinkler system because it was built before they were
required, Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire hoses inside the building had been disconnected because the equipment
was obsolete, Seton Hall spokeswoman Lisa Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   The smoke alarms and extinguishers had passed inspection recently and at
least one extinguisher was used during the blaze, Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the fire, soot-faced students lined up in the student center to
comfort each other and call parents.
</P>
<P>
	   Three roommates on the ground floor slept through the fire and were not
hurt. They woke up more than two hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   One of them, Erica McGlone, 18, peeked out her window and startled a
firefighter outside. ``We said, `Like, excuse me, sir, what's going on?' And he
said, `Get out.' They came in and dragged us out of there,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Perlman To Be Guest Conductor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- One of classical music's biggest stars, violinist Itzhak
Perlman, will be the Detroit Symphony Orchestra's first principal guest
conductor.
</P>
<P>
	   For three weeks a year starting in the 2001-2002 season, Perlman, 54, will
conduct concerts, participate in the orchestra's education programs, and work
with the symphony's youth orchestra and the Detroit High School for the Fine and
Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt such a great rapport with the musicians of the orchestra," Perlman
said Wednesday. "I was quite flabbergasted by this offer."
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli-born Perlman, who walks with crutches and plays and conducts
while seated because of a childhood bout with polio, has performed with the
Detroit Symphony Orchestra more than 30 times since 1964. He made his debut on
the podium last year.

Clinton Renewing Plan for Education
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is going to push again this year for a
tax credit that's designed to make college education more affordable, officials
familiar with his proposal say. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., with whom Mrs. Clinton would serve alongside were she
to win her Senate bid in New York, were joining the president in making the
announcement Thursday at the White House. The centerpiece of the education plan
is a renewal of Clinton's proposed "lifelong learning tax credit," which died in
Congress last year, according to officials who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.

Report: Smoking, Electricity Ruled Out in Fire
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- The cause of the fire that killed three people at
a Seton Hall University dormitory early Wednesday is under investigation. Essex
County Prosecutor Donald C. Campolo declined comment Wednesday on a possible
cause. The Star-Ledger of Newark, citing unidentified sources close to the
investigation, reported Thursday that fire officials have ruled out careless
smoking or an electrical problem as the cause. Investigators are seeking
information on three young men whom a resident adviser had asked to leave the
building less than an hour before the fire broke out, the newspaper reported.
The 48-year-old building was equipped with smoke alarms and extinguishers but
did not have a sprinkler system because it was built before they were required,
Campolo said.

Mideast Peace May Be Stalled

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Mideast peacemaking in slow-motion, President
Clinton says he is taking on the task of nudging Syria and Israel along, and
that neither side is giving up despite the suspension of talks this week.
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has a scheduled White House meeting Thursday
with Clinton as the administration acknowledged Israel and the Palestinians may
miss a mid-February deadline for concluding the outline of a final settlement of
their long dispute. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Wednesday if
Israel and the Palestinians delayed there would be no framework agreement by
Feb. 13 or a formal settlement by the fall, as planned.

reporter from The (Portland) Oregonian was allowed into the hall for part of the

<HEADLINE> Latin Grammys To Be Awarded in L.A.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- The first Latin Grammys will be awarded in Los
Angeles because the first choice, Miami, refused to permit Cuban performers,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gloria Estefan and other stars attended Wednesday's announcement at the
headquarters of the Latin Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we are still on the ground floor of the emergence of Latin music in
America, and I look forward to our contribution to the popularity of this
wonderful music," said Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences, which helped organize the Latin recording academy.
</P>
<P>
	   NARAS awards the traditional Grammys, which includes seven in Latin music
categories. Those Grammys, led by Carlos Santana's 10 nominations, will be
handed out next month.
</P>
<P>
	   The Latin Grammys will have 40 categories covering Spanish and Portugese
music -- "everything from salsa to merengue" -- and will be open to musicians
anywhere on the planet, Greene said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sept. 15 awards ceremony will air on CBS. No site was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami was dumped because an ordinance prohibits the surrounding county from
doing business with any entity doing business with Cuba, Green said. That would
have prevented use of a needed arena and barred Cuban musicians from performing.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dade County continues to be held hostage by the Cuban expatriates down
there," Greene said. "It's regrettable, because Miami is such an international
Latino city."

<HEADLINE> Alstott Enjoys More Work for Bucs  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Mike Alstott isn't disappointed he didn't rush for 1,000
yards. It means more to him to be playing on a team with a chance to go to the
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers will play for the NFC championship on Sunday, and
the 260-pound fullback figures to be a big part of the game plan against the St.
Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is why I'm here. I don't feel pressure. I feel determination. I feel
hunger. I feel motivation," the three-time All-Pro said. "Man, who wouldn't want
to be in my shoes right now."
</P>
<P>
	   Alstott rushed for 949 yards and scored nine touchdowns -- both career highs
-- this season, thriving on the increased workload he took on after speedy
sidekick Warrick Dunn got off to a slow start.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Dunn paced the team with 64 pass receptions, he only gained 616
yards on the ground after leading the Bucs in rushing the previous two seasons.
Meanwhile, Alstott joined Hall of Famer Lee Roy Selmon as the only players in
franchise history to be selected All-Pro three consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every year has been different. There have been different roles," said
Alstott, who feels he's not only improved as a runner, but as a receiver and
blocker, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've come a long way, learning from other athletes, other celebrities
throughout the league, watching a lot of tape and just realizing how fortunate,
how lucky, I am."
</P>
<P>
	   Although he was held to 24 yards on 15 carries in last week's 14-13 playoff
victory over Washington, Alstott had two runs that were crucial to Tampa Bay's
comeback from a 13-point deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   One typified the Bucs' season -- a year in which the team has had a knack
for doing whatever it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
	   The fourth-year pro took a handoff from Shaun King and started right, only
to be met head on by would-be tacklers. Spinning out of their grasp, he tried
the middle, where two more Redskins got their hands on him, but couldn't bring
him down.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, Alstott whirled to his left, broke an arm tackle and rumbled around
end to finish a 2-yard touchdown run that trimmed Washington's third-quarter
lead to 13-7.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a fine, fine player. Anything he does doesn't surprise me," Rams coach
Dick Vermeil said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a big, strong guy, and you get tired of running into him. He's a great
ricochet runner. He bounces off people. You don't normally knock him down with
one person."
</P>
<P>
	   The TD got Tampa Bay back in the game. Alstott delivered again midway
through the fourth quarter, gaining 5 yards on fourth-and-1 from the Washington
8 to keep the go-ahead drive alive.
</P>
<P>
	   To beat St. Louis, the Bucs will have to solve the NFL's best run defense.
The Rams yielded just 74.3 yards per game and haven't allowed an opposing runner
to rush for 100 yards in 19 games, including last week's playoff victory over
Minnesota. That's the longest streak in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's kind of the well-kept secret about them. They're a very good
defensive football team. Their offense is so explosive, that gets the
notoriety," Bucs coach Tony Dungy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of St. Louis' success can attributed to the Rams forcing opponents to
abandon the run in an effort to keep pace with their high-scoring offense.
</P>
<P>
	   "That always help you play defense, when you get ahead," Dungy said. "But
that's not the whole thing of it. They play well."

<HEADLINE> Titans Take 'No Name' Approach  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Reporters crowd around Tennessee Titans rookie star
Jevon Kearse, and veteran safety Blaine Bishop draws attention as a three-time
Pro Bowl player. The rest of the Titans' defenders usually stand by and watch.
</P>
<P>
	   Nobody is complaining.
</P>
<P>
	   "Of course Jevon and Blaine are probably the best two players on our
defense," second-year cornerback Samari Rolle said on Wednesday. "They deserve
all the credit they get. ... We don't have any guys that are jealous or envious
over anyone. That's fine."
</P>
<P>
	   Defensive end Kenny Holmes, the team's No. 1 draft pick in 1997, said
everyone seems to think the rest of the unit is a bunch of nobodies.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to play along with that. We're nobodies with one good defensive
player in Jevon, so we're going to play along with that until you see us down in
Atlanta," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta -- and the Super Bowl -- will be the destination of the Titans if
they beat the Jaguars on Sunday in Jacksonville for the AFC championship.
</P>
<P>
	   Kearse is a popular attraction as the first rookie to lead a conference in
sacks, with his rookie record of 14 1/2. He earned All-Pro honors and became the
first rookie end named an AFC Pro Bowl starter.
</P>
<P>
	   He also has gotten considerable credit for the Titans' much-improved pass
rush. He had more sacks by himself than the defensive line had in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   It hasn't been a solo effort. The Titans finished with a club-record 54
sacks during the regular season, and the relentless rush has allowed the
linebackers and defensive backs to be much more aggressive. The result has been
37 turnovers, a big improvement from 19 last season.
</P>
<P>
	   Jaguars linebacker Kevin Hardy considers himself a football fan and enjoys
watching the Titans defense.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their defense is probably the real reason they're where they are right now.
Not to take anything away from their offense, but their defense has been playing
tremendous," Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans finished the regular season ranked just 17th in the league in
total defense and 25th against the pass.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin said rankings can't sum up just what the
Titans do defensively. He called the unit outstanding and pointed to how poorly
Buffalo and Indianapolis fared in losing to the Titans in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee allowed Bills quarterback Rob Johnson and Colts quarterback Peyton
Manning to complete just 44 percent of their passes, none for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're playing super football without a doubt," Coughlin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense's leader is Bishop. He was designated the team's franchise
player before the 1997 season and is a three-time Pro Bowler. Fisher thinks
Bishop may have played the best game of his career in the Titans' 19-16
divisional victory over the Colts. Bishop was credited with 11 total tackles and
defended two passes.
</P>
<P>
	   "His play has been huge for them," Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans also have built a stingy secondary through the draft the last
three seasons. Cornerback Denard Walker is the veteran and Rolle, who took over
right corner just before the season, shut down star receivers.
</P>
<P>
	   Dainon Sidney and rookie Donald Mitchell pitch in on passing downs.
</P>
<P>
	   All four of Rolle's career interceptions came against Jacksonville this
season, and the Jaguars managed only one touchdown pass in two losses to the
Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd give them half of what I make because those guys will cover anybody,"
Holmes said. "I'll put our four corners against anybody in the NFL. (When) we
bring four corners on the field, I know I have plenty of time to rush because
those guys cover like blankets."
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans feel they have just one area to improve -- catching the ball
instead of breaking up passes.
</P>
<P>
	   "We need to get our hands on more interceptions," free safety Marcus
Robertson said.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch To Answer Questions  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- For the second time in two months, IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch plans to talk to U.S. authorities investigating the Salt Lake City
Olympics bid scandal.
</P>
<P>
	``I think my duty as president of the International Olympic Committee is to go
there,'' Samaranch told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ``It is my duty to
clarify all the questions. All the questions can be answered very easily at this
moment. Our position is very clear. We have nothing to hide.''
</P>
<P>
	The IOC announced last month that Samaranch agreed to a ``voluntary interview''
in about two weeks with Justice Department and FBI investigators probing the
more than $1 million in improper payments, gifts and other inducements offered
to IOC members during Salt Lake's winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement with the Justice Department, Samaranch did not have to face
questioning during his trip to Washington last month when he testified at a
Congressional hearing on Olympic scandals and the IOC's reform efforts. Both
sides agreed that Samaranch would be interviewed at a mutually convenient later
date.
</P>
<P>
	Speaking from IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, Samaranch said the
exact date of the meeting has not been ''100 percent fixed'' but it would be in
around two weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
	IOC director general Francois Carrard, the middleman in discussions with U.S.
officials, said both sides agreed not to disclose the place and date of the
session.
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has not been served with a subpoena, and the IOC says he is not a
target of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	``What the IOC has done from day one of these events is decided on a policy of
full cooperation with all governmental authorities, particularly in the United
States,'' Carrard said. ``We have been totally complying with this policy.''
</P>
<P>
	Some IOC members have advised Samaranch not to travel to the United States to
speak with investigators because of the possibility he could be subpoenaed to
testify before a grand jury. These members say Samaranch should insist on
holding the meeting in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	But Samaranch said he has nothing to fear.
</P>
<P>
	``I am ready to go any time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said he would explain to investigators how the IOC took action when
it learned of the Salt Lake vote-buying scheme. Ten IOC members resigned or were
expelled.
</P>
<P>
	``We heard some rumors of non-observance of the Olympic charter by some
members,'' he said. ``When we got some names, we set up an inquiry commission.
In three months, we cleaned the house. There are no secrets.''
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch would be the eighth IOC member questioned by investigators in the
case. Carrard said last month that six members had been interviewed. A seventh
has been questioned since then, he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	Among the IOC members who have spoken to investigators are Canadians Dick Pound
and Carol Anne Letheren, Jean Claude-Killy of France, Marc Hodler of Switzerland
and Niels Holst-Soerensen of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department/FBI investigation, which has been under way for more
than a year, has led to criminal charges against two minor figures so far.
</P>
<P>
	Utah businessman David Simmons pleaded guilty Aug. 3 to a federal misdemeanor
tax charge. He said he helped create a sham job for John Kim, son of powerful
South Korean IOC executive board member Kim Un-Yong.
</P>
<P>
	John Kim was indicted in September on federal charges that he lied to
investigators and entered the United States with a fraudulently obtained green
card.
</P>
<P>
	The chief target of the investigation is believed to be Tom Welch, who led the
Salt Lake bid effort and is also the former head of the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch testified before a House panel on Dec. 15, telling skeptical
lawmakers that the IOC had cleaned itself up and resolved the crisis by
approving a package of 50 reforms at a special general assembly in Lausanne
three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
	Asked Wednesday about the hearing, Samaranch said:
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say it was a success. I went there. I answered questions. For me, the
timing was excellent after the approval of the reforms, maybe the most important
changes in the history of the IOC. I have been told they (lawmakers) appreciated
my voluntary presence. They will follow (the implementation of the reforms) with
a lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the three American IOC members -- Anita DeFrantz, Jim Easton and
newly elected athletes' member Bob Ctvrtlik -- would report to Congress every
two or three months on the progress of the reforms.
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch restated his intention to remain as IOC president until his term
expires in July 2001.
</P>
<P>
	``When I pass the power to the next president, I want to say, `Here is the IOC,
and I think it is much stronger today than the day when I was elected (in
1980),''' he said.

<HEADLINE> Martin Off to Strong Start in Hope  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. (AP) -- Casey Martin split the fairway with his
opening tee shot as the first PGA Tour member on wheels. Before he drove off
into history, though, he wanted to get one thing straight.
</P>
<P>
	   Was his caddie allowed to ride in his cart with him between the 18th green
and first tee?
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a rookie," a tour official said. "He just wants to be sure."
</P>
<P>
	   Other than being the only tour player to ride a cart, Martin was no
different than any other rookie in the first round Wednesday of the Bob Hope
Classic.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, he wound up with a score most players would have taken -- a 4-under
68 at Indian Wells that left him in a tie for 30th, five strokes back of leader
David Toms.
</P>
<P>
	   Toms, a two-time winner on tour last year, played two groups in front of
Martin at Indian Wells, and no one seemed to notice his 9-under 63.
</P>
<P>
	   Most eyes were on David Duval, who was 9 strokes worse than his final-round
59 at PGA West last year that gave him a 1-stroke victory and the greatest
closing round in PGA Tour history.
</P>
<P>
	   At La Quinta, they watched Fred Couples post the lowest score (68) on the
toughest of the four courses used in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian Wells belonged to Casey and the cart.
</P>
<P>
	   The majority of the gallery following Martin under a hot desert sun belonged
to the media, curious to see how the 27-year-old Stanford graduate who sued the
PGA Tour for a right to ride would perform.
</P>
<P>
	   "When there are a lot of cameras, you don't want to do anything stupid," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Not to worry. Aside from missing a 14-inch putt for his only bogey of the
first round, and not converting several other birdie chances, Martin didn't look
like a player in his first tournament since earning his PGA card three months
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "I could have really gone low if I had made some putts," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hope Classic, sponsored by Chrysler, is all about going low. Only 14
players failed to break par, including Gary Nicklaus (74) and Arnold Palmer
(82), who at age 70 is playing the pro-am event outside Palm Springs for the
40th time.
</P>
<P>
	   Former PGA champion Bob Tway was among four players at 64. The group at 65
included Steve Pate -- the runner-up and victim of Duval's 59 last year -- and
Glen Day, who offered the best perspective of a good score in the first round.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got to shoot like 88-under," Day said. "I'm only 6-under, so I've
got a long way to go. If we were going out to dinner, we haven't even valeted
the car yet."
</P>
<P>
	   Martin was nervous when he hobbled to the first tee. He feels that way every
time he plays, whether it involves a friendly wager with his buddies or a PGA
Tour event with a $3 million purse.
</P>
<P>
	   This was different.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was more nervous because of you all," he told 27 reporters who surrounded
him under a palm tree beyond the ninth green at Indian Wells. "And, wanting to
play well."
</P>
<P>
	   He held up his end of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
	   The nerves showed on No. 11, his second hole, when Martin lipped out from 14
inches. Three holes later, he came up short on the 483-yard par-5 and chipped in
for eagle from about 25 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   "That settled me down a little bit," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin made another 25-foot birdie from just off the green at No. 17, and
added birdies on Nos. 7 and 8 to get to 68.
</P>
<P>
	   The second round is packed with irony. Among the three amateurs he was to
play with today is Dick Ferris, the chairman of the PGA Tour policy board who
testified against Martin two years ago when Martin sued for the right to use a
cart.
</P>
<P>
	   "As an individual, Casey ... I think he's wonderful," Ferris said after his
round. "We also feel walking is an integral part of the tour."
</P>
<P>
	   Martin and Ferris chatted during a delay on the 16th tee, and Martin said he
expected no problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he's a nice guy," Martin said. "He also went out of his way to
testify against me. We'll be friends out there. I just won't read his putts for
him."
</P>
<P>
	   Wednesday wasn't the first time Martin used a cart against the best players
in the world. He qualified for the 1998 U.S. Open and tied for 23rd, and also
played two PGA Tour events later that year on sponsors' exemptions.
</P>
<P>
	   The difference now is that he belongs. Martin earned his card by finishing
14th on the Nike Tour money list, and likely will play at least 25 tournaments
this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Hanging over him is the tour's appeal and his own health. The ruling from
the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco could be returned any day. Of
greater concern is the circulatory disease in Martin's right leg that makes it
virtually impossible for him to walk 18 holes over four rounds. The leg is
getting progressively worse.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not worried about the courts as much as I am his leg," said Melinda
Martin, his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   For one day, Martin showed there was nothing wrong with his game.

<HEADLINE> Duval at 59 With 2 Hole Remaining  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN PETERS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PALM DESERT, Calif. (AP) -- PGA West looked different to David Duval.
</P>
<P>
	   "This course seemed like they added a few holes. I don't remember it being
this hard," he said, shaking his head and smiling.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval, who matched golf's magic number a year ago with a closing round of 59
to win the Bob Hope Classic, this time reached 59 considerably earlier -- with
his putt for par on his 16th hole at the same PGA West Palmer course.
</P>
<P>
	   He finished the opening round of the Hope with a 4-under 68, good enough to
keep him within five shots of leader David Toms, but a far cry from his 13-under
round of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   There were early indications that another 59 wasn't in the cards.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval got off to a quick start on the final day last year, with birdies on
the first three holes.
</P>
<P>
	   After just six pars during his record-tying round, he capped his day with a
6-foot putt for an eagle on the par-5 No. 18 for a record-tying 59. Only two
other players in PGA Tour history, Al Geiberger and Chip Beck, have gone so low.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, Duval missed a 12-foot birdie try on his first hole, parred the
next hole, then went 1-over with a bogey on his third.
</P>
<P>
	   The gallery following him, several hundred people at the start, had dwindled
to less than 100 by the time he got his first birdie, on the seventh hole.
</P>
<P>
	   But Duval came up big on No. 18 again. He and his playing partners, who
included New York Yankees ace Roger Clemens, started the round on the 10th tee,
so the 18th was actually their ninth hole.
</P>
<P>
	   After drilling his tee shot down the center of the fairway, Duval nestled a
long iron shot within 20 feet of the pin, then rolled in the putt for eagle as
the fans in stands around the green erupted in cheers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just happened there again," Duval said of his dramatics at No. 18. "I
hit some good shots."
</P>
<P>
	   He was steady off the tee Wednesday and he hit his irons well enough to give
him numerous birdie opportunities. But he failed to cash in, just missing a
string of birdie putts from within 20 feet or closer.
</P>
<P>
	   "I missed a few putts I should have made. I shot a pretty good score. I
don't know what anyone else did here, but I think I played pretty well," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would imagine a 68 puts me at least in the top half of the people who
played here. That's a pretty good score considering this is one of the harder
courses they use."
</P>
<P>
	   Duval finished the round with four birdies, the eagle and two bogeys.
</P>
<P>
	   He was content with his position after the first day of the tournament,
which uses four different courses that vary in the degree of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think I had a 70 in the first round last year," he said. "The thing about
this tournament is you never really know, the players or the people who are
reporting it, who is really leading until after Saturday."

<HEADLINE> Owners Give Selig Sweeping Powers  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- Unable to save themselves, baseball owners asked Bud Selig
to do it for them.
</P>
<P>
	   The commissioner was given sweeping new powers Wednesday night, allowing him
to block trades and redistribute the wealth in order to restore competitive
balance in baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   To enforce his authority under baseball's "best interests" clause, the 30
owners unanimously adopted a new constitution that grants him the ability to
fine teams up to $2 million -- the previous limit was $250,000. He can fine club
employees $500,000, up from $25,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the end of the 1994-95 strike, just one team not among the top half by
payroll has advanced to the postseason -- the 1997 Houston Astros -- and the
eight playoff teams were among the 10 top spenders last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Many clubs are seemingly out of contention when they report for spring
training, and the bar for player salaries is about to be raised again, with the
New York Yankees close to a $118.5 million, seven-year contract with shortstop
Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
	   Teams unanimously passed a resolution introduced by San Diego Padres
president Larry Lucchino that calls for Selig to "take such action as he deems
appropriate to ensure an appropriate level of long-term competitive balance."
</P>
<P>
	   That means Selig could take away millions of dollars in national TV revenue
from teams like the Yankees and Atlanta Braves and give it to clubs such as the
Montreal Expos and Minnesota Twins. He could say all of baseball's Internet
money will go to the small markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The only limitation is that the players association could insist it has
power to approve any revenue redistribution because the owners' revenue-sharing
plan was included in the sport's collective bargaining agreement. Also, Selig
can't redistribute the wealth in a manner that would violate baseball's credit
lines with banks.
</P>
<P>
	   Until January 1994, the commissioner could use his "best interests"
authority for virtually anything -- Bowie Kuhn wielded that power on June 18,
1976 when he blocked Oakland owner Charlie Finley from selling pitcher Rollie
Fingers and outfielder Joe Rudi to Boston for $2 million and pitcher Vida Blue
to the Yankees for $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   But after Fay Vincent was forced to resign, owners gutted the "best
interests" clause in January 1994, weakening the commissioner's clout by saying
he couldn't use it on any matter subject to a vote by owners. Their message was
clear: owners decide, not the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
	   But after six years of drift, they decided on change.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today, baseball woke up and recognized there was an 800-pound gorilla
sitting in our living room -- the lack of competitive balance in the game,"
Lucchino said. "Let's cure some of the problems. Enough is enough.
</P>
<P>
	   "Baseball has been for too long a big, old oil transport ship that takes
forever to turn. Bud should take the rudder and turn ASAP."
</P>
<P>
	   Selig became acting commissioner following Vincent's resignation and was
voted to a five-year term in July 1998. He had owned the small-market Milwaukee
Brewers since 1970, and teams trusted he would act in their interests.
</P>
<P>
	   He wouldn't say how he will use his new power. He has said he wants to see
the report of baseball's latest economic study committee.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not going to get into the specific things I can and cannot do," Selig
said.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the new constitution, owners overhauled baseball's management
structure, eliminating the American and National league offices.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, they approved the $320 million sale of the Cleveland Indians by
Richard Jacobs to Larry Dolan and also approved the transfer of control of the
Los Angeles Dodgers from the Fox division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. to
former Warner Bros. co-head Bob Daly, who bought a small interest in the team.
</P>
<P>
	   The changes in the league offices will not affect the way the game is played
on the field. The move was expected -- AL president Gene Budig and NL president
Len Coleman, whose jobs are being eliminated, already had resigned.
</P>
<P>
	   The new best interests clause says Selig "without limitation" has the right
to ensure "there is an appropriate level of long-term competitive balance among
the clubs." He can use that to override all of baseball's rules, including the
one requiring three-quarters approval for revenue sharing.
</P>
<P>
	   " 'Best interest' power takes precedence over all other clauses," said Bob
DuPuy, baseball's chief legal officer. "They trump every other clause."

<HEADLINE> Amish Forgives Man in Crash Case  </HEADLINE>
   By DOUG JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEYMOUR, Mo. (AP) -- A hit-and-run accident took the life of one of their
own, yet members of an Amish community have forgiven the truck driver charged
with leaving the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of harboring resentment over the death of Leah Graber, a 44-year-old
mother of 13, the Amish sat down with the driver over the weekend and talked
``family to family'' about building friendships and preventing similar
tragedies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe it's just an accident that happened,'' said Josie Schwartz, who
owns a buggy shop along the county road where Graber was killed. ``It may have
been part of God's plan for Leah.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Amish hoped the meeting would be the first step in mending strained
relations with their neighbors near Seymour, a community of 1,700 east of
Springfield.
</P>
<P>
	   At the meeting, the two sides discussed ways to get the state to widen
shoulders along the road north of Seymour to better protect the buggies.
</P>
<P>
	   The two-lane road, dotted with horse manure and tire skidmarks, has been the
focus of tension between the Amish and their neighbors for the last 10 years or
so, as both buggy and automobile traffic has increased, said Amish farmer Harley
Beachy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would say 99 percent of the traffic is courteous. But every once in a
while, when someone drives up close, you wonder,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherry Jones, manager of a sandwich shop near the intersection of the road
and U.S. Highway 60, says she frequently sees near-misses. She wonders why the
Amish can't convert to using automobiles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those trucks spook the horses so bad, it doesn't seem fair,'' she said,
adding that some of the misses appear intentional. ``They (the Amish) have their
friends, but they also have a few enemies.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Missouri Department of Transportation says a project to build the
shoulders is worthwhile, but would be very costly.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of widening the highway, others say lowering the speed limit along
the hilly road from 55 mph to 45 mph would help.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm really surprised we don't see more accidents the way some people drive
so fast,'' said Brian West, who lives along the county road.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week's accident -- the first buggy fatality along the Webster County
road in Schwartz's 32 years here -- should serve as a lesson for neighbors to
take more care when they see Amish along the road, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Highway patrol officials said a logging truck crashed into Graber's buggy
about 10 a.m. Friday as it tried to pass. The truck left without stopping,
police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Graber's 20-year-old son, Amos, was driving the buggy and was slightly
injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin Hampton of Seymour was charged with leaving the scene of an accident,
a felony, but the Amish don't want to see him prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Marvin told us that he just panicked and didn't know what to do, so he
drove away,'' said Schwartz, who attended the meeting with Hampton on Sunday.
``He feels worse than Leah's family because he has to carry this around with
him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't believe in pressing charges and going to courts. Instead, let's
sit down and be friends and try to prevent this from happening again. That's the
only way to solve things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting between the Amish and Hampton was arranged by his lawyer, Shawn
Askinosie of Springfield.
</P>
<P>
	   Askinosie told the Springfield News-Leader that he asked the Amish for
permission to represent Hampton, saying he did not want to jeopardize his
relationship with the community. He first got to know the Amish when they built
his house.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Amish want a better relationship and a safer neighborhood,'' Askinosie
said. ''(Hampton's) intentions would be in line with what the Amish want.''

<HEADLINE> Energy Dept. Finds Racial Profiling  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Months of anxiety and controversy among Asian-American
scientists over allegations of Chinese espionage is having an impact on the
government's ability to attract top-notch scientists, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson says.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson released the findings Wednesday of a six-month investigation that
found evidence of racial profiling and an ``atmosphere of distrust and
suspicion'' toward Asian-Americans at the nuclear weapons research labs after
the firing of a Taiwan-born scientist for security violations last March.
</P>
<P>
	   The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, in December was arrested and charged with
mishandling and improper copying of top-secret nuclear weapons computer tapes
and is in jail without bail, awaiting trial. He has denied giving secrets to
China or anyone else, and has not been charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite directives last summer from Richardson against racial profiling,
managers and supervisors at the weapons labs -- Sandia, Los Alamos and Lawrence
Livermore -- and other Energy Department facilities have questioned ``the
loyalty and patriotism of some employees based upon racial factors,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While specific incidents and examples of racial profiling may differ from
site to site, the general concerns and issues were virtually identical
department-wide,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   And the 19-member task force found widespread concern among Asian-American
scientists over the potential of a ``brain drain'' as the most qualified
scholars choose to go to universities and a friendlier, more open work
environment.
</P>
<P>
	   There is no room for racial profiling, insisted Richardson, promising to
stamp it out. He said the fallout could be long lasting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This perceived hostile work environment ... can foment a dangerous `brain
drain' where we lose our best scientists, hobbling our research quality, leading
edge science and ultimately our national security,'' the secretary warned.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, he added, ``we are not having as much success in recruiting
topflight scientists.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asian-American scientists told task force members that the ``hostile work
environment'' was jeopardizing their opportunities for promotion and scientific
development. Scientists told of supervisors who made clear they didn't want
Asian-Americans on a project for fear their presence would attract unwanted
attention, task force members said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yvonne Lee, a member of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and a task force
member, said the group, while visiting nine facilities, found ``a general sense
of fear'' among Asian-Americans of being unfairly targeted.
</P>
<P>
	   Task force members cited as examples a practice by the FBI to call on
Asian-American scientists simply because of their race, and counterintelligence
briefers joking about the large number of Chinese restaurants in town. They're
needed, the briefers would joke, ``for spying, of course,'' task force
investigators were told.
</P>
<P>
	   While calling such comments ``insensitive and inappropriate,'' Richardson
said no specific case of racial profiling has been proven. Still, he said, the
perception and mistrust that has developed among Asian-American scientists was
troubling.

<HEADLINE> Governor: Move Confederate Symbol  </HEADLINE>
   By LEIGH STROPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Gov. Jim Hodges has announced that the Confederate battle
flag should be removed from the Capitol dome, his boldest statement yet on the
controversial issue and one that drew immediate criticism for its lack of
specifics.
</P>
<P>
	   In his State of the State address Wednesday, Hodges said it was time to
resolve the dispute that has led a national civil rights group to boycott South
Carolina amid charges of racial insensitivity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's resolve this issue,'' the Democrat said to applause Wednesday night.
``We must move the flag from the dome to a place of historical significance on
the Statehouse grounds. The debate over the Confederate flag has claimed too
much of our time and energy.''
</P>
<P>
	   GOP leaders appeared lukewarm about the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we all expected him to come out with a specific plan, to say this
is what I think should happen and I'm going to call on both sides to come to
that point,'' said Republican House Speaker David Wilkins of Greenville. ``We
didn't get that. We didn't get anything new.''
</P>
<P>
	   As a state legislator, Hodges supported previous attempts to remove the
flag, and earlier this year said he personally did not think it should fly above
the dome. His address came two days after nearly 50,000 people rallied on the
Statehouse lawn, urging the Legislature to bring the flag down.
</P>
<P>
	   The flag was raised in 1962 to commemorate the Civil War centennial, and
South Carolina's Legislature has the sole power to remove it. Legislative
leaders have said in recent days that the question is no longer if it will come
down, but where on Statehouse grounds the flag will be displayed afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   The question of what to do about the flag is one of South Carolina's
thorniest issues. Hodges' predecessor, Republican Gov. David Beasley, has said
his public support for removing the flag was partly to blame for his election
loss.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which helped
organize Monday's Martin Luther King Day rally, has urged tourists to boycott
South Carolina because it flies flag, which the group considers a racist symbol.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The entire nation is watching and listening to us,'' Hodges said. ``Most
importantly, South Carolina's children are watching and listening to us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hodges also said South Carolina should recognize King Day as an official
state holiday. It is currently an optional holiday for state employees, who also
can pick several Confederate holidays or a day of their choice.
</P>
<P>
	   Also on Wednesday, the wife of Republican presidential candidate and Texas
Gov. George W. Bush rejected arguments that the flag is racist.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not a symbol of racism,'' Laura Bush told television station WOLO as
she campaigned in South Carolina for her husband. ``I grew up in south Texas.
It's just a time in our history that we can't erase.''
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton's spokesman Joe Lockhart said Tuesday that the president
``thinks the flag shouldn't be flown.''

<HEADLINE> States Pressure Congress on Gas  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid concerns about drinking water contamination,
Congress is facing growing pressure to revamp a program that has provided
cleaner-burning gasoline to much of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight northeastern states from New Jersey to Maine announced plans for a
coordinated effort Wednesday to get Congress to free states to regulate what is
put in gasoline, particularly amounts of an additive that is contaminating
waterways and aquifers.
</P>
<P>
	   California, which has greater leeway to deal with air pollution problems
than other states under the federal Clean Air Act, already has said it will ban
the additive now used in about a third of all the gasoline sold in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The additive, MTBE or methyl tertiary butyl ether, for years has been a key
component of so-called reformulated gasoline, which contains higher amounts of
oxygen and, therefore, emits less toxic chemical and smog-causing pollution when
it burns.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil companies put MTBE into gasoline to comply with a law passed by Congress
in 1990 that requires gasoline sold in areas with significant air pollution to
contain at least 2 percent oxygen.
</P>
<P>
	   But last summer, the Environmental Protection Agency, in a major reversal of
environmental policy, urged that MTBE be sharply curtailed because of worries
that it is polluting drinking water sources.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists now say that MTBE, if gasoline leaks from underground storage
tanks at service stations or otherwise gets into the environment, moves quickly
into groundwater -- a problem particularly severe in some rural areas with
porous soil and heavy reliance on wells for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
	   A blue-ribbon advisory panel last summer said that while current levels of
MTBE in water do not pose a health risk -- although some levels of water
contamination have been detected in most states -- the government should abandon
its widespread use of the additive.
</P>
<P>
	   Inaction by Congress, which returns from its winter break next week, is
leaving states ``in the unacceptable position of being unable to respond to a
serious public concern,'' said Jason Grumet, executive director of the Northeast
States for Coordinated Air Use Management.
</P>
<P>
	   The group, based in Boston, represents state environmental regulators in New
Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Vermont and Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   Only congressional action ``can provide an adequate solution to concerns
over current levels of MTBE use,'' said the coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   Grumet said the states planned to contact others -- from environmental
groups to business interests and officials in other states -- ``in hopes of
building a broad and bipartisan coalition'' to push for congressional repeal of
the oxygen requirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Arthur Rocque Jr., Connecticut's top environmental protection official, said
the challenge is to find a way to reduce the environmental risks pose by MTBE,
while preserving the air quality improvement benefits of reformulated gasoline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Federal mandates ... are barriers to that goal,'' said Rocque.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report last summer, the Northeast states coalition said low levels of
MTBE have been found in 15 percent of the drinking water tested in the
Northeast, in most cases less than 2 parts per billion. Water begins to pose a
health concern and tastes or smells bad at 30 to 70 parts per billion, the
report said. About 1 percent of the water supplies tested in the Northeast had
concentrations above 35 parts per billion, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been few health studies conducted on ingesting MTBE, although one
Italian study found that mice, given high levels of MTBE, contracted cancer. The
study has been criticized because of the high doses that were given.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court upholds conviction of woman in controversial drug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal appeals court avoided controversy in upholding
a judge's rulings in a drug case that created such a furor that even President
Clinton weighed in on the issue.
<P>
	   In ruling, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Wednesday it did not
decide the most difficult issues raised by what it described as a "remarkable
case."
</P>
<P>
	   "Thus, we do not determine when, if ever, criticism of an unpopular decision
becomes so severe as to constitute grounds for recusal of the judge who made
that decision," it wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said it had decided merely that U.S. District Judge Harold Baer
Jr. did not err by refusing to recuse himself from the case and by changing his
mind and restoring the evidence after the controversy erupted.
</P>
<P>
	   The case stemmed from the April 21, 1995 arrest of Carol Bayless in the
Washington Heights section of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Bayless, 44, was arrested after police stopped her rental car and found
$4 million in drugs, including 75 pounds of cocaine and 4 1/2 pounds of heroin.
</P>
<P>
	   Baer, appointed for life in 1994 by Clinton, sparked a national debate when
he tossed out the evidence, finding that police in Washington Heights had
arrested Mrs. Bayless improperly.
</P>
<P>
	   Baer said it was not unusual for civilians to flee police in a community
damaged by police corruption. He added, "What I find shattering is that in this
day and age blacks in black neighborhoods and blacks in white neighborhoods can
count on little security for their person."
</P>
<P>
	   Then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other House Republicans called on
Clinton to seek Baer's resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Mike McCurry called the ruling "wrongheaded" and said
Clinton could ask for Baer's resignation. Later, the White House retreated,
saying it supported an independent judiciary.
</P>
<P>
	   Amidst the uproar, four senior judges for the appeals court in Manhattan
even took the unusual step of writing a statement saying threats to remove Baer
"threaten to weaken the constitutional structure of this nation."
</P>
<P>
	   At the request of federal prosecutors, Baer then held an unusual second
hearing on the admissibility of the evidence in the case and reversed himself,
saying police acted properly.
</P>
<P>
	   After the ruling against Mrs. Bayless, lawyers for her said Baer should have
withdrawn from the case because of the political pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, the appeals court said Baer was "forced to decide whether to
disqualify himself when doing so could readily have been perceived as a
capitulation to political pressure - a capitulation, moreover, that might well
have encouraged such pressure on judges in the future."
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court said it was also proper of Baer to uphold the arrest,
finding that the men who loaded the defendant's car with drugs acted oddly,
behavior which "makes factors such as the high-crime neighborhood and flight
more significant."
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Bayless was freed after serving a 4 1/2 year prison sentence for
pleading guilty to conspiracy and other drug charges.
</P>
<P>
	   A lawyer for her did not immediately return a phone message for comment.

<HEADLINE> College Basketball Roundup  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   One of the most impressive streaks in college basketball was kept alive with
one of the wildest finishes of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Duke blew a five-point lead in the final 9.6 seconds of regulation, but the
fifth-ranked Blue Devils came up big in overtime for a 92-88 victory over North
Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
	   The win was Duke's 27th straight in the Atlantic Coast Conference, tying the
record set by North Carolina State from 1972-75. The Blue Devils (14-2, 5-0),
who won their 14th straight overall and 44th straight at home, can break the
record Saturday at Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any time you can win 27 in a row in this great league, it says you're
playing hard all the time, 110 percent every time you step out on the court,"
said Chris Carrawell, Duke's only senior, who finished with a career-high 30
points and played all 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Carrawell had five points in overtime, one less than freshman teammate
Carlos Boozer, who finished with 24 points.
</P>
<P>
	   "Carrawell was a magnificent warrior," Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "I
was truly honored to be his coach. He has developed into such a tough kid."
</P>
<P>
	   In other games involving ranked teams Wednesday, it was No. 1 Cincinnati 75,
Memphis 55; No. 4 Auburn 65, South Carolina 61; No. 6 Syracuse 82, Pittsburgh
72; No. 12 Oklahoma State 73, No. 14 Texas 65; Colorado 88, No. 17 Oklahoma 80;
No. 18 Kentucky 74, Mississippi 69; and No. 24 Maryland 73, Wake Forest 51.
</P>
<P>
	   N.C. State (12-3, 3-2) trailed by point with a chance to win the game in
regulation, but Justin Gainey fell to the floor with the ball and called a
timeout his team didn't have. Duke made two free throws on the technical and two
on the ensuing possession.
</P>
<P>
	   But after a layup by Marshall Williams of the Wolfpack and a turnover by
Duke with 2.8 seconds left, Shane Battier fouled Gainey from 3-point range with
0.8 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   The senior point guard made the first, missed the second, then missed the
third on purpose, and Williams put back the rebound for a 79-79 tie at the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   Television relays appeared to show the red light was on, signaling no time
left before the shot left Williams' hand.
</P>
<P>
	   "To be able to recover from situations like that is a sign of outstanding
kids, and my kids really responded," Krzyzewski said. "That's one of the better
things I've seen any of my teams do. They did it, I didn't do it.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an emotional downer when you feel like you had the game won, but we
played so magnificently in the overtime."
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Kelley matched his season high with 17 points to lead the Wolfpack.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the most part, we played with excellent composure," N.C. State coach
Herb Sendek said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenyon Martin had a career-high 28 points, grabbed 13 rebounds and tied the
school record with 10 blocks as the Bearcats (17-1, 5-0 Conference USA) extended
their home winning streak to 40 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati turned a close game into a blowout with a closing 21-9 run.
Keiron Shine had 22 points for Memphis (8-9, 1-3), which started the game
1-for-20 from the field, the only points coming on a goaltending call against
Martin.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tigers (16-1, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) won their 14th straight by
going 5-for-6 from the foul line in the final 49 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Pohlman had 19 points for Auburn, 12 on 3-pointers. Freshman Chuck
Eidson had 24 points for the visiting Gamecocks (9-8, 1-3), who lost their third
straight.
</P>
<P>
	   Reserve freshman DeShaun Williams, scoreless his last three games, had a
season-high 23 points as the Orangemen (15-0, 5-0 Big East) remained the only
unbeaten team in Division I.
</P>
<P>
	   Syracuse remained unbeaten in Pittsburgh since the 1991-92 season by going
14-for-14 from the foul line in the second half. Ricardo Greer had 18 points and
10 rebounds for the Panthers (8-7, 0-4), who have lost four straight and five of
six.
</P>
<P>
	   Desmond Mason scored 30 points, including the first eight of the second half
when the Cowboys (14-1, 3-0 Big 12) took the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
	   They sealed the win by going 12-of-14 from the free-throw line in the final
1:48. Chris Mihm had a season-high 24 points for the visiting Longhorns (11-5,
3-1).
</P>
<P>
	   Jaquay Walls scored 17 of his 28 points in the final 10:42, including going
13-of-14 from the free-throw line, as the Buffaloes (10-6, 1-3 Big 12) snapped
an 11-game losing streak to Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
	   Eduardo Najera had 17 points and 14 rebounds for the Sooners (14-3, 2-2),
who dropped their second straight road game.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamaal Magloire had 19 points and 14 rebounds for the Wildcats (12-5, 3-1
Southeastern Conference), who won for the eighth time in nine games and finished
with a 45-35 rebound advantage. Kentucky, last in the league in shooting,
struggled again, going 24-for-59 (40.7 percent), including 3-of-17 from 3-point
range. Marcus Hicks had 27 points and 10 rebounds for the visiting Rebels (12-6,
0-5).
</P>
<P>
	   Lonny Baxter scored 12 of his 18 points in a game-opening 24-4 run as the
Terrapins (12-5, 1-3) snapped a three-game losing streak and finally posted a
victory in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Darius Songaila had 14 points for the
visiting Demon Deacons (11-6, 2-3), who shot 29 percent, including 2-for-10 from
3-point range, and committed 20 turnovers.

<HEADLINE> Few Answers for Jags Losses to Tenn  </HEADLINE>
    By EDDIE PELLS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The two losses to Tennessee had a
stomach-churning similarity.
</P>
<P>
	   Lack of execution, lack of intensity, too many turnovers and maybe, just
maybe, a lack of respect for the opponent had something to do with them.
</P>
<P>
	   One thing is for sure Sunday: the Titans won't sneak up on the Jacksonville
Jaguars anymore.
</P>
<P>
	   The only question is, as they head into the AFC championship game, have the
Jaguars figured out a way to break Tennessee's recent mastery in this series?
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans accounted for both of Jacksonville's losses this season and three
of its last five.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are an outstanding ballclub, and you have to give them credit,"
receiver Jimmy Smith said. "They come to play hard, and that's the key. They
have played faster and harder than we have in the past."
</P>
<P>
	   In Week 14 last season, Tennessee overcame a 10-0 deficit to defeat
Jacksonville 16-13.
</P>
<P>
	   That game stunted Jacksonville's bid for a first-round bye, but almost
everyone in Jacksonville wrote it off to injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Brunell was out with a severely sprained ankle and backup Jamie Martin
left at halftime with a torn knee ligament, leaving the game to third-string
quarterback Jonathan Quinn.
</P>
<P>
	   Quinn had a respectable game, finishing 12-for-18 for 107 yards, but he
squandered Jacksonville's only second-half scoring threat by forcing an
interception into coverage in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Tennessee held Fred Taylor to 42 yards on 20 carries, and the
Jaguars had a third-quarter touchdown nullified by a penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no explanation for that one," coach Tom Coughlin said. "That was a
truly frustrating game."
</P>
<P>
	   This season's losses are fresher in everyone's minds. First came the
rain-soaked 20-19 game in Jacksonville, then the 41-14 blowout in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first game could have gone either way," Jags defensive lineman Seth
Payne said. "The second game, they just beat us physically. You can't really
blame it on Xs and Os when you turn on the film and see guys getting blocked,
falling over and basically, getting beat physically."
</P>
<P>
	   But the Xs and Os can't be completely ignored.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacksonville linebacker Lonnie Marts says Tennessee's relatively simple
offensive game plan -- pound Eddie George through the line, then throw short to
tight ends Frank Wycheck and Jackie Harris -- has been effective against the
Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
	   "What they do is try to get to third down and short yardage," Marts said.
"They're very patient about what they're doing. They're not going to push it
unless they're behind. But most of time, their defense plays so well that they
don't get behind. When that happens, they can dink and dunk and do it well for a
long time."
</P>
<P>
	   On defense, the Titans give opponents various looks at the line of scrimmage
and force them to adjust.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their defense will do some dictating," Coughlin said. "The best way to
handle it is to turn around and dictate right back at them."
</P>
<P>
	   In the first game, a steady rainstorm and the Tennessee defense helped force
four Jacksonville turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   The deciding play, Samari Rolle's end-zone interception late in the fourth
quarter, was the combination of a bad play call by Coughlin, compounded by a bad
decision by Brunell.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's a game we should have won," Coughlin said. "We lost the game. I lost
the game. It's just a bad memory."
</P>
<P>
	   So was the 41-14 loss on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
	   Coughlin insists the Jaguars had a week's worth of good practices. He also
says the coaching staff felt it had eliminated the Christmas holiday and the Pro
Bowl announcements as distractions.
</P>
<P>
	   So, why such a big flop in what was then considered the most important game
of the season?
</P>
<P>
	   "We didn't play with any intensity," Coughlin said. "They're human beings
and whatever happened, happened. Hopefully, it's not going to happen again."

<HEADLINE> Warner's a Stock Boy's Dream  </HEADLINE>
    By ED SCHUYLER JR. AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Kurt Warner fades back, a can of beans in his hand, and looks for the
receiver sprinting between the cheese table and the meat freezer.
</P>
<P>
	   Before he hurls the beans and risks smashing a display case of gourmet
foods, he wakes up. It's not Kurt Warner at all, it's just a supermarket stock
boy, or, if you prefer, stock person.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocking shelves at night in a supermarket was what Warner was doing in 1994
in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. On Jan. 30 -- it says here -- he will be playing in the
Super Bowl as quarterback for the St. Louis Rams and telling a huge television
audience that he's going to an amusement park.
</P>
<P>
	   Kurt Warner is a flesh-and-blood dream realized.
</P>
<P>
	   To get to the Super Bowl indoors at Atlanta, Warner and the Rams will beat
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers indoors at St. Louis on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs' quarterback is rookie Shaun King, who is 5-1 as a starter since he
replaced the injured Trent Dilfer. One of the wins was the 14-13 playoff verdict
over the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
	   So a rookie and a former arena player are the quarterbacks in the National
Conference championship game.
</P>
<P>
	   After years of reading and listening to analysts, some of us thought being a
successful NFL quarterback was like becoming a neurosurgeon. It required years
of dedicated study.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was typical Kurt Warner," Rams wide receiver Az-Zahir Hakim said after
Warner completed 27 of 33 passes for 391 yards and five touchdowns in the 49-37
playoff victory over the Minnesota Vikings. He threw 41 TD passes in the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner really is a typical case -- an unheralded college player who didn't
dazzle the all-knowing scouts and computers.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can't help but think there are guys that got passed over that maybe
could have had great careers had they gotten the opportunity," Warner has said.
Many players who were in Warner's situation can't hang around long enough to get
a chance at the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   Fate smiled on Warner after having kept a straight face for quite awhile. He
came out of Northern Iowa to fail in tryouts with five NFL teams. Then after
stocking shelves for six months in 1994, he played for three years with the Iowa
Barnstormers in the Arena Football League and then one season with the Amsterdam
Admirals of NFL Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Warner was the Rams' third-string quarterback two seasons ago, moved to No.
2 this past preseason and became No. 1 for the regular season when Trent Green
injured a knee.
</P>
<P>
	   Now he's an NFL MVP and about to be the winning quarterback in the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, the Bucs defense will keep it close, but three Rams touchdowns
will be enough to win and send them to a Super Bowl victory over the Tennessee
Titans, who will beat the Jacksonville Jaguars for the third straight time in
the American Conference title game at Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans will be at a disadvantage because the Super Bowl will be played
on artificial turf in the Georgia Dome, and they won't be able to draw up any
schoolyard plays in the dirt.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks closed higher today, boosted by a rise in the
technology-rich Nasdaq on Wall Street. The dollar edged lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up 110.26 points, or
0.58 percent, to 19,008.01. On Wednesday, the average finished down 298.82
points, or 1.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 105.34 yen at 5 p.m. (3 a.m. EST), down 0.18 yen from late
Wednesday and below its late New York level of 105.36 yen. During the day, it
traded between 105.17 yen and 105.39 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices rose on buying of several blue chips as
investors were encouraged by a new record close on the Nasdaq Composite Index in
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq index ended Wednesday at 4,151.27, its first closing record high
since Jan. 3. The Dow Jones industrial average, however, fell 71.36 points, or
0.6 percent, to close at 11,489.36.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tokyo market was being led by strong gains in several blue-chip stocks,
with Sony, Toyota Motor and Matsushita Electric Industrial all posting rises
today.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 1.83 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,633.11. The TOPIX closed down
34.56 points, or 2.07 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   Volume on the first section was estimated at 600.75 million shares, up from
561.40 million shares Wednesday. Rising shares outnumbered decliners 710 to 511,
while 120 closed unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the greenback moved in a narrow range in quiet trading
ahead of the meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank
governors in Tokyo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar fell to a low of 105.15 yen, but rebounded to 105.37 yen in early
Asian trading on bids from some U.S. and Japanese investors ahead of the G-7
meeting, traders said. Some investors expect the group to publicly express
concern about the strong yen.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese officials have said the yen's rapid rise will hurt Japanese exports
and profits, slowing down the nation's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 106.64 yen, down from 107.06 yen
late Wednesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.7750
percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.7550 percent. Its price fell 0.17 point to
100.21.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Test 'Marijuana Patch'  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL GORMLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Scientists are planning research on whether a
"marijuana patch" similar to the patches that help smokers kick the habit could
help ease the suffering of cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Cancer Society is funding a three-year, $361,000 grant for
research at the Albany College of Pharmacy. A formal announcement was planned
for today.
</P>
<P>
	   The marijuana patch could ease the pain, nausea and vomiting that
chemotherapy patients can suffer, said Gail Tyner-Taylor of the American Cancer
Society of New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   No such patch exists now, but Dr. Audra Stinchcomb, an assistant professor
who researches medications transmitted through the skin, will explore whether it
is feasible.
</P>
<P>
	   The concept is similar to nicotine patches used as a way to deliver
controlled doses of nicotine to help people quit smoking tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   The patch could provide an alternative to smoking marijuana for medical
purposes, which has been approved in some states but remains a controversial
issue nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates for the use of medical marijuana, however, criticized the patch
concept as another in a long line of less-effective alternatives to smoking the
drug.
</P>
<P>
	   "The American Cancer Society has always been on record against people
smoking tobacco and marijuana," said Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws in Washington, D.C. "This
is a way to assuage opponents."
</P>
<P>
	   Previous research included pills, suppositories, eye and ear drops and even
talk of creating a marijuana vapor, St. Pierre said. Smoking, however, is a
faster way to get the drug into the system, an important factor in controlling
nausea.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Institutes of Health and an affiliate of the National Academy
of Sciences have concluded that the active ingredients in marijuana can ease the
pain, nausea and vomiting of cancer and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   A half-dozen states have offered ballot measures to legalize marijuana as
medication, but the drug is banned by federal law and doctors hesitate to
prescribe it, even in states that legalized its medical use.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department is challenging voter-approved laws in Alaska,
Arizona, California, Oregon and Washington. Maine voters approved a medical
marijuana law last year and the law went into effect last month.

<HEADLINE> Latin Grammys Awarded to L.A.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- The first Latin Grammys will be awarded in Los
Angeles because the first choice, Miami, refused to permit Cuban performers,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gloria Estefan and other stars attended Wednesday's announcement at the
headquarters of the Latin Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we are still on the ground floor of the emergence of Latin music in
America, and I look forward to our contribution to the popularity of this
wonderful music," said Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences, which helped organize the Latin recording academy.
</P>
<P>
	   NARAS awards the traditional Grammys, which includes seven in Latin music
categories. Those Grammys, led by Carlos Santana's 10 nominations, will be
handed out next month.
</P>
<P>
	   The Latin Grammys will have 40 categories covering Spanish and Portuguese
music -- "everything from salsa to merengue" -- and will be open to musicians
anywhere on the planet, Greene said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sept. 15 awards ceremony will air on CBS. No site was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami was dumped because an ordinance prohibits the surrounding county from
doing business with any entity doing business with Cuba, Green said. That would
have prevented use of a needed arena and barred Cuban musicians from performing.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dade County continues to be held hostage by the Cuban expatriates down
there," Greene said. "It's regrettable, because Miami is such an international
Latino city."
</P>
<P>
	   Officials in South Florida lamented the loss of the awards show.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is only one connection between Fidel Castro and the Latin Grammys and
that is the ordinance in Dade County. Because of that South Florida just lost
$40 million dollars," said Nicki Grossman, president of the Fort Lauderdale
Visitors &AMP; Conventions Bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   Broward County officials made a strong bid to lure the awards show and Miami
Beach offered to support Grammy-related events, but Miami-Dade Mayor Alex
Penelas refused to join in the effort.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an opportunity lost for the area," said Miami Beach Mayor Neisen
Kasdin.

<HEADLINE> German Poised for Top IMF Post  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German officials have renewed their campaign to
promote German Deputy Finance Minister Caio Koch-Weser as the next head of the
International Monetary Fund, creating a stir as finance ministers from the
world's seven richest nations head to Tokyo for a weekend meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Brazilian-born German is viewed by supporters as a balanced
representative of the developing countries, which get help from the
international fund -- and the rich, Western nations, which are its largest
contributors.
</P>
<P>
	   Picking a successor to current head Michel Camdessus is not officially on
the Group of Seven agenda, but there will be plenty of talk in the hallways when
the finance ministers meet Saturday, given Camdessus' scheduled exit next month.
</P>
<P>
	   With both France and the United States cool on Koch-Weser for lacking a
high-profile and hard-core financial background, German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder has intensified the campaign to put his candidate at the helm of the
182-nation organization based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Ahead of the G7 finance meeting, Schroeder sent letters to the 40 countries
promoting Koch-Weser as a competent adviser and good negotiator. And Schroeder's
chief foreign policy adviser, Michael Steiner, summoned ambassadors of those
countries on Monday to further pitch the Koch-Weser candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   "We expect to get a clear message at Tokyo that Koch-Weser will be the
European candidate," said Schroeder spokesman Bela Anda. "The signals we've been
getting are quite positive."
</P>
<P>
	   Schroeder put the push in high gear after France indicated last week it was
promoting former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius. But France has already chosen
three of the last four IMF heads, including Camdessus, and Fabius described
speculation that he was a candidate "flattering" but untrue.
</P>
<P>
	   Others vying for the job -- which has always been held by a European --
include Italian Treasury Director Mario Draghi and two Brits -- British
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown and Andrew Crockett, who heads the Bank
of International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan also is promoting former vice finance minister for international
affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara -- known as "Mr. Yen" for his influence on currency
markets.
</P>
<P>
	   A German has never held the job, and Koch-Weser -- who has 26 years of
international experience at the World Bank -- would be a natural choice, his
supporters say.
</P>
<P>
	   "Germany is growing in influence and it is playing a more important role in
the international forum, so I think it would be very healthy for the world, if
you could find Germans like Koch-Weser to play a bigger role," said Peter Eigen,
a former World Bank colleague who now leads Transparency International, a
Berlin-based group dedicated to fighting political corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch-Weser rose quickly through the ranks at the World Bank, serving first
as an economist and then as a health projects officer for the organization,
which works closely with the IMF to finance development projects, mostly in
poorer countries.
</P>
<P>
	   He had been promoted to managing director at the bank when Germany's Finance
Ministry recruited him in April to strengthen Schroeder's Cabinet after
then-Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine resigned in a political spat.
</P>
<P>
	   Eigen said Koch-Weser's strength is being able to build consensus without
twisting arms -- a key to dealing with some of the critical issues the IMF now
faces, including the integration of Russia and Africa into the world economy, as
well as bringing China into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   But Koch-Weser also has no experience as a top finance minister or central
bank governor, and that makes him a less attractive candidate to IMF members who
value a foundation in economics and finance.
</P>
<P>
	   That will play a major role as pressure mounts for the IMF to restructure
itself -- particularly in the United States, which has criticized the fund for
its loans to Russia and its handling of the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   There are also political obstacles to his candidacy. Japan is the IMF's
second-largest financial contributor after the United States, and has repeatedly
demanded a bigger voice in the organization. Already several major Asian
nations, as well as Russia, have openly supported Sakakibara's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, the United States has given Koch-Weser a lukewarm
reception -- partly from an interest in keeping the spot open for U.S. Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, who could lose his job after the upcoming
presidential elections.

<HEADLINE> Union Dockworkers Protest in S.C.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Hundreds of angry dockworkers clashed with police
early today after a Danish company used nonunion workers to unload one of its
cargo ships.
</P>
<P>
	   Police used dogs and at least one smoke grenade to break up the crowd. At
least two people were treated and released from hospitals and there were several
arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   WCIV-TV reporter Ric Swiner said the scene was chaotic.
</P>
<P>
	   "At night when you can't see, it's hard to gauge the situation you're
dealing with," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were standing guard at the port terminal early today.
</P>
<P>
	   The dockworkers had marched to the State Ports Authority Columbus Street
Terminal, where the Nordana Line freighter was being unloaded by about 20
nonunion workers guarded by about 600 police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   About midnight, approximately 600 International Longshoremen's Association
workers arrived at the terminal and began hurling rocks and other debris at
police. Many of the protesters carried beer bottles, shouted obscenities and
chanted "ILA, ILA."
</P>
<P>
	   Police brought in dogs as the workers started tearing down the spotlights
police had set up. News photographers and television cameramen were struck with
debris and beaten by protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   There were reports of arrests and injuries, but desk officers with the
Charleston police and sheriff's departments said they hadn't seen an unusual
number of bookings. Local media reported that police were able to get control of
the crowd by 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   During a protest earlier this month, International Longshoremen's
Association members blocked the terminal gate. Two nonunion workers reportedly
were assaulted, but there were no arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   Police from across the state had been at the terminal since Tuesday
afternoon in anticipation of the latest protest.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you're training for some type of terrorist attack, I can understand this
response," Kenneth Riley Jr., president of ILA Local 1422, said before the
violence. "But you're not dealing with a group of thugs here. These guys are
hardworking, good citizens of the city."
</P>
<P>
	   When the crowd got out of hand early this morning, Riley was unable to calm
protesters. He was escorted from the scene by several other ILA members.

<HEADLINE> Plan Wedding Without Depleting Cash  </HEADLINE>
    By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- When it comes time for planning their weddings, many
couples find themselves torn between their dream day and the reality of what it
all will cost. Plenty of pre-wedding angst comes from trying to create a
beautiful, elegant affair without running up debt that outlasts the memories.
</P>
<P>
	   Buying a wedding -- which, basically, is what you're doing -- is like any
other purchase in that the more informed you are, the more likely you are to be
happy with what you get and how much you pay for it.
</P>
<P>
	   Many bridal consultants -- as well as brides and other veterans of wedding
planning -- say that when it comes to saving on a wedding, the more time you
give yourself to find a location, food, music, clothes, etc., the better. Less
time pressure means you're more likely to make decisions you'll be satisfied
with and that will save you money (think of it in terms of last-minute Christmas
shopping, when you spent more than you intended because you were up against the
wall).
</P>
<P>
	   Some books on weddings advise couples to give themselves a year or more. It
is quite possible to put on a lovely wedding in a few months' time without
spending beyond your budget, said Kathy Bateman, a wedding coordinator in York,
Pa., but "the longer you have to plan, the more options you have."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Bateman says that no matter what the time frame is, the first question
for a couple to consider is "What do you want?" In other words, what kind of
wedding -- big, small, traditional, out-of-town? After that comes the critical
"What is your budget?" and then, "What is the most important part of this to
you? What things are you willing to give up? What things are you not willing to
give up?"
</P>
<P>
	   For example, if having great music, or food, or a drop-dead dress is
important, those are the areas where you'll want to spend more. If you don't
care about having the biggest limo, or you don't need the most expensive
invitations, don't put your money there.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeanne Crudup, a wedding consultant with D'Elegance in Citrus Heights,
Calif., tells her clients, "If you have a figure in mind, you're more apt to
stay within it." Then, as you're planning, don't let your feelings rule, and
allow yourself to spend on something that in the end you might not care about.
</P>
<P>
	   "Weddings are so emotionally driven," Ms. Crudup said. "A month after the
event, you'll say, 'I was so stupid! Why did I do so-and-so?"'
</P>
<P>
	   Many brides look to magazines and books and now the Internet for ideas. But
while these sources will give you an idea of the possibilities, they may not
necessarily help you save money.
</P>
<P>
	   Moreover, some couples choose retailers that offer one-stop shopping --
clothing, photography, flowers, limousines, invitations, wedding party gifts and
more under one roof. Or, Internet equivalents, sites that link a variety of
retailers, photographers and other services. This may be the most convenient
route, but it might exclude some options that are either cheaper or more to your
taste.
</P>
<P>
	   Going to a wedding consultant is an expense, but both Ms. Bateman and Ms.
Crudup say seeking professional advice can help save money. Consultants should
be able to work within a couple's budget and suggest less expensive wedding
suppliers. They can also suggest ways to pare costs.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, Ms. Crudup suggested that couples who are creative or who have
creative friends can save money on floral decorations by not buying them from
retail florists. Instead, go to a craft store or wholesale florist and make the
centerpieces yourself; you can save hundreds of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   When you're buying invitations, instead of getting expensive ones from a
stationery store, try a mail-order catalog or online supplier that charges less
(and be honest, will it really matter if you don't get top-of-the-line engraved
invitations?).
</P>
<P>
	   Even something as big as a reception can be done more cheaply simply by
booking a catering hall on a Friday night or on a Sunday. Most people want to
get married on Saturday, but doing so drives up not just the cost of the
caterer, but probably the pay for musicians, disc jockeys and limo drivers.
</P>
<P>
	   Along that line, Ms. Crudup has a warning for couples planning to marry this
year or next. Because of the millennium, "places are going to be charging
through the roof." She noted that many popular catering halls are largely booked
for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   You might not want to postpone your wedding, waiting for prices to drop, but
keep in mind you may be paying more just for a particular date.

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Close Mostly Higher  </HEADLINE>

<P>
    HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed mostly higher Thursday as
investors shrugged off fears of a possible rise in U.S. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo stocks rose on the back of a rise in the technology-rich Nasdaq
Composite Index overnight on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed up 110.26 points, or
0.58 percent, to 19,008.01. On Wednesday, the average had dropped 1.56 percent.
</P>

Matsushita Electric Industrial.

<P>
	   The Nasdaq on Wednesday gained 0.50 percent to its highest close since Jan.
3.
</P>
<P>

dollar bought 105.34 yen in late trading, down 0.18 yen from late Wednesday and
below its late New York level of 105.36 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar fell ahead of the meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers and
central bank governors in Tokyo on Saturday. The group was expected to express
concern about the strong yen.
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index shed 60.03 points, or 0.40 percent, to
15,215.31. On Wednesday, the index had plunged 3.3 percent.

	   Hong Kong shares were "more expensive than other Southeast Asian countries,"

<HEADLINE> Union Dockworkers Protest in S.C.  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE SMITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Hundreds of angry dockworkers clashed with police
early today after a Danish company used nonunion workers to unload one of its
cargo ships.
</P>
<P>
	   Police used dogs and at least one smoke grenade to break up the crowd. At
least six people were treated and released from hospitals. Several people were
seen taken away in police wagons but officials could not immediately give detail
on arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   WCIV-TV reporter Ric Swiner said the scene was chaotic.
</P>
<P>
	   "At night when you can't see, it's hard to gauge the situation you're
dealing with," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police closed off several blocks leading to the terminal following the
incident. There were no protesters left at the site by 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   The dockworkers had marched to the State Ports Authority Columbus Street
Terminal, where the Nordana Line freighter was being unloaded by about 20
nonunion workers guarded by about 600 police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   About midnight, approximately 600 International Longshoremen's Association
workers arrived at the terminal and began hurling rocks and other debris at
police. Many of the protesters carried beer bottles, shouted obscenities and
chanted "ILA, ILA."
</P>
<P>
	   Police brought in dogs as the workers started tearing down the spotlights
police had set up. News photographers and television cameramen were struck with
debris and beaten by protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   There were reports of arrests and injuries, but desk officers with the
Charleston police and sheriff's departments said they hadn't seen an unusual
number of bookings. Local media reported that police were able to get control of
the crowd by 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   During a protest earlier this month, International Longshoremen's
Association members blocked the terminal gate. Two nonunion workers reportedly
were assaulted, but there were no arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   Police from across the state had been at the terminal since Tuesday
afternoon in anticipation of the latest protest.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you're training for some type of terrorist attack, I can understand this
response," Kenneth Riley Jr., president of ILA Local 1422, said before the
violence. "But you're not dealing with a group of thugs here. These guys are
hardworking, good citizens of the city."
</P>
<P>
	   When the crowd got out of hand early this morning, Riley was unable to calm
protesters. He was escorted from the scene by several other ILA members.

<HEADLINE> Mazda Turns to Internet Sales  </HEADLINE>
    By YURI KAGEYAMA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Having returned to profitability, Mazda Motor Corp. will now
go on the offensive by using the Internet to sell cars in Japan, the automaker's
new president said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mazda has achieved a remarkable recovery through cost-cutting and
streamlining its lineup over the last four years, since Ford Motor Co. increased
its investment to a 33.4 percent controlling stake in the Hiroshima-based
automaker.
</P>
<P>
	   It posted a profit last fiscal year for the first time in six years, and the
earnings were its highest since 1985. Mazda has recently increased market share
not only at home but also in the United States, Canada and Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   It posted a net profit of 13.2 billion yen, or $125 million, in the first
half of this fiscal year ending in September, in contrast to a loss of 4.4
billion yen the previous year.
</P>
<P>
	   "So the trend is good," said Mark Fields, who was named president last
month.
</P>
<P>
	   Fields has drawn media attention here because at 38 he is the youngest
person to head a major automaker in Japan, a culture long dominated by the rule
of seniority.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't shrink our way to greatness. We need to grow our business as
well," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of its latest initiative, Mazda has begun a Web site to sell its
remodeled Demio, a popular compact sports-utility vehicle, and hopes to use the
Internet to sell more models.
</P>
<P>
	   The Internet is "going to redefine what it takes to be competitive," Fields
said. "It's not something we can sit back and wait for the best answer. We've
got to get on it now, and we've got to experiment."
</P>
<P>
	   The two presidents before him, both executives sent by Ford, had helped
stabilize Mazda, Fields said, adding that now his job is to go on the offensive.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Hits Another Record  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit widened to a record $26.5 billion
in November as a flood of foreign cars and consumer goods pushed imports to an
all-time high.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department reported today that the deficit in trade in goods
and services was up 3.7 percent from the October imbalance of $25.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Imports, which have been strong all year, climbed 1.4 percent to a record
$109.4 billion, reflecting robust U.S. demand for foreign cars, business
equipment, consumer goods ranging from clothing to household appliances and a
rising oil import bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Exports, however, also rose a brisk 0.7 percent to a record $82.9 billion as
demand for U.S. products from overseas economies picked up after being severely
depressed from the Asian financial crisis. Sales of telecommunications
equipment, semiconductors, TV sets and VCRS, and industrial supplies all rose.
</P>
<P>
	   Through the first 11 months of 1999, the U.S. trade deficit was running at
an annual rate of $266.8 billion, far surpassing last year's record deficit of
$164.3 billion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renewing Plan for Education  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will push again this year for a tax
credit designed to make college education more affordable, officials familiar
with his proposal say.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the program being outlined by the president today is a
$30 billion, 10-year initiative that would make higher education more affordable
for millions, said the officials, who spoke on condition they not be identified
by name.
</P>
<P>
	   When the credit is fully phased in, a family could receive a tax credit of
up to $10,000 for tuition, fees and training. The maximum credit would be $2,800
a year. A similar proposal died in Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
	   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the Senate from New
York, and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., were joining the president in announcing
the education program today at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also was calling for a $1 billion increase in Pell Grants and
other federal education assistance, including work-study and a new plan for
helping students pursuing dual degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked why Congress could be expected to pass Clinton's plan this year, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart replied: ``Members of Congress who have been in
their districts understand that education is the top priority for most
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Making college tuition tax deductible was a key campaign pledge of Schumer
in his successful bid to oust Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998. His
proposal was narrowly defeated as an amendment to the tax cut package last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer's plan would have allowed families to deduct up to $12,000 from
their income to cover the costs of college tuition. That would have saved the
average middle-class family as much as $3,360 per student.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer said his plan would cost between $45 billion and $50 billion over 10
years and could be paid for out of the nation's budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is also trying to appeal to middle-class suburban voters in the
New York Senate race. Polls show her trailing New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in the politically crucial suburbs.

<HEADLINE> GM Earnings Fall 32 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. saw its earnings fall to $1.1 billion
in the fourth quarter, a decline of 32 percent, due to reduced U.S. truck sales
and losses at its Hughes electronics unit.
</P>
<P>
	   The world's largest automaker said it earned $1.86 a share, compared to
$2.48 a share last year, when the company reported record quarterly earnings.
The results beat Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenues totaled $46.3 billion, compared to $44.6 billion in the same
quarter in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, GM earned $5.6 billion, or $8.53 a share, up 83 percent over
1998's strike-affected earnings of $3 billion, or $4.32 a share. Revenues
totaled $176.5 billion, up 13.6 percent from $155 billion a year ago. The
results do not include income from Delphi Automotive Systems, which was spun off
from GM in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're pleased that our financial performance remained on track even as we
faced unceasing financial pressures," GM Chairman and CEO John F. Smith said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   GM said its fourth quarter results were down due to lower production and a
less profitable mix of cars and trucks. In the final three months of 1998, the
company was pushing to make up losses suffered during the strike. During the
same period of 1999, GM's truck production was down as it put new models into
production.

record quarterly earnings. The results beat Wall Street
expectations. Revenues totaled $46.3 billion, compared to $44.6
billion in the same quarter in 1998. For the year, GM earned $5.6
billion, or $8.53 a share, up 83 percent over 1998's
strike-affected earnings of $3 billion, or $4.32 a share. Revenues
totaled $176.5 billion, up 13.6 percent from $155 billion a year
ago. The results do not include income from Delphi Automotive
Systems, which was spun off from GM in 1999.

	   Mazda Turns to Internet Sales
</P>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Having returned to profitability, Mazda Motor Corp.
will now go on the offensive by using the Internet to sell cars in
Japan, the automaker's new president said today. Mazda has achieved
a remarkable recovery through cost-cutting and streamlining its
lineup over the last four years, since Ford Motor Co. increased its
investment to a 33.4 percent controlling stake in the
Hiroshima-based automaker. It posted a profit last fiscal year for
the first time in six years, and the earnings were its highest
since 1985. Mazda has recently increased market share not only at
home but also in the United States, Canada and Europe.

	   Trade Deficit Hits Another Record
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit widened to a record
$26.5 billion in November as a flood of foreign cars and consumer
goods pushed imports to an all-time high. The Commerce Department
reported today that the deficit in trade in goods and services was
up 3.7 percent from the October imbalance of $25.6 billion.
Imports, which have been strong all year, climbed 1.4 percent to a
record $109.4 billion, reflecting robust U.S. demand for foreign
cars, business equipment, consumer goods ranging from clothing to
household appliances and a rising oil import bill.

<P>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- America Online, which agreed to buy

earnings yesterday on greater revenues from advertising and
e-commerce. AOL earned $224 million, or 9 cents a share, in the
quarter ended Dec. 31, more than double the $86 million, or 4 cents

<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Apple Computer posted its ninth consecutive
quarterly profit as consumers continued to flock to its curvy and

for the three months ended Jan. 1, its first fiscal quarter, rose
to $183 million, or $1.03 a share. In the same period a year ago,
Apple earned $152 million, or 95 cents a share. Excluding a
one-time gain of $101 million from an investment and $6 million for
restructuring costs, Apple earned $178 million, or $1 a share.
Apple's operating profit easily topped Wall Street forecasts of 90
cents a share, according to a survey of analysts by First
Call/Thomson Financial, and even beat unofficial ``whisper''
estimates of 97 cents that circulated before the report.

profits of $1.68 billion, or $1.97 a share, for the quarter ended
Dec. 31, far above Wall Street's forecast of $1.32 a share,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Including a one-time

19,008.01. Gains were led by several blue-chips such as Sony,
Toyota Motor Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial. Hong Kong

first new record since it closed at 4,131.15 on Jan. 3. The Dow
Jones industrial average fell 71.36 to 11,489.36, a decline that
came almost entirely from Microsoft. Microsoft fell 8 5/16 from its

<HEADLINE> Helms To Visit U.N., Talk About Dues  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms, one of the harshest congressional
critics of the United Nations, is offering the world body a truce.
</P>
<P>
	   But he's mixing his overture with a pitch for structural change and a
smaller U.S. share of the peacekeeping burden.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservative chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who in
the past has ridiculed U.N. leaders as ``dysfunctional'' and ``cry babies,'' is
ready to plead for better relations, a spokesman says.
</P>
<P>
	   But at the same time, Helms, R-N.C., plans to tell the Security Council
exactly what he expects in return for a congressional agreement to pay nearly $1
billion in back dues owed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms was to address the Security Council today, becoming the first
legislator from any nation to do so. He was invited to speak by the current
council chairman, U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms plans to ``express his hope for new, better relations with the United
Nations,'' said Marc Thiessen, Helms' spokesman. But Thiessen also said Helms
would assert his view that reforms are needed at the world organization and that
it must know its limitations.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other criticisms, Helms has taken issue with Secretary General Kofi
Annan's calls for increased ``global engagement.''
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke said Wednesday that Helms' visit ``has to help. It has to reduce
misunderstandings. It has to increase understanding here in the U.N. of the
Helms-Biden benchmarks and I hope it will be a two-way street.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, other members of the Foreign Relations Committee will join Helms
for a meeting with Annan, lunch at U.N. headquarters, and a committee hearing at
a nearby office building that will look into recent developments at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We in the Congress don't do nearly enough of this sort of thing,'' said
committee member Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be a good exchange in general areas. We'll get into things like
Iraq, peacekeeping in the Balkans. We want to hear a little more about Africa,''
Hagel said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Hagel said that ``you always run the risk'' that some committee members
might use the session as a platform for hurling new invectives at the United
Nations. But, he said, ``I think it's critically important for us to get out of
Washington, to get where the world is real.''
</P>
<P>
	   In late 1999, Congress voted to pay $926 million in U.N. arrears over three
years, ending years of debate on unrelated issues like international abortion
programs that had held up the payments.
</P>
<P>
	   But the legislation also included about two dozen conditions, which must be
met for all the money to be released. One of the conditions is that the United
Nations maintain a zero-growth budget. Other conditions call for a reduction in
the U.S. share of the U.N. peacekeeping budget from the current 31 percent to 25
percent; and in the regular budget from 25 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States now must try to persuade the other 187 U.N. members to go
along with these demands.
</P>
<P>
	   The leadoff witness at Friday's hearing will be Holbrooke. After a rocky
confirmation process last year that wound up with Holbrooke's winning Helms'
support, Holbrooke invited Helms to bring his committee to New York to observe
the organization in action.
</P>
<P>
	   The Security Council first planned to accept Helms' testimony behind closed
doors. But at the urging of Helms and Holbrooke, the panel agreed to open the
session.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms arrived in New York on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to public appearances, Helms and committee members have various
private meetings over the next two days scheduled with Holbrooke and other U.N.
officials, said Holbrooke spokeswoman Mary Ellen Glynn.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Hits Another Record  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit widened to a record $26.5 billion
in November as a flood of foreign cars and consumer goods pushed imports to an
all-time high.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department reported today that the deficit in trade in goods
and services was up 3.7 percent from the October imbalance of $25.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Imports, which have been strong all year, climbed 1.4 percent to a record
$109.4 billion, reflecting robust U.S. demand for foreign cars, business
equipment, consumer goods ranging from clothing to household appliances and a
rising oil import bill.
</P>
<P>
	   "The good times keep rolling for U.S. consumers. Cheaper-priced imports help
keep inflation at bay and satisfy Americans' insatiable demand for goods," said
Mike Fenollosa, an economist with John Hancock.
</P>
<P>
	   Exports, however, also rose a brisk 0.7 percent to a record $82.9 billion as
demand for U.S. products from overseas economies picked up after being severely
depressed from the Asian financial crisis. Sales of telecommunications
equipment, semiconductors, TV sets and VCRs, and industrial supplies all rose.
</P>
<P>
	   "The pickup in exports is positive because it helps pay for our import bill
and it helps U.S. manufacturers," Fenollosa said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bond markets had little reaction to the trade report. Yields on 30-year
Treasury bonds had already climbed back to match Tuesday's 2 1/2-year high of
6.75 percent. Yields continued to hover around that level after the report, up
from late Wednesday's 6.71 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Through the first 11 months of 1999, the U.S. trade deficit was running at
an annual rate of $266.8 billion, far surpassing last year's record deficit of
$164.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The trade deficit has set a new monthly record eight out of 11 months in
1999 as America's performance on trade has continued to suffer from the
lingering effects of a global financial crisis that depressed U.S. exports and
contributed to a flood of cheaper-priced imports into the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The trade imbalance is the one blot on an otherwise superior economic
performance that has pushed America's unemployment rate down to a 30-year low of
4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In a second report today, the number of Americans filing new claims for
unemployment benefits last week fell sharply by an unexpected 39,000 to 272,000,
the biggest drop since late July. The decline left claims at a level indicating
that employers continue to scramble to find scarce workers to fill job openings.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of President Clinton's trade policies have seized on the soaring
deficits to support their argument that the administration's pursuit of big
market-opening trade deals is not working.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the 135-nation World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle
failed to launch a new round of global trade talks. U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky on Wednesday offered a pessimistic assessment of the chances
for getting those negotiations started any time soon, given the wide differences
that remain over what should be on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration also faces a major fight in Congress to win approval for
a trade agreement clearing the way for China to become a member of the WTO.
Clinton convened a Cabinet meeting Wednesday to review administration goals for
his final year in office, particularly the strategy for winning congressional
approval of normal trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
	   The November trade report showed that the U.S. deficit with China narrowed
by 9.2 percent to $6.5 billion. The politically sensitive deficit with Japan
also narrowed by 11.3 percent to $6.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   However, America's deficit with Germany soared by 29.4 percent to a record
$3 billion in November as imports from that country jumped to an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
	   American's foreign oil bill rose 0.9 percent to $7 billion in November as
crude oil prices hit their highest level since January 1997. Since November,
prices have soared to nearly $30 -- the highest level since January 1991, before
the Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Board of Trade May Split  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Board of Trade's directors have reportedly
approved a plan to divide the world's oldest futures market into two for-profit
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   One venture would handle electronic markets, while the other would run the
traditional trading floors and pits, the Chicago Sun-Times and the Chicago
Tribune reported today. The companies would have separate boards, management and
strategies and compete for orders.
</P>
<P>
	   Board Chairman David Brennan was expected to announce the decision, made at
a special board meeting Wednesday night, to exchange members today. Two-thirds
of the more than 3,600 members would have to approve the plan to make it
official.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plan, members who own the CBOT would get interest in shares of the
new company, which is being called "eBOT." Future plans might also include an
initial public stock offering, both newspapers reported, citing sources familiar
with the plan who declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
	   The 152-year-old Board of Trade has been developing the more streamlined and
agile structure for months to help cope with increasing competitive pressure
from electronic trading networks. Last June, board members approved an alliance
with rival exchange, Frankfurt-based Eurex.
</P>
<P>
	   Because many details are unresolved, some members said the split could take
up to a year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renewing Plan for Education  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will push again this year for a tax
credit designed to make college education more affordable, officials familiar
with his proposal say.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the program being outlined by the president today is a
$30 billion, 10-year initiative that would make higher education more affordable
for millions, said the officials, who spoke on condition they not be identified
by name.
</P>
<P>
	   When the credit is fully phased in, a family could receive a tax credit of
up to $10,000 for tuition, fees and training. The maximum credit would be $2,800
a year. A similar proposal died in Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
	   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the Senate from New
York, and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., were joining the president in announcing
the education program today at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also was calling for a $1 billion increase in Pell Grants, new
College Completion Challenge Grants and other federal education assistance,
including work-study and a new plan for helping students pursuing dual degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked why Congress could be expected to pass Clinton's plan this year, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart replied: ``Members of Congress who have been in
their districts understand that education is the top priority for most
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal includes $35 million for the college Completion Challenge
Grants, designed to spur college dropouts to return to class; $40 million for a
new initiative to help minorities pursue five-year dual-degree programs in
fields where they are underrepresented; and $716 million for the Pell Grants.
</P>
<P>
	   Additionally, Clinton's plan seeks $400 million in increases for the Gear Up
program, which helps disadvantaged youths stay in high school; TRIO, which helps
them stay in college; Job Corps, a national education and job training program
targeted at impoverished youths; and similar initiatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Making college tuition tax deductible was a key campaign pledge of Schumer
in his successful bid to oust Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998. His
proposal was narrowly defeated as an amendment to the tax cut package last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer's plan would have allowed families to deduct up to $12,000 from
their income to cover the costs of college tuition. That would have saved the
average middle-class family as much as $3,360 per student.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer said his plan would cost between $45 billion and $50 billion over 10
years and could be paid for out of the nation's budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is also trying to appeal to middle-class suburban voters in the
New York Senate race. Polls show her trailing New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in the politically crucial suburbs.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher today as robust corporate earnings
reports from several technology companies boosted the Nasdaq further into record
territory.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 31.65 at 11,521.01.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was up 56.41 at 4,207.70, extending the closing
record of 11,489.36 reached Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was up 7.43 at 1,463.33.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors once again poured money into shares of large technology companies,
several of which reported better than expected earnings late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   IBM, which sent a chill through the technology sector last fall when it said
sales had slumped due to worries about the Year 2000 computer bug, easily beat
Wall Street's profit forecasts. While company officials warned that lingering
concerns will continue to take a toll on sales in the current quarter, they
encouraged analysts to leave their profit forecasts for 2000 intact.
</P>
<P>
	   IBM stock soared 7 1/2 to 123 today.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Apple Computer rose 9 11/16 to 116 1/4. Apple said late
Wednesday it earned $183 million, or $1.03 a share, in its most recent quarter.
Strong sales of its iMac computer helped Apple coast past published estimates of
90 cents per share and past the "whisper number" of 97 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   America Online, which has seen its stock price tumble since the company
announced its intentions to merge with Time Warner, slipped 5/16 to 63 3/4. AOL
said late Wednesday it earned $224 million, or 9 cents a share, in the quarter
ended Dec. 31, more than double the $86 million, or 4 cents a share, in the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts had expected AOL to earn 8 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 142.9 million shares, ahead of Wednesday's
early pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.70 to 524.72.
</P>

<HEADLINE> DeLay Attacks Clinton, Liberals  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Setting a combative tone for this election year, House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay accused the Clinton administration and liberals today of
despoiling ``a set of values that binds us together as Americans.'' He summoned
conservatives to restore those values.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The administration that has held the White House for almost eight years
now has moved through the cherished institutions of our nation like a threshing
machine, leveling everything in its path,'' DeLay, R-Texas, said in remarks
prepared for delivery to the conservative Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing alone in defense of ``a conservative world view has been the
Republican-dominated Congress, said DeLay, who has become one of the
conservative movement's closest allies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have challenged the counterculture activists who run Hollywood,
confronted the trial lawyers who dominate the courts, and struck back against
the corporate liberalism that has come to dominate so many American companies,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our cause, the defense of our values, has never changed,'' he added. ``We
lack only a united conservative front that can guide a cause to victory. And
that means a Republican president working with a Republican Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   DeLay's remarks underline the GOP's need for a strong turnout this November
by the party's core conservative voters as Republicans struggle to retain
control of the House. The GOP's hold on the 435-member House is so slim that a
net Democratic gain of five seats would give that party control of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
	   DeLay cited President Clinton's vetoes of Republican-passed initiatives to
cut taxes and ban certain late-term abortions -- and even his administration's
effort to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba -- as evidence
of a need to give the GOP control of the White House and Congress in the fall
elections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a set of values that binds us together as Americans,'' he said,
adding, ``They are our faith in God, our belief in the sanctity of human life,
our acceptance of moral absolutes and our certainty that we are ultimately
accountable for our own actions.''
</P>
<P>
	   DeLay's remarks follow months in which some conservatives have seem
disillusioned with their ability to win legislative successes in Washington, and
have questioned some decisions by GOP leaders to strike budget compromises with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Declaring that congressional Republicans have been battling for the
conservative cause, DeLay said, ``So you can understand my frustration when some
of our friends in the conservative movement allow the perfect to be the enemy of
the good. All conservatives want to do more, but achieving more will require an
expanded Republican majority.''
</P>
<P>
	   His remarks contained few specific legislative proposals. But he said that
``rediscovering our values'' would include support for ``faith-based
institutions,'' attacking violence and obscenity, reducing taxes and regulations
that he said hurt families, supporting the military and a foreign policy that
supports people seeking religious and political freedom.

<HEADLINE> Helms To Visit U.N., Talk About Dues  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms, one of the harshest congressional
critics of the United Nations, is offering the world body a truce.
</P>
<P>
	   But he's mixing his overture with a pitch for structural change and a
smaller U.S. share of the peacekeeping burden.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservative chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who in
the past has ridiculed U.N. leaders as ``dysfunctional'' and ``cry babies,'' is
ready to plead for better relations, a spokesman says.
</P>
<P>
	   But at the same time, Helms, R-N.C., plans to tell the Security Council
exactly what he expects in return for a congressional agreement to pay nearly $1
billion in back dues owed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms was to address the Security Council today, becoming the first U.S.
legislator to do so. He was invited to speak by the current council chairman,
U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke. ``It's his day,'' Holbrooke told reporters as
Helms arrived at U.N. headquarters today.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms plans to ``express his hope for new, better relations with the United
Nations,'' said Marc Thiessen, Helms' spokesman. But Thiessen also said Helms
would assert his view that reforms are needed at the world organization and that
it must know its limitations.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other criticisms, Helms has taken issue with Secretary General Kofi
Annan's calls for increased ``global engagement.''
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke said Wednesday that Helms' visit ``has to help. It has to reduce
misunderstandings. It has to increase understanding here in the U.N. of the
Helms-Biden benchmarks and I hope it will be a two-way street.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, other members of the Foreign Relations Committee will join Helms
for a meeting with Annan, lunch at U.N. headquarters, and a committee hearing at
a nearby office building that will look into recent developments at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We in the Congress don't do nearly enough of this sort of thing,'' said
committee member Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be a good exchange in general areas. We'll get into things like
Iraq, peacekeeping in the Balkans. We want to hear a little more about Africa,''
Hagel said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Hagel said that ``you always run the risk'' that some committee members
might use the session as a platform for hurling new invectives at the United
Nations. But, he said, ``I think it's critically important for us to get out of
Washington, to get where the world is real.''
</P>
<P>
	   In late 1999, Congress voted to pay $926 million in U.N. arrears over three
years, ending years of debate on unrelated issues like international abortion
programs that had held up the payments.
</P>
<P>
	   But the legislation also included about two dozen conditions, which must be
met for all the money to be released. One of the conditions is that the United
Nations maintain a zero-growth budget. Other conditions call for a reduction in
the U.S. share of the U.N. peacekeeping budget from the current 31 percent to 25
percent; and in the regular budget from 25 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States now must try to persuade the other 187 U.N. members to go
along with these demands.
</P>
<P>
	   The leadoff witness at Friday's hearing will be Holbrooke. After a rocky
confirmation process last year that wound up with Holbrooke's winning Helms'
support, Holbrooke invited Helms to bring his committee to New York to observe
the organization in action.
</P>
<P>
	   The Security Council first planned to accept Helms' testimony behind closed
doors. But at the urging of Helms and Holbrooke, the panel agreed to open the
session.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms arrived in New York on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to public appearances, Helms and committee members have various
private meetings over the next two days scheduled with Holbrooke and other U.N.
officials, said Holbrooke spokeswoman Mary Ellen Glynn.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Renewing Plan for Education  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is pushing for a tax credit designed to
make college education more affordable, White House officials said today.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the program being outlined by the president today is a
$30 billion, 10-year initiative that would make higher education more affordable
for millions, said the officials, who spoke on condition they not be identified
by name.
</P>
<P>
	   When the ``College Opportunity Tax Cut'' is fully phased in, a family could
receive a tax deduction of up to $10,000 for tuition, fees and training.
Alternatively, taxpayers could seek a maximum credit of $2,800 a year. A similar
proposal died in Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
	   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the Senate from New
York, and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., were joining the president in announcing
the education program today at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also was calling for a $1 billion increase in Pell Grants, new
College Completion Challenge Grants and other federal education assistance,
including work-study and a new plan for helping students pursuing dual degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked why Congress could be expected to pass Clinton's plan this year, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart replied: ``Members of Congress who have been in
their districts understand that education is the top priority for most
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   The political season has raised doubts that Congress will act on much of
Clinton's agenda. ``The public wants progress,'' Lockhart said. ``I think there
will be a political cost for those who want to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal includes $35 million for the college Completion Challenge
Grants, designed to spur college dropouts to return to class; $40 million for a
new initiative to help minorities pursue five-year dual-degree programs in
fields where they are underrepresented; and $716 million for the Pell Grants.
</P>
<P>
	   Additionally, Clinton's plan seeks $400 million in increases for the Gear Up
program, which helps disadvantaged youths stay in high school; TRIO, which helps
them stay in college; Job Corps, a national education and job training program
targeted at impoverished youths; and similar initiatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Making college tuition tax deductible was a key campaign pledge of Schumer
in his successful bid to oust Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998. His
proposal was narrowly defeated as an amendment to the tax cut package last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer's plan would have allowed families to deduct up to $12,000 from
their income to cover the costs of college tuition. That would have saved the
average middle-class family as much as $3,360 per student.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer said his plan would cost between $45 billion and $50 billion over 10
years and could be paid for out of the nation's budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is also trying to appeal to middle-class suburban voters in the
New York Senate race. Polls show her trailing New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in the politically crucial suburbs.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms, one of the harshest congressional
critics of the United Nations, offered ``my hand of friendship'' today to the
world body but coupled his overture with sharp warning that the organization not
overstep its bounds.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Discuss Arms Cuts  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GENEVA (AP) -- U.S. and Russian officials tried today to break a logjam over
nuclear arms cuts and missile defense, while the world's main disarmament forum
appeared to be waiting for developments from those talks.
</P>
<P>
	   John Holum, the Clinton administration's top disarmament specialist, met
with his Russian counterpart in Geneva, also the site of the 66-nation
Conference on Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   Many ambassadors to the conference said they expected an address from Holum,
but an aide said no speech was planned. A limited session heard only Ireland's
concerns that the conference get global disarmament talks moving or risk
countries building their own nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
	   But Holum and Yuri Kapralov, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's arms
control department, stayed well away. Aides said they were holding discussions
elsewhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue are attempts to get the Russian parliament to approve the START II
treaty so the countries can move on to START III.
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to the sensitivity of the talks is Washington's desire to reopen the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty so it can develop a limited nuclear defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States says such a system is needed to defend against attacks
from rogue nations and poses no threat to Russia. Moscow says it would upset the
strategic balance and launch a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
	   The Holum-Kapralov session is the latest high-level U.S.-Russian meeting to
follow up on former President Boris Yeltsin's agreement with President Clinton
to at least discuss ABM modifications.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the failure of a prototype U.S. missile interceptor to hit its
target above the Pacific Ocean this week, diplomats were concerned that the U.S.
efforts were part of the unraveling of world disarmament efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Irish Ambassador Anne Anderson described the ABM treaty as ``under
challenge'' and noted that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan described it as ``a
cornerstone of strategic stability.''
</P>
<P>
	   The acting head of the delegation from China said his nation still fears the
impact the U.S. plans could have on the global network of arms agreements.
</P>
<P>
	   China joined with Russia in a joint statement last May to say deployment of
a missile defense system would violate ``a fundamental obligation under the ABM
treaty not to deploy ABM systems for the defense of national territory.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ambassador Li Changhe told the conference then that U.S. plans would
``trigger a new round of the arms race.'' Russian Ambassador Vasily S. Sidorov
said it would upset ``the whole system of international treaties in the
disarmament field.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and Russian diplomats refused to say if the talks were making progress.
</P>
<P>
	   START II, which would halve U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals to 3,000-3,500
warheads each, was signed in 1993 and ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The START process has stalled,'' Annan said in a plea read Tuesday at the
opening of the conference that participants put ``a real sense of urgency'' into
efforts to break the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
	   The deadlock is ``part of a wider and disturbing stagnation in the overall
disarmament and nonproliferation agenda,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Conference on Disarmament, meanwhile, was meeting for the first time
since the U.S. Senate rejected in October the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty the
forum negotiated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   That treaty also lacks ratification from such declared or ``threshold''
nuclear countries as China, Russia, India, Pakistan and Israel. Of the nuclear
powers, only France and Britain have ratified it.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms, one of the harshest critics of the
United Nations, extended a ``hand of friendship'' to the world body today but
mixed the overture with a warning to the organization to trim its bureaucracy
and not overstep its authority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American people ... have grown increasingly frustrated with what they
feel is a lack of gratitude,'' Helms, R-N.C., said in the first address of a
U.S. lawmaker to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the United Nations must trim its spending and not draw the United
States into ``entangling alliances.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A United Nations that seeks to impose its presumed authority on the
American people without their consent begs for confrontation, and I want to be
candid, eventual U.S. withdrawal,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, accused the
188-member U.N. General Assembly of an anti-American bias in many of its
activities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have received literally thousands of letters from Americans all across
the country expressing their deep frustration with this institution,'' Helms
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Helms, said he hoped that relations would improve between the world
body and the Republican-led U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not my intent to offend you, and I hope I will not,'' Helms said.
``It is my intent to extend to you my hand of friendship and convey the hope
that in the days to come ... we can join in a mutual respect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Helms, who in the past has ridiculed U.N. leaders as ``dysfunctional'' and
``cry babies,'' sought to mix a stern lecture with folksy charm, saying he hoped
``you have a translator here who can speak Southern.''
</P>
<P>
	   He called for ``a pattern of understanding and friendship'' between U.N.
delegates and Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms sat in a seat at the top of the horseshoe-shaped Security Council
table, mostly reading his remarks from a loose-leaf notebook, sometimes banging
his hands on the table to emphasize a point. Council members looked on with
little apparent emotion as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
	   The Security Council has 15 members, including the permanent five which have
veto power: the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms told the council exactly what he expects in return for a congressional
agreement to pay nearly $1 billion in back dues owed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The money we spend on the U.N. is not charity,'' Helms said. ``To the
contrary, it is an investment -- an investment from which the American people
rightly expect a return.''
</P>
<P>
	   Helms was invited to speak by the current council chairman, U.S. Ambassador
Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's his day,'' Holbrooke told reporters as Helms arrived at U.N.
headquarters. Holbrooke introduced Helms to the council, calling it a ``historic
occasion'' and crediting Helms' support for his own confirmation by the U.S.
Senate last year, after months of delay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to welcome you to this historic room, where wars have been avoided
at times and at other times the Security Council has failed to prevent wars,''
Holbrooke told Helms.
</P>
<P>
	   But Helms said the Security Council had a ``mixed record'' in recent
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it ``performed admirably'' in ending Iraqi aggression against Kuwait
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the more recent case of Kosovo, it was paralyzed. The U.N. peacekeeping
mission in Bosnia was a disaster, and its failure to protect the Bosnian people
from Serb genocide is well documented,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other criticisms, Helms has taken issue with Secretary General Kofi
Annan's calls for increased ``global engagement.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations ``must respect national sovereignty'' and not seek ``to
impose its utopian vision of international law on Americans,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, other members of the Foreign Relations Committee will join Helms
for a meeting with Annan, lunch at U.N. headquarters, and a committee hearing at
a nearby office building that will look into recent developments at the United

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today as robust corporate earnings
reports from several technology companies boosted the Nasdaq further into record
territory while blue-chip industrial stocks languished.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
82.52 at 11,406.84. Its loss stemmed largely from Alcoa, which fell 4 to 74 1/8,
and Procter &AMP; Gamble, which lost 5 11/16 to 109 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was up 33.65 at 4,184.94, moving past the closing
record of 11,489.36 reached Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 5.04 at 1,450.86.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors once again poured money into shares of large technology companies,
several of which reported better than expected earnings late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The earnings reports bolstered the positive outlook about technology and
its prospects for growth," said Paul Cherney, market analyst at Standard &AMP;
Poor's.
</P>
<P>
	   IBM, which sent a chill through the technology sector last fall when it said
sales had slumped due to worries about the Year 2000 computer bug, easily beat
Wall Street's profit forecasts. While company officials warned that lingering
concerns will continue to take a toll on sales in the current quarter, they
encouraged analysts to leave their profit forecasts for 2000 intact.
</P>
<P>
	   IBM stock soared 7 1/16 to 122 9/16 today.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Apple Computer rose 14 5/16 to 120 7/8. Apple said late
Wednesday it earned $183 million, or $1.03 a share, in its most recent quarter.
Strong sales of its iMac computer helped Apple coast past published estimates of
90 cents per share and past the "whisper number" of 97 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   America Online, which has seen its stock price tumble since the company
announced its intentions to merge with Time Warner, slipped  1/4 to 63 13/16.
AOL said late Wednesday it earned $224 million, or 9 cents a share, in the
quarter ended Dec. 31, more than double the $86 million, or 4 cents a share, in
the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts had expected AOL to earn 8 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcoa dropped as the company announced plans to restart primary aluminum
production to meet growing global demand. The announcement caused aluminum
prices to drop. A steady rise in aluminum prices last year helped Alcoa turn in
the highest returns of any Dow component stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 487.54 million shares, on par with
Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.81 to 525.85. The index,
which lagged through much of 1999, has surged so far this year and has set new
closing records in the past three sessions on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're getting some measurable outperformance from the small companies,"
Cherney said. "Investors appear unwilling to put all their eggs in one basket,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> FCC Likely To OK Small Stations  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cajun, zydeco, swamp pop, jazz, rock. The Louisiana music
scene boasts a range of styles that the state's artists work to keep alive each
day.
</P>
<P>
	   But getting the eclectic mix of music onto the airwaves poses another
challenge altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of Louisiana music falls through the cracks because of commercial
radio programming,'' said Steve Picou, assistant director of the Louisiana Music
Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal regulators are moving ahead with a plan that could help the music
commission and hundreds of other groups tap into local interests: the creation
of low-tech FM radio stations.
</P>
<P>
	   A proposal that would allow for at least 1,000 low-power FM stations run by
community groups, churches and schools to spring up nationwide won approval
today from the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   It marks one of the most significant changes in FM radio in decades.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan would let groups obtain noncommercial licenses for 10-watt and
100-watt stations and tailor their broadcasts to the interests of people in
their listening areas. The power of current FM stations ranges from 6,000 watts
up to 100,000 watts.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan has faced opposition from commercial broadcasters, who fear
low-power stations would interfere with existing FM stations.
</P>
<P>
	   One strong proponent is the FCC chairman, Bill Kennard, who hopes the plan
would allow for greater diversity on the airwaves at a time when the media
industry is consolidating.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The airwaves can accommodate lots of voices,'' Kennard said in an
interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   He hopes the low-power stations ``will allow some of these nontraditional
voices to speak to their community.''
</P>
<P>
	   For example, high schools could set up their own radio stations or local
broadcasters could serve non-English speaking groups or distinct musical
interests in their regions, Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
	   A 100-watt station, using a 100-foot antenna, could serve a 7-mile area,
according to FCC officials. Smaller stations of 10 watts would cover a 4-mile
radius.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard estimates these power levels will allow for at least 1,000 new
stations around the country. The plan will contain some limitations on the
number of licenses a single entity can own and will have some requirements to
ensure that license holders have a base in the local community, according to
Kennard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to maximize the opportunities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents such as the National Association of Broadcasters have commissioned
studies to document what they say would be the degradation in service to
listeners that could result from such low-power stations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've provided what we believe is unassailable evidence that low-power
stations will add to the interference on an already congested radio band,''
association spokesman Dennis Wharton said. ``Thousands of people won't be able
to hear their hometown radio stations because of this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., a member of the House Commerce Committee, made a
last-minute pitch to the FCC on Wednesday, urging the commission to make sure
all harmful interference issues had been addressed before the commission made
its decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard has said he would not do anything to interfere with standard FM
service. The FCC has said it was confident that low-power stations could coexist
with full-power FM stations.
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to help regular FM stations grow and become financially solid,
the FCC stopped licensing low-powered FM radio stations around 1978. But once
the commission offered a proposal to reintroduce low-power stations last year,
it was flooded with thousands of comments from interested parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Public interest groups say they will welcome the opportunity for more people
to have access to the airwaves, but stress that it's only one step.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wish this could address all of the concerns about mass media
consolidation,'' said Cheryl Leanza of the Media Access Project, a public
interest law firm. ``It's a meaningful step, but it's certainly not a complete
answer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, the commission was expected to vote today on rules to ensure
broadcasters and cable companies are recruiting minorities and women to fill
vacancies. This comes after a 1998 court decision that scuttled the FCC's
30-year-old equal employment opportunity rules for TV and radio stations,
declaring them unconstitutional.

<HEADLINE> Helms Seeks U.N. Reforms  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms, one of the harshest critics of the
United Nations, extended a ``hand of friendship'' to the world body today but
mixed the overture with a warning to the organization to trim its bureaucracy
and not overstep its authority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American people ... have grown increasingly frustrated with what they
feel is a lack of gratitude,'' Helms, R-N.C., said in the first address of a
U.S. lawmaker to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the United Nations must trim its spending and not draw the United
States into ``entangling alliances.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A United Nations that seeks to impose its presumed authority on the
American people without their consent begs for confrontation -- and I want to be
candid-- eventual U.S. withdrawal,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, accused the
188-member U.N. General Assembly of an anti-American bias in many of its
activities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have received literally thousands of letters from Americans all across
the country expressing their deep frustration with this institution,'' Helms
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Helms said he hopes relations will improve between the world body and
the Republican-led U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not my intent to offend you, and I hope I will not,'' Helms said.
``It is my intent to extend to you my hand of friendship and convey the hope
that in the days to come ... we can join in a mutual respect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Helms, who in the past has ridiculed U.N. leaders as ``dysfunctional'' and
``cry babies,'' sought to mix a stern lecture with folksy charm, saying he hoped
``you have a translator here who can speak Southern.''
</P>
<P>
	   He called for ``a pattern of understanding and friendship'' between U.N.
delegates and Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms' remarks drew sharp responses from the closest U.S. allies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your warm accent from the South was entirely understood by our
interpreters,'' said French Ambassador Alain Dejammet. ``We did hear you. But
the idea in this house is that others must be heard as well.'' He denounced the
U.S. delinquency in paying dues.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter van Walsum, envoy from the Netherlands, said that while the United
Nations makes a ``supreme effort to accommodate the United States,'' under the
U.N. charter it cannot attach conditions to its payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Fowler, Canada's representative, said the slowness of U.S. payments
has ``seriously impaired our cooperative efforts to protect and promote
international peace and security.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese ambassador, Qin Huasun, had muted comments, saying the United
Nations ``is not perfect ... but it is irreplaceable and it is there for
everyone to see.''
</P>
<P>
	   He suggested agreement with Helms' views that the United Nations exhibit
``respect for sovereignty'' and ``no intervention in internal affairs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan escorted Helms into the chamber, but did not
stay for the speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms sat in a seat at the top of the horseshoe-shaped Security Council
table, mostly reading his remarks from a loose-leaf notebook, sometimes banging
his hands on the table to emphasize a point. Council members looked on with
little apparent emotion as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
	   The Security Council has 15 members, including the permanent five with have
veto power: the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms told the council exactly what he expects in return for a congressional
agreement to pay nearly $1 billion in back dues owed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The money we spend on the U.N. is not charity,'' Helms said. ``To the
contrary, it is an investment -- an investment from which the American people
rightly expect a return.''
</P>
<P>
	   Helms was invited to speak by the current council chairman, U.S. Ambassador
Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's his day,'' Holbrooke told reporters as Helms arrived at U.N.
headquarters. Holbrooke introduced Helms to the council, calling it a ``historic
occasion'' and crediting Helms' support for his own confirmation by the U.S.
Senate last year, after months of delay.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to welcome you to this historic room, where wars have been avoided
at times and at other times the Security Council has failed to prevent wars,''
Holbrooke told Helms.
</P>
<P>
	   But Helms said the Security Council had a ``mixed record'' in recent
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it ``performed admirably'' in ending Iraqi aggression against Kuwait
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the more recent case of Kosovo, it was paralyzed. The U.N. peacekeeping
mission in Bosnia was a disaster, and its failure to protect the Bosnian people
from Serb genocide is well documented,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, other members of the Foreign Relations Committee will join Helms
for a meeting with Annan, lunch at U.N. headquarters, and a committee hearing at
a nearby office building that will look into recent developments at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We in the Congress don't do nearly enough of this sort of thing,'' said
committee member Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
	   In late 1999, Congress voted to pay $926 million in U.N. arrears over three
years, ending years of debate on unrelated issues like international abortion
programs that had held up the payments.
</P>
<P>
	   But the legislation also included about two dozen conditions, which must be
met for all the money to be released. One of the conditions is that the United
Nations maintain a zero-growth budget. Other conditions call for a reduction in
the U.S. share of the U.N. peacekeeping budget from the current 31 percent to 25
percent; and in the regular budget from 25 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States now must try to persuade the other 187 U.N. members to go
along with these demands.

<HEADLINE> Laborers Union, Justice Reach Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Laborers union has reached agreement with the Justice
Department to loosen federal oversight, eliminating the threat of
court-appointed officers taking over and cleaning house, the union said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new agreement, effective Feb. 1, the union will have to keep
internal anti-corruption programs intact through its 2001 elections and the
government has the right to challenge any changes in court.
</P>
<P>
	   The programs have included the first direct elections of national union
leaders and an ethics code enforced by independent officers who have placed
locals and district councils representing 68,000 members under supervision or
trusteeship, including in New York, Buffalo, New Jersey and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   The internal corruption investigations reached as high as the union's former
president, Arthur Coia, who resigned Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This agreement is a clear acknowledgment by the government that our
union's innovative internal reforms have been effective in ridding the influence
of organized crime and corruption, and in building a union that is more open and
responsive to its members,'' said Terence M. O'Sullivan, who has replaced Coia
as president.
</P>
<P>
	   In a news release, the union said delegates to its 2006 convention would be
permitted for the first time to consider modifying internal changes that have
resulted from the federal oversight arrangement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Laborers International Union of North America has more than 800,000
members, mostly in the construction, environmental cleanup and maintenance
industries.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1980s, President Reagan's Commission on Organized Crime accused the
Laborers of having mob ties.
</P>
<P>
	   To avoid racketeering charges, the union agreed in February 1995 to weed out
alleged mob lieutenants from its ranks and hold direct elections of its
officers. Under that agreement, which expires Jan. 31, the Justice Department
retained the right to place the union under the control of a court-appointed
federal trustee.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, congressional Republicans criticized the union and the Clinton
administration and questioned why the union wasn't placed into federal
trusteeship.
</P>
<P>
	   But a House inquiry into the arrangement between the Laborers and Justice
found no evidence that prosecutors were improperly influenced by the close
relationship Coia had with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Coia was cleared last year by an independent hearing officer of charges that
he had ties to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
	   He was fined $100,000, however, for a separate ethics violation under a
process established under the arrangement with the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   That ethics violation -- accepting a Ferrari in a joint arrangement with a
dealer who leased cars to the union -- had launched a new criminal investigation
by federal officials who were disappointed Coia was not ousted from the union.
</P>
<P>
	   Upon his resignation, Coia said he was tired of the scrutiny of his conduct
and that he believes he will ultimately be remembered for his efforts to clean
up the union.

<HEADLINE> Filmmaker Explores Vietnam War  </HEADLINE>
    By JEAN H. LEE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- For two decades after her young husband returned from
Vietnam in a flag-draped casket, Barbara Sonneborn packed away his
blood-encrusted dog tags and wedding ring.
</P>
<P>
	   She remarried and became a successful artist. But time did little to heal
her wounds of war, and on the 20th anniversary of the day her husband died, she
vowed to face her grief.
</P>
<P>
	   Her journey -- from her own isolation to the spot in Vietnam where her
husband was killed in a mortar attack in 1968 -- became the documentary "Regret
to Inform." It airs Monday at 10 p.m. EST as an episode of PBS' "P.O.V." series.
</P>
<P>
	   Personal, moving and refreshing in its candor and perspective, "Regret to
Inform" is not a combat movie. There's no talk of tactical maneuvers, ideology
or battles won and lost. Communism is mentioned not even once.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the film asks what happened to the women left behind -- the wives
who sent off their fresh-faced young men flush with patriotism, only to have
them return, ignominiously, in plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
	   And it asks what happened to the people of Vietnam, a land of Buddhists that
was riven by bombs and doused with chemicals that to this day leave newborns
disfigured.
</P>
<P>
	   And, finally, it is a love story, about the young love of college
sweethearts and new parents from Illinois to Arizona, Hanoi to Saigon, cut short
by machine guns and mortar attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   "This film is not about politics," Sonneborn says in an interview. "It's
about war itself, about the meaning of war in our lives. It's also a film about
having compassion for people we consider on the other side -- our enemies."
</P>
<P>
	   Those former enemies include Nguyen Thi Hong, who tells of disguising
herself as a maid to spy on American soldiers, and describes being hung by the
feet and zapped with electrodes when captured. She calls the cruelty "longer
than a river, higher than a mountain, deeper than an ocean."
</P>
<P>
	   Clad in a traditional Vietnamese dress, she takes Sonneborn's hand as they
reach the spot where the filmmaker's husband was killed. Together, the former
Vietcong spy and the wife of her onetime enemy make a peace offering.
</P>
<P>
	   We learn, from Sonneborn's translator, Xuan Ngoc Nguyen, how war steals
youth. She was 14 when the bombs began falling on her family's home in Saigon
and her 5-year-old cousin was shot dead -- by a U.S. soldier -- before her very
eyes.
</P>
<P>
	   To help her family survive, she goes to work as a prostitute. And when she
hears a neighbor's cries for help, she makes the split-second decision that she
cannot stop if she wants to survive.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to decide who's going to live and who's going to die," says Xuan
Ngoc Nguyen, her fist clenched in her lap. She finds love with a South
Vietnamese soldier. He's killed two months before she gives birth to their son.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in America, thousands of miles' distance is no consolation. And when a
tape from her husband arrives after his death, Sonneborn puts it aside. It takes
her 24 years to summon up the courage to listen to it, and she is haunted by the
doubt in his voice as he tries to explain how hard it is to decipher a hoe from
a rifle, a farmer from the enemy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Jeff and I talked about the fact that he might get killed, but we never
talked about what he might have to do there," Sonneborn says.
</P>
<P>
	   The countryside Sonneborn sees from her train window is one of tranquility
-- farmers leading oxen through rice paddies, women plying the waters in boats
laden with fruits.
</P>
<P>
	   But the serenity belies a land ravaged by violence, and Sonneborn deftly
blends images of beauty with chilling war footage -- babies wailing amid
bloodied bodies, civilians cowering in the jungle as helicopters hover overhead,
bombs igniting villages.
</P>
<P>
	   There are also images of compassion: an American soldier, his eyes empty
with weariness, patting the back of an infant with bloody bandages tied about
its head.
</P>
<P>
	   And there is a clear sense of sisterhood among the war widows that
transcends ideology and nationality. Sonneborn holds the hand of a woman who may
have led the attack that killed her husband; Xuan Ngoc Nguyen, now an American
citizen, translates for women who earlier might have branded her a U.S.
collaborator. They are united in their conviction that war must end.
</P>
<P>
	   "But talking to widows, I saw we're the same. We both lost a loved one and
our country was destroyed," Xuan Ngoc Nguyen says. "We are not the enemies --
war is our enemy. We suffered the same suffering."

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading heavily
today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   IBM's fourth-quarter profit tumbled 11 percent as the company struggled with
customers' worries over the Year 2000 computer bug. But profits still beat Wall
Street forecasts, and IBM officials encouraged analysts to leave their forecasts
for 2000 intact.
</P>
<P>
	   The bookseller expects fourth-quarter earnings to top estimates due to
strong sales at its superstores. Barnes &AMP; Noble said it expects to report $1.38
a share in profits, above analysts' estimates of $1.21 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Cascade Investment LLC, an investment vehicle for Microsoft Corp. chairman
Bill Gates, has claimed a 5.01 percent stake in Avista. Gates disclosed in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he holds 1.79 million
shares in Avista, a Spokane, Wash., energy company.
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco company Swedish Match AB plans to buy 64 percent of the shares in
General Cigar Holding, a U.S. company which sells cigar brands including
Macanudo and Cohiba. Last spring, Swedish Match bought General Cigar's mass
market operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The company expects to drastically miss earnings estimates for the fourth
quarter. Sunterra said it expects to report operating income of 1 cent to 8
cents per share, well below First Call/Thomson Financial estimates of 42 cents a
share. Sunterra develops and operates time-share vacation resorts.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said its auditors have required it to adopt more conservative
accounting practices, which forced it to restate third-quarter results. Legato
also missed estimates for its fourth quarter. The company makes backup and
recovery software.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's largest maker of lasers used in vision-correcting surgery said
demand for procedures using its surgical laser did not grow in the fourth
quarter. Visx met earnings forecasts of 38 cents per share.

<HEADLINE> DeLay Opens New GOP Drive  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Majority Whip Tom DeLay implored conservatives
Thursday to back the Republican drive to capture the White House and hold the
party's congressional majority this November, saying the GOP is defending ``the
great principles that have always defined America.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a 21-minute speech brimming with attacks on President Clinton and
liberals, DeLay sought to rally conservatives who in recent years have despaired
over GOP compromises on spending and other issues. DeLay, R-Texas, has become
one of the conservative movement's closest allies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our cause -- the defense of our values -- has never changed,'' DeLay said
in remarks at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ``We lack only a united
conservative front that can guide a cause to victory. And that means a
Republican president working with a Republican Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many Republicans have said poor turnout by dispirited conservatives cost the
GOP several House seats in the 1998 elections. The GOP's hold on the 435-member
House is now so slim that a net Democratic gain of five seats would give them
control of the chamber. Republicans consider a big conservative turnout crucial
to their electoral prospects in this fall's voting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So you can understand my frustration when some of our friends in the
conservative movement allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good,'' DeLay
said. ``All conservatives want to do more, but achieving more will require an
expanded Republican majority.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his speech and in remarks afterward to reporters, DeLay suggested that
the GOP's congressional agenda should be pushed rightward this year. Such a
strategy could conflict with that of GOP presidential front-runner George W.
Bush, who has been trying to give himself a softer edge than congressional
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   DeLay told reporters that his fellow Republicans should ``stand up for what
you believe in and not run from the onslaught that is to come'' if measures are
vetoed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's time to rediscover our world view and apply it to everything we're
passing in the House,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   DeLay mentioned few specific proposals. But he said a GOP drive aimed at
``rediscovering our values'' would include supporting ``faith-based
institutions,'' attacking violence and obscenity, reducing taxes and regulations
that he said hurt families, supporting the military and a foreign policy that
supports religious and political freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will be the foot soldiers in what, I believe, will someday be
recognized as the effort that not only contained, but rolled back the attack on
the great principles that have always defined America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Erik Smith, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee,
said that with GOP incumbents vacating House seats in several moderate, suburban
districts, a conservative shift by the Republican Party would help Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Following Tom DeLay's path to the far right is what's going to lose the
House'' for Republicans, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   DeLay, long one of Clinton's most unrelenting critics, said the White House
``has moved through the cherished institutions of our nation like a threshing
machine.'' He cited the administration's decision to return 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez to his father in Cuba as evidence of the need to introduce ``moral
principle'' to politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We cannot make great progress with a chief executive who believes that it
can, under any circumstances, be in a child's best interests to live under
Castro's communism,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also credited congressional Republicans with opposing ``a culture of
fashionable nihilism'' led by abortion-rights supporters and activist judges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have been alone in mounting a broad challenge to a liberalism designed
in elite universities and marketed by the entertainment moguls who employ their
graduates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   DeLay's remarks came a week before Clinton is scheduled to deliver his State
of the Union address. With Congress not commencing this year's session until
next week, Republicans have been hoping to gain attention with speeches by DeLay
and other congressional leaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Entertainment executive David Geffen wants more Love in
his life.
</P>
<P>
	   Geffen Records has filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Courtney Love
and Eric Erlandson, the principal members of the band Hole, claiming the group
still owes Geffen five albums under a 1992 agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The Superior Court suit filed Wednesday claims that Doll Head Inc., which
owns the exclusive recording services of Ms. Love and Erlandson, repudiated the
contract based on a California labor law limiting personal services contracts to
seven years.
</P>
<P>
	   Geffen contends recording contracts are not personal services agreements. He
said the pact was extended by amendment in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit seeks unspecified damages and an injunction barring the band from
recording as Hole for anyone else.
</P>
<P>
	   A telephone message left Thursday for Ms. Love's publicist wasn't
immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 131.23; Nasdaq Up 19.11  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell steeply today, while robust corporate
earnings reports from several technology companies boosted the Nasdaq further
into record territory.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 131.23 at 11,358.13. Its loss stemmed largely from Alcoa and Procter &AMP;
Gamble.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was up 19.11 at 4,170.40, moving past the closing
record of 4,151.29 reached Wednesday. In earlier trading, the technology-heavy
index rose as much as 73 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 9.43 at 1,446.47.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcoa dropped 4 1/2 to 73 5/8 as the company announced plans to restart
primary aluminum production to meet growing global demand. The announcement
caused aluminum prices to drop. A steady rise in aluminum prices last year
helped Alcoa turn in the highest returns of any Dow component stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 5 1/16 to 110 1/8 amid rumors that the consumer
products company will make a white-knight bid for Warner-Lambert, which is
fighting a takeover offer from Pfizer. While many analysts believe that the
takeover talk is merely an effort to get Pfizer to raise its offer, the
uncertainty pressured Procter &AMP; Gamble shares, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors once again poured money into shares of large technology companies,
several of which reported better than expected earnings late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The earnings reports bolstered the positive outlook about technology and
its prospects for growth," said Paul Cherney, market analyst at Standard &AMP;
Poor's.
</P>
<P>
	   IBM, which sent a chill through the technology sector last fall when it said
sales had slumped due to worries about the Year 2000 computer bug, easily beat
Wall Street's profit forecasts. While company officials warned that lingering
concerns will continue to take a toll on sales in the current quarter, they
encouraged analysts to leave their profit forecasts for 2000 intact.
</P>
<P>
	   IBM stock rose 5 9/16 to 121 1/16 today.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Apple Computer soared 11 3/8 to 117 15/16. Apple said late
Wednesday it earned $183 million, or $1.03 a share, in its most recent quarter.
Strong sales of its iMac computer helped Apple coast past published estimates of
90 cents per share and past the "whisper number" of 97 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   America Online, which has seen its stock price tumble since the company
announced its intentions to merge with Time Warner, edged up  1/4 to 64 5/16.
AOL said late Wednesday it earned $224 million, or 9 cents a share, in the
quarter ended Dec. 31, more than double the $86 million, or 4 cents a share, in
the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts had expected AOL to earn 8 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 752.51 million shares, ahead of Wednesday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.82 to 523.84. The index,
which lagged through much of 1999, has surged so far this year and has set new
closing records in the past three sessions on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're getting some measurable outperformance from the small companies,"
Cherney said. "Investors appear unwilling to put all their eggs in one basket,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Sundance Film Festival Opening  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Movie buyers trolling the Sundance Film Festival
that started Thursday might wish they could ask that witch in the woods whether
there's any more at home like her.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Blair Witch Project," acquired for $1 million at Sundance last year,
went on to gross $140 million, the first bona fide blockbuster to come out of
the nation's premier independent movie showcase.
</P>
<P>
	   While the movie's success prompted predictions that festivals like this
would become crowded with films copying the shaky, home-video look and
improvised approach of "Blair Witch," there's little evidence of that in this
year's 113 features at Sundance.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not an easy film to emulate, the way it mixes genres," Sundance
co-director Geoffrey Gilmore said. "It has a very sophisticated sense of
documentary and horror films and also imagery, so it's hard to anticipate a lot
of different kinds of imitators."
</P>
<P>
	   So buyers remain as cautious as ever about opening their checkbooks at
Sundance. Some distributors say there's even more caution this year because of
recent box-office underachievers such as "Happy, Texas" or "Next Stop,
Wonderland," which were multimillion dollar Sundance acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
	   "People are always looking for lightning to strike twice," said Gerry Rich,
president of worldwide marketing for MGM-United Artists. "That can be dangerous
if you go to Sundance looking to repeat a phenomenon that happened the year
before.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't go there with a mandate to come back with a film under our arms.
Maybe we're geniuses if we come back empty-handed."
</P>
<P>
	   Founded in 1978 and taken over by Robert Redford's Sundance Institute in
1985, the festival runs through Jan. 30. Though the festival began as a creative
showcase, the success of "Blair Witch" emphasizes that it's become as much a
movie marketplace where frenzied bidding can push the price of a film as high as
$10 million, beyond the box-office potential of most independent films.
</P>
<P>
	   Artisan Entertainment had no competition for "Blair Witch," the story of
three filmmakers who vanished while hunting for a legendary witch. After seeing
the movie at a midnight screening at Sundance, Artisan snapped it up, along with
sequel rights, the next day.
</P>
<P>
	   The success of "Blair Witch" had as much to do with its gimmicky marketing
as its gimmicky storytelling. Artisan's Internet-heavy campaign pitched the
fictional movie as a documentary about real filmmakers whose story is told
through their own footage, recovered a year after they disappeared in the woods.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Hollywood executives have observed that if a major studio had picked up
"Blair Witch," it might never have made back its million. Rather than risking
the sort of guerrilla-marketing campaign Artisan concocted, a top studio likely
would have plugged the film through traditional advertising that might not have
captivated the youthful, computer-savvy moviegoers who made "Blair Witch" a
megahit.
</P>
<P>
	   "'Blair Witch' was a marketing person's dream," said Amir Malin, Artisan
president. "It provided us with ample opportunities to promote it and get it out
of the art-house ghetto and find a commercial audience."
</P>
<P>
	   Neil Friedman, a sales agent for eight movies showing at Sundance, said
independent filmmakers should not head into the festival with unrealistic
expectations that their movies will be the next "Blair Witch."
</P>
<P>
	   "Any filmmaker who thinks they've got something," he said, "until they set
it in front of an audience, they're wrong."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Education Tax Credit  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed a tax credit designed to make
college education more affordable today, saying that ``when we open the doors to
college we open the doors to opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
	   The political overtones were obvious at the event called on the first day of
his last year in office: First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the man she
would serve alongside were she to win her Senate bid, Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., stood by the president as he chided Republican leaders who have all but
closed the door on his agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some in Congress, I note, are saying that because this is an election year
we really shouldn't try to do anything for the American people,'' Clinton said.
``Nothing ... should get in the way of making a college education more
affordable for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the program being outlined by the president today is a
$30 billion, 10-year initiative that would make higher education more affordable
for millions, said the officials, who spoke on condition they not be identified
by name.
</P>
<P>
	   When the ``College Opportunity Tax Cut'' is fully phased in, a family could
receive a tax deduction of up to $10,000 for tuition, fees and training.
Alternatively, taxpayers could seek a maximum credit of $2,800 a year. A similar
proposal died in Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When we make college more affordable,'' Clinton said, ``we make the
American dream more achievable.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president also was calling for a $1 billion increase in Pell Grants, new
College Completion Challenge Grants and other federal education assistance,
including work-study and a new plan for helping students pursuing dual degrees.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked why Congress could be expected to pass Clinton's plan this year, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart replied: ``Members of Congress who have been in
their districts understand that education is the top priority for most
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   The political season has raised doubts that Congress will act on much of
Clinton's agenda. ``The public wants progress,'' Lockhart said. ``I think there
will be a political cost for those who want to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal includes $35 million for the college Completion Challenge
Grants, designed to spur college dropouts to return to class; $40 million for a
new initiative to help minorities pursue five-year dual-degree programs in
fields where they are underrepresented; and $716 million for the Pell Grants.
</P>
<P>
	   Additionally, Clinton's plan seeks $400 million in increases for the Gear Up
program, which helps disadvantaged youths stay in high school; TRIO, which helps
them stay in college; Job Corps, a national education and job training program
targeted at impoverished youths; and similar initiatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Making college tuition tax deductible was a key campaign pledge of Schumer
in his successful bid to oust Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998. His
proposal was narrowly defeated as an amendment to the tax cut package last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer's plan would have allowed families to deduct up to $12,000 from
their income to cover the costs of college tuition. That would have saved the
average middle-class family as much as $3,360 per student.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer said his plan would cost between $45 billion and $50 billion over 10
years and could be paid for out of the nation's budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is also trying to appeal to middle-class suburban voters in the
New York Senate race. Polls show her trailing New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in the politically crucial suburbs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposing $33B Tax Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of middle-class taxpayers, especially families
with children, would be protected from the complex alternative minimum tax under
a $33 billion plan proposed Thursday by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
	   In his fiscal 2001 budget to be released next month, President Clinton will
ask Congress to ensure that the alternative minimum tax is not triggered when
people claim personal exemptions, such as the $500 per-child tax credit, or take
the standard deduction instead of itemizing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because of design flaws, the alternative minimum tax is increasingly
hitting families in an unintended manner,'' said Jonathan Talisman, the Treasury
Department's assistant secretary for tax policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The minimum tax was originally created to make sure the wealthy do not
escape income taxes by taking numerous exemptions, credits and deductions. But
it was never indexed for inflation, and as middle-class tax breaks and salaries
have grown, so have the number of people subjected to the 28 percent AMT and its
highly complex calculations.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, a couple with five children with $70,000 in income who claim
the standard tax deduction would be subject to the minimum tax in 2000, Treasury
Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   If nothing is done, Treasury estimates show that the number of people who
would have to pay the minimum tax would rise from 1.3 million this year to 17
million by 2010. The proposal outlined Thursday would cut that number to about
7.6 million in 2010, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan, costing an estimated $32.8 billion over 10 years, would gradually
make sure all personal exemptions could be deducted without concern of
triggering the minimum tax. It would be phased in this way:
</P>
<P>
	   --For tax years 2000 through 2007, personal exemptions for all but two
dependents would be deductible.
</P>
<P>
	   --For tax years 2008 and 2009, personal exemptions for all but one dependent
would be deductible.
</P>
<P>
	   --For tax years 2010 and beyond, all personal exemptions could be deducted.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the Clinton administration plan would enable taxpayers to claim
the standard deduction for minimum tax purposes instead of being forced to
itemize. Under current law, itemized deductions don't count toward the minimum
tax, yet for some taxpayers it is more advantageous to take the standard
deduction.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Clinton signed into law a bill passed by Congress to protect
taxpayers who claim numerous exemptions from the minimum tax, but that measure
covers only two years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican-led Congress included outright repeal of the tax in last
summer's 10-year, $792 billion tax cut, but Clinton vetoed the bill because it
would have used too much of the projected budget surplus. Rep. Bill Archer,
chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, called the
administration plan ``half a loaf'' and urged that the tax be abolished.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Until we get rid of the AMT, this tax hike time bomb will continue to trap
millions of middle-income families,'' said Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The national taxpayer advocate at the Internal Revenue Service, Val Oveson,
said in his recent report to Congress that the alternative minimum tax is one of
the worst complexities in the tax code and also recommended that it be phased
out.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Backs Swede for Iraq Agency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen flew to New York on
Thursday to meet with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and express
the Clinton administration's support for Annan's candidate to head a new U.N.
weapons inspection agency for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan wants Sweden's ambassador to Washington, Rolf Ekeus, to head the
inspection agency but Russia, China and France blocked the choice in the U.N.
Security Council on Tuesday. Security Council members decided to continue
consultations, and U.N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said Ekeus remained a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Ekeus headed an earlier U.N. effort to account for Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction before he became Sweden's ambassador to Washington. There have been
no U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq since December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said the defense secretary also would
discuss African security issues with Annan, as well as meet with Holbrooke.
Cohen is planning a trip to Africa in February.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 119.68; Nasdaq Up 27.99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell steeply today, while robust corporate
earnings reports from several technology companies boosted the Nasdaq further
into record territory.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 119.68 at 11,369.68. Its loss stemmed largely from Alcoa.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was up 27.99 at 4,179.28, moving past the closing
record of 4,151.29 reached Wednesday. In earlier trading, the
technology-dominated index rose as much as 73 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 10.37 at 1,445.53.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcoa dropped 4 7/16 to 73 11/16 as the company announced plans to restart
primary aluminum production to meet growing global demand. The announcement
caused aluminum prices to drop. A steady rise in aluminum prices last year
helped Alcoa turn in the highest returns of any Dow component stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer products companies also fared poorly today. Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 1
3/4 to 110 1/8 and 3M fell 4 to 94 13/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors once again poured money into shares of large technology companies,
several of which reported better than expected earnings late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The earnings reports bolstered the positive outlook about technology and
its prospects for growth," said Paul Cherney, market analyst at Standard &AMP;
Poor's.
</P>
<P>
	   IBM, which sent a chill through the technology sector last fall when it said
sales had slumped due to worries about the Year 2000 computer bug, easily beat
Wall Street's profit forecasts. While company officials warned that lingering
concerns will continue to take a toll on sales in the current quarter, they
encouraged analysts to leave their profit forecasts for 2000 intact.
</P>
<P>
	   IBM stock rose 6 5/16 to 121 13/16 today.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Apple Computer soared 11 1/2 to 118 1/16. Apple said late
Wednesday it earned $183 million, or $1.03 a share, in its most recent quarter.
Strong sales of its iMac computer helped Apple coast past published estimates of
90 cents per share and past the "whisper number" of 97 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   America Online, which has seen its stock price tumble since the company
announced its intentions to merge with Time Warner, edged up  1/2 to 64 9/16.
AOL said late Wednesday it earned $224 million, or 9 cents a share, in the
quarter ended Dec. 31, more than double the $86 million, or 4 cents a share, in
the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts had expected AOL to earn 8 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 896.00 million shares, ahead of Wednesday's
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was fairly volatile a day ahead of Friday's "double witching"
session, when quarterly stock and index options expire, forcing traders to
adjust their portfolios. These quarterly deadlines tend to increase volume and
volatility.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.11 to 525.13. The index,
which lagged through much of 1999, has surged so far this year and has set new
closing records in the past three sessions on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're getting some measurable outperformance from the small companies,"
Cherney said. "Investors appear unwilling to put all their eggs in one basket,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Navy chooses Camden over Bayonne as permanent home of USS New  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. Navy has chosen the Camden, N.J., waterfront
as the permanent home for the retired battleship USS New Jersey, members of
Congress said Thursday.
<P>
	   The decision, which the Navy is expected to officially announce shortly,
will deliver a huge victory to South Jersey advocates who said the ship belongs
close to its place of birth, the Philadelphia Navy Yard.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy decision goes against the recommendation of the state's Battleship
New Jersey Commission, which by a majority vote endorsed placing the battleship
at a pier in Bayonne, N.J., across the harbor from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Bayonne and Camden both advanced detailed arguments about why they would
they would be the best place for a floating museum.
</P>
<P>
	   Bayonne boosters cited the city's proximity to New York and other population
centers of northern New Jersey. The case for Camden included the ship's ties to
the Philadelphia shipyard, where it was built in 1942, and the idea that the
Delaware River's freshwater would be kinder to the ship's massive hull.
</P>
<P>
	   The highly decorated New Jersey, one of only four battleships left in the
world, cruised the seas through 40 years and four wars. Launched during World
War II, it employed its immense guns in Korea, Vietnam and off the coast of
Lebanon in 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will be a great thing for the area, a great thing for the area's
veterans and a great thing for Camden," said Rep. Jim Saxton, R-Mount Holly, who
helped lead the Camden push.
</P>
<P>
	   Saxton said Camden proved the more economically viable location, in part
because Bayonne would have had to compete against an existing floating military
museum, the aircraft carrier USS Intrepid, located across New York Harbor.
</P>
<P>
	   State Assemblyman Joe Azzolina, chairman of the state battleship commission,
promised to implement the Navy's decision even though it went against his
long-held belief that the ship should go to the former Military Ocean Terminal
in Bayonne.
</P>
<P>
	   "Congratulations to Camden!" he wrote in pen on the bottom of a press
release.
</P>
<P>
	   The battleship currently sits at the Philadelphia Naval Business Center,
formerly the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. It was towed there from Bremerton,
Wash., last year on a 5,800-mile trip that included its 10th - and final -
passage through the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle for the battleship opened a long-standing political rift between
North Jersey versus South Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight northern New Jersey congressman advocated Bayonne, while three
southern New Jersey congressman endorsed Camden.
</P>
<P>
	   South Jersey advocates also secured endorsements from congressmen
representing parts of Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland, as well as members of
New York's delegation, who worried that a battleship museum in North Jersey
would compete for tourist dollars with the Intrepid, docked off Manhattan's West
Side.
</P>
<P>
	   Also weighing in for Camden was Andrew Cuomo, secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, who said a floating battleship museum would support federal efforts
to make the city an economic empowerment zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Closely divided, New Jersey's battleship commission voted in 1998 to berth
the warship in Bayonne. But several members supporting Bayonne did so with the
caveat that the ship should move to Liberty State Park in Jersey City if it is
ever renovated to accommodate such a huge vessel.
</P>
<P>
	   Jersey City officials subsequently agreed not to compete with Bayonne before
the Navy's ship-donation program. But Camden did file its own application.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman originally said she would abide by the advice of the
commission. But then she proclaimed herself neutral, pledging $6 million in
state money to restore the ship to museum readiness, wherever it ended up.
</P>
<P>
	   Economics, not just pride, was at issue. Bayonne and Camden are both aging
cities that would welcome the boost of tourism dollars. Also, since the federal
government cannot subsidize a donated warship, a failed museum in either
location could force taxpayers to cover its expense.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the $6 million from the state, an estimated $15 million more
is needed from various public and private organizations to prepare the
battleship as a tourist attraction. Bayonne and Camden supporters all agreed
that the museum, once open, will have operating costs of about $3 million per
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Naval Sea Systems Command, the Navy branch that runs the ship donation
program, kept its deliberations tightly private. Both proposals - Camden's was
estimated to reach 1,700 pages - were not available to the public.
</P>
<P>
	   Early Thursday afternoon, South Jersey congressmen lobbying on behalf of
Camden scheduled a 3:15 p.m. press conference at the Philadelphia shipyard,
knowing a decision was coming, believing it was in their favor, but not entirely
sure.

<HEADLINE> FCC Plan May Mean New FM Stations  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- By summer, hundreds of new low-power radios station could
crop up on the FM dial, giving voice to community groups, churches and even
novice disc jockeys.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Communications Commission adopted rules Thursday to support the
creation of at least 1,000 low-power stations to better serve the needs of local
communities. Officials said they envisioned a wide range of interests -- from
foreign languages to regional music -- getting representation on the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every day it seems we read about more and more consolidation in the
broadcast area,'' said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard, the driving force behind the
plan. ``What low-power FM radio will do is create an important new outlet.''
</P>
<P>
	   The commission hopes that by May it will begin awarding the noncommercial,
educational licenses to groups that want to operate 100-watt and 10-watt
stations -- far less than the 6,000 watts to 100,000 watts at which most FM
stations now operate.
</P>
<P>
	   The would give broadcasters between 4 miles and 7 miles of coverage area.
Also, they could set up shop for much lower costs because in many cases they can
mount their antennas atop a building rather than constructing a tower.
</P>
<P>
	   In the nation's largest radio markets -- New York, Chicago and Los Angeles
-- there will be no room for 100-watt stations, according to the FCC. Cities
like the District of Columbia could accommodate 3 100-watt stations, while Miami
has room for 4. Less dense parts of the country have room for dozens of
stations, according to the commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan, approved by a 4-1 vote, still could face a legal challenge from
the nation's commercial broadcasters. They say that adding hundreds of new
stations to the FM channel will mean more interference for existing stations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a sad day for radio listeners,'' declared Edward Fritts, president of
the National Association of Broadcasters. He said the group ``will review every
option to undo the damage caused by low-power radio.''
</P>
<P>
	   Several lawmakers, including Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House
Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, said they had the same
reservations. Even some FCC officials admitted they were uncertain about the
effects.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I must confess that I have no clear idea as to whether or not existing
broadcasters will suffer intolerable interference,'' said FCC Commissioner
Michael Powell, who voted for the overall plan but dissented from parts of it.
</P>
<P>
	   He also raised the possibility that new low-power stations would siphon away
listeners from existing small broadcasters, making it harder for those
commercial stations to get ad revenue to survive.
</P>
<P>
	   That could translate into ``lost opportunity for a minority or women to
share in the fruits of the broadcasting business,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposing the plan was Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth, who also
expressed concerns about possible interference with existing FM stations.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC rules place some requirements on applicants. To hold a license
during the first two years, groups must show that they are headquartered in or
have three-quarters of their members residing within 10 miles of the proposed
station.
</P>
<P>
	   No group can own more than one low-power station nationwide during the first
two years. The licenses will be valid for 8-year, renewable terms and must
broadcast at least 36 hours per week.
</P>
<P>
	   No existing broadcaster can have ownership or programming arrangements with
any low-power station.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission will decide cases where there are multiple applicants for one
license using a point system that favors those who have an established community
presence and pledge to air at least eight hours of local programming daily.
</P>
<P>
	   Pirate broadcasters, who had operated without a license, can apply only if
they stopped doing so within 24 hours after being reproached by the FCC.

much fury, but Thursday's snow and bitter cold were more than enough to leave
roads icy, causing scores of fender-benders and a few more serious accidents.
<P>
	   Parts of two major highways were closed by wrecks, the New Jersey Turnpike
lowered speed limits, and state police urged residents to stay off roads.
</P>
<P>
	   "Driving is extremely treacherous," said New Jersey State Police spokesman
John Hagerty. "Limit driving unless you absolutely have to be out on the
highways."
</P>
<P>
	   The National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory for the state,
predicting gusty winds, overnight wind chills as numbing as 20 degrees below
zero and 2 to 6 inches of snow, with the southern and eastern parts of the state
getting the most. It also warned that minor coastal flooding was possible during
Thursday evening's high tides as increasing winds pushed water onshore.
</P>
<P>
	   But by mid-afternoon, only a half-inch to 2 inches of snow had fallen on
northeastern New Jersey, and major roads remained clear in west and central New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the roads are that bad," said Cheryl McGuigan, 42, an
assistant mailroom supervisor for the state who lives in Trenton. "The sidewalks
are slippery," though, and she nearly fell while walking outside at lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Lois Vereen, 34, a state Pensions Department employee, said the morning bus
she takes to work from north Trenton was delayed about 30 minutes, but the
weather wasn't bothering her.
</P>
<P>
	   "I expected worse than this," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The turnpike cut its speed limit to 45 mph and banned motorcycles and
car-pulled trailers. NJ Transit spokesman Ken Miller, though, said its trains
and buses were running "fairly close to schedule."
</P>
<P>
	   Newark International Airport, as well as LaGuardia and Kennedy International
airports in New York, were reporting scattered 90-minute delays on flights and
some cancellations. Most of the trouble was caused by bad weather in other parts
of the country, including Washington, D.C., and Chicago, said Bill Cahill, a
spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Some businesses closed early, and at least 120 public schools were closed or
sent students home early. McGuire Air Force Base sent its approximately 1,000
civilian personnel, except those considered "weather essential," home at 2 p.m.
and gave commanders of the base's 5,000 active duty military personnel the
option to do the same.
</P>
<P>
	   The state government, though, didn't send its workers home early or open its
snow emergency center.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jan. 20 storm was the third-latest in central New Jersey with at least
1/10 inch of snow in the last 105 years, according to state climatologist Dave
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were 13 years when the first snowfall didn't come till January," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest snowfall recorded at New Brunswick was Jan. 31, 1921. Robinson
said the storm was far enough east that it would dump most of its snow onto the
ocean, and the storm could sap some of the energy from one expected Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to be another brutally cold day tomorrow," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   In Mercer County, huge stretches of the Delaware River glistened white
through a light fog as snow accumulated atop large sheets of ice.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't so pretty elsewhere, though.
</P>
<P>
	   Hagerty, the state police spokesman, said there were countless
"slip-and-slide accidents" on the state's major highways, including Routes 78,
80 and 278. Route 195 had more than 30 accidents during the morning rush hour
and on the stretch of Route 295 from Trenton to Bellmawr in Camden County, there
were about 40 morning wrecks.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Garden State Parkway in Lakewood, a tanker truck carrying fuel
overturned about 6 a.m., injuring the driver and spilling several hundred
gallons of fuel. An eight-mile stretch between exits 91 and 83 was closed into
the evening.
</P>
<P>
	   On the turnpike, a truck slid off the roadway in East Brunswick shortly
after 10 a.m., shutting down traffic in the southbound truck lanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, icy roads may have caused an incident on the Atlantic City
Expressway in Winslow Township. About 8 a.m., 12 cars on both the eastbound and
westbound sides lost control and ended up on the median and the westbound
shoulder, according to Peter Hartt, a spokesman for the South Jersey
Transportation Authority, which operates the 44-mile toll road.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wouldn't call it a pileup," he said. "I'd call it a scatter."
</P>
<P>
	   The island community of Brigantine had its only access road cut off for 2
1/2 hours Thursday after a weather-related fender-bender, police said. The
accident on the Brigantine Bridge - which links Brigantine with Atlantic City -
occurred about 12 noon and the span was closed until 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Department of Transportation crews hit major roads as early as 5 a.m.
Thursday, spreading salt and monitoring road conditions, according to department
spokesman Jim Berzok. Once snow began to accumulate, about 565 workers operating
463 pieces of equipment - mostly snowplows - began clearing roads.
</P>
<P>
	   Berzok said the biggest problems likely would come at night, when a dramatic
temperature drop was expected to add to icing on roadways. He said the
department probably would keep some road crews on into the evening, after the
anticipated end of the snowfall around 7 p.m., and some crews might continue
salting and sanding roads overnight.

<HEADLINE> University considering installing sprinklers after fatal fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Seton Hall University is considering "anything
and everything" to improve fire safety following a fatal dormitory fire,
including the installation of sprinklers at all dorms, a spokeswoman said
Thursday.
<P>
	   The school will consider "anything that we can all do to make sure that
something like this never, ever happens again," spokeswoman Lisa Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked if the university would look into installing sprinklers in
six-story Boland Hall, she said, "Absolutely."
</P>
<P>
	   Three students were killed and 62 injured, six critically, in Wednesday's
blaze in a third-floor lounge at Boland Hall. Only the six patients remained
hospitalized Thursday, four still in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Essex County Prosecutor Donald Campolo refuted a report Thursday in The
Star-Ledger of Newark that investigators had eliminated careless smoking and
electrical problems as possible causes.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are ruling out nothing at this juncture," Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also said that investigators were seeking three young men whom a
resident adviser had asked to leave the building less than an hour before the
fire broke out. Campolo declined to comment on the story.
</P>
<P>
	   Students at the nation's oldest Roman Catholic university continued to
question how well the university is prepared for fire, including its handling of
the chronic string of false alarms that have plagued Boland Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I first heard the alarm, I thought 'I'm not leaving,"' said Marissa
Lorenz, an 18-year-old Scotch Plains resident who was released from the hospital
on Thursday. "I mean, there are so many alarms."
</P>
<P>
	   Omar Soriano, a 1997 Seton Hall alumnus, said Thursday that 25 false fire
alarms rang in Boland during one semester in 1994, when he was a resident
adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighteen alarms have rung at Boland since September 1999. Grider said on
Thursday that in one of those cases, a fire was found in a Dumpster near the
dormitory. The others were false.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of people don't leave. They hide in closets, hide in bathrooms," said
university freshman Beth McCullough, 18, of Bloomsburg, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   McCullough and Nathan Umbriac, another freshman, said they have not had to
undergo fire drills at the Aquinas Hall dormitory and that they didn't recall
resident advisers preparing them for a fire or warning them against pulling
alarms as a prank.
</P>
<P>
	   "If that was our hall, I'm just wondering if everybody would have been
prepared," said Umbriac, 18, from Danville, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   Several students also said that sprinklers should be installed in all of
Seton Hall's six dormitories. Two of the dormitories, Boland Hall and Aquinas
Hall, don't have installed sprinkler systems because they were built before such
systems were required by law. The dormitories are the only two that house
freshmen.
</P>
<P>
	   A fire alarm rang Thursday morning at Xavier Hall, evacuating nearly 200
students from the upperclassmen dorm. Grider said she didn't know the cause of
the alarm.
</P>
<P>
	   "I got up real quick for this one," said Guerschom Nazaire, 20, a junior
from Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the university's 10,000 students left campus following the fire.
Only two spent the night in a recreation center where makeshift beds were
created, Grider said. Many stayed with upperclassmen or went home.
</P>
<P>
	   About 150 sought grief counseling, Grider said, and others spent the day
quietly talking to friends, staying in their dorms.
</P>
<P>
	   "It affects the whole campus," said Guerschom Nazaire, 20, a junior from
Jersey City. "The school is so small, so everybody feels a little more
connected."
</P>
<P>
	   The university also suspended its guest pass policy for all university
residences. The guest policy was toughened last semester for security reasons,
Grider said. She didn't elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   University officials were making plans for a memorial service on Monday for
the victims: Frank S. Caltabilota of West Long Branch, John N. Giunta of
Vineland and Aaron C. Karol of Green Brook. All were 18-year-old freshmen.

<HEADLINE> Pataki suggests higher license fees for barbers, cosmeticians  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Steve Starr pays more attention to his own budget
than he does Gov. George Pataki's executive budget. But this time, the Army
veteran and barber is going to be watching to see what kind of cutting state
legislators do.
<P>
	   An increase in examination and license renewal fees for barbers,
cosmetologists and nail specialists is among the proposed $28 million in fee
increases proposed in Pataki's executive budget for fiscal 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't like it at all," said Starr, who cuts hair at Siena Unisex Hair
Styles in Colonie, a suburb of the state capital. "But it's something we have to
do to keep our licenses. Sometimes you have to do things you don't like."
</P>
<P>
	   Barbers aren't the only ones who'll see their costs grow if Pataki's
proposals are adopted by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   Other fee increases include an average 20 percent increase in hunting and
fishing licenses, increases in license fees for real estate brokers and agents,
notary publics, as well as security guards and an extension on a fee for
fishermen who harvest clams and quahogs.
</P>
<P>
	   The cost of crime will also go up, with the fees charged to crooks doubling
in some case.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, fees make up roughly $800 million of Pataki's $77 billion budget
this time around, Pataki budget spokesman Kevin Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   In comparison, fees made up about $756 million in Pataki's $72.7 billion
spending plan last year. Fees went up $37.9 million during that budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Quinn points out that Pataki has been cutting taxes in all of his budgets,
including a proposed $2.3 billion in this year's proposed plan. He also said all
the fee increases will benefit the people who are paying them, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The increases for hunting and fishing licenses would go to the state's
Conservation Fund, which pays for about half of the state's fish and wildlife
programs. "Without this increase, the state would have to cut back on its
hunting and fishing programs," said Brian O'Connor, spokesman for the Department
of Environmental Conservation.
</P>
<P>
	   The increases for barbers, cosmetologists, security guards and real estate
brokers will go to improving the computers at the Department of State, which
will eventually allow online licensing for those professions, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved, new barbers, cosmetologists and nail specialists would see a
$10 increase in the examination fee to $25 from $15 and experienced ones would
see a $10 increase for licensing renewals to $30 from $20.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those fees haven't been increased in years, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Don't worry about the price of haircuts or a pedicure going up, though.
"It's only a one-time fee," Starr said. "It shouldn't affect the prices at all."
</P>
<P>
	   Other proposed increases include:
</P>
<P>
	   - Doubling the Crime Victim Assistance Fund fee charged to criminals to $10
from the previous $5. The mandatory crime surcharges also are going up: to $50
from $40 for criminal violations, to $110 from $85 for misdemeanors and to $200
from $150 for felonies. All those fees go to the Crime Victim Assistance Fund,
Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   - Extending the fee for fishermen who take clams and quahogs from New York
waters. The 15-cent-per-bushel clam surcharge and 10-cent-per-bushel quahog
surcharge was supposed to expire in January 2001 but the money is needed to fund
marine research, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
	   - A new fee on public water systems to fund monitoring and testing public
waters. Public water systems that have less than 1,000 connections will have to
pay $100 annually, while larger systems will have to pay $3 per connection.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will dramatically improve the quality of drinking water around the
state," said John Signor, spokesman for the state Health Department. "This will
help prevent a repeat of the tragic events that happened at the Washington
County fairgrounds."
</P>
<P>
	   State officials blamed water contaminated by cow manure at the annual fair
for the deaths of a child and an elderly man in September. About 1,000 people
were sickened with the E. coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers already are lining up to fight some of Pataki's proposed
increases, however. The Legislature will be holding hearings on Pataki's
executive budget for the next few weeks before taking up the budget later this
year. The next state fiscal year begins on April 1.
</P>
<P>
	   State Assembly Majority Leader Michael Bragman, who has opposed sportsman
fee increases, wants Pataki to wait until after an audit of the state
Conservation Fund is completed before asking for an increase in hunting and
fishing fees.
</P>
<P>
	   "Only this independent evaluation will provide the data the Legislature will
need to responsibly address fee increases," Bragman said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have maintained for more than a year ... the need for a resident fee
increase has not yet been demonstrated or justified."

<HEADLINE> Whitman seeks probe of auto emissions memos  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman Thursday directed the
Attorney General's Office to investigate why a state subcontractor's concerns
about the new auto emissions test system weren't brought to the state's
attention.
<P>
	   In memos written in the months preceding the mid-December startup of the
enhanced test, subcontractor Sierra Research of Pasadena, Calif., warned that
Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group's testing equipment was vulnerable
to freezing temperatures and that Parsons' workers were not adequately trained -
issues that later led to long lines and frayed nerves at New Jersey's inspection
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Disclosure of this information should have been automatic, not optional,"
the governor said at a hastily arranged news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want a panel to tell me what happened and why it happened. I don't care
where the investigation leads," she said. "I've heard nothing, seen nothing that
indicates anything criminal here."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman directed Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. to convene a special
panel, to include members of the public, to investigate Sierra's claims and why
they were not disclosed to state officials who awarded the testing bid to
Parsons.
</P>
<P>
	   Parsons' system has been in disarray since the state's private vendor
launched the enhanced safety and emissions test on Dec. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   The new test, which is aimed at meeting Clean Air Act mandates, is up to
five times longer than the old inspection process, and a series of computer
glitches, equipment problems and staffing woes conspired to force long lines and
hours-long waiting times at many of the state's 32 centralized inspection
stations. In some cases, cold weather forced equipment to fail.
</P>
<P>
	   The Whitman administration in 1998 signed Parsons to a seven-year, $400
million contract that drew controversy. Parsons was the only vendor to bid for
the job.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman has grown increasingly angry at Parsons, and state officials say
they intend to remove $580,000 from a scheduled Feb. 10 state payment to the
firm because the long waiting times violate the contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Parsons officials say the impostion of sanctions by the Whitman
administration is "premature," and that some of the long lines were actually
caused by late software changes ordered by the state.

<HEADLINE> Census 2000 Starts in Alaska Hamlet  </HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN CLARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNALAKLEET, Alaska (AP) -- The sun was barely up at 11 a.m. Thursday when
Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt, bundled up in a fur parka, mittens and
heavy boots, knocked on the door of a small wood-frame house in this western
Alaska village to begin the nationwide head count.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanton Katchatag, an 82-year-old Inupiaq Eskimo elder, welcomed Prewitt
into his home in this isolated, windswept village near the frozen Bering Sea and
became the first American to participate in Census 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen minutes later, the director came back out into temperatures just
above zero.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are very excited to have taken our first enumeration,'' Prewitt said
before getting on a snowmobile for a ride to another house.
</P>
<P>
	   Unalakleet, situated about 400 miles northwest of Anchorage, is accessible
only by plane or snowmobile this time of year. Most of its 800 residents are
Inupiaq or Yupik Eskimos.
</P>
<P>
	   While such an out-of-the-way place may seem an unlikely spot to begin the
head count, census officials said they need to reach Alaska Natives in winter,
before they leave their villages for spring fishing and hunting.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, travel is difficult in rural Alaska during the spring. Frozen
rivers that serve as highways for snowmobiles during winter are treacherous when
the ice melts.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Henry Ivanoff said he was pleased that Unalakleet -- and Katchatag --
had the distinction of being first in the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are 275 million people standing in line after him, including the
president and vice president of the United States -- even Michael Jordan!''
Ivanoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   The community put out a warm welcome for Prewitt and the census workers.
Native dancers and cheerleaders performed and community leaders made speeches
before residents sat down for dinner in the school gymnasium Wednesday night.
Tables were laden with home-cooked foods, including moose, caribou, muktuk and
smoked salmon.
</P>
<P>
	   While the mood was celebratory, community leaders were serious about the
importance of an accurate count.
</P>
<P>
	   Census data is used for reapportionment of congressional seats, drawing
legislative districts and school district boundaries and determining how much
state and federal funding a community will get.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will affect the funding we receive from the Indian Health Service,''
said Larry Ivanoff, president of the local tribal organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty census workers, some of them fluent in Yupik or Inupiaq, will go
door-to-door throughout Unalakleet to gather data over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
	   Prewitt said he hopes Unalakleet will set an example of participation for
the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   After Alaska, the Census Bureau will turn its attention to other rural areas
of the country -- from the bottom of the Grand Canyon to the Adirondacks --
where a lack of street names and numbers makes it impossible to deliver census
forms by mail.
</P>
<P>
	   About 100 million census forms will go in the mail for the rest of the
nation in mid-March. The agency expects to have most of the forms back by April
11. After that, census workers will hit the streets and try to track down those
who haven't sent their forms back.

<HEADLINE> 39-year-old murder defendant headed to juvenile court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Michael Skakel is a paunchy, middle-aged man with
thinning gray hair, but in the eyes of the law, he is still a scrawny
15-year-old boy.
<P>
	   The 39-year-old nephew of the late U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was arrested
this week in the 1975 slaying of Martha Moxley, a neighbor and childhood friend
in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
	   Because he was 15 at the time of the killing, he will be treated, at least
initially, just like any other juvenile. The court proceedings will be closed to
the press and public, and prosecutors will not be allowed to speak his name
publicly.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel is the oldest person ever to be treated as a juvenile in Connecticut
courts.
</P>
<P>
	   The image of the mature Skakel entering the Greenwich police station to
surrender Wednesday was a stark contrast to the schoolboy photographs that have
appeared in newspapers since Moxley was beaten to death with a golf club when
they were both 15. Skakel is the son of Rushton Skakel Sr., brother of Robert F.
Kennedy's widow, Ethel.
</P>
<P>
	   The notion of a man pushing 40 appearing in court next to pimply-faced
teen-agers has prompted some chuckling in Connecticut legal circles. But experts
in juvenile law say the case may create a legal morass that could make it
difficult for prosecutors to transfer the case to adult court.
</P>
<P>
	   Exactly what penalty Skakel could face depends on whether he is tried as a
juvenile or an adult.
</P>
<P>
	   Most legal experts say he will be subject to the laws in effect in 1975,
when the crime was committed.
</P>
<P>
	   Under 1975 law, he would face a maximum of four years if he were tried as a
juvenile, even for murder. If he were tried as an adult, he could get 25 years
to life.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1975, prosecutors were required to present evidence at a probable cause
hearing to convince a judge that the case could be transferred to adult court.
Under current law, murder cases are automatically transferred to adult court.
</P>
<P>
	   While some attorneys think it is highly unlikely that a judge would agree to
keep Skakel's case in juvenile court, others say the state may have a long road
ahead of it to get the case moved to adult court.
</P>
<P>
	   David Rosen, a senior research associate at Yale Law School, said there is
even a possibility - albeit a small one - that Skakel could be convicted and
walk away without any punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   "The juvenile court, under that 1975 law, did not have authority to send him
to an adult facility, therefore, he might not be subject to punishment decades
later for crimes committed as a child - no matter how terrible the crime," Rosen
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosen said there is also a question as to whether the adult courts can
punish him, even if the case is transferred there.
</P>
<P>
	   "The adult court doesn't have authority over him unless the juvenile court
is allowed to transfer him, but it's only allowed to transfer him, it seems to
me, if he's a child," Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reason we're going around in circles is that the law at that time was
designed for the protection and correction of children so that they would not
become criminals in their adult years," Rosen said. "It was designed for
rehabilitation, not punishment."
</P>
<P>
	   Hillary Bargar, a juvenile prosecutor in Bridgeport, said Skakels' lawyers
could keep the case in juvenile court for a year or more if they fight the
transfer to adult court.
</P>
<P>
	   "The situation of a 40-year-old was never anticipated by the law," she said.
"This could take a very long time to resolve."
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel's lead attorney, Michael Sherman, insists that he hasn't decided yet
whether he will fight to keep the case in juvenile court. But many lawyers said
it is unlikely that a judge would agree to keep the case in juvenile court,
given the high-profile nature of the case and the fact that Skakel is now 39
years old.
</P>
<P>
	   "Judges don't operate in a vacuum, and in this case there is tremendous
pressure to deal with it openly and in an open courtroom," said Hugh Keefe, a
New Haven defense attorney.

<HEADLINE> President Seeks $31B for Higher Ed  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed a $31 billion plan Thursday to
make college education more affordable and upbraided Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott for suggesting that no major legislation would be enacted this
election year.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the proposal was a $10,000 tax deduction to help millions
of Americans pay for tuition, books and university fees. ``When we make college
more affordable, we make the American dream more achievable,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining Clinton for the White House announcement, on the first day of the
last year of his presidency, were Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the
Senate from New York, and a fellow New York Democrat, Sen. Charles Schumer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some in Congress, I note, are saying that because this is an election year
we really shouldn't try to do anything for the American people,'' Clinton said.
``Nothing, not a national election or a Washington snowstorm, should get in the
way of making a college education more affordable for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president was referring to a comment Lott, R-Miss., made to reporters a
day earlier. Lott said ``everyone needs to acknowledge ... there won't be a lot
of time for big, new initiatives'' on a shortened congressional calendar this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Skeptics question whether the policy proposals Clinton has made before his
State of the Union address Jan. 27 can pass the Republican-controlled Congress.
But White House officials, seeking to address those concerns, seized on Lott's
statement and insisted voters want action on education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Members of Congress who have been in their districts understand that
education is the top priority for most Americans,'' White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart said. ``I think there will be a political cost for those who want
to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
	   When Clinton's ``College Opportunity Tax Cut'' is fully phased in in 2003, a
family earning $120,000 or less annually could receive a tax deduction of up to
$10,000 for tuition, fees and job-related training. Alternatively, taxpayers
could seek a maximum credit of $2,800 a year. A similar proposal sponsored by
Schumer died in Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton noted that average college tuition has doubled over the past 20
years, outpacing median incomes. ``This touches Americans in all incomes and
from all walks of life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   While the White House accused Republicans of threatening to put politics
ahead of progress, officials played down the political benefits of the event to
Mrs. Clinton's campaign and noted that she long has advocated education
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's proposal included $35 million for the college Completion
Challenge grants, designed to spur college dropouts to return to class; $40
million for a new initiative to help minorities pursue five-year dual-degree
programs in fields where they are underrepresented; and $716 million for Pell
grants.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also will seek a combined $400 million increase for initiatives such
as the Gear Up program, which helps disadvantaged youths stay in high school;
TRIO, which helps them stay in college; and Job Corps, a national education and
job training program targeted at impoverished youths.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is trying to appeal to middle-class suburban voters in the New
York Senate race. Polls show her trailing New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
in the politically crucial suburbs.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer noted that making college tuition tax deductible was a key campaign
pledge in his successful bid to oust Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998.
His proposal was narrowly defeated as an amendment to the tax cut package last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Since it is necessary for our children to attend college, it is wrong for
them to graduate with a mountain of debt,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 130.06; New Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell steeply today amid worries that
rising interest rates will ultimately cut into corporate earnings, while signs
of strong growth from leading technology companies boosted the Nasdaq further
into record territory.
</P>
<P>
	   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
138.06 to close at 11,351.30. The blue-chip index pitched wildly today, rising
as much as 68 points in early trading and plunging as much as 214 at midday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index rose, extending the record high reached just
Wednesday. Broader stock indicators were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose at the opening bell after IBM, which sent a chill through the
technology sector last fall when it said sales had slumped due to worries about
the Year 2000 computer bug, easily beat Wall Street's profit forecasts.
</P>
<P>
	   While company officials warned that lingering concerns will continue to take
a toll on sales in the current quarter, they encouraged analysts to leave their
profit forecasts for 2000 intact. IBM stock rose today.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcoa dropped as the company announced plans to restart primary aluminum
production to meet growing global demand. The announcement sparked fears that
aluminum prices will drop, hurting Alcoa's bottom line. A steady rise in
aluminum prices last year helped Alcoa turn in the highest returns of any Dow
component stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer products companies also fared poorly today. Procter &AMP; Gamble and 3M
fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said lingering worries that the Federal Reserve will raise interest
rates this year are affecting blue-chip stocks much more sharply than
high-flying technology companies. Higher rates can cut into corporate profits by
making it more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors seem to feel that as long as the technology companies are
projected to grow 40 or 50 percent per year, who cares about interest rates?"
said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa
Barbara, Calif. "More mature companies can't possibly grow at that rate."
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, investors rewarded several technology leaders for their strong
growth today.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Apple Computer soared. Apple said late Wednesday it earned
$183 million, or $1.03 a share, in its most recent quarter. Strong sales of its
iMac computer helped Apple coast past published estimates of 90 cents per share
and past the "whisper number" of 97 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   "The earnings reports bolstered the positive outlook about technology and
its prospects for growth," said Paul Cherney, market analyst at Standard &AMP;
Poor's.
</P>
<P>
	   Engage Technologies rose sharply after buying two online advertising
businesses from its parent company, CMGI Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Not every technology leader was rewarded for strong profits. America Online,
which has seen its stock price tumble since the company announced its intentions
to merge with Time Warner, fell slightly. AOL said late Wednesday it earned $224
million, or 9 cents a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, more than double the
$86 million, or 4 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts had expected AOL to earn 8 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was fairly volatile a day ahead of Friday's "double witching"
session, when quarterly stock and index options expire, forcing traders to
adjust their portfolios. These quarterly deadlines tend to increase volume and
volatility.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose to a new record. The index,
which lagged through much of 1999, has surged so far this year and has set new
closing records in four consecutive sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're getting some measurable outperformance from the small companies,"
Cherney said. "Investors appear unwilling to put all their eggs in one basket,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Discusses Spiritual Anchor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sharing a rare insight into how he has dealt with the
emotional fallout of the impeachment scandal, President Clinton said he has
sought a ``spiritual anchor'' and to forgive those he feels had wronged him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I have gained more than anything else is a certain humility in
recognizing how important forgiveness is, but how it doesn't count and it can't
count unless you can give it as well as ask for it,'' the president said in an
interview with the Christian Science Monitor.
</P>
<P>
	   In the interview, which was conducted on Tuesday in Boston but released by
the White House on Thursday, Clinton was asked about his own ``spiritual
growth'' over the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
	   While he never mentioned the impeachment directly, he has said he was
seeking spiritual counseling following the revelations about his relationship
with former intern Monica Lewinksy and the ensuing impeachment fight.
</P>
<P>
	   The president indicated that one of his personal challenges has been
abandoning resentment over the investigation into the matter. Clinton was
impeached by the House, but the Senate declined to vote him out of office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The thing that I have really had to work on is trying to gain some
spiritual anchor that will enable me to give up resentments and disappointment
and anger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton remarked that he had sought advice from former South African
President Nelson Mandela about how Mandela had learned to forgive those who had
jailed him under his country's system of Apartheid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've really tried to deal with this in a very serious way and I think I've
learned quite a lot about myself in the process,'' Clinton said. ``And it's an
ongoing effort.''

<HEADLINE> Former NJ sporting head, Whitman fundraiser acquitted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A judge Thursday threw out charges against Michael
Francis, ending a trial in which the former head of the New Jersey Sports and
Exposition Authority and Gov. Christie Whitman's ex-chief fundraiser was charged
with trying to force an Atlantic City mall to hire his cleaning company.
<P>
	   Judge Andrew J. Smithson, who earlier dismissed eight criminal counts
against Francis, tossed out the remaining two that were before the Mercer County
jury. Two other charges that were not part of the trial remain lodged against
Francis.
</P>
<P>
	   State prosecutors alleged Francis, Whitman's top money man for her
successful 1993 gubernatorial campaign, threatened the Ocean One Mall with labor
unrest if it did not award his Planned Building Services with a $500,000
cleaning contract.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense responded that there was no evidence that Francis did anything
other than promote his company. His statements that there would be no labor
problems were meant to reassure the mall owners, not threaten or pressure them,
the defense said.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge took the unusual step of stopping the trial before the jury could
consider the charges
</P>
<P>
	   "I truly do not find in this case a scintilla of evidence for the jury to
consider," the judge said. "There's certainly smoke in this case, but I didn't
find any fire. I don't even find a spark."
</P>
<P>
	   "Frankly, I did not want to put Michael Francis through the agony of having
to wait for the jury to reach a verdict," the judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. said prosecutors were
considering their options, including whether to pursue the remaining two charges
against Francis.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are disappointed that the judge did not permit the case to go to the
jury," said spokesman Chuck Davis. "We'll review the judge's decision and how it
relates to those two charges and then make a decision."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman, noting the charges that remain against her former fundraiser,
declined comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis could not be reached for comment. But his defense attorney Michael
Chertoff said his client is "elated" at the judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Chertoff, a former U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, said it is highly unusual
for a judge to halt a trial midstream.
</P>
<P>
	   "It suggests the state's case as presented was far short," he said. "The
judge vindicating Michael ... totally undercuts the original charge."
</P>
<P>
	   Based on Smithson's ruling, the state ought to give up prosecuting Francis
on the remaining charges, Chertoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis faced charges of attempted theft by extortion and misusing his
corporate powers relating to an effort to win the cleaning contract. Prosecutors
say his assurances that there would be no labor union problems if his company
got the contract were a veiled threat to mall owners.
</P>
<P>
	   He was initially charged in 1997 with orchestrating a conspiracy to conceal
alleged ties to organized crime from Whitman, and using his unpaid state post to
drum up millions of dollars' worth of business for his company. But those
charges were dismissed.

<HEADLINE> Poll finds New Yorkers in favor of teacher scholarships  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New Yorkers overwhelmingly favor tuition breaks for
prospective teachers who agree to teach in poor urban school districts,
according to a poll released Thursday.
<P>
	   Touted as a centerpiece of Gov. George Pataki's 2000-01 budget proposal,
"Teachers of Tomorrow" would allocate $25 million for loan forgiveness over the
next 10 years. The governor hopes the program will boost the state's teaching
ranks by 50,000 classroom instructors.
</P>
<P>
	   With few other details about the plan have been made public, 72 percent of
New York voters polled last week by Quinnipiac College called the concept a
"good idea."
</P>
<P>
	   Seventy-seven percent of the New York City residents surveyed said they
favored the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   The polling institute queried 812 New Yorkers throughout the state in a poll
with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Poorly performing schools tend to be in low-income, heavily minority
districts that are plagued by social problems and can't afford to pay teachers
very well, according to education officials.
</P>
<P>
	   They're a hard sell for young teachers who can boost their salary by $10,000
or more in a suburban district where perquisites include everything from bright,
modern buildings to not having to pay street people to guard their cars.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes people say they're coming and then accept a better offer," said
Daniel Lowengard, superintendent of the Utica City School District, which has
had to recruit 150 new teachers in the past three years alone.
</P>
<P>
	   Lowengard would like to see extra added incentives for minority candidates,
as his student body is 30 percent nonwhite. He would also like to see a
substantial "payback" period.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the key element, if you got four years you should have a four-year
obligation" on the part of teachers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Assembly Education Committee Chairman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan
Democrat, said the details of the governor's program were sketchy.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's some sort of loan forgiveness program, that is pretty much all we
know," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Quinn, spokesman for the state Division of Budget, said that many of
the details were still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
	   In general, he said, the program would work as retroactive grants paid by
school districts as part of a new teacher's compensation package. Since the
maximum a district could pay would be $3,400 a year, a new teacher would need to
stay at a school for four years to realize full benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The $3,400 figure coincides with current tuition levels at State University
of New York schools. The governor said teachers who attended private colleges
should get the same level of benefit under the program, even if their tuition
was higher.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear whether students who did not take out tuition loans would be
eligible for the program.
</P>
<P>
	   The need to replace schools' graying work force is a national one and has
spurred a host of incentive ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Education Association estimates 2.4 million new teachers will
be needed nationwide over the next 11 years due to retirement, attrition and
rising student enrollment.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond Colucciello, superintendent of Schenectady's school district, said
his district would appreciate any statewide recruitment efforts. At least 113 of
the approximately 700 teachers in his district are eligible for retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can see that we have to start producing and encouraging young people
who are bright and able and anything we could do would help," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even a three-year commitment would help the problem, Colucciello said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you can keep somebody three years, they've made some kind of commitment.
They've got tenure. The feeling is 'I know the kids, they know me.' That's when
you start to get in the groove."

<HEADLINE> McCain: Democracy's stronger in Russia than New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Still fuming over a state GOP effort to remove his name
from New York's presidential primary ballots, Sen. John McCain accused party
leaders Thursday of making New York less democratic than Russia.
<P>
	   McCain, who has chosen not to compete in Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses
on Monday, rode his campaign bus down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan while fellow
presidential hopefuls worked crowds in Des Moines and Ottumwa, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona Republican pressed his fight to appear on ballots in New York's
March 7 primary, telling reporters outside the Russian consulate that voters in
Moscow and St. Petersburg would have a wider choice at the polls in March than
those in the Bronx and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   "In Russia, there will be more than one name on the ballot" in the March 26
presidential election, McCain said. "In New York, unless something happens,
there will be only one name on the ballot. It seems to me that history has been
turned on its head."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, both George W. Bush and Steve Forbes have secured places on the New
York ballot, although others are skipping the state altogether because of what
some say are New York's excessively stringent requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican leaders have challenged McCain's petitions in 17 of New
York's 31 congressional districts, claiming he failed to obtain the required
number of signatures from party members. McCain is suing to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   He has hopped up and down the East Coast this week, raising campaign cash
from New York to Boston. He was scheduled to attend a closed fund-raiser
Thursday night at the Greenwich, Conn., home of HBO president John Billock.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Thursday, he talked campaign finance reform before a crowd of 900 at
the South Shore Chamber of Commerce in Randolph, Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   "The special interests have taken over: the trial lawyers, the labor union
bosses, the big corporations," said McCain, one of the Senate's most vehement
advocates of campaign finance reform. "This system is awash in big money that
deprives every one of you of your voice in Washington."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain accused President Clinton and Vice President Gore of accepting money
from foreign donors in violation of federal election laws and for "renting out"
the Lincoln bedroom of the White House to generous contributors.
</P>
<P>
	   He also had harsh words for fellow Republicans who have accepted
contributions from big tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said after his New York news conference that his attacks on politics
as usual are the reason party leaders oppose him in New York and around the
country. Republican leaders have lined up behind front-runner Bush in state
after state.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anybody who wants the status quo in Washington doesn't want me," McCain
said. "The establishment is threatened by my candidacy and I understand that,
and I respect them all."
</P>
<P>
	   He agreed on one point with Bush, who said Thursday that their campaigns'
public sniping over McCain's tax plan wouldn't weaken the two men's friendship.
</P>
<P>
	   "Of course we are friends," McCain said. "He's a fine man and you're not
going to hear anything negative from me about him. He's a very good man."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush says a provision in McCain's tax plan would raise taxes on workers by
$40 billion. McCain's advisers say the number is actually $3.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall the senator proposes cutting taxes by $237 billion over five years
and has criticized Bush's $483 billion tax cut, saying it ignores Social
Security, Medicare and the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   While competitors feverishly wooed Iowans, McCain had his sights set on New
Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary. And he says he's enjoying himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's 12 days, four hours and 37 minutes before the polls close in New
Hampshire," he joked. "But who's counting?"

<HEADLINE> House Democrats set agenda for legislative session  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - House Democrats say this year's legislative
session will include an effort to bail out the cash-strapped University of
Connecticut Health Center.
<P>
	   Education, job training and open space issues also will be priorities for
the 12-week session that begins Feb. 9. It will be the shortest session in the
history of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are very focused, we are very targeted and we are very realistic about
what could be accomplished during this session," House Speaker Moira Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
	   The UConn Health Center in Farmington - which includes the John Dempsey
Hospital and the university's medical and dental schools - poses an immediate
problem, Lyons said. Health center officials say they're facing a $21 million
deficit, and need $12 million from the state to keep the facility running.
</P>
<P>
	   Lyons and House Majority Leader David Pudlin said they want to keep Dempsey
open so the medical and dental schools and research programs don't risk losing
grants they receive by being associated with a hospital. But neither would say
exactly how much they're willing to give UConn.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are asking for an opportunity to maintain, as long as necessary, the
status quo while we have time to study what's wrong," said Pudlin, D-Hartford.
"That's not to say it's a blank check. That that is not to say that it's an
ongoing commitment or that it's not going to be without substantial oversight."
</P>
<P>
	   The state has made $8 million in loans available for other state hospitals,
and plans to conduct a $1 million study of distressed hospitals this session,
lawmakers said. A list of which hospitals will receive the loans is expected in
about a month.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democrats, who control the General Assembly, said they also want to
change the way school districts are funded so that aid no longer is capped.
Other education bills would fund more computers for schools and train more
teachers how to use them in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Expanding the state's HUSKY health-care plan is also on the House Democrats'
agenda. The program was originally set up to provide free health care to
uninsured children, and the House leaders want parents to be covered as well.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawmakers also promised to focus on cleaning up some of the state's
worst polluting power plants.
</P>
<P>
	   Lyons said that while the state is in good financial shape, now is the time
to invest at least $15 million in open space preservation.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we do not take (open spaces) into the public purview and protect them at
this time, they may be lost forever," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Department of Environmental Protection received 2,900 acres of
land in 1999, and Republican Gov. John G. Rowland said he wants to preserve
673,000 acres of land as open space by 2023.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Democrats and Rowland don't see eye to eye when it comes to cutting
the state's gasoline tax. Rowland has been working with his budget staff and the
state Department of Transportation to determine what it would cost to reduce the
32 cents-a-gallon tax - the highest gas tax in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Lyons and Pudlin said such a cut is out of the question this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "We spend the money we get from the gas tax on the infrastructure of
highways and roads around the state," Pudlin said. "To deprive us of that money
I'm not sure is such a good idea."
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic leaders will be coming out with another agenda within two
weeks that outlines their plans for reforming campaign financing and the
sheriffs system.
</P>
<P>
	   House Minority Leader Robert Ward, R-Northford, said the Democrats' session
agenda was "one of the weakest I've seen."
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no mention of taxpayers," he said. "It's just repackaging things
we've already done. There's nothing new there."

<HEADLINE> Bradley takes credit for inevitable health reform  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Bill Bradley told senior citizens Thursday
that reform of the nation's health care system is now inevitable because his
campaign took "the risk of leadership" and put the issue on the political
agenda.
<P>
	   Bradley criticized rival Al Gore and claimed credit for a political
turnaround since President Clinton tried and failed to overhaul health care at
the start of his term.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll tell you something, when I laid out my program this was not an issue
in the political arena," said Bradley. "It was thought to be impossible to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley and Gore have made health care a central theme in their fight for
the Democratic presidential nomination, with both offering big-ticket plans to
expand coverage. Bradley's is bigger; Gore accuses him of frittering away the
budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   The two rivals were opening their final Iowa pushes on Thursday before
Monday's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   In West Des Moines, Bradley defended his plan before about 150 people at a
forum sponsored by AARP, itself a major player in the health care debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Beulah Anderson questioned Bradley closely on whether he could push any of
his plans through a Congress that hasn't acted up to now. Bradley took credit
for shifting the political climate to make that possible.
</P>
<P>
	   "In terms of health, I think there has never been a better opportunity," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said his health care proposal was the first major plan offered, and
it launched the debate.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's what leadership is," said Bradley. "There have been five or six
other major proposals now of how other people might do national health
insurance. Al Gore isn't one of them. He wouldn't do national health insurance."
</P>
<P>
	   The political debate has now moved beyond whether the system should be
reformed to how to go about that, Bradley argued.
</P>
<P>
	   "You look out at this health system and I don't see anyone saying 'let's
make no change,"' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior citizens make up one of the most important demographic groups in
Monday's precinct caucuses that launch the nominating season. Iowa's population
is the nation's third-oldest, and studies have shown the elderly vote in greater
proportion than other age groups.
</P>
<P>
	   While polls show many favor health reforms, there's some skepticism it can
happen, with many pointing to the political furor Clinton's effort sparked.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's a much better opportunity now than in 1993 when Bill Clinton
tried to do it and failed," said Bradley. He said the number of uninsured has
grown since that time, as has cost and there is also increasing restiveness in
the medical community.
</P>
<P>
	   All that's combined to shift the political debate, he argued.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been out there for about six months talking about it, laying it out,
taking the risk of leadership, laying out something specific knowing people were
going to criticize this number or that number," said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   He had mixed success Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Anderson said she was won over though "I still have concerns about
Congress."
</P>
<P>
	   Joyce Brown said she was sticking with Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't hear anything to make me change my mind," Ms. Brown said. "I'm
glad Bradley's there offering competition because it's made Gore sharper.
Besides, Iowans like a good fight."

<HEADLINE> Gov't Urges Use of Polio Shots  </HEADLINE>
   By JUSTIN BACHMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- The government Thursday endorsed polio shots for children
instead of the oral vaccine because of the very small chance that the oral dose
can lead to a polio infection.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention followed the advice
of an advisory panel that decided last summer the benefits of the oral polio
vaccine no longer outweigh the risks.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency publishes its recommended immunization schedule each January as a
guide for state and local health departments and pediatricians.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's guide also added a recommendation that children get a hepatitis
A vaccine in Western states with historically high rates of the virus: Alaska,
Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota,
Utah and Washington. Hepatitis A is a relatively mild form of the virus; most
patients require no medical care.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC also removed a diarrhea vaccine because it can cause bowel
obstruction.
</P>
<P>
	   The oral polio vaccine, developed by Dr. Albert Sabin, has been used for
nearly four decades and played a major role in the elimination of polio. But
because it is made with a live virus, it causes about eight people in the United
States each year to become infected with polio.
</P>
<P>
	   The injectable vaccine developed by the medical pioneer Dr. Jonas Salk in
the 1950s relies on a killed virus. Salk had long insisted his vaccine was
safer, but other scientists said it was not as effective at providing lifelong
immunity.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the new CDC recommendations, the oral vaccine should be used
only in cases of widespread outbreaks, for children traveling to areas where
polio is endemic or epidemic and for children whose parents stop short of
pursuing all four shots in the polio regimen.
</P>
<P>
	   The oral vaccine's U.S. manufacturer, Wyeth-Lederle, stopped making it last
year and has agreed to refund any unused supplies doctors return.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Academy of Pediatrics said last month its members can continue
using their remaining supplies of the oral vaccine if given as the third and
fourth doses. The first and second doses should be the injectable vaccine, the
academy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Melinda Wharton, the CDC's chief of childhood vaccines and preventable
diseases, said the agency is investigating one report from 1998 of a child that
got polio after being given the half-oral, half-injectable schedule. She said
the case had not been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Michael Gerber, a pediatrician in Bethesda, Md., and member of the
pediatrics academy's infectious diseases committee, said any such risk is
miniscule.
</P>
<P>
	   But to Informed Parents Against VAAP, a group of parents whose children
contracted vaccine-associated paralytic polio, even a miniscule chance of
infection is too much.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While the risk is small, why should we have any cases?'' said John
Salamone, a member of the group whose 9-year-old son contracted polio from the
oral vaccine in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Navy chooses Camden over Bayonne as permanent home of USS New  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The hulking battleship USS New Jersey, a decorated
veteran of four wars, will spend its retirement just across the Delaware River
from the shipyard where it was built under the dark cloud of World War II.
<P>
	   Navy Secretary Richard Danzig notified members of Congress Thursday that he
has approved a plan to turn the ship into a floating museum off Camden, N.J.,
near the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.
</P>
<P>
	   In choosing Camden, the Navy rejected the advice of a New Jersey state
commission that recommended the ship be placed off Bayonne in northern New
Jersey, across the harbor from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Launched in 1942, the battleship New Jersey employed its immense guns in
Korea, Vietnam and off the coast of Lebanon in 1983. It is one of only four
battleships left in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Bayonne and Camden both advanced detailed arguments about why they would
they would be the best place for a floating museum.
</P>
<P>
	   Bayonne boosters cited the city's proximity to New York and other population
centers of northern New Jersey. The case for Camden included the ship's ties to
the Philadelphia shipyard and the idea that the Delaware River's freshwater
would be kinder to the ship's massive hull.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will be a great thing for the area, a great thing for the area's
veterans and a great thing for Camden," said Rep. Jim Saxton, R-Mount Holly, who
helped lead the Camden campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Saxton and Rep. Rob Andrews, D-Haddon Heights, said Camden proved the more
economically viable location in part because another floating military museum,
the aircraft carrier USS Intrepid, already exists across New York Harbor from
Bayonne.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't make sense to put two Wal-Marts within a mile and a half of each
other," Andrews said. "The (USS) New Jersey would be competition for the
Intrepid, and vice versa, and it didn't make any sense."
</P>
<P>
	   State Assemblyman Joe Azzolina, chairman of the state battleship commission,
promised to implement the Navy's decision even though it went against his
long-held belief that the ship should go to the former Military Ocean Terminal
in Bayonne.
</P>
<P>
	   "Congratulations to Camden!" he wrote in pen on the bottom of a press
release.
</P>
<P>
	   The battleship currently sits at the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, now
officially called the Philadelphia Naval Business Center. It was towed there
from Bremerton, Wash., last year on a 5,800-mile trip that included its 10th -
and final - passage through the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle for the battleship opened a long-standing political rift pitting
North Jersey against South Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight northern New Jersey congressman advocated Bayonne, while three
southern New Jersey congressman endorsed Camden.
</P>
<P>
	   South Jersey advocates also secured endorsements from congressmen
representing parts of Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland, as well as members of
New York's delegation, who worried that a battleship museum in North Jersey
would compete for tourist dollars with the Intrepid, docked off Manhattan's West
Side.
</P>
<P>
	   Also weighing in for Camden was Andrew Cuomo, secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, who said a floating battleship museum would support federal efforts
to make the city an economic empowerment zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Closely divided, New Jersey's battleship commission voted in 1998 to berth
the warship in Bayonne. But several members supporting Bayonne did so with the
caveat that the ship should move to Liberty State Park in Jersey City if it is
ever renovated to accommodate such a huge vessel.
</P>
<P>
	   Jersey City officials subsequently agreed not to compete with Bayonne before
the Navy's ship-donation program. But Camden did file its own application.
</P>
<P>
	   Economics, not just pride, was at issue. Bayonne and Camden are both aging
cities that would welcome the boost of tourism dollars. Also, since the federal
government cannot subsidize a donated warship, a failed museum in either
location could force taxpayers to cover its expense.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman originally said she would abide by the advice of the
commission. But then she proclaimed herself neutral, pledging $6 million in
state money to restore the ship to museum readiness, wherever it ended up.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday Whitman said her administration is committed to help prepare the
ship for the public's enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think she's going to do just fine in Camden," Whitman said. "She would
have done well in Bayonne; she'll do just fine in Camden."

<HEADLINE> Cause of 'Stunned' Hearts Found  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- They call it a "stunned" heart.
</P>
<P>
	   Just about everyone who undergoes open-heart surgery, even if the surgery
went great, is at risk for sudden heart failure in the hours after the operation
-- and there is little doctors can do to help.
</P>
<P>
	   Now scientists have discovered that a small molecular glitch leaves some
hearts unable to squeeze out a proper beat, a finding that could help develop
medicines to get patients out of intensive care faster or even prevent this
so-called "cardiac stunning."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a problem that's seen on a daily basis in every major medical
center," said Dr. Eduardo Marban of Johns Hopkins University, a co-author of the
study published in Friday's edition of the journal Science. "It would be nice to
have something else ... to do other than wring our hands and hope for the best."
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps more importantly, the discovery "adds an awful lot to our
understanding ... of how heart muscle contracts and doesn't contract,"
information that could help other heart ailments as well, said Dr. Lynn Smaha,
president of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
	   About 760,000 Americans underwent open-heart surgery in 1997, the
association says, citing the most recent figure available.
</P>
<P>
	   Cardiac stunning is the name for a temporary type of heart failure, where
the heart cannot beat forcefully enough. It's unpredictable. Some patients have
a mild case, eased by drugs that help strengthen heartbeat. More severe patients
require days of expensive care, even winding up on life support. Some die.
</P>
<P>
	   But here's the intriguing part: Unlike with other forms of heart failure, if
patients can just hang on long enough, a "stunned" heart can actually repair
itself and recover in a few days.
</P>
<P>
	   Using genetically engineered mice and minuscule catheters designed to
examine rodent hearts, researchers at Hopkins and Queen's University in Ontario
have discovered why.
</P>
<P>
	   It turns out that a protein called troponin-I, or TnI, is vital for making
the heart contract. If even a little bit of the TnI inside the heart gets
damaged, those contractions weaken, said lead researcher Dr. Anne Murphy, a
Hopkins pediatric cardiologist who has watched children develop this heart
failure after successful surgery to repair heart defects.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers genetically engineered mice whose hearts harbored defective
TnI. The mice developed enlarged hearts that struggled to beat -- they looked
just like "stunned" human hearts.
</P>
<P>
	   But what damages TnI in the first place?
</P>
<P>
	   Heart cells temporarily deprived of oxygen, such as when patients are put on
a heart-lung machine during surgery, experience a sudden calcium overload. High
calcium levels produce enzymes that break up proteins -- in this case, nipping
the ends off the TnI proteins that help a heart beat, Murphy explained.
</P>
<P>
	   Any loss of oxygen to the heart can cause TnI damage, but in many people in
can be imperceptible, which explains why not everyone has heart failure after
surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Heart cells regenerate every few days. So if patients experiencing
post-surgery stunning can just survive long enough, cells containing damaged TnI
will die off and be replaced by healthy cells, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   But not everyone survives, and patients with severe cases can spend some
frightening days in intensive care. So armed with the new research, Marban and
Murphy are hunting ways to prevent stunning in people about to undergo heart
surgery. First in line for study are some experimental drugs that might inhibit
those enzymes that damage TnI.
</P>
<P>
	   But the research may affect thousands more patients than surgery candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we're seeing with stunned myocardium I believe is the tip of the
iceberg," Marban said, describing how stunning may play a role in "a broad
variety of cardiac diseases."
</P>
<P>
	   Take the 400,000 Americans diagnosed each year with congestive heart
failure, a chronic, progressive heart weakening. Canadian researchers have found
damaged TnI in the hearts of animals with this form of heart failure. Marban's
theory is that chronic heart failure occurs after repeated small cutoffs of the
blood supply over time -- essentially mini-episodes of stunning.
</P>
<P>
	   If that's the case, and "if you could reverse the stunned portion, you might
have another treatment for heart failure," agreed the AHA's Smaha. "There are a
wide variety of potential applications."

<HEADLINE> FCC Proposes Minority, Women Rules  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators adopted measures Thursday to ensure
broadcasters and cable companies are reaching out to minorities and women to
fill job vacancies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Communications Commission rules require that cable, radio or
television companies institute programs to widely disseminate information about
their job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission offered guidelines for broadcasters and cable companies to
follow to comply with the order. They include sending out job vacancy
announcements to recruitment organizations that request them and using job
fairs, internship programs and scholarships to reach a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Broadcasters or cable operators who want more flexibility can design their
own programs, but they must track the race and gender of their applicants to
monitor the effectiveness of these efforts, the commission decided.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Outreach efforts should be effective, not symbolic,'' said FCC
Commissioner Susan Ness. She encouraged companies to use creative approaches
such as Internet-based job banks to spread the word about opportunities.
</P>
<P>
	   The rules allow religious broadcasters to use religious affiliation as a job
qualification for all station employees.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission was careful to craft rules that would further the goals of
diversity, while not running afoul of a 1998 court decision that overturned the
agency's equal employment opportunity requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   To satisfy the court's decision, the FCC dropped pieces of it old rules --
namely a requirement that stations and local cable systems review whether their
work force reflects the racial composition of the markets they serve. The court
determined that this pressured stations into hiring minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials stressed that the new FCC measures do not require companies to
hire particular applicants.
</P>
<P>
	   The rules do require broadcasters and cable companies to place information
about their outreach efforts in their public file. They must also file annual
employment reports, which would contain more detailed information about
employees. But the commission insisted that it would use the reports only to
monitor industry trends, not to review the background of candidates hired by the
company.
</P>
<P>
	   But Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth, who dissented in the 4-1 vote, said
the new regulations trigger some of the same concerns as the ones scuttled by
the court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The commission's continued insistence on requiring broadcasters to
classify applicants and employees based on their race and gender, factors that
should be irrelevant to a person's job qualifications, is legally troublesome,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Minority Media &AMP; Telecommunications Council, an activist group that
defended the previous equal employment opportunity rules in court, applauded the
FCC's action.
</P>
<P>
	   Kim Gandy, executive president of the National Organization for Women, said
while the rules are an important step, they ultimately leave it up to
broadcasters to determine how they go about doing their outreach.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association of Broadcasters said it was reviewing the rules.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're hopeful that this does not add to an already considerable paperwork
burden on broadcasters,'' said spokesman Dennis Wharton.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut braces for a less-than-wicked winter- so far  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A green December and a sunny start to the new
year has some New Englanders shuddering at the late arrival of snow and subzero
temperatures.
<P>
	   "I think that people have all kinds of anxieties and the weather is a real
handy one," said Sarah Gamble, a South Windsor psychotherapist.
</P>
<P>
	   A forecast for flurries should be no shock in mid-January, but such
predictions are sending shivers down Connecticut's spine.
</P>
<P>
	   "Other states like Alaska where they get a lot of snow could laugh at us,"
said Gamble. "People in Connecticut are used to their lives being on a schedule
and being in control and this is real threat to that. I guess if we were good
Yankees, we'd all be stoic about this."
</P>
<P>
	   So far, it's been a weak winter, with snow waiting until last week to fall,
but that isn't stalling sales of snow supplies, school cancellations and overall
weather woes.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a dry winter in terms of storms and a mild winter in terms of
temperatures," said Xiusheng Yang, an associate professor of meteorology at the
University of Connecticut. "We had about 300 days without snow. That's actually
a record for Connecticut."
</P>
<P>
	   As of late Thursday afternoon, 1 3/4 inches of snow had fallen in Waterbury;
about 1 1/4 inches in Milford, New Milford, North Canaan and Danbury; and less
than an inch had accumulated in most parts of the state, said Bill Simpson, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
	   During an average year, Connecticut would get about 4 inches of snow per
week beginning in December and about 4 inches of rain per month, said Yang, the
acting state climatologist. This year, the first snow did not arrive until the
second week of January and there was only about 2 1/2 inches of rain in
December.
</P>
<P>
	   The past week's bitter cold aside, overall temperatures have been mild- so
far, said Yang. The average monthly temperature in December is 30 degrees, but
last month, the temperature averaged 34 degrees - 2 degrees above freezing.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that television has become such an important factor in our lives
that when the big weatherman predicts these dire storms the viewer abandons his
usual common sense," said Al Primo, a Greenwich television consultant who
pioneered "Eyewitness News" for local TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Lynn Pilczak agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes I think they hype it up good," said Pilczak, who works in
downtown Hartford. Bundled in a hooded jacket and gloves, Pilczak stood alone
Thursday outside an Aetna building where several smokers usually congregate
around noon.
</P>
<P>
	   As of late Thursday afternoon, state highways remained relatively clear.
Plow trucks were out in full force as snow continued to fall, said Rick
DeMatties, storm monitor for state Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we're becoming a little complacent because of the mild winters,"
said DeMatties. "We do get some calls here asking 'Should I go out? Is it safe?
' "
</P>
<P>
	   Some airlines canceled flights to and from Bradley International Airport
Thursday because of weather conditions in destination cities, said Chris Failla,
assistant airport operations specialist.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of people do attempt to get out on an earlier flight" when a storm is
brewing, Failla said.
</P>
<P>
	   All it takes is a fierce forecast to get customers in the door at the
Franklin True Value hardware store, said owner Sal Ciciro.
</P>
<P>
	   "People panic for any little thing," said Ciciro. "Right now they're coming
in."
</P>
<P>
	   The good economy also fuel weather woes, said Primo, president of
Medium4.com. In what he called a "wimpy era" people have become "fat and happy,"
eager for an opportunity to stay cooped up.
</P>
<P>
	   For some business owners, the bad weather makes for better economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today is very busy," said Jose Sanchez, who delivered bundles of food to a
downtown office. "Everybody is cold, nobody wants to go out. But we've got to
keep going."
</P>
<P>
	   Outside his window, Primo could see people scurrying in and out of the Food
Mart to stock up on milk and other essentials should Mother Nature send them to
their rooms.
</P>
<P>
	   Several dozen public and parochial schools canceled or postponed classes
Thursday, particularly those located along the shoreline.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been mild and that's wonderful, but this is New England and snow can
crop up at any time," said Tim Connors, superintendent of the Danbury public
schools. "It started to snow here at 7 a.m. ... Today we think it's a good
call."
</P>
<P>
	   Trumbull schools superintendent Ralph Iassogna also stood by his decision to
cancel school.
</P>
<P>
	   "You always have to make a decision that ensures the safety of the students
and staff coming in," he said.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily today on
the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   IBM's fourth-quarter profit tumbled 11 percent as the company struggled with
customers' worries over the Year 2000 computer bug. But profits still beat Wall
Street forecasts, and IBM officials encouraged analysts to leave their forecasts
for 2000 intact.
</P>
<P>
	   The bookseller expects fourth-quarter earnings to top estimates due to
strong sales at its superstores. Barnes &AMP; Noble said it expects to report $1.38
a share in profits, above analysts' estimates of $1.21 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Cascade Investment LLC, an investment vehicle for Microsoft Corp. chairman
Bill Gates, has claimed a 5.01 percent stake in Avista. Gates disclosed in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he holds 1.79 million
shares in Avista, a Spokane, Wash., energy company.
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco company Swedish Match AB plans to buy 64 percent of the shares in
General Cigar Holding, a U.S. company which sells cigar brands including
Macanudo and Cohiba. Last spring, Swedish Match bought General Cigar's mass
market operations.
</P>
<P>
	   The company expects to drastically miss earnings estimates for the fourth
quarter. Sunterra said it expects to report operating income of 1 cent to 8
cents per share, well below First Call/Thomson Financial estimates of 42 cents a
share. Sunterra develops and operates time-share vacation resorts.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said its auditors have required it to adopt more conservative
accounting practices, which forced it to restate third-quarter results. Legato
also missed estimates for its fourth quarter. The company makes backup and
recovery software.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's largest maker of lasers used in vision-correcting surgery said
demand for procedures using its surgical laser did not grow in the fourth
quarter. Visx met earnings forecasts of 38 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said its experimental cancer drug, Endostatin, is faring well in
an initial round of safety studies. EntreMed also preparing to start testing two

<HEADLINE> Networks Cut Back Campaign Coverage  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite competitive races in both parties, network evening
newscasts spent far less time covering the presidential campaign in 1999 than
they did four years earlier, a study concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC, CBS and NBC nightly news programs had 45 percent fewer minutes of
campaign coverage last year than in 1995, when President Clinton was readying
his re-election effort against eventual GOP nominee Bob Dole, according to the
Center for Media and Public Affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the election that the big broadcast networks decided they are no
longer the whole ballgame," Robert Lichter, president of the Washington-based
think tank, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The news landscape has changed markedly in four years. This is the first
presidential campaign covered by three cable news networks, and there is more
Internet coverage than ever before.
</P>
<P>
	   One expert suggested that the center's conclusions about the evening news
may be misleading.
</P>
<P>
	   Lichter said he would have anticipated more network campaign coverage in
1999, given that there are no incumbents and that the primary season is starting
earlier and is more compressed than before.
</P>
<P>
	   The cable news networks -- CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC -- have been
covering the campaign extensively. Early debates, in particular, have drawn big
ratings for the news networks.
</P>
<P>
	   "The downside is the inadvertent viewer doesn't get educated," Lichter said.
"The stuff is still out there for the junkies, but the average viewer isn't
going to run across it."
</P>
<P>
	   NBC's "Nightly News" devoted 184 minutes to presidential politics in 1999,
down 37 percent from 1995. The "CBS Evening News" had 144 minutes, down 55
percent from four years earlier. ABC's "World News Tonight" had 141 minutes,
down 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Oddly, NBC had the most evening news coverage on the campaign even though it
is the only one of the three tied to a cable news network, MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
	   "NBC News reaches more people today with its news coverage than it did four
years ago," spokeswoman Barbara Levin said. "A news organization's depth of
political coverage must now be measured by not only its broadcast reporting but
its cable news and Internet coverage as well."
</P>
<P>
	   There were no immediate comments from CBS and ABC officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrew Tyndall, a consultant who studies evening news content, suggested the
center's 1995 tally of campaign stories may be inflated by including news on the
aftermath of the 1994 GOP takeover of Congress. Tyndall's own study shows a less
marked drop in coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The evening newscasts had more presidential coverage last year than they did
in 1991, Tyndall said, suggesting there is no long-term shift away from
presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
	   The Center for Media and Public Affairs found that a candidate for Senate --
Hillary Rodham Clinton -- drew more evening news coverage last year than any of
the presidential candidates.

<HEADLINE> Trump, like McCain, facing ballot access problems in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Like John McCain, Donald Trump faces possible
problems getting on New York's presidential primary ballot, officials said
Thursday.
<P>
	   And for a time, it appeared that even former Sen. Bill Bradley might face a
challenge over some of his primary petitions. That appeared to evaporate on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike McCain or Bradley, Trump is not an announced candidate. Nonetheless,
the mega-developer is considering running for the Reform Party's presidential
nomination. In New York, the Reform Party goes by the name of the Independence
Party and some of its leaders are trying to get Trump convention delegate slates
on the state's March 7 presidential primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   But the effort has wound up in the middle of a battle for control of the New
York party.
</P>
<P>
	   The party's Democracy Coalition, led by leftist activist Lenora Fulani, has
filed challenges with the state Board of Elections to the petitions filed to get
Trump delegate slates on the ballot. The Fulani forces have also filed a state
court lawsuit. In a strange twist, Fulani is backing conservative Pat Buchanan's
run for the Reform Party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Backing Trump is Jack Essenberg, who Fulani is battling to have removed as
state chairman of New York's Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Cathy Stewart, the party's Manhattan chairman and a Fulani supporter, said
the Trump forces didn't file the necessary signatures of Independence Party
members to qualify for the primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "They didn't comply with the petition requirements set out in
black-and-white in the election laws," coalition lawyer Gary Sinawski said.
</P>
<P>
	   To qualify for the primary ballot, candidates need the signatures of 5,000
party members statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone said the legal requirements have been met
to get on the New York ballot. He would not say how many petition signatures had
been filed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The same taxes tactics that Mr. Bush is using against Mr. McCain, Miss
Fulani is trying to use on Mr. Trump," Stone said.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain petitions for the GOP primary ballot have been challenged in New
York by supporters of Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump did say Thursday he was worried about the infighting in the Reform
Party. "I am ... deeply concerned about growing divisions in the Reform Party,"
he said. "I strongly urge party leaders to sit down and negotiate their
differences out."
</P>
<P>
	   The state elections board could rule on petition objections early next week.
The lawsuits could last longer.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, a slate of five prospective Bradley delegates in the
Bronx, including Nate "Tiny" Archibald, a Hall of Fame basketball player and
member of the Boston Celtics 1981 title team, had drawn a possible challenge
that seemed to evaporate Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   While general objections to the Bradley slate had been filed Jan. 12,
specific challenges had to be postmarked by midnight Tuesday. As of Thursday,
the state board had not received those. Without specific objections, the
challenge is thrown out.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that while the
Al Gore campaign had vowed not to challenge Bradley's petitions, the general
objections had been filed by one of the vice president's top New York
supporters, Bronx Democratic Chairman Roberto Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Thursday, Ramirez said: "From everything I know, Mr. Bradley's
petitions are not being challenged."
</P>
<P>
	   "As a general rule, as certainly as long as I've been part of the process,
we've always taken a look at the petitions," the state assemblyman added.
</P>
<P>
	   Filing a general objection to the petitions is a way to preserve the right
to later go ahead with a full-blown challenge, Ramirez said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're hopeful there will be no challenges," Bradley spokeswoman Julia
Rothwax said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of New York's top Democrats have endorsed the vice president over the
former New York Knick. Gore's New York campaign said Thursday that it knew
nothing about the challenges.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, McCain is battling challenges to his petitions in 17 of the
state's 31 congressional districts.

<HEADLINE> DeLay Opens New GOP Drive  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Majority Whip Tom DeLay implored conservatives
Thursday to back the Republican drive to capture the White House and hold the
party's congressional majority this November, saying the GOP is defending ``the
great principles that have always defined America.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a 21-minute speech brimming with attacks on President Clinton and
liberals, DeLay sought to rally conservatives who in recent years have despaired
over GOP compromises on spending and other issues. DeLay, R-Texas, has become
one of the conservative movement's closest allies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our cause -- the defense of our values -- has never changed,'' DeLay said
in remarks at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ``We lack only a united
conservative front that can guide a cause to victory. And that means a
Republican president working with a Republican Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many Republicans have said poor turnout by dispirited conservatives cost the
GOP several House seats in the 1998 elections. The GOP's hold on the 435-member
House is now so slim that a net Democratic gain of five seats would give them
control of the chamber. Republicans consider a big conservative turnout crucial
to their electoral prospects in this fall's voting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So you can understand my frustration when some of our friends in the
conservative movement allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good,'' DeLay
said. ``All conservatives want to do more, but achieving more will require an
expanded Republican majority.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his speech and in remarks afterward to reporters, DeLay suggested that
the GOP's congressional agenda should be pushed rightward this year. Such a
strategy could conflict with that of GOP presidential front-runner George W.
Bush, who has been trying to give himself a softer edge than congressional
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   DeLay told reporters that his fellow Republicans should ``stand up for what
you believe in and not run from the onslaught that is to come'' if measures are
vetoed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's time to rediscover our world view and apply it to everything we're
passing in the House,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   DeLay mentioned few specific proposals. But he said a GOP drive aimed at
``rediscovering our values'' would include supporting ``faith-based
institutions,'' attacking violence and obscenity, reducing taxes and regulations
that he said hurt families, supporting the military and a foreign policy that
supports religious and political freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will be the foot soldiers in what, I believe, will someday be
recognized as the effort that not only contained, but rolled back the attack on
the great principles that have always defined America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Erik Smith, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee,
said that with GOP incumbents vacating House seats in several moderate, suburban
districts, a conservative shift by the Republican Party would help Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Following Tom DeLay's path to the far right is what's going to lose the
House'' for Republicans, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can always count on Tom DeLay to remind everyone just how completely
the extreme right wing controls the Republican leadership,'' added Rep. Martin
Frost of Texas, the No. 3 ranking House Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
	   DeLay, long one of Clinton's most unrelenting critics, said the White House
``has moved through the cherished institutions of our nation like a threshing
machine.'' He cited the administration's decision to return 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez to his father in Cuba as evidence of the need to introduce ``moral
principle'' to politics.
</P>

	   ``We cannot make great progress with a chief executive who believes that it
can, under any circumstances, be in a child's best interests to live under
Castro's communism,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also credited congressional Republicans with opposing ``a culture of
fashionable nihilism'' led by abortion-rights supporters and activist judges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have been alone in mounting a broad challenge to a liberalism designed
in elite universities and marketed by the entertainment moguls who employ their
graduates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   DeLay's remarks came a week before Clinton is scheduled to deliver his State
of the Union address. With Congress not commencing this year's session until
next week, Republicans have been hoping to gain attention with speeches by DeLay
and other congressional leaders.

<HEADLINE> Laborers Union, Justice Reach Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has agreed to relax its oversight
of anti-corruption efforts within the Laborers union, which has operated under
threat of a federal takeover for five years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not walking away from reform in the union, but substantial progress
had been made, '' Assistant Attorney General James Robinson, head of the
criminal division at Justice, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new agreement, effective Feb. 1, the union will have to keep
internal anti-corruption programs intact into 2006, and the government has the
right to challenge any substantial changes in court.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department, however, is giving up authority it has held since
1995 to place the union under the control of a court-appointed federal trustee
at any time it is dissatisfied with the progress of reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, after Sept. 30, 2006, the union will be free to modify any of the
internal changes that have resulted from federal oversight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This agreement is a clear acknowledgment by the government that our
union's innovative internal reforms have been effective in ridding the influence
of organized crime and corruption, and in building a union that is more open and
responsive to its members,'' said Laborers president Terence M. O'Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson said the union's overall success at reform was behind the
government's action, but among the factors considered is that none of the people
named by Justice in a proposed 1995 lawsuit against the union as members or
associates of organized crime now hold any position of trust in the union --
including its former president, Arthur Coia.
</P>
<P>
	   Coia was cleared last year by an independent hearing officer of charges that
he had ties to organized crime. But he resigned Dec. 31, saying he was tired of
continuing scrutiny of his conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Union officials said Coia's departure was not a condition required by the
government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The conversations at the table certainly did not make Mr. Coia's status an
issue in these negotiations,'' union attorney Bob Luskin said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Laborers International Union of North America has more than 800,000
members, mostly in the construction, environmental cleanup and maintenance
industries.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1980s, President Reagan's Commission on Organized Crime accused the
Laborers of having mob ties. To avoid racketeering charges, the union entered a
formal agreement with the Justice Department in 1995, promising to weed out
alleged mob lieutenants from its ranks and hold direct elections of its
officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Laborers voluntary deal has been seen as setting a precedent. The
government has forced supervision on other unions, including the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters and the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees
International Union.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is my hope that this reform program may set an example that more can be
achieved through cooperation than through conflict,'' Robinson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Teamsters are instituting voluntary internal reform programs similar to
the Laborers' in hopes of shaking government control.
</P>
<P>
	   The Laborers' anti-corruption efforts have removed 220 individuals from
union posts, including 127 who were members or associates of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Reforms have also included the first direct rank-and-file elections of
national union leaders and an ethics code enforced by independent officers who
have placed locals and district councils representing 68,000 members under
supervision or trusteeship, including in New York and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   The internal corruption investigations reached as high as Coia. Although
cleared of allegations of mob ties, he was fined $100,000 for a separate ethics
violation: purchasing a Ferrari in a joint arrangement with a dealer who leased
cars to the union.
</P>
<P>
	   That had launched a new criminal investigation by federal officials who were
disappointed Coia was not ousted from the union.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Education Tax Credit  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton proposed a $31 billion plan Thursday to
make college education more affordable and upbraided Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott for suggesting that no major legislation would be enacted this
election year.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of the proposal was a $10,000 tax deduction to help millions
of Americans pay for tuition, books and university fees. ``When we make college
more affordable, we make the American dream more achievable,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining Clinton for the White House announcement, on the first day of the
last year of his presidency, were Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the
Senate from New York, and a fellow New York Democrat, Sen. Charles Schumer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some in Congress, I note, are saying that because this is an election year
we really shouldn't try to do anything for the American people,'' Clinton said.
``Nothing, not a national election or a Washington snowstorm, should get in the
way of making a college education more affordable for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president was referring to a comment Lott, R-Miss., made to reporters a
day earlier. Lott said ``everyone needs to acknowledge ... there won't be a lot
of time for big, new initiatives'' on a shortened congressional calendar this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Skeptics question whether the policy proposals Clinton has made before his
State of the Union address Jan. 27 can pass the Republican-controlled Congress.
But White House officials, seeking to address those concerns, seized on Lott's
statement and insisted voters want action on education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Members of Congress who have been in their districts understand that
education is the top priority for most Americans,'' White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart said. ``I think there will be a political cost for those who want
to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lott fired back, saying that Congress would move ahead to balance the
federal budget, protect Social Security and Medicare, improve education and
health care and the national defense.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In addition,'' Lott said, ``We will continue to resist at every turn the
Clinton-Gore liberals' call for more government, less freedom, and higher
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
	   When Clinton's $30 billion ``College Opportunity Tax Cut'' is fully
operational in 2003, a family earning $120,000 or less annually could receive a
tax deduction of up to $10,000 for tuition, fees and job-related training.
Alternatively, taxpayers could seek a maximum credit of $2,800 a year. A similar
proposal sponsored by Schumer died in Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton noted that average college tuition has doubled over the past 20
years, outpacing median incomes. ``This touches Americans in all incomes and
from all walks of life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   While the White House accused Republicans of threatening to put politics
ahead of progress, officials played down the political benefits of the event to
Mrs. Clinton's campaign and noted that she long has advocated education
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's proposal included $35 million for the college Completion
Challenge grants, designed to spur college dropouts to return to class; $40
million for a new initiative to help minorities pursue five-year dual-degree
programs in fields where they are underrepresented; and $716 million for Pell
grants.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also will seek a combined $400 million increase for initiatives such
as the Gear Up program, which helps disadvantaged youths stay in high school;
TRIO, which helps them stay in college; and Job Corps, a national education and
job training program targeted at impoverished youths.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House Education and Workforce
Committee, applauded Clinton for ``finally (deciding) to embrace some of the
Republican priorities,'' such as increasing funding for Pell Grants.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am disappointed, however, that the president still sees the need to
create new federal programs ... when existing programs could be used,'' Goodling
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton is trying to appeal to middle-class suburban voters in the New
York Senate race. Polls show her trailing New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
in the politically crucial suburbs.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer noted that making college tuition tax deductible was a key campaign
pledge in his successful bid to oust Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998.
His proposal was narrowly defeated as an amendment to the tax cut package last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Since it is necessary for our children to attend college, it is wrong for
them to graduate with a mountain of debt,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Seton Hall students released from hospital share stories of fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LIVINGSTON, N.J. (AP) - Seven of 13 freshmen students injured in a fatal
fire at a Seton Hall University dormitory and hospitalized at Saint Barnabas
Medical Center were released on Thursday.
<P>
	   The seven students, who all lived on the third floor of Boland Hall,
suffered from smoke inhalation. An eighth student, also suffering from smoke
inhalation, was released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Five others who remained hospitalized were Nick Donato, of Sparta, and Ben
Chibnik, both 19; and Thomas Pugilese, Alvaro Llanos, and Ken Simons, all 18.
Three were listed in critical condition in the intensive care unit suffering
from burns and smoke inhalation, one in the intensive care unit in serious but
stable condition, and one in stable condition, according to a hospital
spokeswoman. Their hometowns were not released.
</P>
<P>
	   The most seriously injured student suffered burns to more than half his
body, said Dr. Sylvia Petrone, associate director of Saint Barnabas Medical
Center's burn unit.
</P>
<P>
	   "For an 18-year-old with a 60 percent burn injury, there's a good chance of
survival, but it is a life-threatening injury," Petrone said.
</P>
<P>
	   At University Hospital in Newark, Dana Christmas, a 21-year-old resident
adviser with burns on 58 percent of her body, had her first surgery Thursday to
graft skin onto her back and hands. She will need between three and five
surgeries and is still is at serious risk of infection in her lungs and skin,
said her surgeon, Edwin Deitch.
</P>
<P>
	   Students released from the hospital shared tales of panic and despair as
they managed to find their way out of the third-floor dorm which quickly filled
with smoke and flames.
</P>
<P>
	   "I opened the door and there were flames," said Alyssa Merla, 18, of West
Long Branch. "(My roommate and I) started saying Our Father because I thought we
were gonna die."
</P>
<P>
	   Merla said calling 911 was difficult because students must enter a code to
dial out. The two eventually escaped through a suitemate's door.
</P>
<P>
	   Marissa Lorenz, 18, of Scotch Plains, said she was in her room with Justin
Fox, 18, of Paramus, along with two roommates, who had slept through the alarm.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I first heard the alarm, I thought, 'I'm not leaving.' I mean, there
are so many alarms," said Lorenz.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first semester alone, there were 18 alarms in Boland Hall, according
to a campus spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   Merla noted students last semester eventually ignored false alarms.
</P>
<P>
	   "During our final exams, between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m., there were three
alarms," Merla. "I called my Mom and said 'Do you hear this?' I went into my
closet to sleep because I didn't want to leave."
</P>
<P>
	   Lorenz and Fox said they then heard screams just outside their door.
</P>
<P>
	   "I took my sweater off and put it in my mouth and went to the door, and the
handle was already hot," said Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   "We pulled this kid into out room and shut the door," said Lorenz. "We
didn't know who he was, I mean, this boy was unrecognizable."
</P>
<P>
	   Lorenz said she tried to calm the student, and asked him to nod if he could
hear her, but he would only cling to her leg.
</P>
<P>
	   "The hair on his legs were singed. He was charred. His hands were black and
his whole face was charred black," said Fox. "He told us his name, but we don't
remember. There was so much commotion."
</P>
<P>
	   The students said they were not told what happened to the student after they
pulled him into their room and firefighters rescued him.
</P>
<P>
	   Romil Sumilang, 18, of Teaneck, said he crawled into the smoke-filled
hallway with his roommate and couldn't find a way out.
</P>
<P>
	   "I lost my roommate in the dark, and then I heard a voice in the stairwell
saying. 'If you can hear me, come to my voice!"
</P>
<P>
	   Sumilang escaped, but said heard a female student yelling for help, so he
went back inside the burning dorm and dragged her to safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Killed in the fire were 18-year-old freshmen Frank S. Caltabilota of West
Long Branch, John N. Giunta of Vineland and Aaron C. Karol of Green Brook. Two
were found in the lounge and the third was found in a nearby bedroom, Campolo
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Candy Karol, Aaron's mother, said a viewing will be held Friday and Saturday
at Higgins Funeral Home in Watchung. The funeral will be held on Monday at St.
John's Church in Dunellan.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Karol said the family plans to establish a scholarship fund at Watchung
Hills High School, where Aaron graduated with honors.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Rabid Raccoons To Spread  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A two-decade spread of rabies in raccoons in the United
States has advanced into Canada, the government said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The outbreak was detected in 1977 along the West Virginia-Virginia line. The
Appalachian Mountains and rivers helped block the rabid raccoons' westward
spread, but only for a few years, said Candace McCall, an epidemic tracker with
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight cases of rabid raccoons have been confirmed in Canada since July, the
CDC said.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers estimate the rabies virus in raccoons is advancing 18 to 24
miles west and north annually.
</P>
<P>
	   Rabies can spread to other animals and to humans through bites or other
wounds and can be fatal. The CDC recommends that household pets be vaccinated
against the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Raccoons have represented the largest percentage of animal rabies cases
since 1990. From 1990 to 1998, a total of 35,264 cases of raccoon rabies were
reported in the United States, with 99.3 percent of those occurring in Eastern
states.

<HEADLINE> Advocates say what mayor calls help can actually harm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - As the number of homeless people in the city has risen
in recent months, the Giuliani administration has implemented a series of
policies to get people off streets and into treatment programs.
<P>
	   But despite the good intentions, homeless advocates say the mayor is doing
little more than driving additional people out on the street during the coldest
time of the year. The advocates' most recent ammunition: A sweep early Wednesday
in which police arrested at least 125 people seeking shelter from the
20-below-zero wind-chill.
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates and some politicians fear the raids - which occurred at 4 a.m. in
at least seven shelters citywide - will mean that at least some of the city's
22,586 people who seek shelter each night will simply avoid help in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, at least two homeless people have died in the city from
overexposure during the recent cold snap.
</P>
<P>
	   "The administration seems to be giving homeless people an ultimatum: Freeze
or face jail," Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields said Thursday.
"There will undoubtedly be some people who will be afraid to go to shelters and
will be in grave danger of freezing to death."
</P>
<P>
	   The Police Department has released few details about the Thursday morning
raid, but most of those arrested appear to have had outstanding bench warrants
for minor violations, including public urination.
</P>
<P>
	   "They can't be treated any differently than anybody else," Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no immunity in the law that says if you are homeless, you then get
away with committing a crime."
</P>
<P>
	   He said police made the shelter arrests because the homeless people were
suspected of violating various laws, and further, that the arrests will help
make shelters safer.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here's the reality the advocates have to face: 'There are some homeless
people that are criminals. Not all. Not most. Not a majority," said Giuliani. "I
can't ignore that. I'm the mayor of the city. I can't ignore the fact that among
homeless people are some dangerous criminals and some, not so dangerous, but
still criminals."
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates however, say they are particularly concerned by the raids because
they come after two other highly publicized initiatives: A city plan to deny
shelter to able-bodied, mentally stable homeless people who refuse to work; and
a crackdown that rounded people up off the street, and led to the arrests of
those who were uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
	   The work-for-shelter requirement - which is being held up in court - has a
provision that allows the city to take children away from parents who refuse to
comply with the rules. A judge would have to approve the removal of any children
from families.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has more recently sought to explain his initiatives as
"compassionate" and "loving."
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates however, say that without adequate housing and drug treatment
programs, the policies are cruel.
</P>
<P>
	   They also note that the number of homeless people being placed in permanent
housing is down.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1990s, the city and state funded an initiative which built 5,000
units of housing for low income city residents. A subsequent agreement however,
calls for building only 1,500 units over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
	   After several years of declining homelessness, advocates say the number of
needy is back on the rise.
</P>
<P>
	   The middle-of-the-night raid to arrest minor offenders, say advocates, only
makes matters worse.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is part of a series of very punitive policies on the part of the
Giuliani administration," said Patrick Markee, senior policy analyst for the
Coalition for the Homeless.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani however, said quality-of-life offenses cannot be ignored.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 138.06; New Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell steeply Thursday amid worries that
rising interest rates will ultimately cut into corporate earnings, while signs
of strong growth from leading technology companies boosted the Nasdaq further
into record territory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 138.06 to close at 11,351.30. The Dow
pitched wildly during the session, rising as much as 68 points in early trading
and plunging as much as 214 at midday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index rose 38.22 to 4,189.51, extending the record high
reached just Wednesday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 10.33 to 1,445.57.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose at the opening bell after IBM, which sent a chill through the
technology sector last fall when it said sales had slumped due to worries about
Year 2000 computer bugs, easily beat Wall Street's profit forecasts.
</P>
<P>
	   While IBM officials warned in their announcement late Wednesday that
lingering concerns will continue to take a toll on sales in the current quarter,
they encouraged analysts to leave their profit forecasts for 2000 intact. IBM
stock rose 6 3/8 from Wednesday's 4 p.m. close, finishing at 121 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcoa dropped 4 5/8 to 73 1/2 as the company announced plans to restart
primary aluminum production to meet growing global demand. The announcement
sparked fears that aluminum prices will drop, hurting Alcoa's bottom line. A
steady rise in aluminum prices last year helped Alcoa turn in the highest
returns of any Dow component stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer products companies also fared poorly Thursday. Procter &AMP; Gamble
fell 2 13/16 to 112 9/16 and 3M fell 3 11/16 to 95 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said worries that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates
this year are affecting blue-chip stocks much more sharply than high-flying
technology companies. Higher rates can cut into corporate profits by making it
more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
	   "Investors seem to feel that as long as the technology companies are
projected to grow 40 or 50 percent per year, who cares about interest rates?"
said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa
Barbara, Calif. "More mature companies can't possibly grow at that rate."
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, investors rewarded several technology leaders for their strong
growth.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Apple Computer rose 6 15/16 to 113 1/2. Apple said late
Wednesday it earned $1.03 per share in its most recent quarter, coasting past
published estimates of 90 cents per share and past the "whisper number" of 97
cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   "The earnings reports bolstered the positive outlook about technology and
its prospects for growth," said Paul Cherney, market analyst at Standard &AMP;
Poor's.
</P>
<P>
	   Not every technology leader was rewarded for strong profits. America Online,
which has seen its stock price tumble since the company announced its intentions
to merge with Time Warner, slipped  7/8 to 64. AOL said late Wednesday it earned
$224 million, or 9 cents a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, more than double
the $86 million, or 4 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts had expected AOL to earn 8 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 7.26 to 527.28, a new
closing record. The index, which lagged through much of 1999, has surged so far
this year and has set new closing records in four consecutive sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're getting some measurable outperformance from the small companies,"
Cherney said. "Investors appear unwilling to put all their eggs in one basket,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.35 billion shares, compared with 1.29
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading was fairly volatile a day ahead of Friday's "double witching"
session, when quarterly stock and index options expire, forcing traders to
adjust their portfolios. These quarterly deadlines tend to increase volume and
volatility.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.6 percent. Germany's DAX index
rose 0.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.5 percent, and France's CAC-40
closed 1.1 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> University considering installing sprinklers after fatal fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Seton Hall University is considering "anything
and everything" to improve fire safety following a fatal dormitory fire,
including the installation of sprinklers at all dorms, a spokeswoman said
Thursday.
<P>
	   The school will consider "anything that we can all do to make sure that
something like this never, ever happens again," spokeswoman Lisa Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   When asked if the university would look into installing sprinklers in
six-story Boland Hall, she said, "Absolutely."
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman also said Thursday she would consider legislation
requiring sprinkler systems in college dorms. " I don't think you could put a
price tag on human life," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Three students were killed and 62 injured, six critically, in Wednesday's
blaze in a third-floor lounge at Boland Hall. Only the six patients remained
hospitalized Thursday, four still in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Essex County Prosecutor Donald Campolo refuted a report Thursday in The
Star-Ledger of Newark that investigators had eliminated careless smoking and
electrical problems as possible causes.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are ruling out nothing at this juncture," Campolo said. He said
investigators were conducting a lengthy probe that includes interviews with at
least everyone hospitalized by the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The Star-Ledger report also said that investigators were seeking three young
men whom a resident adviser had asked to leave the building less than an hour
before the fire broke out. Campolo declined to comment on the story.
</P>
<P>
	   Students at the Roman Catholic university continued to question how well the
university is prepared for fire, including its handling of the chronic string of
false alarms that have plagued Boland Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I first heard the alarm, I thought 'I'm not leaving,"' said Marissa
Lorenz, an 18-year-old Scotch Plains resident who was released from the hospital
on Thursday. "I mean, there are so many alarms."
</P>
<P>
	   Omar Soriano, a 1997 Seton Hall alumnus, said Thursday that 25 false fire
alarms rang in Boland during one semester in 1994, when he was a resident
assistant.
</P>
<P>
	   Eighteen alarms have rung at Boland since September 1999. Grider said on
Thursday that in one of those cases, a fire was found in a Dumpster near the
dormitory. The others were false.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of people don't leave. They hide in closets, hide in bathrooms," said
university freshman Beth McCullough, 18, of Bloomsburg, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   McCullough and Nathan Umbriac, another freshman, said they have not had to
undergo fire drills at the Aquinas Hall dormitory and that they didn't recall
resident assistants preparing them for a fire or warning them against pulling
alarms as a prank.
</P>
<P>
	   "If that was our hall, I'm just wondering if everybody would have been
prepared," said Umbriac, 18, from Danville, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   The university released a page from its student manual on Thursday which
tells students what to do if a fire alarm goes off and warns that students can
be expelled for setting a false alarm.
</P>
<P>
	   Several students said that sprinklers should be installed in all of Seton
Hall's six dormitories. Two of the dormitories, Boland Hall and Aquinas Hall,
don't have installed sprinkler systems because they were built before such
systems were required by law. The dormitories are the only two that house
freshmen.
</P>
<P>
	   A rare fire alarm rang Thursday morning at Xavier Hall, evacuating nearly
200 students from the upperclassmen dorm. Grider said she didn't know the cause
of the alarm.
</P>
<P>
	   "I got up real quick for this one," said Guerschom Nazaire, 20, a junior
from Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the university's 10,000 students left campus following the fire.
Only two spent the night in a recreation center where makeshift beds were
created, Grider said. Many stayed with upperclassmen or went home.
</P>
<P>
	   About 150 sought grief counseling, Grider said, and others spent the day
quietly talking to friends, staying in their dorms.
</P>
<P>
	   "It affects the whole campus," said Nazaire. "The school is so small, so
everybody feels a little more connected."
</P>
<P>
	   The university suspended its guest pass policy for all university
residences. The guest policy was toughened last semester for security reasons,
Grider said. She didn't elaborate, but several students said there were problems
last year when fights between off and on-campus residents escalated.
</P>
<P>
	   The school canceled its weekend basketball games and extended its break from
classes until Monday, which president Monsignor Robert Sheeran said would be a
"university-wide day of mourning" for the victims: Frank S. Caltabilota of West
Long Branch, John N. Giunta of Vineland and Aaron C. Karol of Green Brook. All
were 18-year-old freshmen.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheeran said on Thursday that he and Newark Archbishop Theodore McCarrick
had walked through the third floor of Boland Hall on Wednesday and knelt by each
of the three bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   "We prayed over each of them, and we blessed them," Sheeran said.

<HEADLINE> Year's first snowfall causes minor problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The snow fell softly, blanketing the metropolitan area
with its first white coat of winter Thursday - a seasonal postcard that
threatened to wreak some havoc overnight before slipping north into New England.
<P>
	   Forecasters warned that up to eight inches of snow could land on eastern
Long Island, with the city getting up to five inches. Dropping temperatures and
whipping winds, with wind chill readings of 10- to 25-below zero, could also
cause icy roads by Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Thursday afternoon, there were only scattered problems, and a
relatively normal rush hour. In the northern suburbs, barely one inch was on the
ground; in Central Park, it was 2.5 inches, with 2 inches reported in Plainview,
on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's amazing how people panic with a little snow," said Marcia Bayer, who
was headed south from the Tarrytown train station for a Manhattan shopping
excursion. "This is nothing."
</P>
<P>
	   The region's three major airports - LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark - reported
delays of between 30 minutes and two hours and some cancellations.
</P>
<P>
	   Port Authority spokesman Bill Cahill said most of those problems were caused
by bad weather in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   In the city, trucks began scattering salt at 6 a.m. and quickly dumped more
than 5,000 tons across the five boroughs. There were also 1,000 heat complaints
called in by chilly tenants on Thursday, said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   On Long Island, a wildcat sick-out by state Department of Transportation
workers left local authorities struggling to keep streets clean and ice-free. At
least 300 of a scheduled 440 drivers, snow plow operators, warehouse workers and
mechanics called in sick.
</P>
<P>
	   The job action, prompted by contract talks stalled since April, was
"completely irresponsible," said state DOT spokesman Michael Fleischer. "The
workers have put the health and safety of Long Island motorists in jeopardy."
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki agreed, ordering the state attorney general to seek a
court order requiring an immediate return to work. "We will meet this ... with
swift and severe action," Pataki promised.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Madarasz, spokesman for the 77,000-member Civil Service Employees
Association, said union shop stewards had called snow plow drivers and urged
their return to work. The union had no knowledge of the sick-out, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of the usual 200 snowplows on the job in Long Island, there were
only 40 to 50 on the roads, Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Scattered school delays and early closings were also reported in suburbs in
Westchester and Rockland counties and Long Island, but nothing widespread.

<HEADLINE> Restoring Jersey side of Ellis Island to cost $300 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - It will cost some $300 million to restore the
abandoned, 30-building complex on the New Jersey side of Ellis Island to a
useful purpose.
<P>
	   Fundraisers, start your engines.
</P>
<P>
	   A blue-ribbon panel headed by one of the Republican Party's top political
donors gave Gov. Christie Whitman its report on Thursday hoping to trigger a
decade of fund raising and construction projects.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee chairman Finn Casperson said for all the ambitious proposals,
including development of a commercial conference center, the immediate priority
was to keep the half-century old buildings from falling down.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ellis Island is a symbol of the neglect of our nation's historic
buildings," Casperson said. "Time is of the essence. The buildings are falling
apart.... We cannot put it off for another decade."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman greeted the report by announcing she would include $1 million in the
upcoming budget to help save the largest building in the complex, the Baggage
and Dormitory Building. The state currently has put $2.3 million into saving the
island's main hospital, and a $2.2 million project is underway to save the ferry
building.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey officials became interested in developing Ellis Island after the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1998 that most of the land lies in New Jersey.
Whitman appointed Casperson's panel to recommend how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
	   Ellis Island's main attraction, the Immigrant Museum with its Great Hall, is
on New York soil and has been open to the public since 1990. It was the
processing center for millions of immigrants from 1892 to 1954.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Supreme Court said the larger, southern half of the island, which
holds a complex of former hospital and quarantine buildings, was in New Jersey
jurisdiction. That part remains off limits.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Park Service actually owns and controls the property and has
proceeded on its own, retaining a consultant, The Sedway Group, to study the
best use of the abandoned complex of buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   Casperson's Advisory Committee on the Preservation and Use of Ellis Island
largely endorsed the findings reported in October by the Sedway Group, which
recommended saving all the buildings and renovating their interiors for use as a
commercial conference center and a public-health museum.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee Thursday also proposed using some buildings to house a center
for historic restoration, a place where preservationists could do research and
could educate other historians.
</P>
<P>
	   "The significance of Ellis Island and its peril is widely recognized," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee said it would be too expensive to restore the building
interiors to their 1950s conditions, but the facades would be preserved as the
interiors are renovated for modern use.
</P>
<P>
	   Ambitious plans aside, Casperson and the committee said the immediate
priority was to make sure there are structures left standing to work with. Many
of the buildings are structurally unsafe, choked with plants and lacking basic
security steps as plywood to board up windows.
</P>
<P>
	   Casperson said these initial steps would cost $6.6 million just to make sure
there are buildings left intact to be preserved in future fundraising efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Plans for a so-called "Ellis Island Institute" would include a policy
retreat with up to 100 lodging rooms, a center for immigration and ethnic
studies and a living history memorial. Officials hope to count it as a revenue
source to fund other work.
</P>
<P>
	   The Center for Immigrant Contributions and Ethnic Learning would include
multimedia exhibits on living conditions of immigrants throughout the world, and
a 100-to 200-seat theater for lectures, film festivals and performing arts.
</P>
<P>
	   The Living History Memorial would preserve selected rooms in the former
medical complex to recall the public health history of the island, according to
the proposal by The Sedway Group.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Edward O'Connor, D-Hudson, a committee member, said the conference
center "could have an enormously positive impact on the Hudson County economy
and on New Jersey's reputation as an international and national leader."
</P>
<P>
	   The report also endorsed a National Park Service finding that the island
would require improved access, including a permanent pedestrian bridge linking
it to Liberty State Park. Currently, visitors to Ellis Island must buy a ticket
for a ferry.

<HEADLINE> Navy chooses Camden over Bayonne as permanent home of USS New  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The hulking battleship USS New Jersey, a decorated
veteran of four military conflicts, will spend its retirement just across the
Delaware River from the shipyard where it was built under the dark cloud of
World War II.
<P>
	   Navy Secretary Richard Danzig notified members of Congress on Thursday that
he has approved a plan to turn the ship into a floating museum off Camden, N.J.,
near the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.
</P>
<P>
	   In choosing Camden, the Navy rejected the advice of a New Jersey state
commission that recommended the ship be placed off Bayonne in northern New
Jersey, across the harbor from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Launched in 1942, the battleship New Jersey employed its immense guns in
World War II, Korea, Vietnam and off the coast of Lebanon in 1983. It is one of
four Iowa-class battleships, the biggest ever constructed.
</P>
<P>
	   Bayonne and Camden both advanced detailed arguments about why they would be
the best place for a floating museum.
</P>
<P>
	   Bayonne boosters cited the city's proximity to New York and other population
centers of northern New Jersey. The case for Camden included the ship's ties to
the Philadelphia shipyard and the idea that the Delaware River's freshwater
would be kinder to the ship's massive hull.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will be a great thing for the area, a great thing for the area's
veterans and a great thing for Camden," said Rep. Jim Saxton, R-Mount Holly, who
helped lead the Camden campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Saxton and Rep. Rob Andrews, D-Haddon Heights, celebrated the decision by
visiting the battleship at its temporary berth at the former Philadelphia Naval
Shipyard, now officially called the Philadelphia Naval Business Center.
</P>
<P>
	   The ship was towed there from Bremerton, Wash., last year on a 5,800-mile
trip that included its 10th - and final - passage through the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
	   Saxton and Andrews said Camden proved the more economically viable location
in part because another floating military museum, the aircraft carrier USS
Intrepid, already exists across New York Harbor from Bayonne.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't make sense to put two Wal-Marts within a mile and a half of each
other," Andrews said. "The (USS) New Jersey would be competition for the
Intrepid, and vice versa, and it didn't make any sense."
</P>
<P>
	   State Assemblyman Joe Azzolina, chairman of the state battleship commission,
promised to implement the Navy's decision even though it went against his
long-held belief that the ship should go to the former Military Ocean Terminal
in Bayonne.
</P>
<P>
	   "Congratulations to Camden!" he wrote in pen on the bottom of a press
release.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bob Menendez, D-Union City, whose district includes Bayonne, accused
the Navy of caring "more for the votes of the (House) Armed Services Committee
than the best berthing place for the USS New Jersey." Andrews and Saxton both
sit on that committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle for the battleship opened a long-standing political rift pitting
North Jersey against South Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight northern New Jersey congressman advocated Bayonne, while three
southern New Jersey congressman endorsed Camden.
</P>
<P>
	   South Jersey advocates also secured endorsements from congressmen
representing parts of Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland, as well as members of
New York's delegation, who worried that a battleship museum in North Jersey
would compete for tourist dollars with the Intrepid, docked off Manhattan's West
Side.
</P>
<P>
	   Also weighing in for Camden was Andrew Cuomo, secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, who said a floating battleship museum would support federal efforts
to make the city an economic empowerment zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Closely divided, New Jersey's battleship commission voted in 1998 to berth
the warship in Bayonne. But several members supporting Bayonne did so with the
caveat that the ship should move to Liberty State Park in Jersey City if it is
ever renovated to accommodate such a huge vessel.
</P>
<P>
	   Jersey City officials subsequently agreed not to compete with Bayonne before
the Navy's ship-donation program. But Camden did file its own application.
</P>
<P>
	   Economics, not just pride, was at issue. Bayonne and Camden are both aging
cities that would welcome the boost of tourism dollars. Also, since the federal
government cannot subsidize a donated warship, a failed museum in either
location could force taxpayers to cover its expense.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman originally said she would abide by the advice of the
commission. But then she proclaimed herself neutral, pledging $6 million in
state money to restore the ship to museum readiness, wherever it ended up.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday Whitman said her administration is committed to help prepare the
ship for the public's enjoyment.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think she's going to do just fine in Camden," Whitman said. "She would
have done well in Bayonne; she'll do just fine in Camden."

<HEADLINE> Fat-Trimming Activists Rip McCain  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE RIZZO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A pig rolls a barrel of dollars across Sen. John McCain's
Web site to illustrate his devotion to cutting pork-barrel spending. Rep. John
Kasich uses an icon of a ``wastebusters'' ghost to make the same point on the
site for the House Budget Committee he chairs.
</P>
<P>
	   But those foes of government waste did not always back up their tough talk
when it came to voting on trimming fat, some of their activist allies complained
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, the Arizona senator who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination,
and Kasich, R-Ohio, were given only average voting scores in ``Green Scissors
2000,'' a report by three groups that identified 77 proposals and programs the
organizations deemed wasteful and environmentally unfriendly. All the items went
before Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was aggressive on a fight against sugar subsidies, but faded on other
issues and missed some key votes, Cuff said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``McCain talks the talk, but when it comes time for leadership, he walks,''
said Courtney Cuff of Friends of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John Kasich, who a few years ago was our champion on this stuff, didn't go
down there and sponsor one amendment,'' she said. She worked closely with Kasich
on several earlier battles to abolish business subsidies, but complained that
last year he hid behind ``let's cut a small percentage across the board.''
</P>
<P>
	   Friends of the Earth, Taxpayers for Common Sense and the U.S. Public
Interest research Group produced the report, which tracked the votes of all the
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides to Kasich and McCain said the criticism was unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokeswoman Nancy Ives said for 17 years he has ``fought against
pork-barrel spending items in every appropriations bill,''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has been front and center in Congress in cutting wasteful spending and
returning that money to the taxpayers of America,'' she said. That effort
includes compiling an itemized list of every non-requested, low-priority item in
each appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
	   Kasich is preparing for a Feb. 2 hearing on wasteful government spending,
spokesman Bruce Cuthbertson said, and ``has been involved in virtual
hand-to-hand combat over corporate welfare for more years than anyone I know
of.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jill Lancelot, legislative director of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said she
was disappointed in the amount of time devoted to subsidy-fighting last year by
McCain and Kasich, both of whom were balancing congressional duties with
presidential campaigns. Kasich subsequently dropped out.
</P>
<P>
	   The Green Scissors report praised the work of Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and
GOP Reps. Tom Campbell of California and Christopher Shays of Connecticut. They
voted against each of the issues identified by the groups and took the lead on
cutting items identified in a previous Green Scissors report.

<HEADLINE> First snowstorm brings only a few inches but lots of travel woes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - As snowstorms go, the first this winter didn't pack
much fury, but Thursday's snow and bitter cold were more than enough to leave
roads icy, causing scores of fender-benders and a few more serious accidents.
<P>
	   Parts of two major highways were closed by wrecks, the New Jersey Turnpike
lowered speed limits, and state police urged residents to stay off roads.
</P>
<P>
	   "Driving is extremely treacherous," said New Jersey State Police spokesman
John Hagerty. "Limit driving unless you absolutely have to be out on the
highways."
</P>
<P>
	   The National Weather Service issued a winter weather advisory for the state,
predicting gusty winds, overnight wind chills as numbing as 20 degrees below
zero and 2 to 6 inches of snow, with the southern and eastern parts of the state
getting the most. It also warned that minor coastal flooding was possible during
Thursday evening's high tides as increasing winds pushed water onshore.
</P>
<P>
	   But by mid-afternoon, only a half-inch to 2 inches of snow had fallen on
northeastern New Jersey, and major roads remained clear in west and central New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the roads are that bad," said Cheryl McGuigan, 42, an
assistant mailroom supervisor for the state who lives in Trenton. "The sidewalks
are slippery," though, and she nearly fell while walking outside at lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Lois Vereen, 34, a state Pensions Department employee, said the morning bus
she takes to work from north Trenton was delayed about 30 minutes, but the
weather wasn't bothering her.
</P>
<P>
	   "I expected worse than this," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The turnpike cut its speed limit to 45 mph and banned motorcycles and
car-pulled trailers. NJ Transit spokesman Ken Miller, though, said its trains
and buses were running "fairly close to schedule."
</P>
<P>
	   Newark International Airport, as well as LaGuardia and Kennedy International
airports in New York, were reporting scattered 90-minute delays on flights and
some cancellations. Most of the trouble was caused by bad weather in other parts
of the country, including Washington, D.C., and Chicago, said Bill Cahill, a
spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Some businesses closed early, and at least 120 public schools were closed or
sent students home early. McGuire Air Force Base sent its approximately 1,000
civilian personnel, except those considered "weather essential," home at 2 p.m.
and gave commanders of the base's 5,000 active duty military personnel the
option to do the same.
</P>
<P>
	   The Meadowlands Racetrack canceled live racing Thursday because of the
weather.
</P>
<P>
	   The state government, though, didn't send its workers home early or open its
snow emergency center.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jan. 20 storm was the third-latest in central New Jersey with at least
1/10 inch of snow in the last 105 years, according to state climatologist Dave
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were 13 years when the first snowfall didn't come till January," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest snowfall recorded at New Brunswick was Jan. 31, 1921. Robinson
said the storm was far enough east that it would dump most of its snow onto the
ocean, and the storm could sap some of the energy from one expected Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to be another brutally cold day tomorrow," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   In Mercer County, huge stretches of the Delaware River glistened white
through a light fog as snow accumulated atop large sheets of ice.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't so pretty elsewhere, though.
</P>
<P>
	   Hagerty, the state police spokesman, said there were countless
"slip-and-slide accidents" on the state's major highways, including Routes 78,
80 and 278. Route 195 had more than 30 accidents during the morning rush hour
and on the stretch of Route 295 from Trenton to Bellmawr in Camden County, there
were about 40 morning wrecks.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Garden State Parkway in Lakewood, a tanker truck carrying fuel
overturned about 6 a.m., injuring the driver and spilling several hundred
gallons of fuel. An eight-mile stretch between exits 91 and 83 was closed into
the evening.
</P>
<P>
	   On the turnpike, a truck slid off the roadway in East Brunswick shortly
after 10 a.m., shutting down traffic in the southbound truck lanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, icy roads may have caused an incident on the Atlantic City
Expressway in Winslow Township. About 8 a.m., 12 cars on both the eastbound and
westbound sides lost control and ended up on the median and the westbound
shoulder, according to Peter Hartt, a spokesman for the South Jersey
Transportation Authority, which operates the 44-mile toll road.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wouldn't call it a pileup," he said. "I'd call it a scatter."
</P>
<P>
	   The island community of Brigantine had its only access road cut off for 2
1/2 hours Thursday after a weather-related fender-bender, police said. The
accident on the Brigantine Bridge - which links Brigantine with Atlantic City -
occurred about 12 noon and the span was closed until 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Department of Transportation crews hit major roads as early as 5 a.m.
Thursday, spreading salt and monitoring road conditions, according to department
spokesman Jim Berzok. Once snow began to accumulate, about 565 workers operating
463 pieces of equipment - mostly snowplows - began clearing roads.
</P>
<P>
	   Berzok said the biggest problems likely would come at night, when a dramatic
temperature drop was expected to add to icing on roadways. He said the
department probably would keep some road crews on into the evening, after the
anticipated end of the snowfall around 7 p.m., and some crews might continue
salting and sanding roads overnight.

<HEADLINE> Seton Hall students released from hospital share stories of fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LIVINGSTON, N.J. (AP) - Seven of 13 freshmen students injured in a fatal
fire at a Seton Hall University dormitory and hospitalized at Saint Barnabas
Medical Center were released on Thursday.
<P>
	   The seven students, who all lived on the third floor of Boland Hall,
suffered from smoke inhalation. An eighth student, also suffering from smoke
inhalation, was released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Five others who remained hospitalized were Nick Donato, of Sparta, and Ben
Chibnik, both 19; and Thomas Pugilese, Alvaro Llanos, and Ken Simons, all 18.
Three were listed in critical condition in the intensive care unit suffering
from burns and smoke inhalation, one in the intensive care unit in serious but
stable condition, and one in stable condition, according to a hospital
spokeswoman. Their hometowns were not released.
</P>
<P>
	   The most seriously injured student suffered burns to more than half his
body, said Dr. Sylvia Petrone, associate director of Saint Barnabas Medical
Center's burn unit.
</P>
<P>
	   "For an 18-year-old with a 60 percent burn injury, there's a good chance of
survival, but it is a life-threatening injury," Petrone said.
</P>
<P>
	   At University Hospital in Newark, Dana Christmas, a 21-year-old resident
adviser with burns on 58 percent of her body, had her first surgery Thursday to
graft skin onto her back and hands. She will need between three and five
surgeries and is still is at serious risk of infection in her lungs and skin,
said her surgeon, Edwin Deitch.
</P>
<P>
	   Students released from the hospital shared tales of panic and despair as
they managed to find their way out of the third-floor dorm which quickly filled
with smoke and flames.
</P>
<P>
	   "I opened the door and there were flames," said Alyssa Merla, 18, of West
Long Branch. "(My roommate and I) started saying Our Father because I thought we
were gonna die."
</P>
<P>
	   Merla said calling 911 was difficult because students must enter a code to
dial out. The two eventually escaped through a suitemate's door.
</P>
<P>
	   Marissa Lorenz, 18, of Scotch Plains, said she was in her room with Justin
Fox, 18, of Paramus, along with two roommates, who had slept through the alarm.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I first heard the alarm, I thought, 'I'm not leaving.' I mean, there
are so many alarms," said Lorenz.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first semester alone, there were 18 alarms in Boland Hall, according
to a campus spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   Merla noted students last semester eventually ignored false alarms.
</P>
<P>
	   "During our final exams, between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m., there were three
alarms," Merla. "I called my Mom and said 'Do you hear this?' I went into my
closet to sleep because I didn't want to leave."
</P>
<P>
	   Lorenz and Fox said they then heard screams just outside their door.
</P>
<P>
	   "I took my sweater off and put it in my mouth and went to the door, and the
handle was already hot," said Fox.
</P>
<P>
	   "We pulled this kid into out room and shut the door," said Lorenz. "We
didn't know who he was, I mean, this boy was unrecognizable."
</P>
<P>
	   Lorenz said she tried to calm the student, and asked him to nod if he could
hear her, but he would only cling to her leg.
</P>
<P>
	   "The hair on his legs were singed. He was charred. His hands were black and
his whole face was charred black," said Fox. "He told us his name, but we don't
remember. There was so much commotion."
</P>
<P>
	   The students said they were not told what happened to the student after they
pulled him into their room and firefighters rescued him.
</P>
<P>
	   Romil Sumilang, 18, of Teaneck, said he crawled into the smoke-filled
hallway with his roommate and couldn't find a way out.
</P>
<P>
	   "I lost my roommate in the dark, and then I heard a voice in the stairwell
saying. 'If you can hear me, come to my voice!"
</P>
<P>
	   Sumilang escaped, but said heard a female student yelling for help, so he
went back inside the burning dorm and dragged her to safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Killed in the fire were 18-year-old freshmen Frank S. Caltabilota of West
Long Branch, John N. Giunta of Vineland and Aaron C. Karol of Green Brook. Two
were found in the lounge and the third was found in a nearby bedroom, said Essex
County Prosecutor Donald Campolo.
</P>
<P>
	   Candy Karol, Aaron's mother, said a viewing will be held Friday and Saturday
at Higgins Funeral Home in Watchung. The funeral will be held on Monday at St.
John's Church in Dunellan.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Karol said the family plans to establish a scholarship fund at Watchung
Hills High School, where Aaron graduated with honors.

<HEADLINE> Helms Seeks U.N. Reforms  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms, who has made a career of lambasting
the United Nations, kept up the attack as he addressed the Security Council on
Thursday, saying Americans feel ``a lack of gratitude'' from the world
organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms, R-N.C., who has previously branded U.N. officials as
``dysfunctional'' and ``cry babies,'' tempered his criticism by proposing a new
spirit of cooperation with the world body and suggested formal, annual visits
between members and U.S. lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we are to have a new beginning, we must endeavor to understand each
other better,'' Helms said in the first-ever address by a U.S. lawmaker to the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his courtly tone and offer of a ``hand of friendship,'' delegates
reacted coolly to Helms' litany of U.N. excesses and failings.
</P>
<P>
	   American tardiness in meeting its payments and Helms' insistence on a lower
U.S. contribution ``has hindered and not helped'' peacekeeping efforts, said
Jeremy Greenstock, the British envoy.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergey Lavrov, Russia's representative, complained that the United States
failed to abide by terms of a U.N. budget that all members approved. ``All the
other members of the United Nations expected the United States to keep its
word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The money we spend on the U.N. is not charity,'' Helms declared. ``To the
contrary, it is an investment -- an investment from which the American people
rightly expect a return.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congress last year voted to pay $926 million in back U.S. dues over three
years.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States paid a $100 million installment late last year. But to get
the rest, the United Nations must meet about a dozen conditions drafted by
Helms, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, and Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., the committee's senior minority member.
</P>
<P>
	   The conditions includes a reduction the U.S. share of the U.N. peacekeeping
budget from the current 31 percent to 25 percent and of the regular budget from
25 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms said the United Nations must also trim its spending and not draw the
United States into ``entangling alliances.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A United Nations that seeks to impose its presumed authority on the
American people without their consent begs for confrontation, and -- I want to
be candid -- eventual U.S. withdrawal,'' Helms asserted.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator also accused the General Assembly of an anti-American bias.
``The American people hear all this, they resent it. And they have grown
increasingly frustrated with what they feel is a lack of gratitude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms was invited to speak by U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, who holds
the rotating council chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the blunt exchanges, Holbrooke said he hoped Helms' appearance would
help in ``bringing to a close a chapter of great tension between Washington and
the U.N.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will help us push the reform package, which is our highest priority,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The full 188-member General Assembly must approve any major changes in the
organization's operations and cost-sharing formula.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms told the Security Council it had a ``mixed record'' in recent
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
	   While it ``performed admirably'' in ending Iraqi aggression against Kuwait
in 1990-91, ``In the more recent case of Kosovo, it was paralyzed,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia was a disaster, and its failure to
protect the Bosnian people from Serb genocide is well documented,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other criticisms, Helms has taken issue with Secretary General Kofi
Annan's calls for increased ``global engagement.'' The United Nations ``must
respect national sovereignty'' and not seek ``to impose its utopian vision of
international law on Americans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan met privately with Helms before the meeting and escorted him into the
chamber, but did not stay for the speech. John Ruggie, a top Annan aide, said
Annan's absence was not a snub, but that the secretary general had other
engagements.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms mixed his lecture with folksy charm, saying at one point that he hoped
``you have a translator here who can speak Southern.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not my intent to offend you, and I hope I will not,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the Security Council's 14 other members spoke in response to Helms'
speech.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your warm accent from the South was entirely understood by our
interpreters,'' said French Ambassador Alain Dejammet. ``We did hear you.... But
the idea in this house is that others must be heard as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese ambassador, Qin Huasun, said the United Nations ``is not perfect
... but it is irreplaceable and it is there for everyone to see.'' He did
suggest agreement with Helms' views that the United Nations exhibit ``respect
for sovereignty'' and ``nonintervention in internal affairs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Helms spoke while seated at the head of the horseshoe-shaped Security
Council table, mostly reading from a loose-leaf notebook, sometimes banging his
hands on the table to emphasize a point. Council members looked on with little
apparent emotion.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, other members of the Foreign Relations Committee will join Helms
for a meeting with Annan, lunch at U.N. headquarters, and a committee hearing at
a nearby office building that will look into recent developments at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms later told reporters none of the rebuttal comments had changed his
mind about the United Nations, but he added, smiling broadly, ``I think we have
a certain camaraderie going. Let's keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke's analysis of Helms' performance: ``It was something.''

<HEADLINE> Indictment returned against top Wall Street executive and porn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - An X-rated movie star and a top Wall Street executive
were indicted Thursday on insider trading charges.
<P>
	   James McDermott Jr., the former CEO at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, was named in
the indictment along with Kathryn Gannon, 30, known as "Marylin Star" in the
adult film industry.
</P>
<P>
	   A third defendant, Anthony P. Pomponio, was also charged. McDermott, 48, of
Briarcliff Manor and Pomponio, 45, of North Caldwell, N.J., already have been
arrested and freed on bail. Ms. Gannon, 30, of Miami, Fla., remains a fugitive,
apparently living in Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York investment bank chief was accused of tipping Ms. Gannon about
companies on the verge of mergers that would dramatically affect their stock
prices. Ms. Gannon then allegedly bought the stocks and shared the information
with Pomponio, a friend who also allegedly cashed in.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, McDermott, 48, who is married, was intimately
involved with Ms. Gannon while the insider trading was going on.
</P>
<P>
	   Pomponio allegedly told investigators that Ms. Gannon not only worked in
adult films but also was a prostitute, with New York City clients including
"well connected Wall Street types" such as lawyers and stockbrokers.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictment accused McDermott of stealing confidential, non-public
information from his company and its clients and feeding the information about
six potential or actual mergers to Ms. Gannon, who then told Pomponio.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege the trio made more than $170,000 in illegal profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods had been scheduled to go public with a stock
offering last spring but withdrew the plans suddenly in May. According to court
papers, the offering was canceled after McDermott told the company's directors
that a friend of his - apparently Ms. Gannon - was being investigated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission for trading in stocks he had recommended to
her.
</P>
<P>
	   McDermott, Ms. Gannon and Pomponio were each charged by U.S. Attorney Mary
Jo White with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and securities fraud.
Pomponio also was charged with perjury. A separate civil complaint was brought
by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   McDermott resigned from the bank in June. He remains free on $1 million bail
while Pomponio is free on $50,000 bail. Both have declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Dorm adviser tells of returning three times to burning floor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Twice, Daniel Nugent led disoriented students
through the smoke that was choking their dormitory to safety. Then he went back
again.
<P>
	   By then, "flames were wrapping around the door" to the third floor, the
floor where Nugent, a sophomore at Seton Hall University, was resident assistant
to freshmen.
</P>
<P>
	   The door was too hot to open. Retreating to the lobby of Boland Hall, Nugent
learned "there were people trapped in their rooms and screaming to get out their
windows," he recalled Thursday evening, some 36 hours after the fire killed
three of his charges.
</P>
<P>
	   A neighbor provided a ladder that Nugent and a fellow resident assistant
used to reach a third-floor window.
</P>
<P>
	   "We got the girls out first because they were really scared," said Nugent,
21, of Northfield in Atlantic County.
</P>
<P>
	   "We went to another window to help other kids. A badly burned kid had been
pulled into one room. I stayed in this room while other RAs took the ladder to
help more residents," Nugent recounted at a news conference, as his parents,
Kathy and Bill, stood by.
</P>
<P>
	   "I stayed with the injured resident. The kid who pulled him out of the fire
is a real hero - he would not leave the room until he knew that the injured
student was all right. I wet towels and put them on the kid's burned skin,"
Nugent said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nugent remained until firefighters came through the window and took the
injured student to safety, then directed firefighters to other rooms before
finally leaving the building, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The young man declined to answer any questions from reporters, asking to be
"left alone to deal with the deaths of my friends and residents."
</P>
<P>
	   "I want people to know that there were so many others - students and staff
members alike - who risked their lives to save other people," Nugent said.
</P>
<P>
	   The horror began when he was awoken by fire alarms about 4:30 a.m. on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I opened my door, I saw smoke in the hallway. I walked into the hall
with my cordless phone and turned the corner to see the fire in the lounge. I
called security to confirm that there was a fire, and started banging on my
residents' doors," Nugent said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Freshmen students living on the floor came out to help me - walking under
the smoke to get through the hallways. We were all banging on doors until they
had to leave for their own safety," he said. But Nugent remained.
</P>
<P>
	   "I found one student in bad shape and grabbed her arms to help her to her
feet, down the stairs and to the lobby where Seton Hall Health Services were
waiting," Nugent said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I went back up to the third floor a second time - this time the smoke was
down so far I had to crawl," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I found more residents who did not know where they were going and were
walking in the smoke," Nugent said. "I told them to crawl - as I was taught in
training - and I yelled at them to use the stairs away from the fire."
</P>
<P>
	   After leading them to safety, Nugent returned to his floor via the ladder.

<HEADLINE> Camden To Be Ship's Retirement Home  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The hulking battleship USS New Jersey, a decorated
veteran of four military conflicts, will spend its retirement just across the
Delaware River from the shipyard where it was built under the dark cloud of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Navy Secretary Richard Danzig notified members of Congress Thursday
that he has approved a plan to turn the ship into a floating museum off Camden,
N.J., near the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.
</P>
<P>
	   In choosing Camden, the Navy rejected the advice of a New Jersey state
commission that recommended putting the ship off Bayonne in northern New Jersey,
across the harbor from New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   Launched in 1942, the battleship New Jersey employed its immense guns in
World War II, Korea, Vietnam and off the coast of Lebanon in 1983. It is one of
four Iowa-class battleships, the biggest ever constructed.
</P>
<P>
	   Bayonne and Camden both advanced detailed arguments about why they would
they would be the best place for a floating museum.
</P>
<P>
	   Bayonne boosters cited the city's proximity to New York and other population
centers of northern New Jersey. The case for Camden included the ship's ties to
the Philadelphia shipyard and the idea that the Delaware River's freshwater
would be kinder to the ship's massive hull.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This will be a great thing for the area, a great thing for the area's
veterans and a great thing for Camden,'' said Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., who
helped lead the Camden push.
</P>
<P>
	   Saxton and Rep. Rob Andrews, D-N.J., said Camden proved the more
economically viable location, in part because Bayonne would have had to compete
against an existing floating military museum, the aircraft carrier USS Intrepid,
located across New York Harbor.
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., whose district includes Bayonne, accused the
Navy of caring more for ``the votes of the (House) Armed Services Committee''
than for the ship's future. Saxton and Andrews sit on that committee.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey Assemblyman Joe Azzolina, chairman of the state battleship
commission, promised to implement the Navy's decision even though it went
against his long-held belief that the ship should go to the former Military
Ocean Terminal in Bayonne.
</P>
<P>
	   The battleship currently sits at the former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, now
officially called the Philadelphia Naval Business Center. It was towed there
from Bremerton, Wash., last year on a 5,800-mile trip that included its 10th and
final passage through the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
	   The battle for the battleship opened a long-standing political rift pitting
North Jersey against South Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight northern New Jersey congressman advocated Bayonne, while three
southern New Jersey congressman endorsed Camden.
</P>
<P>
	   South Jersey advocates also secured endorsements from congressmen
representing parts of Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland, as well as members of
New York's delegation who viewed a museum in Bayonne as potential competition
for the Intrepid.
</P>
<P>
	   Also weighing in for Camden was Andrew Cuomo, secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, who said a floating battleship museum would support federal efforts
to make the city an economic empowerment zone.

<HEADLINE> Driver Evaluations Said Meaningless  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN CLENDENNING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Although bus and truck drivers must be medically
certified every two years, the system is useless because the exams are easy to
pass and there is virtually no government oversight, the chairman of the
National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   During a break from a hearing about a bus crash that killed 22 people in New
Orleans last Mother's Day, NTSB chairman James Hall said there is an ``absence
of any believable program'' for certifying commercial drivers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Each and every day we are sharing our highways with drivers who are
unfit,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall made the comments after transportation experts testified that
commercial drivers with serious health problems essentially shop around for
physicians who give easy medical exams. There was also testimony that doctors
are unaware of rules about driver health and that oversight by federal officials
is virtually nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
	   Such deficiencies were exposed last year in the New Orleans crash, when a
chartered bus carrying mostly elderly women on a day trip to a Mississippi
casino veered off Interstate 610 and overturned. Police said driver Frank
Bedell's use of marijuana hours earlier was the main cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Bedell, who died in August, held a commercial license even though he had a
history of failing bus company drug tests. That information was never passed on
to licensing officials because no federal rules required the disclosure.
</P>
<P>
	   NTSB investigators also found a doctor had diagnosed Bedell with congestive
heart failure in 1998 but still signed his medical certificate -- even though
federal law prohibits people with the disease from getting commercial drivers'
licenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than 12 hours before the crash, Bedell was treated in a hospital
emergency room for dehydration and extremely low blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors who perform the certification exams for bus drivers and truckers
never receive training on how commercial drivers should be assessed, and no one
monitors the doctors' performance, said Dr. Natalie Hartenbaum, a Philadelphia
physician who wrote a guide on medical certification for the federal Department
of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To do a complete exam takes 20 minutes,'' she testified. ``Many of them do
it in five.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration requires doctors to take a one-week
training course before they start giving medical exams to pilots.
</P>
<P>
	   All results are forwarded to the FAA for possible review. Also provided to
the FAA are results of drug and alcohol tests. Pilots who test positive are
grounded while they undergo treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall said bus and truck drivers should be part of a similar system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We already have a model at the federal level on how we can do a better
job,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer says his client is not cooperating with prosecutors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The lawyer for a Brooklyn man accused of helping an
Algerian try to smuggle explosives into the United States said Thursday his
client is not cooperating with authorities.
<P>
	   Roland Thau, the lawyer for Abdel Ghani Meskini in New York, said his client
had not spoken to law enforcement since Thau began representing him a few hours
after his arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorney's comments came several hours after Meskini, 31, pleaded
innocent in U.S. District Court in Manhattan to charges of providing and
concealing support for Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian national accused of trying to
sneak explosives into the United States just before New Year's.
</P>
<P>
	   Another alleged accomplice, Mokhtar Haouari, 31, appeared in Superior Court
in Montreal Thursday morning for the start of court proceedings aimed at
bringing him to New York. He has been indicted on the same charges Meskini
faces.
</P>
<P>
	   Thau said prosecutors have told him Meskini made statements after police
arrested him Dec. 30 and it was possible that "cops coerced some kind of
statement from him."
</P>
<P>
	   But Thau said he hadn't seen any such evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   He said any statement made by his client most likely would have been to
declare his innocence or explain why he traveled to Seattle the week Ressam was
arrested in Port Angeles, Wash.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam was arrested Dec. 14 on explosives smuggling charges after he
allegedly tried to smuggle RDX, a powerful demolition explosive, and timing
devices into Washington from Canada. The arrest increased fears of terrorism
planned to coincide with millennium celebrations, but no such attack
materialized.
</P>
<P>
	   In court papers, federal prosecutors allege Haouari asked Meskini to travel
to Seattle to meet Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   The indictment against Haouari and Meskini accuses them of conspiring since
October 1997 to support members and associates of a terrorist group. Haouari
allegedly provided various forged identification documents while Meskini went to
Seattle to assist Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, court documents and statements by authorities have not indicated
exactly what the alleged terrorists had planned to do, or how many of them were
involved. Suspects in the case have been linked to the Armed Islamic Group,
known by its French acronym GIA.
</P>
<P>
	   According to documents filed in Montreal courts, Haouari said he fled to
Canada in 1993 because he was wanted by military police in Algeria over his
involvement with the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front. He said he left the
group in 1992 because "it is against my principals and religion to use any form
of violence."
</P>
<P>
	   In denying bail in Montreal Thursday, Judge Jean-Guy Boilard ruled that
evidence indicated Haouari was a member of an Algerian terrorist group and was
involved with Ressam in a plot to bring explosives into the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States "seems to have credible proof implicating the accused,"
the judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The proof that has been revealed satisfies me that he belongs to a
terrorist organization."
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also said Haouari posed a flight risk, given his history of using
false documents and credit card fraud.

<HEADLINE> Safir adds pilot program to DWI seizure policy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In hopes of strengthening its legal case to continue
seizing the cars of drunken drivers, the NYPD has launched a pilot program that
would allow some people to get their cars back after completing an alcohol
treatment program and paying a fine.
<P>
	   The so-called settlement program, launched in late November, was announced
by Police Commissioner Howard Safir on Thursday during testimony before the City
Council's public safety committee about the NYPD's policy of seizing cars of
drunken drivers who are arrested. The policy went into effect in February 1999
and was enacted to prevent DWI-related accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   The seizure policy was roundly criticized by civil liberties advocates who
thought it too harsh to seize someone's car before they were convicted of a
crime. Under the law, the accused driver cannot get his car back unless he's
acquitted, and even then must go through a forfeiture proceeding.
</P>
<P>
	   The entire process can take nearly a year, lawyers have said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the pilot program, there's a glimmer of hope for people to avoid the
court process. So is the NYPD softening its stance on DWI offenders? No, says
George Grasso, the department's deputy commissioner of legal matters.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're trying to modify behavior regarding alcohol abuse in order to reduce
DWI-related accidents, DWI-related injuries and fatalities, save lives and
prevent injuries," Grasso said.
</P>
<P>
	   Grasso also said the pilot program strengthens the NYPD's legal standing. So
far, the DWI seizure program has withstood a challenge in state court and the
appellate division, but is currently being reviewed by the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   To qualify for the settlement program, a driver's blood alcohol level must
have been found to be lower than .20 - .10 is considered legally drunk. Also,
they must not have a significant prior history of driving while intoxicated or
impaired, or have been involved in a serious accident that resulted in injury or
property damage.
</P>
<P>
	   Individual cases are reviewed by the NYPD's civil enforcement unit.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the department has reviewed 380 cases and deemed 100 eligible for
the pilot program, Grasso said. Letters have been sent to those 100 people
explaining the settlement program and so far, the department has heard from 41
recipients expressing interest, Grasso added.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately known what percentage of DWI cases have been
reviewed.
</P>
<P>
	   But the settlement program has not eased the concerns of civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Meyers, director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, said the
pilot program is inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
	   "If people don't have a previous record of driving drunk, he's (the
commissioner) suggesting that this first instance is an indication of
alcoholism," Meyers said. "I certainly don't think it's up to the police
commissioner to become the moral monitor and to be the enforcer of such a law."
</P>
<P>
	   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union,
said the settlement program mitigates the harshness of the DWI seizure policy,
but fails to address the problems of people who are charged and later acquitted.
</P>
<P>
	   Siegel also complained that his client, Pavel Grinberg, was not told about
the settlement program.
</P>
<P>
	   "He fits every one of their tests," Siegel said. "He has no priors, he's
never been arrested for anything. He's a hardworking, conscientious guy."
</P>
<P>
	   It is Grinberg's case that's being considered by the Court of Appeals.

<HEADLINE> McCain: Democracy's stronger in Russia than New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Still fuming over a state GOP effort to remove his name
from New York's presidential primary ballots, Sen. John McCain accused party
leaders Thursday of making New York less democratic than Russia.
<P>
	   McCain, who has chosen not to compete in Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses
on Monday, rode his campaign bus down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan while fellow
presidential hopefuls worked crowds in Des Moines and Ottumwa, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona Republican pressed his fight to appear on ballots in New York's
March 7 primary, telling reporters outside the Russian consulate that voters in
Moscow and St. Petersburg would have a wider choice at the polls in March than
those in the Bronx and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   "In Russia, there will be more than one name on the ballot" in the March 26
presidential election, McCain said. "In New York, unless something happens,
there will be only one name on the ballot. It seems to me that history has been
turned on its head."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, both Texas Gov. George W. Bush and millionaire publisher Steve
Forbes are likely to appear on New York ballots, although others are skipping
the state altogether because of its notoriously stringent ballot requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican leaders have challenged McCain's petitions in 17 of New
York's 31 congressional districts, claiming he failed to obtain the required
number of signatures from party members. McCain is suing to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona state Sen. Scott Bundgaard accused McCain of hypocrisy, saying
McCain himself has used Arizona election laws to push his opponents off the
ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   "McCain went through the same process that the state party is going through
here," Bundgaard said. "If there is such a groundswell of support for John
McCain, then he should have no problems getting enough signatures."
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, McCain challenged the petition signatures of a little known
opponent in the Republican primary for his Senate seat, forcing the opponent to
withdraw from the race. And in 1992, McCain mounted a similar challenge to
petitions filed by another Senate opponent, former Republican Gov. Evan Mecham.
McCain eventually dropped the challenge and handily defeated Mecham.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bundgaard's accusations were untrue and that credible candidates
have never been removed from Arizona ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has hopped up and down the East Coast this week, raising campaign
cash from New York to Boston. He was scheduled to attend a closed fund-raiser
Thursday night at the Greenwich, Conn., home of HBO president John Billock.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Thursday, he talked campaign finance reform before a crowd of 900 at
the South Shore Chamber of Commerce in Randolph, Mass.
</P>
<P>
	   "The special interests have taken over: the trial lawyers, the labor union
bosses, the big corporations," said McCain, one of the Senate's most vehement
advocates of campaign finance reform. "This system is awash in big money that
deprives every one of you of your voice in Washington."
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said after his New York news conference that his attacks on politics
as usual are the reason party leaders oppose him in New York and around the
country. Republican leaders have lined up behind front-runner Bush in state
after state.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anybody who wants the status quo in Washington doesn't want me," McCain
said. "The establishment is threatened by my candidacy and I understand that,
and I respect them all."
</P>
<P>
	   He agreed on one point with Bush, who said Thursday that their campaigns'
public sniping over McCain's tax plan wouldn't weaken the two men's friendship.
</P>
<P>
	   "Of course we are friends," McCain said. "He's a fine man and you're not
going to hear anything negative from me about him. He's a very good man."
</P>
<P>
	   While competitors feverishly wooed Iowans, McCain had his sights set on New
Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary. And he says he's enjoying himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's 12 days, four hours and 37 minutes before the polls close in New
Hampshire," he joked. "But who's counting?"

<HEADLINE> Algerian Terror Suspect Denied Bail  </HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL SANGER
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- An Algerian man facing U.S. terrorism charges was denied
bail in Canada on Thursday after police testified that he coordinated plans to
smuggle explosives into the United States, allegedly to be used in an attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling will keep Mokhtar Haouri, whose last name was previously given as
Haouari, in custody until an extradition hearing March 15.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The proof that has been revealed satisfies me that he belongs to a
terrorist organization,'' said Quebec Superior Court Judge Jean-Guy Boilard.
</P>
<P>
	   Boilard said Haouri, whose claim for refugee status was refused by Canadian
authorities in 1994 and 1995, was only in Canada because of a moratorium on
deportations to Algeria. He has a history in Canada of fabricating official
documents and using fake or stolen credit cards, Boilard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Haouari's lawyer, Joseph Elfassy, said there was no danger of his client
leaving Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why would he flee?'' Elfassy asked. ``The best country for him now is
here.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Montreal shopkeeper was detained Jan. 10 as part of an investigation of
Ahmed Ressam, who was arrested trying to cross from British Columbia into
Washington state. He was charged with carrying explosives.
</P>
<P>
	   Another man, Abdel Ghani Meskini, was arrested in New York City on Dec. 30
after police connected him with Ressam through a phone number scrawled on a
piece of paper. Police suggest the two had planned a terrorist attack, perhaps
timed to coincide with millennial celebrations.
</P>
<P>
	   Meskini, 31, pleaded innocent Thursday in New York to charges of providing
and concealing support for Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony Thursday in Montreal, Royal Canadian Mounted Police
investigator Serge Haineault said Haouri has links to both men and had ordered
Meskini, a childhood friend from Algeria, to meet up with Ressam in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mr. Meskini was supposed to translate for Mr. Ressam, drive him and
provide him with funds,'' said Haineault under questioning from prosecutor
Ronald Schachter.
</P>
<P>
	   Meskini returned to New York after Ressam was picked up at the border, an
event which left Haouri ``very disappointed,'' Haineault testified, citing
information obtained from Meskini.
</P>
<P>
	   Haouri later told Meskini to get rid of his pager and his cell phone, to
change the number of his home phone, and to throw out all documents related to
his trip to Seattle, Haineault said.
</P>
<P>
	   Haineault added that under American police questioning, Meskini said Haouri
is a member of the Islamic Salvation Front, the Algerian political party that
won elections overturned by the military in 1992, and its armed faction, the
G.I.A., which has been fighting a guerrilla war against the army.
</P>
<P>
	   Police connected Ressam with Haouri through a fraudulent credit card found
in Ressam's possession. Haineault testified that in his application form, Ressam
said that he was the manager of Boutique Artisanale Nord-Sud, a small clothing
and jewelry shop owned by Haouri.
</P>
<P>
	   Haouri did not address any of the allegations against him under questioning
by his lawyer. He only said that he posed no risk of flight if the judge granted
him bail.

<HEADLINE> Whitman to boost education funding, will improve college saving  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman's proposed state budget is
expected to include more money for public education and improvements to a
college savings program that has drawn a lukewarm response since she set it up
in 1997.
<P>
	   Whitman's spending plan will call for an increase in direct aid to public
education "approaching" $500 million, spokesman Peter McDonough said. The
increase would be in direct aid to education, and does not include areas such as
school construction, a multibillion dollar issue lawmakers are still attempting
to solve.
</P>
<P>
	   The state budget that passed last June raised public education funding by
about $400 million. Whitman's proposed spending plan will be unveiled Saturday.
The governor will deliver her annual budget address on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said on Thursday that her proposed budget would include a plan to
strengthen her college savings program.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of the ways state government can try to make this a better state for
everyone is by helping families save money for college," Whitman said while
visiting a fourth grade class in North Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman announced her intention to launch a college savings program in
January 1997, but the NJ BEST program didn't draw much of a response from
parents.
</P>
<P>
	   As of February 1999, the program had netted only about 570 investors. New
York, which launched its savings program when New Jersey did, had 17,130
investors at that time. Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, Washington, and West
Virginia - which also all launched their programs around the same time as New
Jersey- had at least double the number of New Jersey subscribers. The New Jersey
program now has about 1,900 investors.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's program works like an individual retirement account. Money
deposited in the NJ BEST account is not tax deductible, but interest earned on
the savings is not federally taxed until the money is withdrawn. At that time,
the earnings may be taxed at the college student's income tax rate, which is
typically lower than their parents' rate.
</P>
<P>
	   But the program wasn't yielding as high an investment as in other states,
and a higher management fee reduced that investment return even more. The return
rate, however, did improve by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said the investment fee will be slashed, and that the new program
will allow savings for younger children to be placed in more aggressive
investments to get a better return on the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Marine Who Refused Anthrax Released  </HEADLINE>
   By KRIS B. MAMULA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A Marine private who refused to finish a series of
anthrax vaccinations has been honorably discharged because his mother was
literally worried sick about the inoculations.
</P>
<P>
	   Pfc. James O'Neil, 22, was discharged Tuesday at the Marine base at
Quantico, Va. He returned to his parents' home in Rochester Mills, Pa., on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother, Martha O'Neil, 46, became distraught about her son's safety
after he received three of the six shots. O'Neil has said his mother's weight
dropped from 180 pounds to 120 pounds because of her fears about the shots,
which she researched on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, O'Neil unsuccessfully asked a federal judge to grant him a
hardship discharge from the Marines.
</P>
<P>
	   Marine spokesman Lt. Col. Scott Campbell said this week's decision to grant
O'Neil an honorable discharge for family hardship was based on medical records
O'Neil submitted about his mother.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was an honorable discharge that rested exclusively on the health of
Mrs. O'Neil,'' Campbell said. ``It was clear her health continued to decline
after the decision was made to excuse him from having to get the remaining
shots.''
</P>
<P>
	   Several Marines and other military personnel have been prosecuted for
refusing the shots, and some reservists have quit to avoid taking them. The
military says they are safe. Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered the vaccine
as a defense against biological warfare.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neil's father, also James O'Neil, said Thursday that the family fears his
son was sickened by the first shots. He said his son has been sleepy and has had
strep throat since Jan. 1, though Mrs. O'Neil said the family has no proof the
symptoms are related to the vaccinations.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton uses White House to push college tax credit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton used the power of the White
House bully pulpit on Thursday to push an issue she is embracing on the campaign
trail in New York - making college tuition more affordable.
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton's appearance on behalf of a plan to make college tuition tax
deductible was her first with the president since she told a Buffalo television
station she planned to spend the rest of her life with him. Speculation has
swirled since the Monica Lewinsky scandal that couple might split up when the
president leaves office.
</P>
<P>
	   But the first couple were unusually affectionate Thursday. Clinton draped
his arm around his wife and, as cameras captured their every move, she leaned
against him and flashed a high-wattage smile.
</P>
<P>
	   The president laughingly allowed that his wife and Sen. Charles Schumer
"lobbied me relentlessly on this for the better part of a year."
</P>
<P>
	   "If you've ever been lobbied by either one of them, you know," Clinton said.
"It's sort of like, 'Are you going to say yes now or put yourself through all
this misery and say yes later?"'
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer, D-N.Y., first began pushing the college tax credit plan during his
successful 1998 bid to oust then-Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. The issue was a popular
one for Schumer, especially among middle-class suburban voters like the ones
Mrs. Clinton must court to win New York's U.S. Senate seat. Mrs. Clinton's poll
numbers have been shaky in the politically-crucial suburbs of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan the president unveiled Thursday closely resembled Schumer's, which
died in Congress last year. The centerpiece is a $10,000 tax deduction to help
millions of Americans pay for tuition and other college costs. A family earning
$120,000 or less annually could receive the full deduction of up for tuition,
fees and job-related training under the Clinton plan once it was phased in by
2003. Taxpayers could seek a maximum credit of $2,800 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is necessary for our children to attend college, it is wrong for them to
graduate with a mountain of debt," said Schumer.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, who has made it clear education will be one of her key
campaign themes, said the college plan could be to the coming generation what
the G.I. Bill was for World War II veterans. She noted that average college
tuition has doubled over the past 20 years, outpacing the median income.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today the challenge in paying for college ... has become a daunting one for
that very same middle class that was really created by the GI bill," Mrs.
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one who wants to improve his or her prospects through education should
have to risk poverty to attain that education," she added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cohen Backs Swede for Iraq Agency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq shouldn't be allowed to dictate who is going to
lead the new U.N. weapons inspection agency, Defense Secretary William Cohen
said Thursday after a meeting with the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen flew to New York on Thursday to express U.S. support for Rolf Ekeus of
Sweden, a former chief Iraq weapons inspector and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's pick to head the new inspection agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Baghdad has questioned the choice, saying Ekeus' association with the
previous U.N. arms inspection agency made him unfit. Iraq's allies on the
Security Council, Russia, China and France, blocked the appointment altogether
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has said Ekeus remains a candidate to head the new agency,
but Security Council members have decided to hold further consultations to try
to find someone all 15 can agree on.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The key to remember is we have to have an effective inspection regime,''
Cohen said. ``We can't allow Iraq to put itself in the position of exercising a
veto over who is going to be chairing or heading that verification and
inspection mission.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ekeus was the executive chairman of the U.N. Special Commission from
1991-1997 before becoming Sweden's U.S. ambassador. There have been no U.N.
weapons inspections in Iraq since arms experts withdrew in December 1998 ahead
of U.S. and British airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Thursday that Cohen and Annan also
discussed troop requirements and financing for African missions in Congo, Angola
and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan has recommended large expansions in the Congo and Sierra Leone
missions. During the meeting, the U.N. chief explained his reasoning and the
funding levels that would be required, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States is billed 31 percent of U.N. peacekeeping costs.

<HEADLINE> First snowstorm brings only a few inches but lots of travel woes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - As snowstorms go, the first this winter didn't pack
much fury, but Thursday's snow and bitter cold were more than enough to leave
roads icy, causing scores of fender-benders and a few more serious accidents.
<P>
	   Parts of two major highways were closed by wrecks, the New Jersey Turnpike
lowered speed limits, and state police urged residents to stay off roads.
</P>
<P>
	   "Driving is extremely treacherous," said New Jersey State Police spokesman
John Hagerty. "Limit driving unless you absolutely have to be out on the
highways."
</P>
<P>
	   The National Weather Service issued a winter storm advisory through early
evening for the state, predicting gusty winds, overnight wind chills as numbing
as 20 degrees below zero and 2 to 6 inches of snow. A windchill advisory
remained in effect through Friday. The weather service also warned that minor
coastal flooding was possible during Thursday evening's high tides as increasing
winds pushed water onshore.
</P>
<P>
	   By early evening, the storm had dumped 2 to 3 inches of snow over most of
northeastern and central New Jersey, 1 to 2 inches over the northwestern part of
the state, and 4 to 6 inches over many southern New Jersey communities.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the roads are that bad," said Cheryl McGuigan, 42, an
assistant mailroom supervisor for the state who lives in Trenton. "The sidewalks
are slippery," though, and she nearly fell while walking outside at lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Lois Vereen, 34, a state Pensions Department employee, said the morning bus
she takes to work from north Trenton was delayed about 30 minutes, but the
weather wasn't bothering her.
</P>
<P>
	   "I expected worse than this," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The turnpike cut its speed limit to 45 mph and banned motorcycles and
car-pulled trailers. But NJ Transit spokesman Ken Miller said its trains and
buses were running "fairly close to schedule," although trains originating in
New York were delayed slightly due to an Amtrak switching problem. One NJ
Transit bus was struck head-on by a sliding car in Bloomfield; the bus driver
was taken to a hospital for examination.
</P>
<P>
	   The region's three major airports - Newark, LaGuardia and Kennedy - reported
delays of between 30 minutes and two hours and some cancellations. Most of those
problems were caused by bad weather in other parts of the country, said Bill
Cahill, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Some businesses closed early, and at least 120 public schools were closed or
sent students home early. McGuire Air Force Base sent its approximately 1,000
civilian personnel - except those considered "weather essential" - home at 2
p.m. and gave commanders of the base's 5,000 active duty military personnel the
option to do the same.
</P>
<P>
	   The Meadowlands Racetrack canceled live racing Thursday because of the
weather.
</P>
<P>
	   The state government, though, didn't send its workers home early or open its
snow emergency center.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jan. 20 storm was the third-latest in central New Jersey with at least
1/10 inch of snow in the last 105 years, according to state climatologist Dave
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were 13 years when the first snowfall didn't come till January," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest snowfall recorded at New Brunswick was Jan. 31, 1921. Robinson
said the storm was far enough east that it would dump most of its snow onto the
ocean, and the storm could sap some of the energy from one expected Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to be another brutally cold day tomorrow," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   In Mercer County, huge stretches of the Delaware River glistened white
through a light fog as snow accumulated atop large sheets of ice.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't so pretty elsewhere, though.
</P>
<P>
	   Hagerty, the state police spokesman, said there were countless
"slip-and-slide accidents" on the state's major highways, including Routes 78,
80 and 278. Route 195 had more than 30 accidents during the morning rush hour
and on the stretch of Route 295 from Trenton to Bellmawr in Camden County, there
were about 40 morning wrecks.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Garden State Parkway in Lakewood, a tanker truck carrying fuel
overturned about 6 a.m., injuring the driver and spilling several hundred
gallons of fuel. An eight-mile stretch between exits 91 and 83 remained closed
13 hours later, and traffic was still backed up 5 miles north of Exit 91 as
motorists waited to get off and detour around the accident.
</P>
<P>
	   On the turnpike, a truck slid off the roadway in East Brunswick shortly
after 10 a.m., temporarily shutting down traffic in the southbound truck lanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, icy roads may have caused an incident on the Atlantic City
Expressway in Winslow Township. About 8 a.m., 12 cars on both the eastbound and
westbound sides lost control and ended up on the median and the westbound
shoulder, according to Peter Hartt, a spokesman for the South Jersey
Transportation Authority, which operates the 44-mile toll road.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wouldn't call it a pileup," he said. "I'd call it a scatter."
</P>
<P>
	   The island community of Brigantine had its only access road cut off for 2
1/2 hours Thursday after a weather-related fender-bender, police said. The
accident on the Brigantine Bridge - which links Brigantine with Atlantic City -
occurred about 12 noon and the span was closed until 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Department of Transportation crews hit major roads as early as 5 a.m.
Thursday, spreading salt and monitoring road conditions, according to department
spokesman Jim Berzok. Once snow began to accumulate, about 565 workers operating
463 pieces of equipment - mostly snowplows - began clearing roads.
</P>
<P>
	   Berzok said the biggest problems likely would come at night, when a dramatic
temperature drop was expected to add to icing on roadways. He said the
department probably would keep road crews on into the evening, after the
anticipated end of the snowfall around 7 p.m., and some crews might continue
salting and sanding roads overnight.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs $2.2M Deal for Inmates  </HEADLINE>
   By DANA FIELDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A class-action lawsuit filed after videotaped
shakedowns in which Texas jail guards beat and kicked prisoners has ended with a
$2.2 million settlement for the inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement affects 2,100 inmates from Missouri who were sent to
privately run jails in Texas from 1995 through 1997 because of overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
	   The inmates will share $1.12 million, with individual portions based on the
severity of injuries. The rest of the money will cover attorneys' fees and legal
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Nanette K. Laughrey approved the settlement Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Capitol Corrections Resources Inc., the company that ran the jails, will
contribute $2.1 million. The rest will come from other defendants, including the
company that transported the Missourians to Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The state of Missouri admitted no liability and will not contribute to the
settlement. The state did agree to a five-year moratorium on sending prisoners
to Texas or to any CCRI-run jails anywhere except in very narrow circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the inmates contend Missouri officials ignored credible reports of
their treatment in Texas, and acted only after the public broadcasts of
videotapes showing prisoners being bitten by guard dogs and shocked with stun
guns.
</P>
<P>
	   The videotapes were made by deputies for training purposes on Sept. 18,
1996, at Texas' Brazoria County Jail and on March 2, 1997, in Gregg County.

<HEADLINE> Bush Delays Affirmative Action Ban  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID MARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A 25-hour sit-in at the lieutenant governor's
office by two black lawmakers persuaded Gov. Jeb Bush to delay his ban on
affirmative action, but the protest probably won't derail the plan altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. Kendrick Meek and Rep. Tony Hill, both Democrats, ended their
protest Wednesday when the Republican governor agreed to postpone by a month
Friday's scheduled meeting of the Board of Regents, the state university
system's governing board.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel was expected to formally approve the plan, which would eliminate
race as a factor in university admissions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be unlikely to be any different at this point,'' said Keith
Goldschmidt, Board of Regents spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Meek and Hill had demanded that Bush rescind his November executive order
banning affirmative action in university admissions and contracting decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor's plan guarantees admission to some state universities to the
top 20 percent of each Florida high school's graduating class, adds $20 million
to the state's financial aid budget and makes it easier for minority businesses
to be certified to work across the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush refused to take back the executive order, but he did agree to hold
hearings and make a ``good-faith review'' of Meek and Hill's recommendations on
how to improve the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's already said the plan isn't perfect, and we're going to bring some
recommendations,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
	   Without the sit-in, Meek said, ``The Board of Regents would have rammed this
down the people's throats.''

<HEADLINE> Fire Prompts Univ To Eye Sprinklers  </HEADLINE>
   By AMY WESTFELDT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- A day after fire broke out in a college dormitory
lounge, killing three college students and injured 62, Gov. Christie Whitman
said she would consider legislation requiring sprinkler systems in college
dorms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think you could put a price tag on human life,'' she said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall University will consider ``anything that we can all do to make
sure that something like this never, ever happens again,'' school spokeswoman
Lisa Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   She added that the university would look into installing sprinklers in
six-story Boland Hall, where the fire started early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the six people who remained hospitalized Thursday, four remained in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Essex County Prosecutor Donald Campolo disputed a published report that
investigators had eliminated careless smoking and electrical problems as
possible causes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are ruling out nothing at this juncture,'' Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to comment on a story in The Star-Ledger of Newark that
investigators were seeking three young men whom a resident assistant had asked
to leave the building less than an hour before the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
	   Students at the Roman Catholic university continued to question how well the
university is prepared for fire, including its handling of a chronic string of
false alarms at Boland Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Grider said on Thursday that in one of those cases, a fire was found in a
Dumpster near the dormitory, but the others were false.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I first heard the alarm, I thought `I'm not leaving,''' said Marissa
Lorenz, an 18-year-old who was released from the hospital on Thursday. ``I mean,
there are so many alarms.''
</P>
<P>
	   Several students said sprinklers should be installed in all of Seton Hall's
six dormitories. Two of the dormitories, Boland Hall and Aquinas Hall, don't
have sprinkler systems because they were built before such systems were required
by law. The dormitories are the only two that house freshmen.
</P>
<P>
	   A fire alarm rang Thursday morning at the upperclassmen dorm Xavier Hall,
causing the evacuation of nearly 200 students. Grider said she didn't know the
cause.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I got up real quick for this one,'' said Guerschom Nazaire, a 20-year-old
junior.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the university's 10,000 students left campus following the fire.
Classes were canceled until Monday. Only two spent the night in a recreation
center where makeshift beds were created, Grider said. Many stayed with
upperclassmen or went home.

<HEADLINE> Advocates say what mayor calls help can actually harm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - As the number of homeless people in the city has risen
in recent months, the Giuliani administration has implemented a series of
policies to get people off streets and into treatment programs.
<P>
	   But despite the good intentions, homeless advocates say the mayor is doing
little more than driving additional people out on the street during the coldest
time of the year. The advocates' most recent ammunition: A sweep early Wednesday
in which police arrested at least 125 people seeking shelter from the
20-below-zero wind-chill.
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates and some politicians fear the raids - which occurred at 4 a.m. in
at least seven shelters citywide - will mean that at least some of the city's
22,586 people who seek shelter each night will simply avoid help in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, at least two homeless people have died in the city from
overexposure during the recent cold snap.
</P>
<P>
	   "The administration seems to be giving homeless people an ultimatum: Freeze
or face jail," Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields said Thursday.
"There will undoubtedly be some people who will be afraid to go to shelters and
will be in grave danger of freezing to death."
</P>
<P>
	   The Police Department has released few details about the Wednesday morning
raid, but most of those arrested appear to have had outstanding bench warrants
for minor violations, including public urination.
</P>
<P>
	   "They can't be treated any differently than anybody else," Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no immunity in the law that says if you are homeless, you then get
away with committing a crime."
</P>
<P>
	   He said police made the shelter arrests because the homeless people were
suspected of violating various laws, and further, that the arrests will help
make shelters safer.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here's the reality the advocates have to face: 'There are some homeless
people that are criminals. Not all. Not most. Not a majority," said Giuliani. "I
can't ignore that. I'm the mayor of the city. I can't ignore the fact that among
homeless people are some dangerous criminals and some, not so dangerous, but
still criminals."
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates however, say they are particularly concerned by the raids because
they come after two other highly publicized initiatives: A city plan to deny
shelter to able-bodied, mentally stable homeless people who refuse to work; and
a crackdown that rounded people up off the street, and led to the arrests of
those who were uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
	   The work-for-shelter requirement - which is being held up in court - has a
provision that allows the city to take children away from parents who refuse to
comply with the rules. A judge would have to approve the removal of any children
from families.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has more recently sought to explain his initiatives as
"compassionate" and "loving."
</P>
<P>
	   Advocates however, say that without adequate housing and drug treatment
programs, the policies are cruel.
</P>
<P>
	   They also note that the number of homeless people being placed in permanent
housing is down.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1990s, the city and state funded an initiative which built 5,000
units of housing for low income city residents. A subsequent agreement however,
calls for building only 1,500 units over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
	   After several years of declining homelessness, advocates say the number of
needy is back on the rise.
</P>
<P>
	   The middle-of-the-night raid to arrest minor offenders, say advocates, only
makes matters worse.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is part of a series of very punitive policies on the part of the
Giuliani administration," said Patrick Markee, senior policy analyst for the
Coalition for the Homeless.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani however, said quality-of-life offenses cannot be ignored.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Name KKK Road for Parks  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A state lawmaker embarrassed by the Ku Klux
Klan's participation in Missouri's Adopt-A-Highway program wants to rename the
Klan-sponsored stretch of highway for the civil rights hero Rosa Parks.
</P>
<P>
	   Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a Montgomery, Ala., bus in 1955 was a
turning point in the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To have the Klan clean up a section of highway named to honor the woman
who started the modern civil rights movement -- I love it,'' said state Sen.
Bill Clay Jr., the black Democrat from St. Louis who offered the legislation
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Klan won the right to participate in the highway cleanup program last
fall after years of fighting the Department of Transportation in court. A
federal appellate judge, citing the First Amendment, ruled in November that the
state cannot bar the Klan from participating.
</P>
<P>
	   Signs on both ends of a portion of Interstate 55 south of downtown St. Louis
now read, ``Next mile adopted by Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Realm of
Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
	   Michael A. Cuffley, who led the Klan's legal fight to adopt the road and is
wanted on felony burglary charges in St. Louis County, could not be reached for
comment. The Klan's national director, Thomas Robb, who helped Cuffley in the
fight to join the Adopt-A-Highway program, did not immediately return a call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Missouri Department of Transportation said the Klan's
participation still could be rescinded because, to the state's knowledge, no
Klan members have gone to the site to clean it up. The program's rules require
each group adopting a stretch of highway to collect litter at least four times
annually to remain in the program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they're not holding up their end of the bargain, then that would be
grounds for us removing them from the program,'' said department spokesman Jeff
Briggs.
</P>
<P>
	   Clay's bill, which now heads to a Senate committee for discussion, has
bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous highway name changes in Missouri, including those for St. Louis
Cardinals home run king Mark McGwire and Kansas City Royals Hall of Famer George
Brett, breezed through the Legislature.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Suffers More Heart Episodes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT PLEASANT, Iowa (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley
said Thursday he has suffered four irregular heartbeat episodes since he first
disclosed his non-life threatening condition more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who did not say when the episodes occurred, said he would only make
them public if they required him to seek a doctor's opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has no affect on the race,'' Bradley said at an impromptu news
conference where aides permitted only a few questions. He said the episodes are
``regular and predictable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley conceded that four episodes in a month is more frequent than he's
used to, but he rejected suggestions that it was related to the stress of the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The disclosure came just days before the first voting of the presidential
year with Bradley competing in the Iowa caucuses against Vice President Al Gore,
who is the front-runner there.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's campaign chairman, Doug Berman, said no treatment was needed and
that Bradley's campaign schedule had not been interrupted.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign decided not to make the episodes public unless Bradley sees a
doctor ``because it's a non-event. The fact is it doesn't in any way interfere
with his schedule. He goes forward, He has his full regular schedule so there's
nothing to report.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's press secretary, Eric Hauser, did not know offhand when the
condition reoccurred, but he said more information would be provided later
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was examined in a hospital last month for an irregular heartbeat --
a chronic condition for which he takes daily medication and dismissed as ``just
a nuisance.'' Doctors found no other heart problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is just one of those things, it's there, you live with it, it's no
problem whatsoever. It is common, it is something that doesn't affect my daily
activities,'' Bradley, 56, said at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley campaign released the information after ABC News asked whether
the condition had reoccurred, and the campaign said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had faced a barrage of questions about his heart condition last
month, in part because he had not revealed the long-standing condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley takes four doses of an anti-arrhythmic drug called Procanbid twice a
day. The irregular heartbeat almost never occurs when he regularly takes the
medicine, Bradley said.

York's presidential primary ballots, Sen. John McCain accused party leaders
Thursday of making New York less democratic than Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain stood outside the Russian consulate and declared that voters in
Moscow and St. Petersburg have a wider choice at the polls in March than those
in the Bronx and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Russia, there will be more than one name on the ballot'' in the March
26 presidential election, McCain said. ``In New York, unless something happens,
there will be only one name on the ballot. It seems to me that history has been
turned on its head.''
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, both George W. Bush and Steve Forbes have secured places on the
ballot for the March 7 Republican primary while others are skipping the state
because of what some say are New York's excessively stringent requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   New York could be an important state if McCain upsets Bush in the New
Hampshire primary Feb 1. Most public polls show the two in a statistical dead
heat, though McCain's pollsters believe his lead is in the high single digits.
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican leaders have challenged McCain's petitions in 17 of New
York's 31 congressional districts, claiming he failed to obtain the required
number of signatures from party members. The Arizona senator is suing in an
effort to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   At a separate news conference here, Arizona state Sen. Scott Bundgaard
accused McCain of hypocrisy, saying McCain himself had used Arizona election
laws in 1988 and 1992 to force his opponents off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``McCain went through the same process that the state party is going through
here,'' Bundgaard said. ``If there is such a groundswell of support for John
McCain, then he should have no problems getting enough signatures.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bundgaard's accusations were untrue and that credible candidates
have never been removed from Arizona ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain in New York and Bush in Iowa resolved to maintain their friendship
despite the ballot dispute and sometimes-bitter attacks on each other's tax
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's my friend during the campaign and he's darn sure going to be my
friend after the campaign,'' Bush said, stressing that a TV ad criticizing
McCain's tax package was not a personal attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course we are friends,'' McCain agreed. ``He's a fine man and you're
not going to hear anything negative from me about him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yet their campaigns continued to scrap.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush camp rounded up half a dozen business leaders and accountants who
said McCain's plan to close supposed loopholes in the tax code would hurt
companies large and small and especially those using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain camp responded that Bush was catering to corporate interests
instead of the average taxpayers who would gain if excessive tax breaks were
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
	   Executives from several high-technology firms, in a conference call arranged
by Bush aides, complained to reporters specifically about McCain's proposed
changes in the way advertising expenses are deducted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would add millions to their tax bills,'' said Floyd Kvamme, a partner
in Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield, and Byers, a Silicon Valley firm that raises
money for Internet start-ups. He cast the idea as the ``first substantial tax
increase for the Internet'' even though it would affect all advertisers.
</P>
<P>
	   That was a swing at McCain's pledge to turn an existing moratorium on
Internet sales taxes into a permanent ban.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is proposing to spread out the deduction, having companies take 80
percent in the year the ad costs are incurred and the rest over four years.
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign said the plan simply accords advertising the same treatment as
some other business expenses: When they provide a benefit that lasts for more
than a year, the deduction is spread over more than a year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By closing more than 60 corporate loopholes, John McCain is able to move
more than 25 million middle-class Americans into the 15 percent tax bracket,''
his campaign said in a statement. ``By caving to the demands of the special
interests who have funded his campaign, Governor Bush would prevent those
millions of taxpayers from receiving necessary tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
	   The executives who spoke against the McCain plan said companies would end up
taking deductions several years after the product they advertised became
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
	   After advocating campaign finance reform before a Chamber of Commerce crowd
of 900 in Randolph, Mass., McCain said in New York his attacks on politics as
usual are the reason party leaders oppose him here and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anybody who wants the status quo in Washington doesn't want me,'' McCain
said. ``The establishment is threatened by my candidacy and I understand that,
and I respect them all.''

<HEADLINE> NJ Gov Considers Dorm Sprinkler Law  </HEADLINE>
   By AMY WESTFELDT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- A day after a dorm fire killed three college
students, Gov. Christie Whitman said she would consider legislation requiring
sprinkler systems in all college dormitories.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think you could put a price tag on human life,'' the governor said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sprinklers weren't required when Boland Hall was built 48 years ago at Seton
Hall University, where a fire early Wednesday killed three students and injured
62 people. Sprinklers have been required in dorms built since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall will consider ``anything that we can all do to make sure that
something like this never, ever happens again,'' said school spokeswoman Lisa
Grider, including installing sprinklers in the six-story dorm.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the six people who remained hospitalized Thursday, four remained in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Essex County Prosecutor Donald Campolo disputed a published report that
investigators had eliminated careless smoking and electrical problems as
possible causes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are ruling out nothing at this juncture,'' Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to comment on a story in The Star-Ledger of Newark that
investigators were seeking three young men whom a resident assistant had asked
to leave the building less than an hour before the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
	   Students at the Roman Catholic university continued to question how well the
university is prepared for fire, including its handling of a chronic string of
false alarms at Boland Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Grider said on Thursday that in one case, a fire was found in a Dumpster
near the dormitory, but the others were false.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I first heard the alarm, I thought `I'm not leaving,''' said Marissa
Lorenz, an 18-year-old who was released from the hospital on Thursday. ``I mean,
there are so many alarms.''
</P>
<P>
	   Several students said sprinklers should be installed in all of Seton Hall's
six dormitories. Only the two freshmen dormitories -- Boland Hall and Aquinas
Hall -- don't have sprinkler systems.
</P>
<P>
	   A fire alarm Thursday morning resulted in the evacuation of the
upperclassmen dorm Xavier Hall. Grider said she didn't know the cause.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I got up real quick for this one,'' said Guerschom Nazaire, a 20-year-old
junior.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes were canceled until Monday for the school's 10,000 students. Only
two spent the night in a recreation center where makeshift beds were created,
Grider said. Many stayed with upperclassmen or went home.

<HEADLINE> Year's first snowfall causes minor problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The snow fell softly, blanketing the metropolitan area
with its first white coat of winter Thursday - a seasonal postcard that
threatened to wreak some havoc overnight before slipping north into New England.
<P>
	   Forecasters warned that up to eight inches of snow could land on eastern
Long Island, with the city getting up to five inches. Dropping temperatures and
whipping winds, with wind chill readings of 10- to 20-below zero, could also
cause icy roads by Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Thursday evening, there were only scattered problems, and a
relatively normal rush hour. In the northern suburbs, barely one inch was on the
ground; in Central Park, it was 2.5 inches, with 2 inches reported in Plainview,
on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's amazing how people panic with a little snow," said Marcia Bayer, who
was headed south from the Tarrytown train station for a Manhattan shopping
excursion. "This is nothing."
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the region's three major airports - LaGuardia and Newark - reported
delays of between 90 minutes and three hours and some cancellations Thursday
evening. Flights were delayed at Kennedy earlier in the day but were back to
normal by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
	   Port Authority spokesman Bill Cahill said most of those problems were caused
by bad weather in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
	   In the city, trucks began scattering salt at 6 a.m. and quickly dumped more
than 5,000 tons across the five boroughs. There were also 1,000 heat complaints
called in by chilly tenants on Thursday, said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   On Long Island, a wildcat sick-out by state Department of Transportation
workers left local authorities struggling to keep streets clean and ice-free. At
least 300 of a scheduled 440 drivers, snow plow operators, warehouse workers and
mechanics called in sick.
</P>
<P>
	   The job action, prompted by contract talks stalled since April, was
"completely irresponsible," said state DOT spokesman Michael Fleischer. "The
workers have put the health and safety of Long Island motorists in jeopardy."
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki agreed, ordering the state attorney general to seek a
court order requiring an immediate return to work. "We will meet this ... with
swift and severe action," Pataki promised.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Madarasz, spokesman for the 77,000-member Civil Service Employees
Association, said union shop stewards had called snow plow drivers and urged
their return to work. The union had no knowledge of the sick-out, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of the usual 200 snowplows on the job in Long Island, there were
only 40 to 50 on the roads, Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Scattered school delays and early closings were also reported in suburbs in
Westchester and Rockland counties and Long Island, but nothing widespread.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Name KKK Road for Parks  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A state lawmaker embarrassed by the Ku Klux
Klan's participation in Missouri's Adopt-A-Highway program wants to rename the
Klan-sponsored stretch of highway for the civil rights hero Rosa Parks.
</P>
<P>
	   Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a Montgomery, Ala., bus in 1955 was a
turning point in the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To have the Klan clean up a section of highway named to honor the woman
who started the modern civil rights movement -- I love it,'' said state Sen.
Bill Clay Jr., the black Democrat from St. Louis who offered the legislation
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Klan won the right to participate in the highway cleanup program last
fall after years of fighting the Department of Transportation in court. A
federal appellate court, citing the First Amendment, ruled in November that the
state cannot bar the Klan from participating.
</P>
<P>
	   Signs on both ends of a portion of Interstate 55 south of downtown St. Louis
now read, ``Next mile adopted by Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Realm of
Missouri.'' The signs were stolen the day after they were erected, however, and
haven't been replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael A. Cuffley, who led the Klan's legal fight to adopt the road and is
wanted on felony burglary charges in St. Louis County, could not be reached for
comment. The Klan's national director, Thomas Robb, who helped Cuffley in the
fight to join the Adopt-A-Highway program, did not immediately return a call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Missouri Department of Transportation said the Klan's
participation still could be rescinded because, to the state's knowledge, no
Klan members have gone to the site to clean it up. The program's rules require
each group adopting a stretch of highway to collect litter at least four times
annually to remain in the program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If they're not holding up their end of the bargain, then that would be
grounds for us removing them from the program,'' said department spokesman Jeff
Briggs.
</P>
<P>
	   Clay's bill, which now heads to a Senate committee for discussion, has
bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous highway name changes in Missouri, including those for St. Louis
Cardinals home run king Mark McGwire and Kansas City Royals Hall of Famer George
Brett, breezed through the Legislature.

<HEADLINE> Radio Host Accused of Slander  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- A newspaper reporter is suing a radio station host for
$25,000, accusing him of slandering her by falsely saying she was having a
relationship with her boss.
</P>
<P>
	   Sandra Svoboda said WVKS-FM host Denny Schaffer made defamatory statements
about her on the air to discredit her employer, The Blade.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit filed Thursday, which also alleges invasion of privacy and
infliction of emotional distress, also names Clear Channel Communications Inc.,
the station's parent company, as a defendant.
</P>
<P>
	   Andy Stuart, vice president and market manager for Clear Channel's Toledo
stations, said he could not comment. A message seeking comment was left for
Schaffer at the station. His home telephone is not listed.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaffer, according to the lawsuit, said several times in October that
Svoboda was dating the newspaper's co-publisher and editor-in-chief, John
Robinson Block. Svoboda said that is false.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blade in September sued WSPD-AM, another Clear Channel station in
Toledo, accusing it of using the newspaper's stories on the air without
crediting the newspaper or obtaining permission.
</P>
<P>
	   Svoboda's attorney said the newspaper was not involved in her lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   Svoboda covers higher education for the Blade and previously worked as a
writer and editor at The Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Court Iowa Voters  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- A year before the next presidential inauguration, a
bickering band of White House candidates crisscrossed the state Thursday to
rally supporters for their first election test. The top Republicans tangled over
abortion in the runup to Iowa's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   In a rare convergence of nearly the entire presidential field, the Iowa air
echoed with incrimination after Republican front-runner George W. Bush was asked
what he would do if a relative was raped and was considering abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would hope I would be able to evoke enough sympathy in a rape case to
help comfort her as a friend. It's up to her,'' said Bush, who reiterated that
he is opposed to abortion except in case of rape, incest and when the mother's
life is in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   Four of his words -- ``It's up to her'' -- were seized upon by rival Steve
Forbes as evidence that Bush is not committed to eliminating abortion. ``I think
it's part of a pattern where he is not willing to truly fight for the life
issue. It's part of a pattern that demonstrates, I think, that he's abandoned
the fight,'' Forbes said in a telephone interview from his campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Bill Bradley said he is the only candidate willing
to take ``the risk of leadership'' on issues such as health care reform. Vice
President Al Gore, gaining steam against Bradley, accused his sole rival of
showing disrespect to the caucus system.
</P>
<P>
	   On a personal note, the former New Jersey senator confirmed that he has
suffered four irregular heartbeat episodes since the non-life threatening
condition was revealed more than a month ago. Though he dismisses the condition
as ``just a nuisance,'' a presidential candidate doesn't want to be answering
questions about his health four days before an election.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iowa contest is raw grassroots politics: About 10 percent of the state's
1.8 million registered voters gather in living rooms, schools, churches and even
grain elevators to announce their support of candidates in full view of friends
and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Though technically designed to pick county delegates in a process that ends
with the presidential conventions, the caucuses are an early barometer of
campaign organizations. Momentum is gained and lost in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   The love affair is brief: Within hours of the vote, the candidates and their
entourages flee Iowa to prepare for New Hampshire's primary eight days later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Iowa is the center of the political universe right now,'' said Republican
consultant Scott Reed.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven of the eight major Republican and Democratic presidential candidates
will compete Monday, hoping for a jump start down the road that ends with the
Jan. 20, 2001 presidential inauguration. Arizona Sen. John McCain bypassed the
caucuses to focus on New Hampshire, though he has a huge stake in the Iowa
results.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has led Forbes by about 20 points in most polls, a margin he may have
to sustain to claim momentum for his dead heat race against McCain in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Confident of his chances, Bush didn't bother to mention McCain or Forbes in
his main speech. A question-and-answer session prompted him to say that
President Clinton's impeachment left him ``embarrassed for our country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, however, said he doesn't discuss the issue on the stump because
``we're moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes needs to narrow Bush's lead in polls to get a boost into New
Hampshire, said Reed and other analysts. Courting conservative voters, Forbes
toured a center that counsels against abortion. ``On the issue of (abortion),
Governor Bush and Senator McCain are pacifists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservative millionaire opposes abortion, with the sole exception being
when the mother's life is at risk.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the governor's response to the question
about a raped relative ``is consistent with his long-stated position. He is
opposed to abortion except in the case of rape, incest and the life of the
mother. He's pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
	   With Forbes on the attack and reporters' peppering him about abortion, Bush
issued what may be his clearest denunciation of the Supreme Court ruling that
legalized abortion. ``Roe vs. Wade was a reach. (It) overstepped the
constitutional bounds as far as I'm concerned,'' said Bush, who appeared irked
at the intensity of abortion questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes said he picks up ``hesitancy'' in Bush's replies. ``You saw it in his
unwillingness to pledge to select pro-life running mate,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Public polls show Bradley trailing Gore by about 25 percentage points in
Iowa. Winning by a such a large margin could help Gore separate from Bradley in
New Hampshire, where polls show the pair locked in a tie.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has hammered away at Bradley's health care plan and agriculture record,
attacks the former New Jersey senator said has hurt his standing in polls. ``To
a certain extent, voters might be persuaded by that,'' Bradley told reporters
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to lower expectations, Bradley said the vice president has a huge
advantage Monday because Iowa is a state that favors ``entrenched power.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore suggested the comment was an insult to the caucus system.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Fighting for people is what the Iowa caucuses is all about,'' Gore said at
a campaign stop in Council Bluffs. ``Fighting to reduce the high cost of
pharmaceuticals. Fighting to save Medicare. That's not entrenched power. That is
fighting for people.''
</P>
<P>
	   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
	   --Bush said he was attacking McCain's tax plan in a TV ad, not the senator
himself. ``He's my friend during the campaign and he's darn sure going to be my
friend after the campaign,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   --Bradley released two new TV ads with Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., and former
Boston Celtic star Bill Russell praising him.
</P>
<P>
	   --Bauer said Forbes has stolen his issues and words. ``He has purloined my
rhetoric,'' the conservative activist said.

<HEADLINE> Papers Have Gov't Anti-Drug Ad Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Television networks are not the only media that have
advertising credit agreements with the White House drug policy office.
Newspapers and magazines also benefit from the program.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1997 law set aside $1 billion over five years for the agency to buy
anti-drug ads and commercials in media outlets around the country. The media are
then required to provide something tangible in return, such as discounts on the
ads or additional free advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   Networks that took the paid ads agreed to fill their obligation by inserting
anti-drug messages in popular shows like ``ER'' and ``Home Improvement,'' and
they recently came under criticism when it was disclosed that they allowed the
drug office to review the scripts before they aired.
</P>
<P>
	   The 250 newspapers that accept the drug office's ads typically meet their
obligation by providing discounts. Some papers, including The Washington Post,
fulfill part of their requirement by posting free anti-drug ads on their Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This, as far as the Post is concerned, was an advertiser coming to the
Post to purchase ads,'' Post spokeswoman Linda Erdos said Wednesday. ``It was
treated no differently than we would have treated any company coming to us.''
</P>
<P>
	   The drug office gave The New York Times $100,000 to produce 30,000 booklets
under its Newspapers in Education program to help teachers deal with drug abuse
questions. The information was also posted on the Times Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   The office announced this week that it would no longer review TV scripts
prior to the shows being aired.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are mandated under law to do the program,'' said Bob Weiner, a
spokesman for the office. ``We have never told the television networks or
newspapers what to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   The office plans to spend $11 million this year on newspaper advertising and
another $9 million for ads in magazines such as Time, People and Family Circle.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fuming over a state GOP effort to remove his name from New
York's presidential primary ballots, Sen. John McCain accused party leaders
Thursday of making New York less democratic than Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain stood outside the Russian consulate and declared that voters in
Moscow and St. Petersburg have a wider choice at the polls in March than those
in the Bronx and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Russia, there will be more than one name on the ballot'' in the March
26 presidential election, McCain said. ``In New York, unless something happens,
there will be only one name on the ballot. It seems to me that history has been
turned on its head.''
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, both George W. Bush and Steve Forbes have secured places on the
ballot for the March 7 Republican primary while others are skipping the state
because of what some say are New York's excessively stringent requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   New York could be an important state if McCain upsets Bush in the New
Hampshire primary Feb 1. Most public polls show the two in a statistical dead
heat, though McCain's pollsters believe his lead is in the high single digits.
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican leaders have challenged McCain's petitions in 17 of New
York's 31 congressional districts, claiming he failed to obtain the required
number of signatures from party members. The Arizona senator is suing in an
effort to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   At a separate news conference here, Arizona state Sen. Scott Bundgaard
accused McCain of hypocrisy, saying McCain himself had used Arizona election
laws in 1998 and 1992 to force his opponents off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``McCain went through the same process that the state party is going through
here,'' Bundgaard said. ``If there is such a groundswell of support for John
McCain, then he should have no problems getting enough signatures.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Bundgaard's accusations were untrue and that credible candidates
have never been removed from Arizona ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain in New York and Bush in Iowa resolved to maintain their friendship
despite the ballot dispute and sometimes-bitter attacks on each other's tax
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's my friend during the campaign and he's darn sure going to be my
friend after the campaign,'' Bush said, stressing that a TV ad criticizing
McCain's tax package was not a personal attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course we are friends,'' McCain agreed. ``He's a fine man and you're
not going to hear anything negative from me about him.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yet their campaigns continued to scrap.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush camp rounded up half a dozen business leaders and accountants who
said McCain's plan to close supposed loopholes in the tax code would hurt
companies large and small and especially those using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain camp responded that Bush was catering to corporate interests
instead of the average taxpayers who would gain if excessive tax breaks were
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
	   Executives from several high-technology firms, in a conference call arranged
by Bush aides, complained to reporters specifically about McCain's proposed
changes in the way advertising expenses are deducted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would add millions to their tax bills,'' said Floyd Kvamme, a partner
in Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield, and Byers, a Silicon Valley firm that raises
money for Internet start-ups. He cast the idea as the ``first substantial tax
increase for the Internet'' even though it would affect all advertisers.
</P>
<P>
	   That was a swing at McCain's pledge to turn an existing moratorium on
Internet sales taxes into a permanent ban.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is proposing to spread out the deduction, having companies take 80
percent in the year the ad costs are incurred and the rest over four years.
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign said the plan simply accords advertising the same treatment as
some other business expenses: When they provide a benefit that lasts for more
than a year, the deduction is spread over more than a year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``By closing more than 60 corporate loopholes, John McCain is able to move
more than 25 million middle-class Americans into the 15 percent tax bracket,''
his campaign said in a statement. ``By caving to the demands of the special
interests who have funded his campaign, Governor Bush would prevent those
millions of taxpayers from receiving necessary tax relief.''
</P>
<P>
	   The executives who spoke against the McCain plan said companies would end up
taking deductions several years after the product they advertised became
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
	   After advocating campaign finance reform before a Chamber of Commerce crowd
of 900 in Randolph, Mass., McCain said in New York his attacks on politics as
usual are the reason party leaders oppose him here and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anybody who wants the status quo in Washington doesn't want me,'' McCain
said. ``The establishment is threatened by my candidacy and I understand that,
and I respect them all.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Suffers More Heart Episodes  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOUNT PLEASANT, Iowa (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley
said Thursday he has suffered four irregular heartbeat episodes since he first
disclosed his non-life threatening condition more than a month ago. The latest
reoccurrence was on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he would only make the episodes public if they required him to
seek a doctor's attention, and he dismissed any notion that the problem might
hamper his presidential bid. His campaign schedule had not been interrupted by
the irregular heartbeat, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has absolutely no impact on the race or my capacity to have a schedule
or the intensity of campaigning,'' Bradley said at an impromptu news conference
where he took only a few questions.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the episodes are ``regular and predictable,'' although he conceded
that four episodes in a month is more than he's used to. ``It's more frequent
than I've had in the past. ... What you feel is your heart starts to beat
faster. It's been pretty regular,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The timing of the disclosure couldn't be more awkward, coming just days
before the first voting of the presidential year with Bradley competing in the
Iowa caucuses on Monday against Vice President Al Gore, who is the front-runner
there.
</P>
<P>
	   When his heart condition was first disclosed on Dec. 10, Bradley faced a
barrage of questions about his health, in part because he had not revealed the
condition he's had since 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked Thursday night why he choose not to disclose the latest episodes,
Bradley bristled, saying, ``Because I didn't think we needed to disclose it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``You don't want me to go around disclosing every time I flip out for an
hour, or two hours,'' he said. ``If I have to see a doctor or if there has to be
any medical attention given to it you will hear about it immediately. Otherwise
it's just the nature of the particular situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campaign aide Anita Dunn said Bradley had not seen a doctor, but had
contacted his doctors about the episodes, which began shortly after Christmas,
around Dec. 26-28. The most recent occurrences came on Jan. 6, Jan. 9 and on
Sunday, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were all of very short duration,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley takes four doses of an anti-arrhythmic drug called Procanbid twice a
day and the irregular heartbeat almost never occurs when he regularly takes the
medicine, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dunn said doctors are ``not sure why'' he's experiencing irregular
heartbeats, but have voiced no concern and have not recommended any change in
medication.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's campaign chairman, Doug Berman, said the campaign decided not to
make the episodes public unless Bradley sees a doctor ``because it's a
non-event.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact is it doesn't in any way interfere with his schedule,'' Berman
said. ``He goes forward. He has his full regular schedule so there's nothing to
report.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was examined in a hospital last month for an irregular heartbeat --
a chronic condition that he previously has dismissed as ``just a nuisance.''
Doctors found no other heart problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is just one of those things, it's there, you live with it, it's no
problem whatsoever. It is common, it is something that doesn't effect my daily
activities,'' Bradley, 56, said at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley campaign released the information after ABC News asked whether
the condition had reoccurred.

<HEADLINE> First Big Winter Storm Wallops East  </HEADLINE>
   By BOB MILLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Winter delivered its first major wallop to parts of the East on Thursday,
tangling air and ground traffic, closing scores of schools and dropping blankets
of snow on roads that until now hadn't seen a dusting.
</P>
<P>
	   The powerful, blustery storm blew through the eastern half of the nation
like a freezing pendulum, swinging down from the upper Midwest, crossing the
Appalachians and then scooting up the coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The thick, white coating it left behind -- starting with 9 inches in
Minnesota on Wednesday and continuing with up to 8 inches in West Virginia by
Thursday -- closed schools and caused several fender-benders.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only complaint I have is that people don't know how to drive in it,''
said Lisa DeCicco of Philadelphia, which had about 2 inches of snow by Thursday
evening. ``It took me two hours to get to work today, and that's really
aggravating when there's almost nothing on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
	   Delaware Gov. Thomas Carper canceled his State of the State address, and
schools were closed across Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland and parts of West
Virginia. Hampton Roads, Va., received more snow Thursday than in the last three
winters combined.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm just going to dig it out,'' said Rhoda Helmintoller, who cleared the
snow from in front of her apartment in Hagerstown, Md., before tackling the
slushy buildup on her car. ``I've got to bowl tonight. I don't like to drive in
it, but you've got to do something when it snows.''
</P>
<P>
	   Airline passengers throughout the region had to cope with delays and
cancellations. At Logan International Airport in Boston, U.S. Airways canceled
half its remaining flights after 3 p.m. The airline also warned that some
flights could be affected Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York City area's three major airports reported up to one-hour delays
and some cancellations. Port Authority spokesman Bill Cahill said most were due
to bad weather elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   On nearby Long Island, a wildcat sick-out by state Department of
Transportation workers left local authorities struggling to keep streets clear.
At least 300 of a scheduled 440 drivers, snow plow operators, warehouse workers
and mechanics called in sick, and only 40 to 50 of the usual 200 snowplows were
on the road.
</P>
<P>
	   The job action, prompted by contract talks stalled since April, was
``completely irresponsible,'' said state DOT spokesman Michael Fleischer. ``The
workers have put the health and safety of Long Island motorists in jeopardy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Near Washington, about a third of the flights out of Reagan National Airport
and Dulles International Airport were canceled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   All of the city's public schools were closed, and the federal government
announced that nonessential employees could take a day off instead of trying to
make it to the office.
</P>
<P>
	   A mass of bitter, arctic air followed the storm from Canada all the way to
North Carolina, where the overnight wind chill in Raleigh was expected to drop
to 10 below zero.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm first brought treacherous driving to the Midwest, where the
weather was blamed for three traffic deaths in Iowa and one in Michigan on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   It continued to cause problems in the region Thursday. In Michigan, for
example, a 37-year-old woman was killed when she lost control of her car on a
slushy road and collided with a truck.
</P>
<P>
	   The relatively mild winter until now has been attributed to a number of
factors, including the La Nina phenomenon in which cool water sloshes across the
Pacific to replace the warm water that produced El Nino.

<HEADLINE> Huge Dinosaur Bones Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Scientists working in the remote Patagonia
region of Argentina say they have discovered partial remains of what may be the
largest dinosaur species on record.
</P>
<P>
	   Carlos Munoz, director of the Florentino Ameghino Museum of Natural
Sciences, said Thursday a team of paleontologists unearthed the bones of a huge
plant-eating dinosaur thought to have roamed Earth some 105 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The dinosaur is believed to have stretched between 157 and 167 feet from
head to tail and weighed more than 10 tons. The creature is said to have been 27
feet longer than the 100-ton Argentinosaurus, considered by some experts to be
the largest dinosaur ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
	   The new dinosaur, which had a small head and a lengthy tail, has yet to be
named or classified, Munoz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Munoz said scientists working on a tip from a villager found a femur and two
parts of a vertebra. The pieces of cervical vertebrae were nearly four feet
high, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a spectacular find," said Munoz, whose team of nine students is
still working in the remote area near the city of Neuquen, 640 miles southwest
of Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
	   Munoz said his team would continue to dig until the end of the month before
returning to the museum to clean and classify what they uncovered. The
scientists plan to officially release their findings in March in an Argentine
paleontology magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   John McIntosh, a dinosaur expert at Wesleyan University in Middletown,
Conn., said in a telephone interview that if the new creature truly did reach
167 feet in length, "it certainly would be the largest dinosaur yet recorded."
</P>
<P>
	   But paleontologists say there are different ways of measuring the biggest
dinosaur, which might add some controversy to the Patagonia discovery.
</P>
<P>
	   Though possible shorter, the 100-ton Argentinosaurus would have been as much
as 10 times heavier than the new dinosaur, according to scientists' estimates.
And in November, researchers at the University of Oklahoma reported the
discovery of a 60-ton, 60-foot tall giraffe-like creature that lived 100 million
years ago along an ancient seacoast in what is now the south-central United
States. Those measurements would give that dinosaur, called Sauroposeidon, the
greatest height and longest neck -- 40 feet -- of any recorded species,
researcher Richard Cifelli said.

<HEADLINE> 1st Lady Pushes College Tax Credit  </HEADLINE>
   By SHANNON McCAFFREY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton used the power of the White House
bully pulpit Thursday to push an issue she is embracing as a candidate for a
Senate seat from New York -- making college tuition more affordable.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton said a new proposal for college tax credits could be to the
coming generation what the G.I. Bill was for World War II veterans. She noted
that average college tuition has doubled over the past 20 years, outpacing the
median income.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one who wants to improve his or her prospects through education should
have to risk poverty to attain that education,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton allowed that his wife and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
have ``lobbied me relentlessly on this for the better part of a year.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer first began pushing the college tax credit plan during his 1998
Senate campaign. The issue was popular for Schumer, especially among
middle-class suburban voters like the ones Mrs. Clinton must court to win the
Senate race next year. Her poll numbers have been shaky in the
politically-crucial suburbs of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton plan unveiled Thursday mirrored Schumer's, which died in
Congress last year. The centerpiece is a $10,000 tax deduction to help families
pay for tuition and other college costs. A family earning $120,000 or less
annually could receive the full deduction for tuition, fees and job-related
training under the plan once it was phased in by 2003. Alternatively, taxpayers
could seek a maximum credit of $2,800 a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart brushed aside reporters
questions about whether Mrs. Clinton's appearance at the White House was
appropriate given that she is planning to formally announce her Senate candidacy
next month.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the first lady's long-standing commitment to education was well
known.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's certainly other people who come here to events,'' Lockhart said.
``They're up for re-election or running or something else.''

<HEADLINE> NJ Gov Considers Dorm Sprinkler Law  </HEADLINE>
   By AMY WESTFELDT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- A day after a dorm fire killed three college
students, Gov. Christie Whitman said she would consider legislation requiring
sprinkler systems in all college dormitories.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think you could put a price tag on human life,'' the governor said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sprinklers weren't required when Boland Hall was built 48 years ago at Seton
Hall University, where a fire early Wednesday killed three students and injured
62 people. Sprinklers have been required in dorms built since 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall will consider ``anything that we can all do to make sure that
something like this never, ever happens again,'' said school spokeswoman Lisa
Grider, including installing sprinklers in the six-story dorm.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the six people who remained hospitalized Thursday, four remained in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Essex County Prosecutor Donald Campolo disputed a published report that
investigators had eliminated careless smoking and electrical problems as
possible causes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are ruling out nothing at this juncture,'' Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to comment on a story in The Star-Ledger of Newark that
investigators were seeking three young men whom a resident assistant had asked
to leave the building less than an hour before the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
	   Students at the Roman Catholic university continued to question how well the
university is prepared for fire, including its handling of a chronic string of
false alarms at Boland Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Grider said on Thursday that in one case, a fire was found in a Dumpster
near the dormitory, but the others were false.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I first heard the alarm, I thought `I'm not leaving,''' said Marissa
Lorenz, an 18-year-old who was released from the hospital on Thursday. ``I mean,
there are so many alarms.''
</P>
<P>
	   Several students said sprinklers should be installed in all of Seton Hall's
six dormitories. Only the two freshmen dormitories -- Boland Hall and Aquinas
Hall -- don't have sprinkler systems.
</P>
<P>
	   A fire alarm Thursday morning resulted in the evacuation of the
upperclassmen dorm Xavier Hall. Grider said she didn't know the cause.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I got up real quick for this one,'' said Guerschom Nazaire, a 20-year-old
junior.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes were canceled until Monday for the school's 10,000 students. Only
two spent the night in a recreation center where makeshift beds were created,
Grider said. Many stayed with upperclassmen or went home.

<HEADLINE> Gore Raps Bradley on Caucus Comment  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) -- Aiming to rile his own supporters to work
harder, Vice President Al Gore suggested to Iowans Thursday that they should be
insulted by Bill Bradley's assessment that the state caucus system ``rewards
entrenched power.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley responded that he was ``absolutely not, absolutely not'' showing
disrespect to the state's Monday precinct caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Bradley, a former New Jersey senator, told senior citizens that
health care reform is now inevitable because his campaign took ``the risk of
leadership'' and restored the issue to the presidential agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaigned on Iowa's western border, his voice thundering as he railed
against Bradley for spending ``stacks of money'' in Iowa and saturating the
airwaves with TV and radio ads only to seemingly dismiss the caucus as an
organizational contest that favors Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My opponent in this Democratic contest has come here -- he's here today.
He came here, asked for your vote, asked for your support and now ... he has
evidently developed a new view of the Iowa caucuses,'' Gore told several hundred
people gathered in a gymnasium at Iowa Western Community College.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, let me tell you, fighting for people is what the Iowa caucuses are
all about! ... Fighting to save Medicare, that's not entrenched power, that is
fighting for people,'' Gore shouted.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who trails Gore here even after spending, by the Gore campaign's
count, almost twice as many days in the state, said in New Hampshire Wednesday,
``I think Iowa is a state that rewards entrenched power.''
</P>
<P>
	   On a more personal note, Bradley confirmed Thursday that he has suffered
four irregular heartbeat episodes since the non-life threatening condition was
revealed more than a month ago. Although he characterizes the ailment as a
nuisance, a presidential candidate doesn't want to be facing question about his
health days before an election.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and his aides, worried about complacency keeping their supporters home
on Monday, seized on the remark as a way to provoke their own team.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is ``attacking grassroots activists who are playing a very important
role in choosing the next president,'' said Steve Hildebrand, Gore's Iowa
campaign director. ``Senator Bradley is doing nothing but firing up our troops
to go out and work harder.''
</P>
<P>
	   But some union organizers for Gore doubted the potency of this strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernie Kinsella, a railroad worker and union caucus coordinator, said he may
be insulted by Bradley's comment but, with only one hour's sleep in the last 2
1/2 days, ``As far as me working harder for Gore, I don't know if that's
possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley told reporters he respects Iowans and refused to back down on Gore's
institutional advantages. His aides circulated comments Gore made during his
failed 1988 presidential bid, when he described the Iowa contest as ``an arcane
procedure that produces crazy results.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president has the backing of President Clinton, ``most of the
Democratic National Committee officialdom and most of the Democratic Party
fund-raisers, has the backing of the leadership of organized labor and rides in
Air Force II. That is entrenched power,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   In West Des Moines, Bradley promoted his health care proposal at a forum
sponsored by the AARP and claimed credit for a political turnaround since
President Clinton tried and failed to overhaul health care at the start of his
first term.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll tell you something, when I laid out my program this was not an issue
in the political arena,'' said Bradley. ``It was thought to be impossible to
do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Beulah Anderson questioned Bradley closely on whether he could push any of
his plans through a Congress that hasn't acted up to now. Bradley took credit
for shifting the political climate to make that possible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In terms of health, I think there has never been a better opportunity,''
he said. After his plan launched a national debate, ``there have been five or
six other major proposals now of how other people might do national health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore isn't one of them. He wouldn't do national health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Senior citizens make up one of the most important demographic groups in
Monday's precinct caucuses that launch the nominating season. Iowa's population
is the nation's third-oldest, and studies have shown the elderly vote in greater
proportion than other age groups.
</P>
<P>
	   While polls show many favor health reforms, there's some skepticism it can
happen, with many pointing to the political furor Clinton's effort sparked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's a much better opportunity now than in 1993 when Bill Clinton
tried to do it and failed,'' said Bradley. He said the number of uninsured has
grown since that time, as has cost and there is also increasing restiveness in
the medical community.
</P>
<P>
	   All that's combined to shift the political debate, he argued.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Anderson said she was won over though ``I still have concerns about
Congress.''

<P>
	   ``I didn't hear anything to make me change my mind,'' Ms. Brown said. ``I'm
glad Bradley's there offering competition because it's made Gore sharper.
Besides, Iowans like a good fight.''

<HEADLINE> Outcry Quashes Cat-Killing Program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. (AP) -- An Air Force effort to save a beach mouse
from extinction by killing cats and other predators has been put on hold after
complaints from cat lovers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Air Force has been trying to sustain the mouse population and protect
sea turtle nests and shore birds by trapping and killing predators on 17 miles
of Santa Rosa Island owned by Eglin, the nation's largest air base. The program
was put on hold Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a civilized country such as America, there should be a non-lethal way
to deal with predators,'' said Jacqueline Belczak, an opponent of the program.
``They should catch these native animals and maybe the invasive ones and have
them relocated.''
</P>
<P>
	   The moratorium will remain while alternatives are considered, said Carl
Petrick, who heads the base's fish and wildlife management program.
</P>
<P>
	   From March through December last year, trappers killed 25 cats on Eglin
beaches. Officials say a sharp increase in the feral cat population --
once-domestic animals that reverted to wild instincts after being abandoned --
has led to a decline in the mouse population.

<HEADLINE> Helms Seeks U.N. Reforms  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Sen. Jesse Helms, who has made a career of lambasting
the United Nations, kept up the attack as he addressed the Security Council on
Thursday, saying Americans feel ``a lack of gratitude'' from the world
organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms, R-N.C., who has previously branded U.N. officials as
``dysfunctional'' and ``cry babies,'' tempered his criticism by proposing a new
spirit of cooperation with the world body and suggested formal, annual visits
between members and U.S. lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we are to have a new beginning, we must endeavor to understand each
other better,'' Helms said in the first-ever address by a U.S. lawmaker to the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his courtly tone and offer of a ``hand of friendship,'' delegates
reacted coolly to Helms' litany of U.N. excesses and failings.
</P>
<P>
	   American tardiness in meeting its payments and Helms' insistence on a lower
U.S. contribution ``has hindered and not helped'' peacekeeping efforts, said
Jeremy Greenstock, the British envoy.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergey Lavrov, Russia's representative, complained that the United States
failed to abide by terms of a U.N. budget that all members approved. ``All the
other members of the United Nations expected the United States to keep its
word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The money we spend on the U.N. is not charity,'' Helms declared. ``To the
contrary, it is an investment -- an investment from which the American people
rightly expect a return.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congress last year voted to pay $926 million in back U.S. dues over three
years.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States paid a $100 million installment late last year. But to get
the rest, the United Nations must meet about a dozen conditions drafted by
Helms, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, and Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., the committee's senior minority member.
</P>
<P>
	   The conditions includes a reduction the U.S. share of the U.N. peacekeeping
budget from the current 31 percent to 25 percent and of the regular budget from
25 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms said the United Nations must also trim its spending and not draw the
United States into ``entangling alliances.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``A United Nations that seeks to impose its presumed authority on the
American people without their consent begs for confrontation, and -- I want to
be candid -- eventual U.S. withdrawal,'' Helms asserted.
</P>
<P>
	   The senator also accused the General Assembly of an anti-American bias.
``The American people hear all this, they resent it. And they have grown
increasingly frustrated with what they feel is a lack of gratitude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms was invited to speak by U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, who holds
the rotating council chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the blunt exchanges, Holbrooke said he hoped Helms' appearance would
help in ``bringing to a close a chapter of great tension between Washington and
the U.N.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will help us push the reform package, which is our highest priority,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The full 188-member General Assembly must approve any major changes in the
organization's operations and cost-sharing formula.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms told the Security Council it had a ``mixed record'' in recent
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
	   While it ``performed admirably'' in ending Iraqi aggression against Kuwait
in 1990-91, ``In the more recent case of Kosovo, it was paralyzed,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia was a disaster, and its failure to
protect the Bosnian people from Serb genocide is well documented,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other criticisms, Helms has taken issue with Secretary General Kofi
Annan's calls for increased ``global engagement.'' The United Nations ``must
respect national sovereignty'' and not seek ``to impose its utopian vision of
international law on Americans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Annan met privately with Helms before the meeting and escorted him into the
chamber, but did not stay for the speech. John Ruggie, a top Annan aide, said
Annan's absence was not a snub, but that the secretary general had other
engagements.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms mixed his lecture with folksy charm, saying at one point that he hoped
``you have a translator here who can speak Southern.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not my intent to offend you, and I hope I will not,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each of the Security Council's 14 other members spoke in response to Helms'
speech.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Your warm accent from the South was entirely understood by our
interpreters,'' said French Ambassador Alain Dejammet. ``We did hear you.... But
the idea in this house is that others must be heard as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese ambassador, Qin Huasun, said the United Nations ``is not perfect
... but it is irreplaceable and it is there for everyone to see.'' He did
suggest agreement with Helms' views that the United Nations exhibit ``respect
for sovereignty'' and ``nonintervention in internal affairs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Helms spoke while seated at the head of the horseshoe-shaped Security
Council table, mostly reading from a loose-leaf notebook, sometimes banging his
hands on the table to emphasize a point. Council members looked on with little
apparent emotion.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, other members of the Foreign Relations Committee will join Helms
for a meeting with Annan, lunch at U.N. headquarters, and a committee hearing at
a nearby office building that will look into recent developments at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms later told reporters none of the rebuttal comments had changed his
mind about the United Nations, but he added, smiling broadly, ``I think we have
a certain camaraderie going. Let's keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke's analysis of Helms' performance: ``It was something.''

<HEADLINE> Nixon Tapes To Be Distributed  </HEADLINE>
   By DEB RIECHMANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hear Richard Nixon like you've never heard him before.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Archives on Friday begins distributing cassettes of the
president's once-secret tapes -- at $18 a pop. Warning: The government has
determined that these tapes contain language some people might find offensive.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, Americans have read transcripts of the Nixon tapes -- salty
language and all.
</P>
<P>
	   But unless they traveled to the archives in College Park, Md., they couldn't
listen to the tapes. Copying was prohibited. So, besides a few bootleg tapes
illegally broadcast years ago and snippets of recordings played in court, the
Nixon tapes have not been publicly aired.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, 26 years after Nixon resigned, the public will hear Nixon's baritone
voice on television and radio. Students will listen to him in class. Historians,
Nixon buffs, journalists and writers around the nation will play and replay
their own Nixon tapes at home, or maybe in the car.
</P>
<P>
	   They'll hear the famous ``smoking gun'' conversation about Watergate that
led to Nixon's resignation. They'll listen to the infamous tape erasure -- a
full 18 1/2 minutes of buzzes and clicks. They'll hear the chat between Nixon
and former White House counsel John Dean, who tells the president: ``We have a
cancer -- within -- close to the presidency that's growing.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I certainly think the American public has a right to hear this material.
Those tapes are what resulted in Richard Nixon resigning from office. And while
they know the content, they really sound much different than they read,'' said
Dean, now an investment banker in Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nixon kinda growls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dean's voice also can be heard on tape.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously, there's some stuff on there that I find embarrassing with
hindsight,'' said Dean, who was in his 30s during Watergate. ``I was young, awed
by the presidency for a long time and I would approach it much differently today
than I did back then.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nixon secretly recorded 3,700 hours of tape. So far, 264 hours of Watergate
and so-called ``abuse of government power'' tapes can be purchased. These
contain conversations about the break-in and bugging of the Democratic National
Committee headquarters in the Watergate in 1972, subsequent cover-up and
wrongdoing by the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The archives began taking orders late last year. On Friday, the government
is distributing the first batch -- 12 1/2 hours of tapes played in court in the
mid-1970s. The entire set of trial tapes costs $702.
</P>
<P>
	   Segments of the tapes cost $18 for each 30-minute recording. Prices are set
to cover the cost of copying and packaging tapes. The archives will not profit
from the sale.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC News bought a complete set and plans to begin airing them Friday on
``Nightline,'' said producer Jon Ebinger. C-SPAN, which in February 1998 began
airing President Johnson's White House tapes on the radio and its web site, is
waiting to assess the quality of the Nixon tapes before deciding how to use
them, said history producer Maura Pierce.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nixon spoke in a low monotone which makes him hard to understand,'' said
Christopher Beam, director of the Edmund S. Muskie Archives at Bates College in
Maine who plans to play segments of the tapes for students in a history class
he's teaching at the University of Southern Maine.
</P>
<P>
	   Sale of copies of the recordings is governed by a 1996 legal settlement
reached by the archives, Stanley Kutler and the Nixon estate that requires the
government to make these tapes publicly available this month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While the tapes are not the whole of the Nixon record, they are the most
readily identifiable part of it by the general public,'' said Kutler, a
historian and author of a book of Nixon tape transcripts. ``In fairness to
Nixon, they have to be heard in totality -- for a more complete public record.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Nixon estate has often criticized the government for releasing Watergate
tapes before making all the conversations available in chronological order.
Ultimately, there should be less focus on Watergate and more on the Democratic
Congress' decisions during the communist takeover of South Vietnam, said John
Taylor, director of the Richard Nixon Library &AMP; Birthplace Foundation in Yorba
Linda, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is the real scandal of the Vietnam and Watergate era,'' he said.
``When the (baby) boomers move on and stop celebrating their great antiwar
achievements, history will look anew at the era and it won't matter what order
the materials were released.''

<HEADLINE> Algerian Terror Suspect Denied Bail  </HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL SANGER
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- An Algerian man facing U.S. terrorism charges was denied
bail in Canada on Thursday after police testified that he coordinated plans to
smuggle explosives into the United States, allegedly to be used in an attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling in Montreal was one of several developments in the case Thursday.
Elsewhere, Ahmed Ressam, the man accused of trying to smuggle the explosives
from Canada into Washington state, was formally indicted in Seattle. And in New
York, a third man involved in the case pleaded innocent to supporting Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling in Montreal will keep Mokhtar Haouri, whose last name was
previously given as Haouari, in custody until an extradition hearing March 15.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The proof that has been revealed satisfies me that he belongs to a
terrorist organization,'' said Quebec Superior Court Judge Jean-Guy Boilard.
</P>
<P>
	   Boilard said Haouri, whose claim for refugee status was refused by Canadian
authorities in 1994 and 1995, was only in Canada because of a moratorium on
deportations to Algeria. He has a history in Canada of fabricating official
documents and using fake or stolen credit cards, Boilard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Haouari's lawyer, Joseph Elfassy, said there was no danger of his client
leaving Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why would he flee?'' Elfassy asked. ``The best country for him now is
here.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Montreal shopkeeper was detained Jan. 10 as part of an investigation of
Ressam, who was arrested trying to cross from British Columbia into Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam was charged with carrying explosives. On Thursday, a Seattle grand
jury filed a terrorism conspiracy indictment against Ressam and another
Algerian, alleging that the explosives were going to be used to blow up
buildings or other U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine-count federal indictment, which supersedes previous charges,
accuses Ressam and Abdelmajid Dahoumane of conspiring since 1998 ``to destroy or
damage structures, conveyances or other real or personal property within the
United States.'' It does not disclose specific targets or how investigators had
discovered the plot stretched back at least a year. Dahoumane remains at large.
</P>
<P>
	   Several other Algerian nationals and one woman married to an Algerian are
being investigated in the explosives plot. One man was to meet Ressam in
Seattle, drive him where he needed to go and give him money, Canadian police
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   That man, Abdel Ghani Meskini, 31, pleaded innocent Thursday in New York
City to charges of providing and concealing support for Ressam. Police suggest
the two had planned a terrorist attack, perhaps timed to coincide with
millennial celebrations.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony Thursday in Montreal, Royal Canadian Mounted Police
investigator Serge Haineault said Haouri has links to both men and had ordered
Meskini, a childhood friend from Algeria, to meet up with Ressam in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mr. Meskini was supposed to translate for Mr. Ressam, drive him and
provide him with funds,'' said Haineault under questioning from prosecutor
Ronald Schachter.
</P>
<P>
	   Meskini returned to New York after Ressam was picked up at the border, an
event which left Haouri ``very disappointed,'' Haineault testified, citing
information obtained from Meskini.
</P>
<P>
	   Haouri later told Meskini to get rid of his pager and his cell phone, to
change the number of his home phone, and to throw out all documents related to
his trip to Seattle, Haineault said.
</P>
<P>
	   Haineault added that under American police questioning, Meskini said Haouri
is a member of the Islamic Salvation Front, the Algerian political party that
won elections overturned by the military in 1992, and its armed faction, the
G.I.A., which has been fighting a guerrilla war against the army.
</P>
<P>
	   Police connected Ressam with Haouri through a fraudulent credit card found
in Ressam's possession. Haineault testified that in his application form, Ressam
said that he was the manager of Boutique Artisanale Nord-Sud, a small clothing
and jewelry shop owned by Haouri.
</P>
<P>
	   Haouri did not address any of the allegations against him under questioning
by his lawyer. He only said that he posed no risk of flight if the judge granted
him bail.

<HEADLINE> Gore Raps Bradley on Caucus Comment  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) -- Aiming to rile his own supporters to work
harder, Vice President Al Gore suggested to Iowans Thursday that they should be
insulted by Bill Bradley's assessment that the state caucus system ``rewards
entrenched power.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley responded that he was ``absolutely not, absolutely not'' showing
disrespect to the state's Monday precinct caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Bradley, a former New Jersey senator, told senior citizens that
health care reform is now inevitable because his campaign took ``the risk of
leadership'' and restored the issue to the presidential agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaigned on Iowa's western border, his voice thundering as he railed
against Bradley for spending ``stacks of money'' in Iowa and saturating the
airwaves with TV and radio ads only to seemingly dismiss the caucus as an
organizational contest that favors Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My opponent in this Democratic contest has come here -- he's here today.
He came here, asked for your vote, asked for your support and now ... he has
evidently developed a new view of the Iowa caucuses,'' Gore told several hundred
people gathered in a gymnasium at Iowa Western Community College.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, let me tell you, fighting for people is what the Iowa caucuses are
all about! ... Fighting to save Medicare, that's not entrenched power, that is
fighting for people,'' Gore shouted.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who trails Gore here even after spending, by the Gore campaign's
count, almost twice as many days in the state, said in New Hampshire Wednesday,
``I think Iowa is a state that rewards entrenched power.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and his aides, worried about complacency keeping their supporters home
on Monday, seized on the remark as a way to provoke their own team. By an
evening appearance in Sioux City, Gore supporters were equipped with posters
mocking Bradley's comment. ``I am a Mom and I have the power,'' read one.
Another: ``I am a teacher and I have the power.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is ``attacking grassroots activists who are playing a very important
role in choosing the next president,'' said Steve Hildebrand, Gore's Iowa
campaign director. ``Senator Bradley is doing nothing but firing up our troops
to go out and work harder.''
</P>
<P>
	   But some union organizers for Gore doubted the potency of this strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernie Kinsella, a railroad worker and union caucus coordinator, said he may
be insulted by Bradley's comment but, with only one hour's sleep in the last 2
1/2 days, ``As far as me working harder for Gore, I don't know if that's
possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   On a more personal note, Bradley confirmed Thursday that he has suffered
four irregular heartbeat episodes since the non-life threatening condition was
revealed more than a month ago. Although he characterizes the ailment as a
nuisance, a presidential candidate doesn't want to be facing questions about his
health days before an election.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley told reporters he respects Iowans and refused to back down on Gore's
institutional advantages. His aides circulated comments Gore made during his
failed 1988 presidential bid, when he described the Iowa contest as ``an arcane
procedure that produces crazy results.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president has the backing of President Clinton, ``most of the
Democratic National Committee officialdom and most of the Democratic Party
fund-raisers, has the backing of the leadership of organized labor and rides in
Air Force II. That is entrenched power,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   In West Des Moines, Bradley promoted his health care proposal at a forum
sponsored by the AARP and claimed credit for a political turnaround since
President Clinton tried and failed to overhaul health care at the start of his
first term.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll tell you something, when I laid out my program this was not an issue
in the political arena,'' said Bradley. ``It was thought to be impossible to
do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Beulah Anderson questioned Bradley closely on whether he could push any of
his plans through a Congress that hasn't acted up to now. Bradley took credit
for shifting the political climate to make that possible.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In terms of health, I think there has never been a better opportunity,''
he said. After his plan launched a national debate, ``there have been five or
six other major proposals now of how other people might do national health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore isn't one of them. He wouldn't do national health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Senior citizens make up one of the most important demographic groups in
Monday's precinct caucuses that launch the nominating season. Iowa's population
is the nation's third-oldest, and studies have shown the elderly vote in greater
proportion than other age groups.
</P>
<P>
	   While polls show many favor health reforms, there's some skepticism it can
happen, with many pointing to the political furor Clinton's effort sparked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's a much better opportunity now than in 1993 when Bill Clinton
tried to do it and failed,'' said Bradley. He said the number of uninsured has
grown since that time, as has cost and there is also increasing restiveness in
the medical community.
</P>
<P>
	   All that's combined to shift the political debate, he argued.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Anderson said she was won over though ``I still have concerns about
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   Joyce Brown said she was sticking with Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't hear anything to make me change my mind,'' Ms. Brown said. ``I'm
glad Bradley's there offering competition because it's made Gore sharper.
Besides, Iowans like a good fight.''

<HEADLINE> Four Kids Die in Amish House Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRYBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Fire tore through an Amish farmhouse early Thursday,
killing four young children trapped inside.
</P>
<P>
	   The children's parents were working in a nearby barn when the fire started
at about 7:30 a.m. Their father, Levi Mast, tried to get into the house to
rescue them but was turned back by the heat and flames, Fire Chief Ed Hoffman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The nearest telephone was at least half a mile away.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time firefighters arrived, the entire house was ablaze, Hoffman said.
``There was no chance for us to make a rescue.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bodies of the children-- Mosie, 5, Alvin, 3, Martha, 2, and Manda, 1 --
were found in rubble below their first-floor bedrooms. The two-story brick and
wood house had collapsed in the blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   The house was built about 200 yards off a dirt road and had no electricity.
</P>
<P>
	   The children's grandfather, Elmer Mast, said there was a kerosene lamp in
the children's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarion County coroner Roland Burns said the lamp is presumed to be the
cause of the fire. But a state police fire marshal had not released an official
determination of the cause Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The home was located in a community of 30 Amish families about in
northwestern Pennsylvania about 60 miles southeast of Erie.

<HEADLINE> Indians March on Ecuador Congress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Thousands of Indians marched on Ecuador's Congress and
the adjacent Supreme Court building Thursday, the latest in a month-long series
of protests seeking the resignation of President Jamil Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   Riot police guarding the government buildings maintained their distance
during the peaceful demonstration, which paralyzed downtown traffic in Quito.
Congress was not in session late Thursday afternoon when the march started, and
the court had already finished its business for the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad, a Harvard-educated political centrist who took office in August
1998, has faced growing calls to resign after failing to stop the rapid decline
of Ecuador's economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Indian protesters say Mahuad should go because of his plan to make the U.S.
dollar Ecuador's official currency to halt inflation and stabilize the economy.
Their leaders charge the step will further impoverish the 7 million poor people
among Ecuador's population of 12 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Indigenous leaders at one point had said 40,000 Indians would take part in
protests in the capital this week, but they soon scaled the figure back to
10,000.
</P>
<P>
	   About half that many highland Indians managed to slip past patrols into
Quito on Monday and Tuesday to shut down Congress and the courts as part of
their drive for a government that will support the poor. Using a park near the
downtown as their base, they have staged several peaceful marches and blocked
traffic in what organizers call an ``indigenous uprising.''
</P>
<P>
	   The government had deployed 35,000 soldiers and police to patrol the
country's major highways last weekend to block Indians who live in isolated
highland villages from reaching Quito.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad said late Thursday that authorities would not use force to break up
the protests so long as they remain nonviolent. Anti-government demonstrations
last week by student groups were marked by isolated acts of violence, he said,
including masked protesters firing guns and hurling Molotov cocktails at police.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad urged leaders of the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of
Ecuador, which represents the country's 4 million Indians, to remain vigilant
against ``infiltrators that use dynamite, firearms and violence.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Ecuador's economy shrank 7 percent and inflation topped 60
percent, the highest in Latin America. Many economists predicted that the
country's currency would slip into hyperinflation this year if the government
did not act.

<HEADLINE> Gore: His Iowa campaign not about 'entrenched power,' Bradley takes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) - Aiming to rile his own supporters to work
harder, Vice President Al Gore suggested to Iowans Thursday that they should be
insulted by Bill Bradley's assessment that the state caucus system "rewards
entrenched power."
<P>
	   Bradley responded that he was "absolutely not, absolutely not" showing
disrespect to the state's Monday precinct caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, Bradley, a former New Jersey senator, told senior citizens that
health care reform is now inevitable because his campaign took "the risk of
leadership" and restored the issue to the presidential agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaigned on Iowa's western border, his voice thundering as he railed
against Bradley for spending "stacks of money" in Iowa and saturating the
airwaves with TV and radio ads only to seemingly dismiss the caucus as an
organizational contest that favors Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "My opponent in this Democratic contest has come here - he's here today. He
came here, asked for your vote, asked for your support and now ... he has
evidently developed a new view of the Iowa caucuses," Gore told several hundred
people gathered in a gymnasium at Iowa Western Community College.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well, let me tell you, fighting for people is what the Iowa caucuses are
all about! ... Fighting to save Medicare, that's not entrenched power, that is
fighting for people," Gore shouted.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who trails Gore here even after spending, by the Gore campaign's
count, almost twice as many days in the state, said in New Hampshire Wednesday,
"I think Iowa is a state that rewards entrenched power."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and his aides, worried about complacency keeping their supporters home
on Monday, seized on the remark as a way to provoke their own team. By an
evening appearance in Sioux City, Gore supporters were equipped with posters
mocking Bradley's comment. "I am a Mom and I have the power," read one. Another:
"I am a teacher and I have the power."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is "attacking grassroots activists who are playing a very important
role in choosing the next president," said Steve Hildebrand, Gore's Iowa
campaign director. "Senator Bradley is doing nothing but firing up our troops to
go out and work harder."
</P>
<P>
	   But some union organizers for Gore doubted the potency of this strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernie Kinsella, a railroad worker and union caucus coordinator, said he may
be insulted by Bradley's comment but, with only one hour's sleep in the last 2
1/2 days, "As far as me working harder for Gore, I don't know if that's
possible."
</P>
<P>
	   On a more personal note, Bradley confirmed Thursday that he has suffered
four irregular heartbeat episodes since the non-life threatening condition was
revealed more than a month ago. Although he characterizes the ailment as a
nuisance, a presidential candidate doesn't want to be facing questions about his
health days before an election.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley told reporters he respects Iowans and refused to back down on Gore's
institutional advantages. His aides circulated comments Gore made during his
failed 1988 presidential bid, when he described the Iowa contest as "an arcane
procedure that produces crazy results."
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president has the backing of President Clinton, "most of the
Democratic National Committee officialdom and most of the Democratic Party
fund-raisers, has the backing of the leadership of organized labor and rides in
Air Force II. That is entrenched power," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   In West Des Moines, Bradley promoted his health care proposal at a forum
sponsored by the AARP and claimed credit for a political turnaround since
President Clinton tried and failed to overhaul health care at the start of his
first term.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll tell you something, when I laid out my program this was not an issue
in the political arena," said Bradley. "It was thought to be impossible to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Beulah Anderson questioned Bradley closely on whether he could push any of
his plans through a Congress that hasn't acted up to now. Bradley took credit
for shifting the political climate to make that possible.
</P>
<P>
	   "In terms of health, I think there has never been a better opportunity," he
said. After his plan launched a national debate, "there have been five or six
other major proposals now of how other people might do national health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   "Al Gore isn't one of them. He wouldn't do national health insurance."
</P>
<P>
	   Senior citizens make up one of the most important demographic groups in
Monday's precinct caucuses that launch the nominating season. Iowa's population
is the nation's third-oldest, and studies have shown the elderly vote in greater
proportion than other age groups.
</P>
<P>
	   While polls show many favor health reforms, there's some skepticism it can
happen, with many pointing to the political furor Clinton's effort sparked.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's a much better opportunity now than in 1993 when Bill Clinton
tried to do it and failed," said Bradley. He said the number of uninsured has
grown since that time, as has cost and there is also increasing restiveness in
the medical community.
</P>
<P>
	   All that's combined to shift the political debate, he argued.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Anderson said she was won over though "I still have concerns about
Congress."
</P>
<P>
	   Joyce Brown said she was sticking with Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't hear anything to make me change my mind," Ms. Brown said. "I'm
glad Bradley's there offering competition because it's made Gore sharper.
Besides, Iowans like a good fight."

   By The Associated Press Don W. Samuelson
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Former Idaho Gov. Don W. Samuelson died of a heart
attack Thursday. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
	   Samuelson was a state senator from Sandpoint in 1966 when he was elected
governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite a legislative majority of his own Republican party, Samuelson set a
record in 1967 when he vetoed 39 bills sent to him by lawmakers. He served only
one term.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Gov. Dirk Kempthorne remembered Samuelson as ``an honest,
plain-speaking man whose solid conservative ideals shaped his personal and
public life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His background as a small businessman helped him bring sound business
practices to state government,'' Kempthorne said.
</P>
<P>
	   Born in Woodhull, Ill., on July 27, 1913, Samuelson attended Knox College in
Galesburg, Ill., before entering the Navy in 1944 and serving as a gunners mate
at Farragut Naval Training Station in northern Idaho.
</P>
<P>
	   After his discharge in 1946, Samuelson lived in Iowa for a short time before
returning to Sandpoint to start a sporting goods store, the Pend Oreille Sport
Shop, where he did gunsmithing and fishing tackle repair for 14 years. He then
sold his business and started the Don Samuelson Equipment Co., selling and
leasing mining and logging equipment.
Isabella Yurieva
</P>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Isabella Yurieva, a celebrated singer of Russian folk songs
who was lively enough to perform as she entered her second century, died
Wednesday. She was 100.
</P>
<P>
	   Yurieva was well-known on Moscow's musical stages even in the 1920s, after
moving there from the southern city of Rostov-on-Don.
</P>
<P>
	   Her repertoire focused on urban and rural romance songs, even though the
genre was often discouraged during Soviet times.
Richard B. Caspari
</P>
<P>
	   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Dr. Richard B. Caspari, an orthopedic surgeon who
operated on gymnast Mary Lou Retton before she won her Olympic gold medal, died
Wednesday of an apparent heart attack while skiing in Vail, Colo. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
	   A former president of the Arthroscopy Association of North America, Caspari
performed arthroscopic surgery on Retton's knee six weeks before the 1984
Olympics. She went on to win a gold medal, two silver medals and two bronze
medals in gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
	   His other patients included journalist Ted Koppel, Cy Young Award-winning
pitcher Frank Viola and several members of the Washington Redskins.
John Chrystal
</P>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- John Chrystal, an Iowa farmer and banker who
followed in his uncle's footsteps as Cold War-era agricultural adviser to Soviet
leaders, died Wednesday of cancer. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1959, then-Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev toured the United States and
made a much-publicized stop at the Coon Rapids, Iowa, farm of Roswell Garst,
Chrystal's uncle. Garst had already visited the Soviet Union as part of a farm
delegation.
</P>
<P>
	   From that time on, Chrystal traveled about every other year to the Soviet
Union at the government's invitation. He toured the land, dined with Khrushchev
and in the early '80s talked farming with Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
	   Chrystal was chairman and chief executive of Bankers Trust Inc. and a
partner with his brother on the family farm.
</P>
<P>
	   He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor in 1990.
Oliver Heard
</P>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Oliver Heard, a San Antonio attorney whose
tax-collection company became nearly as universal in the state as taxes
themselves, died Wednesday during heart surgery. He was 56.
</P>
<P>
	   Heard was a principal of Heard, Linebarger, Graham, Giggan, Blair, Pena &AMP;
Sampson, which dominates the $2 billion per year tax-collection business in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The firm represents 250 tax-collection clients in Texas, including the
cities of Dallas, El Paso and San Antonio, as well as Harris and Tarrant
counties and school districts throughout the state.
David Riley
</P>
<P>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- David Riley, the U.N. refugee agency's highest
official in Kosovo, has died of apparent natural causes. He was 50.
</P>
<P>
	   Riley joined the United Nations in 1981 and rose to become the top officer
overseeing U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees assistance projects worldwide. He
was named to lead UNHCR operations in Kosovo last June.
</P>
<P>
	   After the international peacekeeping force entered Kosovo that month, Riley
set up office in a warehouse outside Pristina, the province's capital. There he
began managing UNHCR's assistance program to help refugees from the war-torn
province return home.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the years, he served the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in
Pakistan, Ethiopia, Malawi, and Bosnia.
Hazel Wolf
</P>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Hazel Wolf, a longtime environmental activist who helped
found 21 chapters of the Audubon Society in the Pacific Northwest, died
Wednesday. She was 101.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to her Audubon Society work, she served as editor of the
newsletter of the Federation of Western Outdoor Clubs since 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1979, Wolf laid the groundwork for Indian tribes and environmental groups
in Washington State to talk with one another, to share concerns, and find common
ground relating to issues affecting the environment.
George W. Williams
</P>
<P>
	   LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) -- George W. Williams, a former publisher of the Las
Cruces Sun-News and other newspapers in several states, died Tuesday in
Murfreesboro, Tenn. after a lengthy illness. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
	   He was publisher of the Sun-News from 1987 to 1990. He left the Sun-News
shortly after the newspaper was purchased from Worrell Newspapers Inc. by its
current owner, MediaNews Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams worked for Worrell Newspapers for 20 years as a publisher in
several cities in Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, West Virginia and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   After he retired as a publisher, he owned and managed the Northfield Mega
Video in Murfreesboro for five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors include sons Keith Williams of Cookeville, Tenn., and John

<HEADLINE> Bush Answers Abortion Question  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PELLA, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush said Thursday that if the child of a
relative or friend were raped and asked him about abortion, he would hope to
respond with sympathy and would advise that ``it's up to her'' whether to have
the operation.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the Texas governor and Republican presidential front-runner also
said that the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion ``was a reach.'' And he
said he ``would not be inclined to accept'' government approval of
abortion-inducing medicines such as the French pill RU-486.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's abortion,'' Bush told reporters during a news conference at Central
College that featured a string of abortion questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush faced criticism on the issue from rival candidate Steve Forbes, who
said abortions can leave women emotionally scarred and accused Bush of not doing
enough to oppose the operations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What all this underscores is that it's not enough just to say one is
pro-life,'' Forbes told reporters in Cedar Rapids at the Aid to Women center, an
agency supported by Christian groups that counsels women against abortions.
``You have to find ways to move people, even if it's just step-by-step, toward
your goal.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's abandoned the fight,'' Forbes added in a telephone interview from his
campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Iowa caucuses on Monday, Forbes is trying to distinguish himself
from Bush on the abortion issue in the eyes of conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
	   He is running TV ads in Iowa featuring women who insist that fetuses are
people deserving of the legal protections that Forbes advocates.
</P>
<P>
	   Told about Forbes' criticism, Bush said, ``I've got a good, strong record''
on abortion as a governor, including increasing adoptions, signing a parental
notification law and working on abstinence education.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stump, Bush routinely says he would not impose an abortion litmus
test on appointees he would make to Supreme Court. Instead, he says he would
appoint only ``strict constructionists'' to the nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Bush says that while he opposes abortion, he would make
exceptions in three cases: a woman who has been raped, who is a victim of incest
or who would jeopardize her life by delivering a baby.
</P>
<P>
	   After his address at Central College, Bush defined a strict constructionist
as a jurist who ``doesn't use the opportunity of the Constitution to pass
legislation or legislate from the bench.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked what such a judge would think about Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme
Court decision legalizing abortion, Bush said: ``Roe vs. Wade was a reach,
overstepped the constitutional bounds as far as I'm concerned. I would remind
you I'm not a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
	   When Bush was asked if Roe vs. Wade would be in jeopardy because he believes
it is a ``reach'' legally, and because he would appoint only strict
constructionists to the bench, he replied: ``I'm going to name strict
constructionists.''
</P>
<P>
	   GOP rival Alan Keyes reacted with surprise to Bush's comments on Roe vs.
Wade. ``He's just realizing this? Oh my gosh,'' Keyes said before a speech in
Mason City. He suggested Bush may be catering to the strong anti-abortion
sentiment within the GOP.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he has reached this conclusion for the sake of political expediency,
then I hope it's too late,'' Keyes said. ``But if it reflects real conviction,
then it's never too late to admit the truth.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his new biography, ``A Charge to Keep,'' Bush notes that while he
supports the death penalty, one of his 18-year-old twin daughters disagrees with
that position.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if either daughter disagreed with his views on abortion, the governor
said: ``I'm not going to talk about my daughters and their views. My daughters
are, they're part of my private life. ... I'm not going to talk about my
daughters during the course of the campaign, and I appreciate you respecting
their privacy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, the governor was asked what he would say if a friend or relative's
child were raped and asked his advice about abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would say, first of all, I believe in three exceptions when it comes to
abortion. But I would say, I would hope I would be able to evoke enough sympathy
from a rape case that I could help comfort her as a friend,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes told reporters that unlike Bush, he has promised to choose a running
mate and judges who oppose abortion. He has also pledged to preserve the
anti-abortion plank in the GOP platform.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Aid to Women center, Forbes heard from staff members who said they
regularly see women traumatized by abortions they'd had years earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Director Linda Drzycimski said her clients sometimes report feeling suicidal
or turning to drugs and alcohol to diminish the pain when ``there isn't a day
that's gone by that she doesn't think about that baby that she's aborted.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, support for Forbes was mixed at the center on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Volunteer Judy Cope said as she sorted donated baby clothes that Forbes'
anti-abortion stance was the reason she planned to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
	   But staff member Barb Hosford said she planned to vote for another GOP
candidate, conservative commentator Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   He, too, is running TV ads touting his anti-abortion views.

Bradley Discusses Heart Problem
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MOUNT PLEASANT, Iowa (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley
said today he has suffered from episodes of irregular heartbeat but the
condition will not affect his campaign tour. He said the episodes are "regular
and predictable," although he conceded that four episodes in a month is more
than he's used to. Bradley was examined in a hospital last month for an
irregular heartbeat -- a chronic condition that he previously has dismissed as
"just a nuisance." Doctors found no other heart problems.

EgyptAir 990 Crash Said Deliberate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NORTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- Officials close to the investigation of
EgyptAir 990 have said they are more convinced than ever that the jet was
crashed deliberately. The examination of the shattered Boeing 767 has revealed
no signs of a mechanical failure that would have caused the plane to plummet 40
minutes into its 11-hour flight. "Everything leads everyone to believe that the
plane was mechanically sound and it was doing what it was supposed to," one
government official told The Associated Press. "There's just no smoking gun" to
indicate mechanical failure. The FBI has been involved from the start and has
uncovered no evidence of terrorism or conspiracy, according to one of the
federal officials.

Elian's Grandmothers Get Visas To U.S.

diplomatic mission in Cuba issued visas to the two women today as a group from
the National Council of Churches was flying to Havana from New York to meet with
them and with Cuban government officials. Sources said New York was chosen as a
destination because the welcome there would be far friendlier than in Miami,
where Elian has been living with relatives for almost two months and where
sentiment for his remaining in the United States is strong.

Colombia Drug War Progress Seen
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- In a visit underscoring the growing American
military role in strife-torn Colombia, U.S. Army Secretary Louis Caldera said
today a huge planned increase in military aid would yield "dramatic results" in
the war on drugs. Even as he spoke, officials traveling with him warned that the
booming cocaine trade from the South American nation to the United States will
likely get worse before it improves. The trip is the first in memory by a U.S.
Army Secretary to Colombia. It follows President Clinton's proposal earlier this
month of a $1.6 billion emergency anti-narcotics package for the world's
principal cocaine-exporting country.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Thousands of Indians marched on Ecuador's Congress
and the adjacent Supreme Court building Thursday, the latest in a month-long
series of protests seeking the resignation of President Jamil Mahuad. Riot
police guarding the government buildings maintained their distance during the
peaceful demonstration, which paralyzed downtown traffic in Quito. Indian
protesters say Mahuad should go because of his plan to make the U.S. dollar
Ecuador's official currency to halt inflation and stabilize the economy. Their
leaders charge the step will further impoverish the 7 million poor people among
Ecuador's population of 12 million.

<HEADLINE> Attempt at New Austria Govt. Fails  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Attempts to form a new Austrian government failed
Friday when the leading party broke off coalition talks with an opposition party
after more than three hours of closed-door negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Chancellor Viktor Klima of the leading Social Democrats announced the end of
the talks. He said he would propose to President Thomas Klestil that the Social
Democrats form a minority government.
</P>
<P>
	   The leading Social Democrats won the biggest share of votes in October's
parliamentary elections, but it was not enough for the party to form a
government by itself. On Tuesday, it appeared the Social Democrats had reached a
deal with the Austrian People's Party to form a coalition government, but the
deal collapsed after the sides disagreed over who should control key government
posts.
</P>
<P>
	   Klima said he and his negotiating team had gone to ``the limit of what is
tolerable'' in the talks with the People's Party. The People's Party had
demanded control of the Interior Ministry and the Finance Ministry, both Social
Democratic strongholds. Those and other demands were flatly rejected by the
Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear if the president would let Klima form a
minority Cabinet, which would be the first such government since 1970. Another
likely alternative would be new elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Austria has been regarded as a model democracy known for political stability
and the absence of labor conflicts. But the political scene was thrown into
turmoil after the Oct. 3 elections, when populist Joerg Haider's far-right
Freedom Party finished second, outpolling the center-right People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider attracted growing numbers of disillusioned blue-collar workers and
employees, capitalizing on people's fears of job loss by stoking anti-foreigner
sentiments. His controversial right wing comments did nothing to discourage
potential voters.
</P>
<P>
	   But despite the Freedom Party's second-place finish, the Social Democrats
refused to work with Haider to form a coalition.

<HEADLINE> Bush peppered with abortion questions, faces Forbes criticism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PELLA, Iowa (AP) - George W. Bush said Thursday that if the child of a
relative or friend were raped and asked him about abortion, he would hope to
respond with sympathy and would advise that "it's up to her" whether to have the
operation.
<P>
	   However, the Texas governor and Republican presidential front-runner also
said that the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion "was a reach." And he
said he "would not be inclined to accept" government approval of
abortion-inducing medicines such as the French pill RU-486.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's abortion," Bush told reporters during a news conference at Central
College that featured a string of abortion questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush faced criticism on the issue from rival candidate Steve Forbes, who
said abortions can leave women emotionally scarred and accused Bush of not doing
enough to oppose the operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "What all this underscores is that it's not enough just to say one is
pro-life," Forbes told reporters in Cedar Rapids at the Aid to Women center, an
agency supported by Christian groups that counsels women against abortions. "You
have to find ways to move people, even if it's just step-by-step, toward your
goal."
</P>
<P>
	   "He's abandoned the fight," Forbes added in a telephone interview from his
campaign bus.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Iowa caucuses on Monday, Forbes is trying to distinguish himself
from Bush on the abortion issue in the eyes of conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
	   He is running TV ads in Iowa featuring women who insist that fetuses are
people deserving of the legal protections that Forbes advocates.
</P>
<P>
	   Told about Forbes' criticism, Bush said, "I've got a good, strong record" on
abortion as a governor, including increasing adoptions, signing a parental
notification law and working on abstinence education.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stump, Bush routinely says he would not impose an abortion litmus
test on appointees he would make to Supreme Court. Instead, he says he would
appoint only "strict constructionists" to the nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Bush says that while he opposes abortion, he would make
exceptions in three cases: a woman who has been raped, who is a victim of incest
or who would jeopardize her life by delivering a baby.
</P>
<P>
	   After his address at Central College, Bush defined a strict constructionist
as a jurist who "doesn't use the opportunity of the Constitution to pass
legislation or legislate from the bench."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked what such a judge would think about Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme
Court decision legalizing abortion, Bush said: "Roe vs. Wade was a reach,
overstepped the constitutional bounds as far as I'm concerned. I would remind
you I'm not a lawyer."
</P>
<P>
	   When Bush was asked if Roe vs. Wade would be in jeopardy because he believes
it is a "reach" legally, and because he would appoint only strict
constructionists to the bench, he replied: "I'm going to name strict
constructionists."
</P>
<P>
	   GOP rival Alan Keyes reacted with surprise to Bush's comments on Roe vs.
Wade. "He's just realizing this? Oh my gosh," Keyes said before a speech in
Mason City. He suggested Bush may be catering to the strong anti-abortion
sentiment within the GOP.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he has reached this conclusion for the sake of political expediency,
then I hope it's too late," Keyes said. "But if it reflects real conviction,
then it's never too late to admit the truth."
</P>
<P>
	   In his new biography, "A Charge to Keep," Bush notes that while he supports
the death penalty, one of his 18-year-old twin daughters disagrees with that
position.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if either daughter disagreed with his views on abortion, the governor
said: "I'm not going to talk about my daughters and their views. My daughters
are, they're part of my private life. ... I'm not going to talk about my
daughters during the course of the campaign, and I appreciate you respecting
their privacy."
</P>
<P>
	   Later, the governor was asked what he would say if a friend or relative's
child were raped and asked his advice about abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would say, first of all, I believe in three exceptions when it comes to
abortion. But I would say, I would hope I would be able to evoke enough sympathy
from a rape case that I could help comfort her as a friend," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes told reporters that unlike Bush, he has promised to choose a running
mate and judges who oppose abortion. He has also pledged to preserve the
anti-abortion plank in the GOP platform.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Aid to Women center, Forbes heard from staff members who said they
regularly see women traumatized by abortions they'd had years earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Director Linda Drzycimski said her clients sometimes report feeling suicidal
or turning to drugs and alcohol to diminish the pain when "there isn't a day
that's gone by that she doesn't think about that baby that she's aborted."
</P>
<P>
	   However, support for Forbes was mixed at the center on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Volunteer Judy Cope said as she sorted donated baby clothes that Forbes'
anti-abortion stance was the reason she planned to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
	   But staff member Barb Hosford said she planned to vote for another GOP
candidate, conservative commentator Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   He, too, is running TV ads touting his anti-abortion views.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Referendum Seeks Strike End  </HEADLINE>
   By LISA J. ADAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Teachers, students and employees of Latin America's
largest university voted Thursday on a proposal aimed at ending a nine-month
strike that has kept hundreds of thousands of students out of class.
</P>
<P>
	   The referendum at the 286,000-student National Autonomous University and
affiliated high schools asks voters whether they support a compromise proposal
from recently appointed rector Juan Ramon de la Fuente, and whether the proposal
should be used to end the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Fuente's proposal would agree to some of the strikers' demands,
including a return to previous tuition levels. But it rejects other demands, and
the strikers vehemently oppose it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I prefer a bloodstained people to a subjugated one,'' said UNAM political
science professor and strike supporter David Navarrete, 35. ``Either you have
school for everyone or you have school for no one.''
</P>
<P>
	   Results were not expected until early Friday. But an exit poll by the
independent firm Consulta Mitofsky said the proposal won the support of 90
percent of teachers, 89 percent of students and 87 percent of university
workers. The groups answered affirmatively in roughly similar percentages to the
of whether the proposal should lead to the strike's end received affirmative
answers of similar percentages, the poll reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll, taken at 150 voting booths, surveyed 8,000 students, 1,300
professors and 300 workers. No margin of error was given.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of increasingly radical students has kept the university and other
institutions closed since April 1999. As the strike has worn on, university
authorities have taken an increasingly hard line on the strikers' demands, which
include more student representation in university decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Fuente's ``Proposal for a Consensus'' recommends a return to previous
tuition levels -- officials initially wanted to increase tuition from a token
few cents to the equivalent of $140 -- and the creation of a university-wide
Congress to work on reforms. The proposal also would agree to several other
student demands, including that the strikers not be punished.
</P>
<P>
	   In preparation for Thursday's vote, UNAM officials set up about 900 polling
places around the city, as well as at university branches in other Mexican
states.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the gates of the school, 40-year-old Melania Alviter, the mother of
a university student, threw her arms in the air and begged for divine
intervention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm praying to God that he will help to solve this conflict,'' she said,
sobbing.

<HEADLINE> NJ Gov Considers Dorm Sprinkler Law  </HEADLINE>
   By AMY WESTFELDT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- A day after a dorm fire killed three college
students, Gov. Christie Whitman said she would consider legislation requiring
sprinkler systems in all college dormitories.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think you could put a price tag on human life,'' the governor said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sprinklers weren't required when Boland Hall was built at Seton Hall
University, where a fire early Wednesday killed three students and injured 62
people. Sprinklers have been required in dorms built since 1984. The wing of
Boland Hall where the fire started was added to the building in 1971.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall will consider ``anything that we can all do to make sure that
something like this never, ever happens again,'' said school spokeswoman Lisa
Grider, including installing sprinklers in the six-story dorm.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the six people who remained hospitalized Thursday, four remained in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Essex County Prosecutor Donald Campolo disputed a published report that
investigators had eliminated careless smoking and electrical problems as
possible causes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are ruling out nothing at this juncture,'' Campolo said.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to comment on a story in The Star-Ledger of Newark that
investigators were seeking three young men whom a resident assistant had asked
to leave the building less than an hour before the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
	   Students at the Roman Catholic university continued to question how well the
university is prepared for fire, including its handling of a chronic string of
false alarms at Boland Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Grider said on Thursday that in one case, a fire was found in a Dumpster
near the dormitory, but the others were false.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I first heard the alarm, I thought `I'm not leaving,''' said Marissa
Lorenz, an 18-year-old who was released from the hospital on Thursday. ``I mean,
there are so many alarms.''
</P>
<P>
	   Several students said sprinklers should be installed in all of Seton Hall's
six dormitories. Only the two freshmen dormitories -- Boland Hall and Aquinas
Hall -- don't have sprinkler systems.
</P>
<P>
	   A fire alarm Thursday morning resulted in the evacuation of the
upperclassmen dorm Xavier Hall. Grider said she didn't know the cause.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I got up real quick for this one,'' said Guerschom Nazaire, a 20-year-old
junior.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes were canceled until Monday for the school's 10,000 students. Only
two spent the night in a recreation center where makeshift beds were created,
Grider said. Many stayed with upperclassmen or went home.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Terror Suspect Denied Bail  </HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL SANGER
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- An Algerian man facing U.S. terrorism charges was denied
bail in Canada on Thursday after police testified that he coordinated plans to
smuggle explosives into the United States, allegedly to be used in an attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling in Montreal was one of several developments in the case Thursday.
Elsewhere, Ahmed Ressam, the man accused of trying to smuggle the explosives
from Canada into Washington state, was indicted on new charges in Seattle. And
in New York, a third man involved in the case pleaded innocent to supporting
Ressam.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling in Montreal will keep Mokhtar Haouri, whose last name was
previously given as Haouari, in custody until an extradition hearing March 15.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The proof that has been revealed satisfies me that he belongs to a
terrorist organization,'' said Quebec Superior Court Judge Jean-Guy Boilard.
</P>
<P>
	   Boilard said Haouri, whose claim for refugee status was refused by Canadian
authorities in 1994 and 1995, was only in Canada because of a moratorium on
deportations to Algeria. He has a history in Canada of fabricating official
documents and using fake or stolen credit cards, Boilard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Haouari's lawyer, Joseph Elfassy, said there was no danger of his client
leaving Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why would he flee?'' Elfassy asked. ``The best country for him now is
here.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Montreal shopkeeper was detained Jan. 10 as part of an investigation of
Ressam, who was arrested trying to cross from British Columbia into Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
	   Ressam was charged with carrying explosives. On Thursday, a Seattle grand
jury filed a terrorism conspiracy indictment against Ressam and another
Algerian, alleging that the explosives were going to be used to blow up
buildings or other U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
	   The nine-count federal indictment, which supersedes previous charges,
accuses Ressam and Abdelmajid Dahoumane of conspiring since 1998 ``to destroy or
damage structures, conveyances or other real or personal property within the
United States.'' It does not disclose specific targets or how investigators had
discovered the plot stretched back at least a year. Dahoumane remains at large.
</P>
<P>
	   Several other Algerian nationals and one woman married to an Algerian are
being investigated in the explosives plot. One man was to meet Ressam in
Seattle, drive him where he needed to go and give him money, Canadian police
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   That man, Abdel Ghani Meskini, 31, pleaded innocent Thursday in New York
City to charges of providing and concealing support for Ressam. Police suggest
the two had planned a terrorist attack, perhaps timed to coincide with
millennial celebrations.
</P>
<P>
	   In testimony Thursday in Montreal, Royal Canadian Mounted Police
investigator Serge Haineault said Haouri has links to both men and had ordered
Meskini, a childhood friend from Algeria, to meet up with Ressam in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mr. Meskini was supposed to translate for Mr. Ressam, drive him and
provide him with funds,'' said Haineault under questioning from prosecutor
Ronald Schachter.
</P>
<P>
	   Meskini returned to New York after Ressam was picked up at the border, an
event which left Haouri ``very disappointed,'' Haineault testified, citing
information obtained from Meskini.
</P>
<P>
	   Haouri later told Meskini to get rid of his pager and his cell phone, to
change the number of his home phone, and to throw out all documents related to
his trip to Seattle, Haineault said.
</P>
<P>
	   Haineault added that under American police questioning, Meskini said Haouri
is a member of the Islamic Salvation Front, the Algerian political party that
won elections overturned by the military in 1992, and its armed faction, the
G.I.A., which has been fighting a guerrilla war against the army.
</P>
<P>
	   Police connected Ressam with Haouri through a fraudulent credit card found
in Ressam's possession. Haineault testified that in his application form, Ressam
said that he was the manager of Boutique Artisanale Nord-Sud, a small clothing
and jewelry shop owned by Haouri.
</P>
<P>
	   Haouri did not address any of the allegations against him under questioning
by his lawyer. He only said that he posed no risk of flight if the judge granted
him bail.

<HEADLINE> Senators 1, Flyers 1  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN BERGER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Rookie Brian Boucher made 22 saves filling in for John
Vanbiesbrouck, but the Philadelphia Flyers extended their winless streak to four
games Thursday night with a 1-1 tie against the Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
	   The Flyers continued to struggle without injured captain Eric Lindros, who
might learn Friday when he can return from his third concussion in 22 months.
The Flyers have scored three goals during their 0-3-1 slide -- one in each game
Lindros has missed.
</P>
<P>
	   Shawn McEachern scored his 19th goal for the Senators, unbeaten in four of
five. Valeri Zelepukin scored the Flyers' first even-strength goal in five
games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Flyers had several chances in overtime, but Igor Kravchuk foiled the
best one when he tied up John LeClair as he tried to convert a centering pass
from Simon Gagne in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottawa goalie Ron Tugnutt, who stopped 23 of 24 shots, poked LeClair's pass
to Mark Recchi away with 15 seconds left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottawa's Magnus Arvedson was taken to a hospital after a brutal collision
involving Philadelphia's Marc Bureau with 5:12 left in the third. Arvedson, who
collapsed twice while being helped off the ice, had multiple injuries from his
head to his groin and was to be held overnight for observation.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think he lost consciousness," Ottawa coach Jaques Martin said. "He
went into the boards with his leg, his arm and his head."
</P>
<P>
	   Both were chasing the puck along the boards in front of the Flyers' bench as
Philadelphia defenseman Eric Desjardins was coming off the ice through an open
door at the end of the bench.
</P>
<P>
	   Arvedson collided hard with the corner at the door's hinges. Bureau also
went down hard as the crowd stood up like a wave.
</P>
<P>
	   Arvedson tried twice to get up with the help of teammates and trainers, but
fell both times. A stretcher was summoned, but Arvedson was helped off the ice
without it. Bureau escaped with only a stiff neck.
</P>
<P>
	   Lindros, who suffered a concussion Jan. 14 in Atlanta, skated with the team
for the first time Thursday morning. He was scheduled for tests Friday which
will determine when he can return. Lindros has said he wants to play Sunday at
Pittsburgh or Thursday at home against Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottawa had shut out the Flyers in their last two meetings in Philadelphia --
5-0 and 3-0.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Wives Tout Pro-Choice  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With their husbands campaigning in Iowa, Ernestine
Bradley and Tipper Gore made a rare joint appearance Thursday to reaffirm the
Democratic presidential candidates' support for abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   The two would-be first ladies spoke at a National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League dinner commemorating the 27th anniversary of the Supreme
Court's Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Bradley presented her husband as a staunch supporter of abortion
rights, saying his opinion has never changed during his public career.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bill has always said that a woman's right to choose is an issue that is so
important that we must never play politics with it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who also supports abortion rights, has been criticized by some
activists for voting against abortion legislation 20 years ago as a Tennessee
congressman.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mrs. Gore gave no indication that he had been anything but a supporter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to stand together to keep the White House pro-choice,'' she said.
``My husband is fully committed to our cause.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both women introduced video messages from their husbands, who were busy
campaigning in Iowa in advance of Monday's caucuses and could not attend the
event.
</P>

<P>
   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- A military attack jet crashed Thursday night in
southwestern Idaho, killing an Idaho National Guard pilot.
</P>
<P>
	   Ada County sheriff's dispatch supervisor Myrna Harris said the pilot was the
only person aboard the A-10 when it went down in a field near Star, about 15
miles northwest of Boise, at 6:42 p.m. MST.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris said investigators with the Federal Aviation Administration were
examining the crash site Thursday night, but had not determined why the plane
went down.
</P>
<P>
	   An eyewitness said the plane seemed to arc before plummeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack jet was believed to be from the Idaho National Guard facility at
Boise. The National Guard shares an air field with Boise's city airport.

	   HOUSTON (AP) -- Shandon Anderson had 26 points and 13 rebounds as the
Houston Rockets won their season-high fifth straight with a 122-115 victory over
the Denver Nuggets on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson was one short of his career high, rookie Steve Francis added 22
points and seven assists and Kenny Thomas had 13 points and 10 rebounds. Cuttino
Mobley had 17 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rockets offset Antonio McDyess' season-high 40 points, six short of his
career high. Nick Van Exel added 31 points and 11 assists, and Ron Mercer had 22
points for the Nuggets, who lost their season-high fifth straight.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rockets, who beat the Nuggets for the 11th straight time, didn't take

<HEADLINE> US Issues Visas to Elian's Grandmas  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- The custody fight over Elian Gonzalez took a new turn
Thursday as the grandmothers of the 6-year-old obtained visas to travel to the
United States to make their case that the boy should be returned to his father
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. diplomatic mission in Cuba issued visas to the two women Thursday
afternoon as a group from the National Council of Churches flew to Havana from
New York to meet with them and with Cuban government officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers were expected to fly to New York on Friday, apparently
escorted by the church group, and Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel of New York,
who has offered to accompany the boy to Cuba, planned to meet with the women.
They hoped to return home with Elian, according to congressional sources.
</P>
<P>
	   These sources said New York was chosen as a destination because the welcome
there would be far friendlier than in Miami, where Elian has been living with
relatives for almost two months and where sentiment for his remaining in the
United States is strong.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, National Council of Churches spokeswoman Sara Vilankulu said
three council representatives arrived in Havana aboard a chartered plane around
6 p.m. EST Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The charter plane left Havana's airport later in the evening for an unknown
destination, but it appeared that the church group remained in Havana. That
could not be officially confirmed, but an airport security guard said the plane
took off without passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban officials did not permit reporters access to the plane or its
passengers. Reporters were herded into a waiting room after the plane had
arrived amid indications that there might be a chance to speak with the
visitors. However, no one showed up and Cuban officials made no statements.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Thursday night, both Elian's grandmothers appeared at a church office
in Havana, apparently to meet with the council members. The paternal
grandmother, Mariela Quintana, said ``I'm here to get my grandson.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian survived a shipwreck in late November. The boat on which he was
heading for south Florida capsized, killing his mother and 10 other would-be
refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States refused to return Elian immediately to Cuba, aggravating
the already hostile relationship between Washington and Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Bernstein, one of the lawyers retained by Elian's Miami relatives,
said the family is pleased about the grandmothers' visit and hopes Elian will
get to see them.
</P>
<P>
	   He said their visit will not affect the proceedings in federal court to
determine Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle, went to federal court
Wednesday to challenge the Immigration and Naturalization Service's ruling that
Elian must to be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The legal team filed a lawsuit accusing the INS of violating Elian's
due-process rights and asked the judge to prevent the agency from returning the
boy before it gives him an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is about protecting Elian's civil and constitutional rights, the same
as if he was any other child,'' said Spencer Eig, a lawyer for the great-uncle.
</P>
<P>
	   Many legal experts insist that Elian's U.S. relatives have no legal standing
because their rights do not trump those of his father, his closest relative.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All along, the legal issue has been who speaks for a 6-year-old boy, and
the answer is the closest surviving relative,'' said David Abraham, an
immigration law professor at the University of Miami. ``That is the father.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the federal judge in the case asked lawyers if they preferred
he step aside because of his ties to both sides. U.S. District Court Judge James
Lawrence King has a son with political ties to Elian's Miami relatives and a
daughter who works for the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
	   King said his son hired Armando Gutierrez, now working as spokesman for
those relatives, to help in his re-election bid. King's daughter is an assistant
U.S. attorney in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez said they saw no reason for King to recuse
himself. U.S. Attorney Tom Scott asked for a day to respond.
</P>
<P>
	   Gutierrez also has ties to the Florida judge who ordered Elian to remain in
the United States until March, working as a political consultant for Miami-Dade
County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez during her 1998 election campaign. She said
she was not required to remove herself from the case because of the affiliation,
a suggestion made by a legal expert.

<HEADLINE> Eugene McCarthy Honored  </HEADLINE>
   By FREDERIC J. FROMMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eugene McCarthy, the former Minnesota senator who
galvanized a generation of liberals in the 1960s with his antiwar presidential
campaign, received an award Thursday night from the most unlikely of
organizations: the Conservative Political Action Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The group gave McCarthy its ``Defenders of the Constitution Award'' for his
role in challenging spending limits on political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   McCarthy, whose 1968 antiwar candidacy forced President Lyndon Johnson to
announce he would not seek another term, launched a third-party bid for the
White House in 1976, crusading against spending limits Congress had passed after
Watergate. He joined New York Republican Sen. James Buckley in challenging the
law, and in 1976, the Supreme Court struck down spending limits as
unconstitutional but upheld limits on contributions.
</P>
<P>
	   McCarthy and Buckley, now a federal appeals court judge in Washington, D.C.,
shared the award Thursday night on behalf of other plaintiffs in the case.
McCarthy, now 83, found himself sitting next to some resolute conservatives,
including former New York Republican Congressman Gerald Solomon and Wayne
LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Referring to the term ``liberal,'' McCarthy said to laughs, ``It was a
pretty good adjective. Then it became a noun. Any time an adjective becomes a
noun, it's in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview in his Washington apartment before the dinner, McCarthy
didn't seem concerned about accepting an award from a conservative organization.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think they're right on this and the Democrats have been wrong from the
beginning,'' he said. ``We always had much less to spend than the Republicans,
so Democrats thought if they got federal financing they could win all of the
time. It was a real compromise of principle, especially for liberals.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCarthy has long argued that spending limits violate the First Amendment
and bolster the two-party system at the expense of third-party challengers. He
favors full disclosure and bans on contributions by corporations and labor
unions.
</P>
<P>
	   McCarthy isn't afraid to acknowledge money helped him in the '68 race, in
the days before campaign contribution limits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had a few big contributors,'' he said. ``And that's true of any liberal
movement. In the American Revolution, they didn't get matching funds from George
III.''

<HEADLINE> Four Kids Die in Amish House Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRYBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Fire tore through an Amish farmhouse early Thursday,
killing four young children trapped inside.
</P>
<P>
	   The children's parents were working in a nearby barn when the fire started
at about 7:30 a.m. Their father, Levi Mast, tried to get into the house to
rescue them but was turned back by the heat and flames, Fire Chief Ed Hoffman
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The nearest telephone was at least half a mile away.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time firefighters arrived, the entire house was ablaze, Hoffman said.
``There was no chance for us to make a rescue.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bodies of the children -- Moses, 5, Alvin, 3, Martha, 2, and Amanda, 1
-- were found in rubble below their first-floor bedrooms. The two-story brick
and wood house had collapsed in the blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   The house was built about 200 yards off a dirt road and had no electricity.
</P>
<P>
	   The children's grandfather, Elmer Mast, said there was a kerosene lamp in
the children's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Clarion County coroner Roland Burns said the lamp is presumed to be the
cause of the fire. But a state police fire marshal had not released an official
determination of the cause Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The home was located in a community of 30 Amish families about in
northwestern Pennsylvania about 60 miles southeast of Erie.

<HEADLINE> Lauries Call Off Grizzlies Effort  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Bill and Nancy Laurie, a billionaire couple that purchased
the NHL's St. Louis Blues in September, on Thursday called off their efforts to
buy the NBA's Vancouver Grizzlies and move the team to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lauries, from Columbia, Mo., announced in a statement that they had
terminated their agreement and would "explore other methods" of bringing an NBA
team to the city.
</P>
<P>
	   "That remains our objective, and we intend to explore all options, including
the possibility of securing an NBA expansion franchise," Bill Laurie said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lauries signed a contract to buy the Grizzlies for $200 million in
September, about three weeks after they bought the Blues. The deal was
contingent on relocating the team, which would have given the Lauries two
tenants in the 5-year-old Kiel Center, but was met with resistance from NBA
owners.
</P>
<P>
	   Laurie said others in the league felt Vancouver hadn't been given an
"adequate opportunity to demonstrate their support for the Grizzlies."
</P>
<P>
	   The Kiel Center was included in the Lauries' $100 million purchase of the
Blues.
</P>
<P>
	   Nancy Laurie is an heir to the Wal-Mart fortune. Bill Laurie is a former
point guard at Memphis.
</P>
<P>
	   In April, the Lauries bid $400 million to buy the Colorado Avalanche of the
NHL, the Denver Nuggets of the NBA and Denver's new Pepsi Center, but lost to a
rival group that bid $461 million.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Louis has not had an NBA team since the Hawks left in 1968.
</P>
<P>
	   Orca Bay, the parent company that owns the Grizzlies, and the NBA were taken
completely off guard by Laurie's announcement, which was only released to media
outlets in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Curiously, Laurie's announcement came a day after the two sides held talks
in New York in an attempt to resolve the differences on the condition of sale.
</P>
<P>
	   At halftime of the Grizzlies game against the Utah Jazz Thursday night,
Loring Phinney, spokesman for Orca Bay owner John McCaw, said company officials
were still reviewing Laurie's announcement and would not have a statement until
at least Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think you can say we're surprised," said Phinney.
</P>
<P>
	   Grizzlies president and general manager Stu Jackson said the team can't
comment because it hasn't received official word from Laurie yet.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to take it at face value," said Jackson. "We don't know concretely
that the deal has fallen through. Certainly, there are some issues to work out.
I think tomorrow we'll know exactly where everybody stands."
</P>
<P>
	   If true, Jackson called the news "terrific,"
</P>
<P>
	   With Laurie out of the picture, the Grizzlies will have to continue
searching for other investors. Orca Bay, headed by Seattle-based
multi-millionaire John McCaw, also owns the NHL Vancouver Canucks and their home
facility, GM Place.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grizzlies, now in their fifth year of existence, were established by
former Canucks owner Arthur Griffiths, who eventually sold off his interest in
the franchise to McCaw, a partner he originally brought in to help finance
soaring arena construction costs and the fees involved in landing the NBA
franchise.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffiths, attending Thursday's game, was cautious after hearing the news.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't surprise me, although I'm not quite sure what it means long
term. But without a doubt it's a signal to us all, the fans, that there are
certain things we have to do in order to keep this team in the first place,"
said Griffiths. "Whether it's Mr. Laurie or Mr. McCaw or whoever owns this team,
it's incumbent that we all wake up and recognize that they could go quickly if
we don't pay attention to those concerns."
</P>
<P>
	   Grizzlies star forward Shareef Abdur-Rahim said he was relieved by the news.
</P>

	   "It's real good. It's better for the fans. It would've been tough for us to
move just because of all the relationships we built here in the city," said
Abdur-Rahim. "I'm very happy. It seems like we have some stability now."
</P>
<P>
	   As a result of the announced sale agreement last Sept. 23, and Laurie's
refusal to commit to keeping the Grizzlies in Vancouver, a grassroots-based
'Save Our Grizzlies' campaign was organized in an attempt to keep the franchise
in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Immediately following the announcement, NBA commissioner David Stern voiced
his personal opposition to a relocation, citing the league's record of not
having any franchise migrations since the Clippers moved from San Diego to Los
Angeles in 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's my goal to see the Grizzlies stay and succeed in Vancouver," Stern
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, the NBA board of governors finance committee raised concerns
over the terms of the deal, noting that it included many incentives to move the
team.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing the concerns, Orca Bay pulled the deal away before the NBA could vote
on it, in an attempt to try to renegotiate with Laurie.

<HEADLINE> 39-year-old defendant in Greenwich murder is headed for juvenile  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - Michael Skakel, charged in the 1975 slaying of a
15-year neighbor girl, has changed greatly since the crime.
<P>
	   So, too has the law.
</P>
<P>
	   The 39-year-old nephew of Robert F. Kennedy was arrested Wednesday in the
1975 slaying of Martha Moxley, a childhood friend in Greenwich who was
bludgeoned to death with a golf club.
</P>
<P>
	   Most legal experts said Skakel will be subject to the laws in effect in
1975. Under 1975 law, he would face a maximum of only four years if he were
tried as a juvenile. If he were tried as an adult, he could get 25 years to
life.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1975, prosecutors were required to present evidence at a hearing to
convince a judge that the case should be transferred to adult court. Under
current law, murder cases are automatically transferred to adult court.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Skakel was 15 at the time of the killing, he will be treated, at
least initially, just like any other juvenile. The court proceedings will be
closed to the press and public, and prosecutors will not even be allowed to
speak his name publicly.
</P>
<P>
	   The first hurdle for prosecutors is to get the case transferred to adult
court. But the complications don't end there. The question of whether he can be
punished as an adult is so complex that according to at least one expert, Skakel
could actually be convicted and walk away with no punishment at all.
</P>
<P>
	   The hefty, mature Skakel who entered the Greenwich police station to
surrender Wednesday was a stark contrast from the scrawny schoolboy seen in
photographs that have appeared in newspapers since the slaying more than 24
years go.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel is the oldest person ever to be treated as a juvenile in Connecticut
courts. The notion of a man pushing 40 appearing in court next to teen-agers has
prompted some chuckling in Connecticut legal circles.
</P>
<P>
	   But experts in juvenile law said the case may create a legal morass that
could make it difficult for prosecutors to transfer the case to adult court.
</P>
<P>
	   While some attorneys think it is highly unlikely that a judge would agree to
keep Skakel's case in juvenile court, others said the state may have a long road
ahead to get the case moved to adult court.
</P>
<P>
	   David Rosen, a researcher at Yale Law School, said there is even a
possibility - albeit a small one - that Skakel could be found guilty and get no
punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   "The juvenile court, under that 1975 law, did not have authority to send him
to an adult facility. Therefore, he might not be subject to punishment decades
later for crimes committed as a child - no matter how terrible the crime," Rosen
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosen said there is also a question as to whether the adult courts can
punish him, even if the case is transferred there.
</P>
<P>
	   "The adult court doesn't have authority over him unless the juvenile court
is allowed to transfer him, but it's only allowed to transfer him, it seems to
me, if he's a child," Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
	   He explained: "The reason we're going around in circles is that the law at
that time was designed for the protection and correction of children so that
they would not become criminals in their adult years. It was designed for
rehabilitation, not punishment."
</P>
<P>
	   Hillary Bargar, a juvenile prosecutor in Bridgeport, said Skakels' lawyers
could keep the case in juvenile court for a year or more if they fight the
transfer to adult court.
</P>
<P>
	   "The situation of a 40-year-old was never anticipated by the law," she said.
"This could take a very long time to resolve."
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel attorney Michael Sherman insisted he hasn't decided whether he will
fight to keep the case in juvenile court. But many lawyers said it is unlikely
that a judge would agree to keep the case in juvenile court, given the
high-profile nature of the case and the fact that Skakel is now 39.
</P>
<P>
	   "Judges don't operate in a vacuum, and in this case there is tremendous
pressure to deal with it openly and in an open courtroom," said Hugh Keefe, a
New Haven defense attorney.
</P>
<P>
	   The Moxley case remained unsolved for more than 24 years. Skakel, whose
father, Rushton, is the brother of Kennedy's widow, Ethel, was charged Wednesday
after a judge acting as a one-man grand jury completed an 18-month investigation
by finding grounds for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   On the night she was killed, Martha was among a group of teen-agers who
visited the Skakel house. Her body was found the next day on her family's
estate. She had been beaten to death with a 6-iron that was later matched to a
set owned by the Skakel family.

Moon Moves Toward Total Eclipse
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Across the Western Hemisphere wherever there wasn't a
curtain of clouds, one of the greatest shows on Earth played overhead Thursday
night. Starting about 9:30 p.m. EST with a shadow along its left edge, the moon
began moving toward total eclipse as it crept into Earth's shadow. The darkest
phase, when the moon climbed to its height over the East Coast, was to end at
12:22 a.m. EST Friday. The moon was expected to leave Earth's shadow at 2:24
a.m. EST. Snow spoiled the viewing in some places, especially in the Northeast.
And in much of the North, temperatures dipped into single digits or below,
turning eclipse watching into a test of hardiness.

EgyptAir 990 Crash Said Deliberate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NORTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- Investigators closely involved with the
EgyptAir 990 crash told the Associated Press on Thursday they are more convinced
than ever that the jet was deliberately crashed. Careful examination of the
shattered remains of the Boeing 767 has revealed no signs of a mechanical
failure that would have caused the plane to plummet 40 minutes into its 11-hour
flight. "Everything leads everyone to believe that the plane was mechanically
sound and it was doing what it was supposed to," one government official said.
"There's just no smoking gun" to indicate mechanical failure. The FBI has been
involved from the start and has uncovered no evidence of terrorism or
conspiracy, according to one of the federal officials.

Bradley Discusses Heart Problem
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MOUNT PLEASANT, Iowa (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley
said Thursday he has suffered four irregular heartbeat episodes since he first
disclosed his non-life threatening condition more than a month ago. The latest
reoccurrence was on Sunday. Bradley said he would only make the episodes public
if they required him to seek a doctor's attention, and he dismissed any notion
that the problem might hamper his presidential bid. His campaign schedule had
not been interrupted by the irregular heartbeat, he said. Aides said doctors are
"not sure why" he's experiencing irregular heartbeats, but have voiced no
concern and have not recommended any change in medication.

Algerian Terror Suspect Denied Bail

<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- An Algerian man facing U.S. terrorism charges was denied
bail in Canada on Thursday after police testified that he coordinated plans to
smuggle explosives into the United States, allegedly to be used in an attack.
The ruling in Montreal was one of several developments in the case Thursday.
Elsewhere, Ahmed Ressam, the man accused of trying to smuggle the explosives
from Canada into Washington state, was indicted on new charges in Seattle. And
in New York, a third man involved in the case pleaded innocent to supporting
Ressam.

Mexico Referendum Seeks Strike End
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Teachers, students and employees of Latin America's
largest university voted Thursday on a proposal aimed at ending a nine-month
strike that has kept hundreds of thousands of students out of class. A group of
increasingly radical students has kept the university and other institutions
closed since April 1999. As the strike has worn on, university authorities have
taken an increasingly hard line on the strikers' demands, which include more
student representation in university decisions. Results were not expected until
early Friday.

N.J. Gov. Considers Dorm Sprinkler Law
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- A day after a dorm fire killed three college
students, Gov. Christie Whitman said she would consider legislation requiring
sprinkler systems in all college dormitories. Sprinklers weren't required when
Boland Hall was built at Seton Hall University, where a fire early Wednesday
killed three students and injured 62 people. Sprinklers have been required in
dorms built since 1984. The wing of Boland Hall where the fire started was added
to the building in 1971. Of the six people who remained hospitalized Thursday,
four remained in critical condition.
