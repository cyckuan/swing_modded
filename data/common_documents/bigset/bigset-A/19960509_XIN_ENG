<HEADLINE> Singapore Declares Moratorium on Land-Mine Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has declared a two-year
moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines (APLs) that
have no self-destruct or self-neutralizing mechanisms, the Foreign
Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
It said in a letter dated May 7, 1996, that the Permanent
Representative of Singapore to the United Nations informed the UN
Secretary-General that the moratorium would take immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry noted that in recent years "the
irresponsible and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel land-mines
has emerged as one of the most important humanitarian problems
faced by the international community."
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 people are estimated to be injured or killed
by land-mines each year, often long after the conflict has ended.
Many of the victims are non-combatants, especially women and
children, the ministry noted.
</P>
<P>
"The irresponsible and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel
land-mines poses not only grave dangers to civilian populations,
it also poses a serious threat to the safety and lives of UN
personnel participating in humanitarian, peacekeeping and
development programs," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, Singapore also shares the view that it is not
practical to have a blanket ban on all types of APLs as many
countries still see the need for APLs for legitimate self-defense
purposes.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, the fundamental cause of the humanitarian
problems are APLs with no self-destruct or self-neutralizing
mechanisms. They are hard to detect, continue to inflict harm on
civilian populations long after emplacement and are indiscriminate
in their effect," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the two-year moratorium imposed by Singapore will be
confined to the export of APLs that have no self-destruct or
self-neutralizing mechanisms, it added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Object To Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Most of Zimbabwe's 23 commercial farmers
whose farms were redesignated for compulsory acquisition have
objected to the purchase of their properties by the government, the
Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
CFU President Peter Macsporran said that only one farmer had so
far indicated his willingness to sell his farm to the government.
</P>
<P>
''The others who received notices of compulsory acquisition have
lodged their objections with the Ministry of Lands and Water
Resources as required by law.
</P>
<P>
''We are rather surprised that the government has decided to issue
certificates of compulsory acquisition yet some of the owners had
been notified the government was no longer interested in purchasing
their farms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The farmers claimed their farms were fully utilised, highly
productive and employed up to 120 people each.
</P>
<P>
In a notice gazetted on April 12, the government said it would
compulsorily acquire 23 large scale commercial farms with a total
area of about 50,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The farms were first designated in 1993 but the notices sent to
the owners automatically lapsed because the government failed to
acquire them within the time period laid down in the controversial
land acquisition act of 1992.
</P>
<P>
The act empowers the government to compulsorily acquire land for
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
However, a land owner can challenge the designation in writing
within a month of the notice being gazetted.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the government to redesignate the farms comes in
the wake of a recent pledge by President Robert Mugabe that the
government will speed up the resettlement exercise to reduce land
pressure in the communal lands. enditem

<HEADLINE> UK Tory In-fighting Erupts Again on Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Euro-rebels within the
Conservative party launched a campaign to secure a referendum on
Britain's wide relations with the European Union, but they were
immediately refuted by their pro-European colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Sir Teddy Taylor, one of the eight Tory rebels who were kicked
out of the Conservative whip for their opposition to the
government's position on Europe in the winter 1994, told a news
conference here that a plebiscite was the only way to unite the
Tory party.
</P>
<P>
Teresa Gorman, a staunch female Eurosceptic and also one of the
above-said eight, said that British people were "sick of the
government not standing for British interests."
</P>
<P>
Gorman, who claimed last Saturday that she would introduce a
bill in parliament demanding a referendum on Europe, told BBC TV
today that Britons had "become disillusioned with Europe."
</P>
<P>
She renewed her demand for a referendum on the single European
currency.
</P>
<P>
However, pro-European Tory member of parliament Edwine Currie
came out to brand the Eurosceptics as "lunatics."
</P>
<P>
Currie, former health minister and a leading member of the
cross party European Movement, described the European Union as
"the greatest association of trading members this world has ever
seen."
</P>
<P>
She accused the Eurosceptics of going too far in demanding a
referendum on Britain's membership in the EU.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov is leaving Azerbaijan later today for Armenia to help
settle the conflict between the two former Soviet republics,
reports from Baku said.
</P>
<P>
The top Russian diplomat has taken his current trip, which
began earlier today in Azerbaijan, to continue Russia's "shuttle
diplomacy" to settle conflict between the two former Soviet
republics over the Nagorno-Karabakh zone.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today in Baku, he had a meeting with Azerbaijani
President Geidar Aliyev that was joined by experts from both sides.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to hold talks with Armenian leaders on a quick
settlement of the conflict and the exchange of some 100 war
prisoners held for almost two years since the end of the violence
in zone.
</P>
<P>
The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict started in February 1988 when the
ethnic Armenians in Azerbaijan's Armenian-populated enclave asked
to join Armenia, in which many people were killed or wounded.

<HEADLINE> Barak Dismisses UN Report on Israeli Attack on Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud
Barak today dismissed a U.N. criticism of an Israeli military
attack on a U.N. refuge camp in southern Lebanon in April.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. report released Tuesday did not directly accuse
Israeli gunners of intentionally firing the U.N. base at Qana,
which killed more than 90 civilians. But it said that the shelling
was neither accidental nor a technical failure.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if this is exactly what the (U.N.) secretary
general meant, but the whole idea is absurd," Barak told reporters
when asked about the report.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that even the Lebanese know very well that there
is no way Israel has done it intentionally or deliberately,"
Barak added.
</P>
<P>
The former Israeli military chief of staff spoke to reporters
before meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher on
prospects for a defense pact with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that he did not believe the report would have an
adverse affect on a U.S.-brokered cease-fire between Israel and
Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Foreign Affairs Minister
Christon Tembo this morning expressed concern about British High
Commissioner Patrick Nixon's activities in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting between the Minister and the envoy, Tembo
requested Nixon to refrain from his negative conduct, Zambian
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa told reporters
here.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Nixon said the recent local reports portrayed a
wrong picture of his diplomatic activities.
</P>
<P>
He said he had been consistent in his official duties and had
not done anything to undermine the relations that his country had
maintained with Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The envoy pledged to continue working towards the further
strengthening of the good relations existing between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa said following "the clearance of the
misunderstandings", a fresh leaf is opened in the warm relations
that the two countries has enjoyed for a long time.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that Nixon gave a gloomy picture of
Zambian political and economic situation while meeting British
businessmen in the African country.

<P>
BONN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Top-seeded Boris Becker of Germany
edged out Emilio Alvarez of Spain, ranked No. 187 in the world,
but used three sets Wednesday to enter the third round of the
German Open in Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, 23, fell behind when he lost the first set. But he
rallied to win the second and Becker needed all of his experience
to win 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 in two hours, six minutes.
</P>
<P>
Becker, the the reigning Australian Open champion, is ranked
No. 5 in the world. He has 45 career titles including three
Wimbledon crowns, but has never won a tournament on clay.
</P>
<P>
Becker's real challenge will come in the next round when he
plays Gilbert Schaller, the 16th-seeded Austrian who is a top
player on clay.
</P>
<P>
Schaller beat Andrei Olhovskiy 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 (9-7) to reach the
third round. Fourth-seeded Wayne Ferreira ousted Daniel Vacek 6-2,
6-0 in other match on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Personal-Bankruptcy Filling Soars in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Personal-bankruptcy fillings
surged in the U.S. during the first four months of this year as
high debt levels prompted a record number of consumers to seek
protection from creditors.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics compiled by MasterCard International,
total bankruptcy fillings rose 27 percent between January 1 and
April 26 to 318,893. That was the largest four-month rate of
increase since 1986, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
For the four-week period ending April 26, bankruptcy fillings
were running 30 percent higher than the similar year-ago period,
the statistics said.
</P>
<P>
Although many U.S. economists and bankers had been expecting a
sharp pickup in bankruptcies this year, many said that the
fillings were running much higher than they had expected.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the year, U.S. bankers and finance
executives were predicting that a record 1 million Americans would
appeal to the U.S. courts for protection from creditors. But they
now believe as many as 1.1 million Americans will opt for
bankruptcy this year.
</P>
<P>
The higher debt levels, corporate downsizing and medical
setbacks are main reasons contributing to the quick increase of
the bankruptcy fillings. And it also resulted partly from the
liberalization of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code that took effect late
last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve said Tuesday that the U.S. consumer
credit in March was increasing continuously but the pace was
slowing down.

<HEADLINE> EC Urges Efforts to Fight Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) today
urged European Union (EU) countries to crack down on fraud,
pointing out that fraud cases in 1995 increased by 15 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4,750 fraud cases were uncovered in 1995, involving
1.1 billion Ecus (1.32 billion U.S. dollars) of EU funds or up to
1.4 percent of its budget for the year, according to an EC report.
</P>
<P>
Fraud is on the rise in recent years. Cases in 1994 increased
by as high as 64 percent over 1993.
</P>
<P>
The EC appealed for cooperation from the EU members to curb the
wave of fraud.
</P>
<P>
In January, the commission adopted an ambitious program to
intensify its anti-fraud struggle, including spot checks by EU
inspectors, heavy penalties and criminal liability.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU member states signed a convention at the EU summit in
Cannes, France, last June to define abuses of EU funds as an
offense punishable by law. But none of the members has yet
ratified it.

<P>
LASAKA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Minister of Works and Supply
Simon Zukas today resigned from the cabinet with immediate
effect.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here this afternoon, Zukas said, "I have
been obliged to do this in order to give the nation my view on
national issues involved in the debate on the constitution and the
forthcoming presidential elections."
</P>
<P>
According to earlier press reports, Zukas has differed from
the mainstream of the ruling party over a clause in the draft
constitution, which requires that only a second generation
Zambian is qualified to stand as presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
These issues were national and above party politics, said
Zukas, the only white Zambian in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The air must first be cleared as to the basis for presidential
candidates in the coming elections, Zukas said, adding that with the
air cleared, meaningful debate leading to a broad consensus would
then take palce on the draft constitution.
</P>
<P>
"The air in the house is very foggy while the attempt to kill two
birds with one stone persists," he said.

ULAN BATOR, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Artificial snowfalls have helped
curb the quick spread of forest fires in Mongolia, but government
officials said it is still early to be optimistic about a final
victory.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow blanketed the central and northern provinces of
Hovsgol, Ovorkhangai and Arakhangai on Monday after cloud-seeding

</P>
<P>
However, local officials warned that it needs two or three days
before the fires could be declared dead.
</P>
<P>
The fires, which have raged across the nation for more than

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Israeli Foreign Minister
Ehud Barak today expressed optimism about the prospect for a
defense pact alliance between his nation and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Barak told reporters after meeting with U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher that the pact will be reached "within a day or
two."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton had said that the goal of the
U.S.-Israeli defense alliance would be "to meet common threats in
the years to come."
</P>
<P>
Barak and Christopher were named to head a steering committee
to formalize the two countries' longstanding military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers discussed concrete issues concerning
the defense pact, sources close to the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
"U.S.-Israeli strategic cooperation will grow in importance" in
view of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the
Middle East and other threats to regional peace, the White House
had said.
</P>
<P>
Barak also disclosed that Israel will resume peace negotiations
with Syria after elections on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The Israel-Syrian peace talks were suspended in the wake of
bombing attacks at Israeli targets in late February and early
March.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Delegation Leaves for Home After Fruitful Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan government delegation,
whose talks with Pakistani officials here made a major
breakthrough in thawing out the relationship between the two
countries, left today for home.
</P>
<P>
During their three-day visit, the six-member delegation, headed
by Minister of Transport Abdul Ghafar Saim, held talks with
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Aseff Ahmed Ali and officials
from Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office Spokesman said that both sides expressed
satisfaction at the talks.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Afghan delegation offered to reconstruct
the embassy of Pakistan in Kabul, which was burnt down during an
attack on September 6, 1995.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, Pakistan blamed the Kabul government for
failing to protect the embassy during the attack and demanded an
apology and full compensation for the damages, which had been
rejected by Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"The Afghan delegation accepted our claim for compensation for
the damages to our embassy," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation's talks with the Pakistani foreign minister also
focused on the situation in Afghanistan and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Various projects relating to the opening of trade routes among
Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan,
and construction of gas and oil pipelines and railways connecting
these countries also came under discussion.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan delegation also sought Pakistan's help in building
infrastructure in their strife-hit country during their meeting
with the officials of the Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
This is the first official contact between Islamabad and Kabul
in eight months since the burning down of the Pakistani embassy in
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries hit rock bottom after the
incident.

<HEADLINE> Ireland to Declare EU War Against Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government is to declare an
overall fight against drug abuse within the European Union (EU)
during the country's six-month period of the EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
Irish European Affairs Minister Gay Mitchell reportedly said
Wednesday that combating illegal drugs will be high on the agenda
of Ireland when the country takes over the EU presidency from
Italy at the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell pointed out that this indicated a conscious effort to
tackle those problems of direct importance to the ordinary EU
citizens.
</P>
<P>
"Like everyone else in Europe we have a growth drugs problem,
but collectively we have done precious little about the issue,"
he said. "Our level of cooperation in Europe on fighting drugs is
so feeble as to be sinister."
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that a key proposal from the Irish government
would be that developed countries were to provide financial
subsidies to drug-producing countries to persuade their farmers
into giving up those illegal plants.
</P>
<P>
The Irish minister suggested that the scheme would be policed
with the help of spy satellite techniques under the current EU
common agriculture policy.
</P>
<P>
During the Irish presidency, the Irish government will also
strive to make collective efforts with its EU partners to fight
against unemployment and create more job opportunities.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Bumper harvest is expected in the
southern African country Mozambique this year, according to the
United Nations agencies, the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP).
</P>
<P>
The two UN food agencies estimate that the country can have a
grain harvest of 1.3 million tons in the year 1996, a growth of
25 percent over the previous year's 1.05 million tons, the
Mozambique Information Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The estimation is based on a recent survey conducted by the

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Authority Opposed to Extradition of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority has
reiterated its strong opposition to extradition of Hamas political
leader Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook from the U.S. to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of Justice Freih Abu Middein warned today
that the U.S. and Israel are playing with fire over Israel's
request to extradite the Hamas official.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy ruled Wednesday that Abu
Marzook can be extradited to Israel, saying there is reasonable
cause to believe that he is connected to violence.
</P>
<P>
Abu Marzook has been fighting extradition since he was
detained in New York last summer when he tried to enter the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Abu Marzook, 45, contends that he is the leader of the Hamas
political bureau and that he has no control over the activities
of the military wing. He has denied involvement in terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
However, Duffy said, "there is more than sufficient evidence
to show that Abu Marzook was a member of the conspiracy known as
Hamas, and that the acts charged against him were foreseeable
consequences of the conspiracy."
</P>
<P>
Stanley Cohen, Abu Marzook's lawyer, said he will appeal the
ruling, a process that could take years.
</P>
<P>
Israel sought Abu Marzook's extradition in connection with
bombings and stabbings. Israel also contends that Abu Marzook was
a fund-raiser for Hamas.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio, it will be for the U.S. Justice
Department to decide the extradition if ever.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Garment Exports Slightly Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' garment and textile
exports inched up by three percent in the first four months of
1996 to 874 million US dollars from 847.87 million US dollars
recorded a year earlier, the Garment and Textile Exports Board
said today.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the lackluster export performance of the industry
to lower demand, particularly in quota countries such as the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Export sales to the US during the period dropped from 529.05
million US dollars to 523.4 million US dollars despite a slight
increase in terms of volume.
</P>
<P>
This means that prices are going down because of the lower
demand in the US market, officials of the board noted.
</P>
<P>
However, the US remained the single biggest market for the
Philippines' garment and textile during the period, accounting for
almost 60 percent of the industry's total exports.

China's famous Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
Included in the 'top twenty' list of foreign enterprises are
Hitachi, General Motors, Siemens, Shell Oil, Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu International, and Motorola.
</P>
<P>
The companies have become the first members of the
newly-established Overseas Department under "the Qinghua
University and the Enterprises Co-operation Commission," which was
founded today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The commission, a non-profit organization, was set up last July
with the aim of promoting co-operation between Chinese scientific
research institutes and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The commission has 53 members at the present time. Its domestic
members include big name companies such as Baoshan Steel and Iron
Company, Dongfeng Auto Group Company, Yanshan Petrochemical
Corporation and Guangdong Nuclear Power Group.
</P>
<P>
As a leading university in China, Qinghua has intensified its
links with a number of world-famous enterprises. The companies
have taken part in more than 2,000 visits to the university.
</P>
<P>
Wang Dazhong, president of the university, said that
establishment of the department is aimed at consolidating its
traditional ties with overseas enterprises, and at the same time
exploring new co-operation opportunities with them.
</P>
<P>
Wang expressed the hope that his university and overseas
enterprises could expand cooperation in the technologies of
information, biology, materials, energy, environment and in the
joint development of products.

<HEADLINE> North China's Expressway Almost Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A super highway, described by local
officials as the best road China has ever built, is to open to
traffic next month.
</P>
<P>
The Taiyuan-jiuguan Expressway is the first expressway in
north China's Shanxi Province. Work on the last stretch is almost
finished in preparation for its opening on June 25.
</P>
<P>
At a tourism seminar today, Du Wu'an, deputy governor and
director of the provincial communications administration, said the
budget for the expressway will be kept within three billion yuan
(about 361 million US dollars), with the scheme completed two
years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase 90 kilometers of the expressway has been
operational since last October, and over 90 percent of the
remaining stretch will be completed by June 25, almost 50 days
ahead of the anticipated date.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the expressway, Du said, will serve to
facilitate the increasing contact between the province and
neighboring Beijing and Hebei Province, and to boost local
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Work on the expressway, a sample project in terms of speed in
the country's expressway construction, started in September 1993.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi, rich in coal and historic relics, is making efforts to
boost its tourism as one of its five pillar industries in a bid to
make Shanxi one of north China's top tourist attractions. And
construction of roads takes the lead in the strategy.

<HEADLINE> China's Environmental Protection Industry Taking Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The first national survey on China's
environmental protection industry shows that the country's
burgeoning industry is beginning to take shape.
</P>
<P>
The 15-month survey, sponsored by the State Environmental
Protection Bureau and four other state bureaus, was launched in
1994.
</P>
<P>
It obtained one million pieces of basic data and 29 sets of
analysis materials, which set the year 1993 as a survey reference
year, from the country's 29 provinces and regions, and more than
8,000 enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that there are 8,651 environmental protection
enterprises and units in the country, employing almost 1.9 million
people, with an annual output of 31.1 billion yuan (about 3,740
million US dollars), and an annual profit of four billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The products for environmental protection and the comprehensive
utilization of three wastes constitute the backbone of the
industry, and the large number of small enterprises and township
enterprises is the main characteristics of the industry.
</P>
<P>
The equipment dealing with water or air pollution accounts for
about 80 percent of the total number of environmental protection
products.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the year 1988, the number of environmental
protection enterprises and units in 1993 increased by 71 percent,
and the number of workers went up by almost 50 percent, the annual
output increased by more than two times, the annual profit doubled.
</P>
<P>
Although the industry has achieved rapid development, it is in
its early developing stage, with poor basic structures. Imbalance
is found inside the industry, and the locations of the industry
are also out of proportion, mainly concentrating in coastal
regions and areas along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-year Plan(1996-2000), China will try to
industrialize its environmental protection sector.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, China will enlarge the output of its
environmental protection products to hit 25 billion yuan or 30
billion yuan, establishing 100 environmental protection
enterprises with each one's annual output over 20 million yuan,
forming four to five pilot environmental protection sites or
industrial groups.

Federation Pan-Regional Conference in March in Hong Kong.

<P>
"We have mentioned the system to some young diabetic patients
and they have shown great interest," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to launch a pilot study with four or five
patients within the next two months," he said.
</P>
<P>
The system allows patients to input diet, activity and blood
glucose data into a hospital computer system -- using a portable
device or workstation -- to get instant analysis and
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
It also enables medical professionals to closely monitor a
patient's condition making use of the most up-to-date data.
</P>
<P>
Even with patients having medical check-ups only once every
three months, doctors and dietitians can use the system to track a
 diabetic' condition since the records have been updated.
</P>
<P>
Based on a prototype designed by last year's graduates, four
final-year computer studies students developed the system and the
relevant software design to connect the server and
workstation. They have been working on the project since last
September, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Wants to Work with Malaysia on Bosnia Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Hungary is keen to form a
partnership with Malaysia to help reconstruct and rehabilitate
Bosnia-Herzegovina, visiting Hungarian National Assembly Speaker
Zoltan Gal said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Hungary has an adequate level of preparedness to construct
homes, roads and bridges in Bosnia," Gal, who has been on a
six-day visit since Monday, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the upcoming visit to Hungary by Malaysian Minister of
International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz would be an
opportunity for the two sides to discuss the possible
establishment of a joint-venture focusing on Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian Speaker acknowledged that his country, eager to
promote economic cooperation with Malaysia, would have to provide
to the Malaysians more information on potential areas of
cooperation and investment.
</P>
<P>
He said Rafidah's visit would also be an opportunity for
Malaysia to assess Hungary as a possible gateway to eastern and
central Europe.
</P>
<P>
Gal said the Seventh Malaysian Five-Year Plan announced Monday
by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad would open numerous
opportunities for the two countries to conduct mutually beneficial
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also praised Malaysia's approach in handling the various
communities in the country and said it could serve as an example
to other regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
"In Europe, the various ethnic groups have become a source of
political tension," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Gal met Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and
Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Hung Fung-ling, who has preserved
as mother of an autistic child for seven years, Wednesday had her
steadfastness rewarded as she and three others were named Hong
Kong's Mothers of the Year, according to local English Newspaper
Hongkong Standard today.
</P>
<P>
Madam Hung, 36, beamed with pride as she received the award,
accompanied by her husband and her second daughter Lam Wing-man.
</P>
<P>
As her policeman husband cracked under the strain and left
home, the mother-of-four, herself a patient of breast cancer, has
to go on facing the battle alone. The hardest time was when
Wing-man enrolled in a special school as a Primary One pupil, Hung
recalled.
</P>
<P>
Wing-man, unable to cope with the new situation, even sneaked
away from home and strayed around for a day before being found.
</P>
<P>
"I was so helpless and at one time I thought of killing
Wing-man and myself to end the whole thing," said Hung.
</P>
<P>
But, with the help from one of her neighbors, Hung managed
through all the hardship and her husband returned and gave his
support to the family.
</P>
<P>
Finally the situation of their daughter improved and, from ever
since, Hung became much involved in community activities.
</P>
<P>
The three other best mothers awarded Wednesday were Lee
Chung-kai, 35, Tong Shuk-hing, 78, and Yeung Lai-kuen, 52.
</P>
<P>
Also named were ten good mothers in the ceremony jointly held
by the Hong Kong Kai Fong Women's Association, the Women's Center
New Territories Association of Societies and the Hong Kong Women's
Foundation Association.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Hong Kong official said
today that there were signs of improvement in the trade outlook
for Hong Kong in the next few months, despite a more volatile
export performance in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon meeting of the Hong Kong Exporters
Association, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said more orders had
been received most recently than in the early part of the year,

<HEADLINE> Legislators Review Draft Law on Lawyers (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the NPC Standing Committee, Li Ligong and Li Xuezhi,
and vice-chairman of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, Wang
Tong, spoke against some problems within the lawyers' circle.
</P>
<P>
At present, they said, some lawyers are making wild hunts for
money, with great enthusiasm in economic disputes and little
interest in criminal cases, while some others perform poorly in
the courts because they lack ability.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the hope that the draft law could make clear
definitions on the lawyer's activities and charging standards.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Hu Min noted that legal punishments on lawyers who
violate laws are also too light.
</P>
<P>
Some legislators voiced their opinions in favor of the
country's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Zhou Zhan'ao described law consultation as a
"relatively new vocation" in China and called for more protection
for lawyers' rights. He suggested one article be added to the law
to prevent any units or individuals from interfering with defence
lawyers in both criminal and civil cases.
</P>
<P>
He was supported by Li Zhengwen, who urged the law to define
the liabilities of relevant units and individuals to help the
lawyers to collect or examine information and evidence related to
cases.
</P>
<P>
China, which reintroduced lawyers into its judicial system in
1980, now has 89,000 law practitioners. Nearly half a million
people have participated in the exams on lawyers' qualifications,
which started in 1986, and some 70,000 have qualified as lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Legislators Review Draft Law on Lawyers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators are attempting
to hammer out a new law for tighter control of lawyers'
qualifications. They also want the rules to clearly define the
activities of lawyers and their charging standards.
</P>
<P>
During group discussions on the draft law concerning lawyers
today, most legislators attending the current session of the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee in
Beijing held that the law, which had been revised once, is "fairly
good" and will be passed this time after more revision work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they demanded that the draft law should bring in
tighter rules on lawyers' qualifications to guarantee the quality
of the country's legal profession.
</P>
<P>
The draft law stipulates that only people with university or
college degrees of law higher than bachelor's, and who are engaged
in research or teaching of laws, and have acquired senior
professional titles, or those who have similar professional
capabilities, can apply for the law practitioner qualification,
which shall be granted by the judicial departments of the State
Council, if the applicant passes a national examination.
</P>
<P>
Some legislators believe that it is improper to list those who
"have professional capabilities" but have no degrees or titles as
eligible applicants, and asked for the removal of this part.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhengwen, vice-chairman of the People's Congress of
northeast China's Jilin Province, said that there are still a
large number of lawyers in the country who have neither national
examination records nor university degrees.
</P>
<P>
"Clear stipulations shall be added to the law to require them
to either take part in national exams or receive professional
training," he suggested.

QINGDAO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Three more industrial companies in
Qingdao, in east China's Shandong province, have been given
self-determining rights to import and export, bringing the number
of such companies in the city to more than 100.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao city took a lead in the cities enjoying the
provincial-level status in the state economic plan in respect of
import and export development.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the city government has spared no
efforts to strive for the self-determining rights to import and
export for qualified companies in an effort to promote the
development of opening up and enlivening state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, the export volume of these companies reached 415
million US dollars, accounting for 25 percent of the total in the
city.
</P>
<P>
The companies with self-determining rights to import and export
have become a driving force for the city's economic growth. In
1995, while 80 percent of foreign trade firms in the country
suffered losses, the city witnessed 80 percent of these companies
gaining money.

<HEADLINE> Foreign-funded Enterprises Sees a Sharp Rise in Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Recent data from General
Administration of Customs (CAAC) shows that China's foreign-funded
enterprises have seen a 32.2 percent rise in foreign trade during
the first quarter of this year, standing at 26.44 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Exports of those enterprises topped 11.64 billion dollars, up
37.3 percent from the same period of last year, with total imports
reaching 14.8 billion dollars, today's People's Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
However, the increase of the enterprises in newly added
investments hit 4.8 billion dollars in the same period. If the
investment is wiped out from the total imports, then the
enterprises would have reported a surplus of 1.64 billion in
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials said the enterprises's sharp increase in
exports is a big contrast to the country's overall falling export
market and steady import rise.
</P>
<P>
Although the enterprises' growth rate in exports in the first
quarter was lower then the 51.3 percent increase rate of the same
period of last year, the absolute growth rate of the enterprises
in export is sure to surpass that of imports.
</P>
<P>
Also, the enterprises in south China's Guangdong Province rank
first in the country in total foreign trade volume in the first
quarter, which stood at 12.12 billion dollars. The figure accounted
for 45.8 percent of the country's total in the same period.
</P>
<P>
And the northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region saw the
fastest growth rate in China in the sector, which reached 30.94
million dollars, 3.3 times of that of the same period of last
year.

<HEADLINE> National Party To Withdraw From S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Liu Yegang)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The National Party of South
Africa is going to withdraw from the government of national
unity, the party leader and Deputy President F.W.de Klerk
announced at a press conference this afternoon in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday was correctly described as the final moment of the
birth of a nation. Our vision is that a strong political movement
should be developed for a strong multi-party democracy," he told
the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Attending the conference were the National Party's full
parliamentary caucus as well as many ANC MPs and cabinet
ministers' staff.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's first democratic constitution was adopted
yesterday by the Constitutional Assembly in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said: "The National Party had felt for some time that
its influence within the government of National Unity was
dwindling."
</P>
<P>
He described the ANC as having been acting more and more as
though it no longer needed multi-party government.
</P>
<P>
The National Party's dual role as partner in the government of
national unity and as the main opposition party had been
difficult to sustain, he said, adding "we have done so thus far
in the interest of the country".
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the development of a strong and vigilant
oppostion is essential for the maintenance and promotion of a
genuine multi-party democracy," said de Klerk.
</P>
<P>
He declared: "since the new constitution does not provide for
the continuation of any firm joint decision-making in the
executive branch of government, we have decided that the time has
come for us to play our full role as the main opposition party."
</P>
<P>
His party would withdraw from the government at the end of
June, he told the conference.
</P>
<P>
The party's decision to withdraw followed a special meeting of
the party's Federal Executive Council this morning and a
report-back to caucus members.
</P>
<P>
He apologized for delaying the announcement because he had
felt it necesary to inform the president of the party's decision
before making it public.
</P>
<P>
During the constitutional negotiation process, he had already
informed President Mandela of this possibility while National
Party Secretary-general Roelf Meyer had conveyed the same message
to his ANC counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela confirmed this afternoon that the National
Party would withdraw from the government.
</P>
<P>
"I thank him for his contribution," Mandela said in reference
to de Klerk.
</P>
<P>
The president was speaking at a function at a school in
Philippi, Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
He said: "But the ANC is supremely confident that we are going
to carry the government of the country."
</P>
<P>
The ANC was generous and had wanted to build a spirit of
national unity with the government of national unity, Mandela
said, adding he wanted the government to continue until 1999, but
"the national party has withdrawn".
</P>
<P>
The National Party was a "traditionally white party" which had
not accepted change but the ANC was going to force it to change,
he asserted.
</P>
<P>
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) indices nosedived after
opening at 2 pm following the party's decision to withdraw from
the government.
</P>
<P>
A dealer said the JSE industrial index had plummeted 154
points to 7219 by 2:20 pm, while the JSE all gold index had lost
five points to 1433. The all share index was 88 points lower at
6130.

<HEADLINE> Russia Celebrates V-day With Festivities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Russian soldiers
bearing the red Soviet flag paraded in the Red Square today to mark
the defeat of Nazis in 1945.
</P>
<P>
Celebrations of the V-day started this morning with soldiers
carrying the Victory Banner to Red Square.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, together with World War II
veterans and marshals of the former Soviet Union, greeted the
Victory Banner near the Lenin Mausoleum in Red Square.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the parade of troops from the Moscow garrison and
the veterans, Yeltsin said: "The military parade honors heroic Soviet
army, which, with honor, performed its duty during the dreadful
war years to the people, the motherland and the entire world."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, also commander-in-chief of the armed forces,
said: "The Victory Red Banner...is together with us on this
holiday. The Soviet army proudly carried the banner...near the
walls of the ancient Kremlin 51 years ago."
</P>
<P>
"This sacred symbol of the motherland is fluttering over Red
Square as peace is over Russia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Following his speech, the anthem of the Russian Federation
and artillery salutes were rendered.
</P>
<P>
Then, trumpets signaled the start of the march, which began
with the traditional report by the parade commander and his
inspection of troops together with Defense Minister Pavel Grachev.
</P>
<P>
The parade involved 7,370 servicemen. Unlike victory parades in
the Soviet times, heavy military equipment, such as amored
vehicles and missiles, was not present.
</P>
<P>
The Russian leadership, including Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and speakers of the two houses of the parliament, and
generals ascended onto the mausoleum for the first time in several
years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, festivities started early in the morning in all
parks in the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
Moscow's Central Park again became one of the main meeting
places for war veterans. Yeltsin visited the park at noon.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, a festive concert will start at an open-air
variety theater, where young actors and actresses will perform
songs of the war years. The sky over the park will be lighted with
fireworks tonight, as a prelude to a salute all over the city in
honor of the victors.
</P>
<P>
At the entrance to the park, a war veteran, retired colonel
Alexander Kovalenko, said: "We hope our children and grandchildren
will always live in the radiant and enchanting spring sunshine. We
should defend peace."

<HEADLINE> Lianyungang Strives for Greater Role in Euro-Asia Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lianyungang, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Lianyungang, the city at the
start of the new Euro-Asia continental bridge in eastern China,
plans to play a greater role in the important passage to
international trade.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one hundred officials and experts from more than 30
countries, regions and international organizations visited the
city this afternoon, after ending a three-day symposium in Beijing
on economic development of regions along the bridge.
</P>
<P>
The new Euro-Asia continental bridge, starting from the eastern
Pacific coastal city of Lianyungang and ending in the eastern
Atlantic coastal city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, forms a
comprehensive international corridor connecting Asia with Europe,
mainly by means of land communications.
</P>
<P>
Local officials told the visitors that Lianyungang has an
annual port handling capacity of nearly 200,000 standard
containers in place thanks to years of infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
The city has established shipping links with 630 ports in 120
countries and regions, officials said.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, 8,448 international containers were
transported along the bridge from Lianyungang to other countries.
</P>
<P>
As more and more international traders begin to make use of the
bridge, Local officials expect that more than 20,000 containers
will be sent onto the bridge from Lianyungang this year.
</P>
<P>
Pieter Jan Jongman from Rotterdam said that his city started
friendly cooperation with Lianyungang five years ago, and such
ties are expected to be expanded in the coming years to produce a
brighter prospect of development.

<HEADLINE> Students Set Anti-Smoking Example </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Just one week before the Chinese
capital carries out a ban on smoking in public places, a medical
academy here has announced that it will no longer recruit students
who smoke.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Medical College will, in addition, not employ
graduates who smoke to teach at the school or work in hospitals
attached to the college, the "China Youth Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
As part of efforts to create a "smoke-free college", the school
will not offer scholarships or allowances to students who smoke,
the paper quoted the president of the college, Wang Debing, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Student smoking is serious in this school, where smokers among
senior students outnumber freshman smokers by four to five times,
according to a survey.
</P>
<P>
China's Minister of Public Health Chen Minzhang has urged 11
medical academies across the country, including this college, to
set examples of controlling smoking, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"As places to foster senior medical personnel, the medical
colleges should take the lead in controlling smoking," Chen said
in letters to the schools on April 17.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Zhejiang Medical Academy and the Shanghai Medical
Sciences University in east China have announced that they will
ban smoking completely.
</P>
<P>
Another report said that Beijing plans to name 100 "smoke-free
schools", including primary schools, high schools, vocational
schools, colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
Students should not smoke anywhere, and teachers,
administrative staff and adult visitors should not smoke in
schools. Parents should make sure that the students do not smoke
at home, either, the "Beijing Evening News" said.
</P>
<P>
China has 350 million smokers, including about five million
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
A survey found that among every four adult smokers, three began
to puff on cigarettes when they were 15 to 24 years old, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> China Declares War On Shoddy Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China plans to clean up leased
counters in commercial stores to drive shoddy goods off the
shelves.
</P>
<P>
"Many low-quality and fake goods enter the market via leased
counters," said Li Rongrong, vice-minister of the State Economic
and Trade Commission, at a conference today on the cracking down
on shoddy products.
</P>
<P>
"Some state-owned shops have a lax management over those
counters, and even bribes and discounts have been offered that
allows the flow of shoddy products," Li claimed.
</P>
<P>
"'Cleaning up' leased counters will first be tried in bigger
commercial stores, each with annual transactions topping 100
million yuan," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be concentrated in south China's Guangdong
Province, east China's Zhejiang Province, north China's Hebei
Province, central China's Henan Province, and southwest China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region where most of China's shoddy
products are found.
</P>
<P>
More harsh measures will taken to deal with major
shoddy-commodity-related cases, Li noted, "cases involving fake
pesticides, seeds, fertilizers, and medicines, which have raised
angry reaction among the masses, should be tackled seriously".
</P>
<P>
"The campaign against shoddy products has received wide support
from general public, however, some problems have yet to be
solved," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"In some localities, punishment has not been serious enough,
local protectionism has hampered the campaign, chaotic commercial
circulation has spurred the spread of shoddy products, and some
people have resisted with force legal action to get rid of shoddy
products," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Price of Soybean May Rise this Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The price of China's soybeans is
expected to increase this year, market analysts have predicted.
</P>
<P>
They point a finger of blame at a decrease in growing
acreage in China and worldwide.
</P>
<P>
According to analysis provided by the National Grain, Edible
Oil and Fodder Information Network, the upturn of soybean prices on
the domestic Chinese market since last September is mainly
attributable to three reasons.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the soybean growing area nationwide is down by 1.13
million hectares in 1995, causing output to be reduced by 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, domestic demand has kept its momentum, mainly because
of the growing popularity of high-protein soybean food.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, more soybeans are exported from China. China
began to sell soybeans to Japan and to Democratic Republic of
Korea last September.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Statistics Bureau, the soybean growing
area will continue to decrease by 2.9 percent this year, and the
supply of soybean will be about 14.81 million tons, lower than the
15.53 million tons of last year. The main reason for the decrease
is because the returns from growing soybean is lower that maize,
experts noted.
</P>
<P>
"The shortfall in the domestic supply will need to be
compensated by imports," an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
The US Department of Agriculture predicted in early March that
the world soybean output in the 95/96 year will be 1237.6 billion
tons, a fall of 9.85 percent than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Because of a bumper harvest refilling world stocks, the price
of the soybean has not seen the upward trend.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Ice Melting in Pak-Afghan Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 9 (Xinhua) -- After eight months of ups and
downs in their bilateral relations, Pakistan and Afghanistan made
their first official contact this week to mend fences.
</P>
<P>
Holding of the crucial Pak-Afghan talks in Islamabad this week
is widely believed as "a major breakthrough" in thawing out the
strained relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As a major development after the three-day visit by an Afghan
government delegation to Islamabad, Kabul has tendered an apology
for the ransacking and torching of the Pakistani Embassy building
in Kabul last September and has agreed "in principle" to pay
compensation.
</P>
<P>
It is for the first time that the Afghan government made an
official acknowledgment and accepted Pakistan's conditions for
compensation.
</P>
<P>
Since the burning of its embassy in Kabul, Pakistan has
demanded 467.7 million US dollars in compensation for human and
material losses as well as an unconditional apology from the
Afghan government.
</P>
<P>
This latest development stemming from the talks is widely
considered to be positive and constructive, and it is known to be
the first step towards the resumption of full-fledged diplomatic
ties between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in Islamabad, the six-member Afghan
government delegation headed by Minister of Transport Abdul Ghafar
Saim also held talks on various projects relating to the opening
of trade routes connecting Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan,
Uzbekistan and Tajikistan and the construction of gas and oil
pipelines. Railways connecting these countries also came under
discussion.
</P>
<P>
Official sources here said that the Afghan delegation,
representing various Afghan groups allied with the Rabbani
government and ministries, also sought Pakistan's help in building
infrastructure in their war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
today that the Afghan government hopes that Pakistan would not
only support but also participate in Afghanistan's reconstruction
process, to which a positive response has been made.
</P>
<P>
However, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Aseff Ahmed Ali voiced
Islamabad's concern during the talks with the Afghan delegation
over the persisting instability in Afghanistan and has urged all
Afghan leaders to work for a negotiated political settlement of
the long-drawn-out conflict. He also offered Pakistan's mediatory
help in effecting a reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan, though still suffering from flames of a civil war,
has doubtless assumed added geo-political significance for
Pakistan since the disintegration of the former Soviet Union and
the emergence of a huge potential Central Asian market.
</P>
<P>
Peace and stability in Afghanistan is, by all means, vital to
the security of its neighbors. Pakistan is expected to continue to
play a positive role in the Afghan issue with a view to its
possible economic and trade opportunities in Afghanistan and other
Central Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Taking the initiative to invite the Afghan government
delegation one week ahead of the Fourth Summit of the 10-nation
Economic Cooperation Organization is a clear indication of
Pakistan's endeavors.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Develops Brand-Name Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 95 brand-name products
produced in northwest China's Gansu Province have contributed
greatly to local economic growth, according to the provincial
authorities.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six such products the province approved last year
generated an annual output value of 1.74 billion yuan and profits
and taxes totalling 363 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
And 59 brand-name products had an output value of 5.77 billion
yuan, profits and taxes totalling 1.32 billion yuan and export
earnings of 30.19 million yuan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Some of the key products in Gansu have reached world standards,
and others are taking the lead in quality in domestic markets,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials attributed the success to the province's
preferential policies to encourage the development of brand-name
products by providing strong support in the fields of funding,
energy, transport, taxation, and technology.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province has set a target of expanding
brand-name products in ten sectors such as non-ferrous metals,
metallurgy, petrochemicals, machinery and electronics, and
petrochemical machinery.

bureau, the province has worked out a strategy for its tourist
industry: to lay a sound basis by the end of this century, explore
and expand tourist resources and products between 2000 and 2005,
and make the industry a pillar in the local economy by 2010.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the province plans to play host to 200,000 overseas
tourists and 20 million domestic visitors, earning a profit of 6.5
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
He Guangwei, Director of National Tourism Administration, said
China's tourism industry should explore more new products and
promote the industry with more publicity.
</P>
<P>
The industry weighs heavily on the development of a province's
economic growth, He said, adding that Shanxi will become one of
the country's hot tourism spots in the future, as it strives to
make the industry the pillar in local development.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi is one of the most important part of the cradle of the
Chinese nation, Chinese civilization and traditional culture,
famous as a museum of Chinese ancient culture and art.
</P>
<P>
It boats over 31,000 historical relics, the largest collection
in China. The number of its stone carvings, color sculptures,
frescoes and architecture ranks first in China.
</P>
<P>
Bo Xicheng, senior travel expert and chairman of Beijing
Liuhexing Hotel Management Company, said Shanxi, as a place with
rich historical relics and scenic spots, has good prospects for
tourism, with the planned investments and with the improvement of
its its environment and more effective publicity.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Kenyan Ministers Discuss Bilateral Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi and Kenya's Minister of Finance
Musalia Mudavadi held talks here today, exchanging views on
bilateral cooperation in economy, trade, tourism, education,
culture and other areas.
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi thanked China for its economic assistance over the
past many years. He said that Chinese companies have done a
satisfactory job in Kenya, thus having helped promote the
economic growth of this country.
</P>
<P>
Joining the talks, Kenya's Minister of Commerce and Industry
Kirugi M'Mukindia said Kenya welcomes Chinese companies to set up
enterprises and increase investment in this country in an effort
to help balance bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
Wu said China has offered assistance within its ability to
Kenya since the two countries established diplomatic ties 33
years ago. She noted that such assistance is limited since China
itself is a developing country.
</P>
<P>
With the development of economy and the increase of national
strengthen, she said, China will be able to provide more aid to
Kenya and the Sino-Kenyan economic cooperation will be further
developed.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Chinese government has noted the imbalance
in Sino-Kenyan trade ties and is taking measures to resolve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The foreign trade minister stressed that the problem of
imbalance should be settled through the development of trade ties
rather than reducing the trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Wu said China encourages Chinese companies to establish joint
ventures or solely-owned enterprises in Kenya and she suggested that
the two sides set up a working group to study the issues concerning
the establishment of Chinese enterprises in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Wu is accompanying Chinese President Jiang Zemin on a visit to
this country.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Troops Conclude Limited Cross-Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish government troops concluded
this morning a "limited" cross-border operation against Kurdish
rebels escaping into northern Iraq, said military sources here.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia news agency reported that some
1,200 government troops who chased after the Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) militants in the southeast turned their mission into
a cross-border operation since last Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said the troops had reached their targets and
withdrew from northern Iraq this morning. But they didn't give
the details concerning casualties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Nurettin
Nurkan told a press conference today that Turkey was determined
to restore the security along its border with Iraq and that the
cross-border operations Turkish troops carried out from time to
time were "very limited."
</P>
<P>
Nurkan said that Turkey could not tolerate the presence of PKK
in northern Iraq, where the rebels were entrenched and organized
attacks in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He also denied the reports that the operations had led to
civil casualties in northern Iraq. He claimed that the operations
were carried out in areas without civil habitation.
</P>
<P>
However, according to representatives based in Ankara for the
Mesut Barzani-led Iraq Kurdistan Democratic Party, the latest
cross-border operation had forced 160 Iraqi Kurdish families
leave their homes and wounded one civilian.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said Turkish jet fighters and helicopter
gunships were involved in the operation during which government
troops penetrated up to 10 kilometers inside northern
Iraq.

HAIKOU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Twelve Chinese fisherman, who owe
their lives to clinging onto logs after their trawler overturned,
have returned home.
</P>
<P>
The twelve Hainan fishermen were rescued by the crew of a
Taiwan fishing trawler. They have been safely escorted to their
homes by a unit of the navy of the PLA (People's Liberation Army)
stationed at Xisha Islands.
</P>
<P>
At 8:10 am April 21, fishermen from Qionghai City, Hainan
Province were operating in the sea about 113 degrees East and
15 degrees North, when their engine suddenly broke down.
</P>
<P>
A strong gale soon overturned their vessel, leaving the crew
struggling in the stormy sea by embracing logs or other objects.
</P>
<P>
After receiving a distress signal for help, a Taiwan vessel
fishing in nearby waters went to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan vessel had to take shelter from the wind in a safer
place for two days before it eventually arrived at Yongxing
Island, Xisha Islands at 3 pm April 24.

incremental exports, the most contentious issue in the IRR.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreed IRR, the first five percent increase on
exports would be granted a 2.5 percent tax credit and five percent
for the next five percent increase. The third five percent
additional export would be allowed a 7.5 percent tax credit.
</P>
<P>
Exporters posting 15 percent or more in their export
commitments would receive a 10 percent tax credit.
</P>
<P>
On the local value added (LVA), the two government departments
have agreed to adopt the bracketing scheme wherein exports with an
LVA of 10 percent and below would not be eligible for incentives
on their incremental exports.

<HEADLINE> Mandela On South African Government's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela said today that although a National Party withdrawal from
the cabinet would be regrettable, the ANC (African National
Congress) would not allow the government of National Unity to
continue beyond 1999.
</P>
<P>
"I hope wise counsel will prevail," he said in reaction to
reports that the National Party's Federal Council would meet
today to discuss the party's withdrawal from the government.
</P>
<P>
Addressing members of the Cape Town Press Club and the foreign
correspondents' association, the president declined to speculate
on the effects of such a move.
</P>
<P>
"Let's wait and see," he said.
</P>
<P>
National Party leader F.W.de Klerk told the Constitutional
Assembly yesterday that his party's consideration of a possible
withdrawal from the government was "unavoidable".
</P>
<P>
"This is a logical question against the background of the fact
that the new constitution makes no provision in any manner for
continued joint decision making in the executive branch of
government," said de Klerk, who is also second deputy president
of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's first democratic constitution was formally
adopted by the Constitutional Assembly yesterday by 421 votes to
2, with 10 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said today that even though the government of National
Unity would disappear in 1999, the ANC had a "global policy" that
there should be government by consensus.
</P>
<P>
"That is what we believe in, irrespective of what the
constitution says," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president said that as far back as 1986 when he was still
in prison, he had written to the then president P.W.Botha and
said one of the challenges facing the government and the ANC was
to convince the white minority that majority rule did not mean
blacks would oppress whites.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Posts and
Telecommunications Administration (SPTA) is co-operating with two
U.S.-funded high-tech companies to build the first large-scale
commercial on-line information service in China.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai On-Line is the first and a very important part of the
`Shanghai Info Port' project," said Han Ying, manager of the
Public Relations Department of the Asia Info Beijing Computer
Network Company (AIBCNC) here today.
</P>
<P>
This marks a significant step forward in the construction of
the Shanghai Information Infrastructure Project, Han added.
</P>
<P>
Besides providing dial-up and leased-line access to the public
global Internet, Shanghai On-Line will mainly focus on providing
local and national information to the public and especially to the
business community.
</P>
<P>
It will have five large distributed data banks covering various
areas like business information, travel, news, "yellow pages",
tourism, and other international information service.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project, which is expected to be
completed in July this year, will cost an estimated 25 million
yuan provided by the SPTA, while the AIBCNC will render technical
guidance and installation.
</P>
<P>
The two partners, both part of the Dallas, Texas,-based Asia
Info Group, won the contract in fierce competition among domestic
and international candidates.
</P>
<P>
Last year the two firms won the contract to build the Chinanet,
one of the world's largest commercial internet backbones, covering
the whole of China.

<HEADLINE> Manila Mulls Opening Up of AFTA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has been informally
consulting the other members of ASEAN on the possibility of
widening the Free Trade Area in the region to include APEC members
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Cesar Bautista said today
that the opening up of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) has been
proposed by former finance secretary Jesus Estanislao.
</P>
<P>
Estanislao is the Philippine government adviser to the APEC
(Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum.
</P>
<P>
However, Bautista said the Philippine government has neither
acted upon the proposal nor adopted it as a Philippine position.
</P>
<P>
"We are just informally consulting fellow ASEAN (the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations) members outside of
corridors," Bautista said, adding that the idea "is not even an
agenda in the ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
"We are exploring ways to modify the concept," Bautista said,
"to make it more acceptable to other ASEAN countries."
</P>
<P>
Programs regarding the AFTA are now being implemented through
the Common Effective Preferential Tariff calling for a zero to 5
percent tariff rates on manufactured products traded within the
region by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Estanislao also suggested that the plan would be unveiled at
the APEC leaders' meeting in November and be submitted at the
first ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization in
Singapore in December.

<HEADLINE> Top Mathematics Institute Overwhelmed by Amateurs' Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Chinese amateur
mathematicians are claiming to have solved a 254-year-old problem
since the country's top mathematician Chen Jingrun died one month
ago.
</P>
<P>
However, not one of them has come up with the right answer,
according to researchers at a leading Chinese mathematics
institute here today.
</P>
<P>
The "Goldbach conjecture", which was first put forward by a
German mathematician in 1742 and has been considered the world's
most difficult maths problem, proposes that every even number
greater than two can be represented as the sum of two primes (one
plus one), or every even number greater than two is a Goldbach
number.
</P>
<P>
But the best research finding did not come until 1973, when
Academician Chen Jingrun, a researcher and professor at the
Institute of Mathematics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS), published a paper in the journal "Chinese Science".
</P>
<P>
"Professor Chen improved the estimate of the coefficient on the
Goldbach conjecture, clearing away another obstacle to solving the
difficult problem," a researcher from the maths institute said.
</P>
<P>
Chen's paper not only impressed the international mathematical
community, his work also caught the attention of China's late
Chairman Mao Zedong and late Premier Zhou Enlai in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
Mao and Zhou reportedly personally instructed CAS to improve
Chen's medical care, housing and working conditions.
</P>
<P>
In the more than two decades since then, Chen's life and work
have been widely covered by the Chinese press, and his name has
become a household word.
</P>
<P>
Chen's success has tempted tens of thousands of young Chinese
mathematicians to study the "Goldbach conjecture" over the past
two decades. "Chen's recent death was just like fuel poured on a
smoldering `Goldbach fire'," said a CAS researcher.
</P>
<P>
"We have been overwhelmed in recent weeks by letters and papers
claiming to have solved the problem," said a spokesman for the
Institute of Mathematics, "But almost all the letters and papers
we received in recent weeks were full of mistakes and some of the
mistakes were so obvious that even high-school students could have
spotted them."
</P>
<P>
"Most of the authors of these letters and papers obviously
learned about the Goldbach theory from newspaper accounts and they
have never read any serious research papers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to build a space ship with just a saw and a
plane," he noted, "and you can't solve the Goldbach conjecture
with just elementary mathematics.
</P>
<P>
"Amateur mathematicians should not waste their time doing
fruitless work," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Leading Chinese mathematicians held that a complete new
mathematical theory is needed to eventually solve the Goldbach
conjecture.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Major Oil Producers Still Await </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Crisis of low crude production may be
in the offing in Nigeria as the country's major oil producing
companies are yet to approve budgets for this year's workload.
</P>
<P>
The implication of this development would be Nigeria's
inability to realize crude oil production capacity of 2.5 million
barrels per day and the reserve level of 25 billion barrels, the
local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The leading oil producing companies are ll joint ventures with
foreign partners, including Chevron, Elf, Agip, Shell, Mobil and
Texaco. They are waiting for the budget to be approved by the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
</P>
<P>
Joint venture operations account for 85 percent of the
country's oil production. The Nigerian government, through the
NNPC, holds about 60 percent interest in each of the major oil
producing companies and the work of the joint venture partners
(the major oil producing companies) is funded 55-60 percent by
the NNPC.
</P>
<P>
The government should reduce its equity holding through
divestment, said managing director of Mobil producing unlimited
Jim Massey yesterday, adding that it is a solution to the problem
of irregular funding to oil producing companies.
</P>
<P>
The inability of the NNPC to regularly meet its funding
obligations to major oil producing companies is killing the
oil industry of the country, he said.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China is country which has over
5,000 years of history and no one has the right to tell the
Chinese people what way of living they should adopt.
</P>
<P>
He added that Kenya also faces external pressure in this
aspect but Kenya has decided to walk along its own way.
</P>
<P>
Moi expressed the hope that Kenya and China further enhance
their cooperation in the international affairs so as to work
together for the future of mankind.
</P>
<P>
On the economic cooperation and trade ties between the two
countries, Jiang said China believes such relations have immense
potentials.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the cooperation at the government level, Jiang
said, China is to encourage the enterprises of the two countries
to expand cooperation and make effort to find out more areas of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will consider offering its help in
those areas which assistances are in urgent need.
</P>

whether in the form of sole Chinese fund or in the form of
joint-ventures.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese enterprises have established cooperative
projects successfully in Kenya, saying that China's help is
valuable since there is no conditions attached.

economy structure, hopes to increase cooperation with China in
various areas and welcomes China's participation in the process
of such reforms.
</P>
<P>
He added that Kenya can learn from China's experience in
developing medium-sized and small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Jiang on the situation in eastern Africa, President
Moi said the situation in this region is still unstable and there
exist some difficulties and problems in Kenya's neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
As Chairman of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development
(IGAD), Kenya has always played a positive role by maintaining
consultations and coordination with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He said Kenya will continue to play its role by mediating on
the domestic conflicts and the disputes between IGAD's member
countries.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Kenyan government's foreign policy, Jiang
said China admires Kenya's efforts in pursuing an independent and
non-aligned foreign policy, opposing external interferences,
safeguarding the country's sovereignty and dignity, upholding
good-neighborly relationships and striving for peaceful
settlement of regional conflicts.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- On the other hand, the presidents
noted, the overall strength of the developing world is growing
stronger and the portion of the developing countries' economy is
growing bigger in the world economy. Also, the right to speak of
the developing countries in the international affairs has been
increasing.
</P>
<P>
As the vast majority of the world, the developing countries
should always strengthen unity and cooperation and make their
status more prominent so as to contribute to the establishment of
a peaceful, stable and reasonable new world political and
economic order as well as to maintaining world peace and
development, the two heads of state noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Moi also agreed that, as developing countries, China
and Kenya face the common tasks of maintaining domestic
stability, developing national economy and raising the people's
living standards.
</P>
<P>
They said there are good prospects for the developing
countries as long as they unite with each other and make full use
of their own abilities.
</P>
<P>
Briefing his host on China's domestic situation, Jiang said
China, according to senior leader Deng Xiaoping's theories of
building a socialism with Chinese characteristics, has scored
achievements in building socialist market economy and will try to
maintain a sustained, rapid and healthy growth of the national
economy based on Deng's theories.
</P>
<P>
China will allow some people in some areas to become rich
sooner while promoting the common prosperity of the people of all
nationalities.
</P>
<P>
President Moi said Kenya, which is also focusing on economic
reforms, can draw experience from China's economic development,
which has caught the eyes of the world people.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- He added that Presdient Moi has
played a positive role in promoting the settlement of some hot
spot issues in this region.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that Kenya is an important country in the
eastern African region and an major force in promoting regional
peace, development and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the China-Africa relations, Jiang said China and
African countries have similar historic backgrounds and now face
the common tasks of building their own countries. As major forces
on the international stage, both China and Africa bear
responsibilities on world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
China attaches importance to the Africa's roles in the
international affairs and holds that there is no world progress
and prosperity without peace and development in Africa, Jiang
noted.
</P>
<P>
A basic point of China's policy on Africa is to continuously
strengthen solidarity and cooperation with Africa so as to make
contributions for the lofty cause of peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Under the new international situation, Jiang added, China is
willing to increase contacts and common grounds with African
nations in order to forge with them the long-term and stable
state-to-state relations of all-round cooperation facing the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, he said, China and African countries will become
"reliable and all-weather friends."
</P>
<P>
Jiang added that the two sides will develop the cooperative
ties of mutual benefit without any preconditions in order to seek
common development. Also, the two sides will seek closer
discussions and cooperation and jointly safeguard the rights of
the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Discussing the international situation, the two heads of state
agreed that the world, which has undergone profound changes after
the Cold War, is generally moving toward relaxation and
multipolirazation.
</P>
<P>
While seeking peace and development has become the main stream
of today's world, the two presidents pointed out, hegemonism and
power politics still exist, making the world not so tranquil.
</P>
<P>
Some country, posing itself as world police, tends to
manoeuvre the international affairs and impose its own will on
and even sanctions against other countries, Jiang said, adding
that many developing countries have suffered a lot from this
situation.

offices in makeshift accommodation after January's bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank sources today, more than 1,000 employees
at all levels, including executives, stop their work for two hours
every day demanding better conditions.
</P>
<P>
The daily picket campaign began Tuesday and will continue until
the demands are addressed, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources stated that the bank's workforce of more than 2,000
people was now working in shifts to stagger office hours due to
the lack of space in the present location.

<HEADLINE> Kong Says He Has Fifty-fifty Chance Against Waldner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua/OANA) -- World and World Cup table
tennis champion Kong Linhui said here on Thursday that
newly-crowned European singles champion Jan-Ove Waldner is the
biggest obstacle on his road to the Olympic honor.
</P>
<P>
Kong, who was attending a press conference on the coming China
All-Star table tennis tournament on Thursday, said he has only a
fifty-fifty chance should he meets the 30-year-old Swede in this
summer's Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Waldner, who had been struggling to find his form after the
world championships in May last year, won the only title to have
eluded him in a 15-year-old career in the European championships
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Waldner is famed for his experience, wickedly deceptive serves
and follow-up attacks, he is my number one rival," said the
20-year-old Kong.
</P>
<P>
Kong, who downed defending champion Jean-Philippe Gatien of
France en route to the singles title in the world championships,
said the fast-attacking Frenchman and current world number two
Jean-Michael Saive of Belgium are forces to reckon with.
</P>
<P>
If Kong wins the singles title at the Olympic Games, he will
join all-time great Waldner as a holder of world championship,
World Cup and Olympic titles.
</P>
<P>
Kong is to take part in the China All-Stars table tennis
tournament slated for May 18-19, the event attracts top eight
men's and women's players in the nation.
</P>
<P>
Liu Guoliang, world singles runner-up, and Wang Tao and Lu Lin,
who combined to win the Olympic and world doubles titles, are
among the other men's players.
</P>
<P>
Reigning world mixed champion Liu Wei will again challenge
world top player Deng Yaping in the women's competition. In the
Chinese Table Tennis Association Cup in April, Liu edged out Deng
on the way for the singles title.

<HEADLINE> Seminar On Flight Techniques Prepares Crews For 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 150 pilots and flight
technicians from China's civil aviation industry and the air force
attended a seminar on flight techniques for the next century,
which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The two-day event, co-organized by the Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group and the China Civil Aviation Association, deals
with new trends in flight deck design and air control management,
and new flight safety problems crews might encounter with the
development of flight techniques.
</P>
<P>
Captain J. Kenneth Higgins, vice-president of flight operations
and testing, and James E. Veitengruber, chief of flight deck
engineering of Boeing's civil aircraft arm, are the main lecturers
at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988 Boeing has held training courses and seminars on
flight safety and airline management for the technical and
management staff of the Chinese aviation industry, said Yeh Huang,
vice-president of Boeing China.
</P>
<P>
He said hundreds of Chinese pilots and other flight crew
members have been sent to Boeing for training, and the company is
co-operating with China's civil aviation authorities on a major
project to improve China's air traffic management system.
</P>
<P>
"Boeing will hold more such activities in China in the future,"
Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Boeing planes account for nearly 70 percent of the total of
Western-made commercial airplanes now in use in China.
</P>
<P>
Its arch-rival, the European consortium Airbus Industrie, is
vigorously competing with Boeing for a bigger share of the Chinese
civil aviation market, the world's fastest-growing one with an
annual growth rate of 20 percent in its air traffic flow.
</P>
<P>
Airbus held a similar seminar in Sichuan Province in
March. During Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to France last
month, a deal involving the purchase of 30 Airbuses worth about
1.5 billion US dollars was struck between China and the consortium.
</P>
<P>
China plans to add about 300 new planes to its commercial
fleet, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China, of
which the vast majority will be Western-made ones manufactured by
Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas, among others.

Continental Bridge ended here today with the adoption of a
chairman's statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on all countries along the bridge, no
matter whether they are big or small, rich or poor, to enhance
co-operation on the basis of the principles of voluntary
participation, equality and mutual benefit, promotion of
sustainable development, training human resources, increasing
employment, promoting balanced development and alleviating poverty.
</P>
<P>
The inland countries along the Continental Bridge will require
appropriate financial and technical assistance to achieve
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
This should be provided by donor countries and multilateral
financial and technical assistance organizations in a manner that
will benefit inland countries by accelerated international trade,
investment and technology transfer, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, which opened Tuesday, attracted 460 officials
and scholars from 30 countries and regions and 15 world
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Thai-US Study on Mother-Child HIV Transmission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and the United States have
launched a joint study on the effectiveness of the drug AZT in
preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission.
</P>
<P>
Under the study, two doses of 300 milligrams of AZT would be
given to each of some 400 women in their ninth month of pregnancy
and during labor, to see whether it can reduce mother-to-child
transmission of HIV, a virus which leads to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women in the study would also be advised not to
breast-feed their children, for it is known that HIV can be
transmitted through breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
If AZT is proven successful, it is expected to help reduce
mother-infant HIV transmission among the estimated 20,000
HIV-infected women who give birth each year in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
This is the second major study on the use of AZT to reduce
mother-child perinatal transmission. The results are expected in
15-18 months.
</P>
<P>
The first study, carried out jointly by the US and France,
showed that AZT could reduce mother-child HIV transmission by
two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
But the dosage was too costly to be feasible for developing
countries. The new experiment is much cheaper.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Records Smaller Trade Deficit In February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia announced here today
that its trade deficit in February was 747.1 million Malaysian
ringgit (about 298.84 million US dollars), compared with the 1.1
billion ringgit (about 440 million dollars) deficit recorded in
January.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's statistics department said in a statement released
here today that the trade deficit for January-February however
amounted to 1.9 billion ringgit (about 760 million dollars), 1.6
billion ringgit (about 640 million dollars) more than the 325.4
million ringgit (about 130.16 million dollars) deficit for the
same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
The department explained that the increased deficit in the
first two months of the year was mainly due to a 14.9 percent
increase in imports to 31 billion ringgit (about 12.4 billion
dollars) while exports grew merely 9.2 percent to 29.1 billion
ringgit (about 11.64 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Figures show that machinery and transport equipment, which
represented 18.7 billion ringgit (about 7.48 billion dollars) or
60.4 percent of the total import expenditure, remained the largest
contributor to the increase.
</P>
<P>
Major components also include ships, boats and floating
structures, mechanical handling equipment and parts and other
specialized machinery.
</P>
<P>
The statement also indicates that Malaysia's imports came
mainly from Japan (2.8 billion dollars), the United States (2.4
billion dollars), Singapore (1.56 billion dollars) and South Korea
(608 million dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua)-- King Mswati iii of Swaziland
announced at a special meeting yesterday that he had sacked
74-year-old Prime Minister Mbilini Dlamini with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
He called the meeting at Ludzidzini, 80 km south of the
capital Mbabane, South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The king did not name a replacement for Prince Mbilini, who
has been prime minister since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The monarch also announced that he had set up a people's
parliament at Ludzidzini, which will start hearing constitutional
submissions by ordinary Swazis from today.
</P>
<P>
Two advisory bodies, a constitutional committee and the
Swaziland National Council, will also be set up, the monarch
said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela of South Africa, President Mugabe of
Zimbabwe and President Masire of Botswana were to atted the first
session of the people's parliament, he added.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for President Mandela in Pretoria, however, denied
the president would be visiting South Africa's tiny neighbour in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
"We know nothing of president Mandela visiting Swaziland,"
Presi- dential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
Political and trade union leaders left the meeting yesterday
in disgust after it became apparent that King Mswati, who has
absolute authority over his 900,000 subjects, had no intention of
lifting a 1973 decree which bans political activity.
</P>
<P>
In his budget speech in April, the king promised an overhaul
of the country's constitution, saying it had to be "reviewed like
a car which needs to be serviced".
</P>
<P>
Opposition political parties who have formed the Swaziland
Democratic Alliance have joined the Swaziland Federation of Trade
Unions in demanding political reforms and an end to a state of
emer- gency imposed in 1973 by King Mswati's father, King Sobusa

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Industry to Hold Roundtable Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The price-depressed Australian wool
industry will hold a roundtable meeting in Canberra next Thursday
aimed at restoring confidence, Minister for Primary Industries and
Energy John Anderson said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting would address the fundamental problems
confronting the industry.
</P>
<P>
Australia's wool stockpile has reached nearly 2.5 million bales
while its wool price fell to a two-year low of 547 cents per
kilogram clean late last month.
</P>
<P>
Wool growers are keeping wool in their own hands because of the
low price and a second stockpile is accumulating in the country.
</P>
<P>
The wool stockpile and slack international demands have
depressed the wool price.
</P>
<P>
"I'm aiming for a free-ranging discussion of the issues facing
the industry as well as a clear assessment of our strategic
position over the medium term, particularly after the stockpile
has been cleared," Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
He said the roundtable meeting would embrace the full gamut of
issues from production through to the end user, as well as the
supply chain and marketing.
</P>
<P>
The participants will include growers, brokers, exporters,
domestic and overseas processors, private treaty merchants, the
Australian Wool Exchange, the Wool International and the
International Wool Secretariat.

especially for workers at 19 low-profit enterprises in the city.
</P>
<P>
The hospital has 800 beds and receives 620,000 patients
annually. Though it is operating at over capacity, the hospital
still invested 100,000 yuan to build 600 sq m of wards for poor
patients.
</P>
<P>
There is no difference between these wards and the others in
terms of equipment and other facilities. What is different is that
patients in such wards pay medical treatment charges 30 percent to
50 percent lower than the people in ordinary wards.
</P>
<P>
Doctors and nurses in charge of these wards are kind-hearted
and ready to help patients who have difficulties at any time.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-year-old Hou Shulan, a retired worker from a local
match factory, recovered rapidly after an operation and felt very
sorry when he said good-bye to friendly doctors and nurses. "They
are so good," Hou said.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that 50 percent of the city's poor
families have become poor because of illness.
</P>
<P>
So far some 1,000 patients have been treated in "Help-the-Poor"
wards since March this year.

<HEADLINE> Celestial Theories Created 5,000 Years Ago in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China was a nation of stargazers
thousands of years ago, experts have disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Ancient celestial paintings on rocks, pottery and copper ware
demonstrate that Chinese astronomers developed fairly advanced
celestial theories about 5,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
At Zhuozi Mountain in Wuhai City of Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region, north China, paintings have been found on a large rock,
depicting the god of the sun and other gods, with deep pits
standing for stars.
</P>
<P>
The god of the sun looks something like the face of a human
being, around which there is radiating sunlight.
</P>
<P>
In Dengkou County of Wuhai City, a rock painting depicts a
worshiper standing on the ground with two legs apart and two arms
stretching over his head. Overhead there is a large circle -- the
well-worshiped sun.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists believe ancient people worshipped the sun and
stars much more than any other celestial bodies. Through the
observation of the sun and stars, ancient people were able to
learn about seasonal changes and arrange farming and living
matters.
</P>
<P>
Ancient Chinese astronomers recorded a solar eclipse around
4,000 years ago, and later there were recordings of celestial
affairs on tortoise-shells and animal bones during the Shang
Dynasty (16th century to 11th century BC).
</P>
<P>
Similar paintings have also been found in other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Paintings on pottery found near Zhengzhou, capital city of
central China's Henan Province show the primitive lines indicating
the sun, moon and constellations. These paintings have been proved
to date back 5,000 years, indicating that ancient people had begun
to grasp the rules of celestial and meteorological activities at
that time.
</P>
<P>
In Lianyungang City of east China's Jiangsu Province, rock
paintings also show the sun, constellations, god of the sun and
other gods, and sacrificial altars.

<HEADLINE> Donors To Discuss Funding Of Dar Water Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A donor conference is to be held
soon to discuss a request by the National Urban Water Authority
(NUWA) for funding of the Dar es Salaam water supply project, NUWA
sources confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Ministry of Water had approached the
African Development Bank (ADB) for funding of the project.
</P>
<P>
"NUWA has submitted its request for financial assistance and we
are still awaiting the bank's response on this issue", said the sources.
</P>
<P>
On the recently hiked water tariffs, the sources said the
increase was to cover costs of operations and distribution of water.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources added that NUWA was expected to operate
commercially and noted that one of the ways to realise that goal was
to raise tariffs regularly in line with changing costs of production.
</P>
<P>
NUWA is responsible for water distribution in Dar es Salaam and
Coast regions.
</P>
<P>
Dar es Salaam residents and industries have been facing
intermittent water shortages lately due to the dilapidated state of
pumping stations and water lost through leaking pipes.

<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Police have confiscated more than
300,000 illegal CDs, including 7,000 pornographic CDs, from two
gangs in Beijing, in the largest haul of pirated and pornographic
CDs ever in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Three men, Song Lingjun, Li Yongqiang, and Lin Laiwei were
arrested and 100,000 pirated CDs seized on March 13th when the
three were attempting to rent a house to store the CDs. A young
man on a bicycle with 12,000 pirated CDs was caught near the same
spot on the same day.
</P>
<P>
According to the obtained clues the police then went to Anyang,
in east China's Henan Province and Guangzhou, in south China's
Guangdong, and seized 150,000 CDs.
</P>
<P>
Police say that two of the arrested, Song Lingjun and Wang
Xingde, were from south China's Zhejiang Province, and had bought
pirated CDs from Guangdong and sold them in Beijing to retailers,
or copied CDs provided by people in Henan and Guangdong
provinces. They made 440,000 of these with a total profit of
420,000 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Two Indian Chief Ministers Resign over Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Two Indian chief ministers, J.
Jayalalitha in Tamil Nadu and A.K. Antony in Kerala, today
resigned from their posts in the wake of severe electoral reverses
in both Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) and assembly
elections in their respective states.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, Antony, who became
Kerala chief minister only last year, resigned soon after the
results showed the Indian National Congress-led United Democratic
Front had fared badly in the southern state.
</P>
<P>
In another southern state of Tamil Nadu, Miss Jayalalitha,
supremo of the ruling party in the state All India Anna Dravida
Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), submitted her resignation as chief
minister as trends available in vote counting suggested a
landslide victory for the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The AIADMK and the national ruling party Indian National
Congress were allies in the state in the general elections.
</P>
<P>
Jayalalitha's resignation was promptly accepted by Tamil Nadu
Governor M. Channa Reddy.
</P>
<P>
Both Kerala and Tamil Nadu used to be the strongholds of the
ruling Indian National Congress in the 1991 polls.

<HEADLINE> CPC Senior Official Meets DPRK Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese Communist Party
official said here today that China will unswervingly reinforce
its relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and
develop the existing friendship between the two parties and two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, a standing committee member of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made this
remark during a meeting with a delegation of the "Working People"
journal, a theoretical journal of the Workers' Party of Korea, led
by its chief editor Ryang Kyong Bok.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that China and the DPRK are friendly neighbors linked
by mountains and rivers, and the two parties, two countries and
two peoples have maintained a traditional friendship which was
fostered by leaders of the elder generations and has stood the
test of history.
</P>
<P>
"The CPC and the Chinese people cherish very much Sino-DPRK
friendship," he stressed, adding that "it is an unswerving policy
of the CPC and the Chinese government to strengthen Sino-DPRK ties
and to reinforce the existing friendly relations between the two
parties and the two nations."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the people of the DPRK would promote
their socialist construction and national unification under the
leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea led by Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
Hu also expressed the hope that "Seeking Truth", the
theoretical journal of the CPC Central Committee, would increase
its contacts with its counterpart, the "Working People", so as to
contribute more to the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Ryang said that "we have seen the great achievements the
Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party, have made in their socialist construction by taking the
economic construction as the central task and by sticking to the
two basic points (sticking to the four cardinal principles and to
the reform and the opening up to the outside world)."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Chinese people would, under the
leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin
at the core, make greater progress in implementing the Party's
line, principles and policies, and in socialist construction and
in improving people's life quality.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK visitors arrived here April 30 as guests of the
"Seeking Truth" Journal. Xing Bensi, Editor-in-Chief of the
journal, and DPRK ambassador to China Chu Chang Jun were present
at the occasion.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The elections in October last year
of Harare's First Executive Mayor, Solomon Tawengwa, and his
Bulawayo counterpart, Alderman Abel Siwela, have been nullified
by the High Court of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Justice Adam nullified the elections yesterday following an
application by the opposition Forum Party of Zimbabwe who
contended that there had been gross irregularities.
</P>
<P>
In a long judgment, which is still to be transcribed, the
judge set aside what he called the ''purported'' general
elections of the mayor of Harare and the mayor of Bulawayo, held
on October 28 and 29, last year and ordered the returning
officers of both cities to fix a date for the elections to be
held in terms of the urban council's act 1995.
</P>
<P>
The judge blamed the Harare Town Clerk, Edward Kanengoni, and
the Bulawayo Town Clerk, Mike Ndubiwa, for not complying with the
regulations pertaining to urban councils' elections.
</P>
<P>
He said Kanengoni had not published a notice calling for the
nominations of an executive mayor of Harare and the date for the
elections. Ndubiwa had gone to extend the nomination time
without authority to do so.
</P>
<P>
Harare is the country's capital and Bulawayo is Zimbabwe's
second largest city. enditem

</P>
<P>
He said the signing ceremony would be also attended by foreign
ministers of Egypt and Ethiopia and a representative of

ALMA ATA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Developing friendly relations with
China is the priority in Kazakhstan's foreign policy, Kazakh
Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev told visiting Chinese

<P>
The delegation, led by Fu Quanyou, chief of general staff of

<HEADLINE> Hanoi Plans to Double GDP by the Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's capital city Hanoi is trying
to double its gross domestic product (gdp) to 1,100 U.S. dollars
per capita over the next five years, according to a political
report delivered at Hanoi Communist Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Party Congress of Hanoi opened Tuesday with Vietnam's
Communist Party leader Do Muoi and other senior leaders being
present.
</P>
<P>
Hanoi's average gdp in 1995 was estimated at 650 U.S. dollars
per capita compared with 470 U.S. dollars in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise was due to massive investments from both foreign
and domestic sources estimated at 32,570 billion vnd (about 3.25
billion U.S. dollars), according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that by the end of 1995, up to 210 foreign
investment projects had been licensed to operate in Hanoi
involving 3.3 billion U.S. dollars of prescribed capital. Of this
amount 1.3 billion U.S. dollars has been consumed.
</P>
<P>
This has helped Hanoi along its chosen path to restructure its
economic base towards industries and services rather than rely on
its traditional agriculture and small industry.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of industries and that of trade and services in
Hanoi's gdp in the 1991-95 period rose sharply to 33.1 per cent
and 61.6 per cent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the agricultural share fell to just 5.3 per cent of
the total gdp share.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, Hanoi would need 9 billion U.S. dollars
in investment to develop new industrial zones, renovate existing
industrial zones and build more high rise buildings in the inner
city for office space, trade centres and entertainment
centres.

<HEADLINE> Heilongjiang's Measures to Rebuild Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province, one of China's major industrial bases, recently worked
out a series of measures to improve efficiency and economic
returns of the province's companies.
</P>
<P>
There are 550 large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises
here that were built in the 1950s and 1960s. Many of these
enterprises have been facing the shortage of funds for renovation
of their equipment and lagging behind in management.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, over the past several years, losses
incurred by these companies was as high as three to four billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
To remedy this, the local government developed a plan to
accelerate the pace of establishing enterprise groups, merge
enterprises, and give more freedom to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the province will build some ten large
enterprise groups, each with an annual output value of at least
three billion.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that the major step in reforming
money-losing companies is mergers, and that the local government
will encourage this action through various measures.
</P>
<P>
The local government is also considering measures to ease the
debt burden of many companies, the official said, noting that the
equity-debt ratio of most state-owned companies in the province is
more than 80 percent at present.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Constitution To Be Signed Into Law By Semptember </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's new constitution,
adopted by the constitutional assembly yesterday, could be
promulgated as early as September this year if the constitutional
court gives it an early thumbs-up.
</P>
<P>
According to radio of South Africa Broadcasting Corporation this
morning, the constitution is due to come before the court next month.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted parliament officials as saying that the court has
to decide whether the constitution complies with the 34
constitutional principles decided on at the multi-party talks two
years ago and which have guided the broad content of the new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Political parties may also make representations to the court and
already the Democratic Party and the National Party have indicated
that they will contest the lockout clause for its constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
The court can decide whether other interested groups should also
be consulted, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
If the court gives the constitution the all-clear, President
Nelson Mandela is free to sign it into law.
</P>
<P>
If the court raises objections, the assembly has to attend to
necessary changes within a three-month period.
</P>
<P>
The constitution contains a chapter on transititional provisions.
</P>
<P>
The effect of these is to suspend certain parts of the new
constitution until April 1999 when the five-year period, starting from
the adoption of the interim constitution, expires. enditem

<HEADLINE> Beijing Taking Lead in Banning Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Beijing legislators have passed a
smoking ban, stepping to the forefront of keeping tobacco out of
offices.
</P>
<P>
The ban is scheduled to take effect next Wednesday in public
places such as hospitals, schools, cinemas, department stores, and
public conveyances.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 "no-smoking" signs have been placed inside
buildings of the Municipal People's Congress, the local
legislative body, since it passed the ban last December.
</P>
<P>
Cigarettes were banned from all offices and meeting rooms of
the MPC as soon as it published news of the regulation.
</P>
<P>
Buildings of the municipal government and the Municipal
Communist Party Committee have also become smoke-free areas,
meaning that smokers are allowed to satisfy their craving only in
designated smoking areas.
</P>
<P>
The city has asked all government office workers to set an
example in the citywide anti-smoking drive, which is expected to
be a long and trying time for millions of smokers.
</P>
<P>
More than 80,000 volunteers will be on duty in no-smoking areas
from next week to levy a ten-yuan (a little more than one US
dollar) fine on those who break the rules.

<HEADLINE> New Genes Provide Clue to Cancer Cure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Two human genes discovered recently
by Chinese scientists may help lead to a cure for cancer, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
The two retinoic acid-regulated genes, RIG-E and RIG-G, were
cloned from acute promyelocytic leukemia cells by a researcher at
the Shanghai Hematology Institute and have been entered into the
International Human Gene Data Bank.
</P>
<P>
The researcher, a Ph.D. graduate student, discovered the genes
while separating retinoic acid-regulated genes from leukemia cells
under the supervision of two renowned Chinese hematologists, Chen
Zhu and Wang Zhenyi.
</P>
<P>
Further research showed that RIG-E had a high degree of
autoploidy with a particular species of mice, and RIG-G had a high
degree of autoploidy with human interferon stimulated genes.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that those features of the new genes may help
them get closer to the secret of cancer and find a method to treat
it.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists were the first to use retinoic acid to treat
acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, the answer to exactly why
retinoic acid controls the genes for leukemic acid cell
differentiation and reverses the malignancy after binding with the
receptors is still unknown.

<HEADLINE> Rosy Future Planned for Port City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Lianyungang, the starting point of
the new Eurasian Continental Bridge, recently revealed its
ambitious plan to become an international port and business center.
</P>
<P>
The plan has been approved by the relevant ministries and
Jiangsu provincial government, said Vice-Mayor Cheng Zhipei, and
will make the city a major east-coast port linking China with
Pacific coast and central Asian nations, and an international
tourist city, in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The port in east China's Jiangsu Province now has 25 berths,
with an annual handling capacity of 22.5 million tons and plans to
increase the number to 49 and annual handling capacity to 39.3
million tons by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the growing container business on the continental
bridge, By the year 2020, the port will be able to handle 10
million TEUs of containers a year,
</P>
<P>
The city has other reasons to be confident of its future. The
double-track Lianyungang-Lanzhou Railway will be completed by
1997. An expressway parallel to the Chinese section of the
continental bridge will open to traffic around 2000, and a
national highway along the Chinese coast, also expected to be
completed by that time, will pass through the city.
</P>
<P>
A natural gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Lianyungang is now
being discussed.
</P>
<P>
The city is determined to suit its industry to its rising
international status. Proposed projects include the largest
spandex plant in China, and an oil refinery that handles five
million tons of crude oil a year. The total investment is
estimated at 11.67 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> New Securities Firm Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Everbright Securities Ltd, a new
securities company headquartered here, started business today.
</P>
<P>
The firm is based on the securities business arms of the China
Everbright Bank and China Everbright International Trust and
Investment Corporation, Liu Jiyuan, the firm's general manager,
said at a news briefing this morning.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the firm follows a central bank decision
ordering all financial institutions to de-link banking and
non-banking business, according to observers here.
</P>
<P>
With the majority stake held by the China Everbright Group Ltd,
which has assets valued at more than 68 billion yuan (about 8.1
billion US dollars), the new securities company has a registered
capital volume of 250 million yuan (about 30 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China (PBC) had given approval to
Everbright Securities Ltd as a national non-banking financial
institution in March. Currently, the firm has regional offices in
Shanghai and Shenzhen, a representative office in southwest
China's Sichuan Province, and 14 securities departments in major
cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
The main business of Everbright Securities Ltd, with the
approval of the central bank, includes issuing securities itself
or for clients, buying or selling securities, providing securities
trusts, conducting securities-backed fund-raising, exercising fund
and asset management, offering investment consultancy and acting
as a financial advisor.
</P>
<P>
The firm is also authorized to engage in business related to
enterprise restructuring, takeovers and mergers, futures, foreign
currency-denominated securities and other business allowed by the
PBC, the general manager said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Everbright Securities Ltd currently has over 20
trading berths on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses and other
national securities exchanges. The company is also a primary
dealer in treasury bonds selected by the Ministry of Finance this
year.

<HEADLINE> China to Hold Safety Production Promotion Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to reduce the country's
in-service accidents, China's Labor Ministry has planned its sixth
national "Safety Production Promotion Week" for next week.
</P>
<P>
"This program is aimed at further enhancing the public
awareness of production safety and consciousness of abiding by
safety rules at work," said Wang Jianlun, vice-minister of labor,
here today at a press conference jointly held by the ministries of
labor, public security and supervision, and the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
The promotion work this time will mainly target "violations of
safety regulations and rules", while encouraging business managers
and workers to strictly follow the safety rules, she said.
</P>
<P>
Wang explained that, thanks to the five similar programs
launched since 1991, China has come to "maintain a stable
situation of safety production, with accident occurrence rates
lowered in some industries."
</P>
<P>
However, she is "far from optimistic about the overall
situation," she said.
</P>
<P>
Over 100,000 people die from accidents at work every year,
extremely serious accidents take place from time to time, and some
crucial problems have not been well addressed, according to her.
</P>
<P>
Most of the all, 70 percent of the accidents arose from
negligence of safety regulations by management staff or workers,
Wang stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to Vice-Minister of Public Security Mu Xinsheng, the
first three months of this year saw over 66,000 traffic accidents
and over 13,300 fires, killing 17,000 and 699 people respectively.
</P>
<P>
But 95 percent of the traffic accidents and 80 percent of fires
were caused by ignorance or negligence of rules, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1996 safety promotion program, local officials
and business leaders across the country will be organized to
conduct inspections of their own and others' enterprises for
violations against safety rules; localities and departments are
required to closely look into dangerous or accident-prone work
places under their jurisdiction; self-disciplinary mechanisms
should be improved and all workers and management staff should
receive systematic training in production safety connected with
their work; and production safety supervisors must go to workshops
to work during this period to redress mistakes and handle mishaps.
</P>
<P>
It was also learned that the Labor Ministry has drawn up a
production safety plan for the next five years, under which the
ministry will formulate or revise 100 national and professional
standards of production safety, establish a comprehensive set of
laws in this field, and beef up safety education and safety
measures, with the aim of reducing the number of accidents and
professional hazards to the minimum.

<P>
DHAKA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Export earnings from Bangladesh's four
major items have failed to reach the target, according to official
sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the country could not attain the targeted
earnings from items including frozen food, jute goods, leather and
handicrafts, causing much concern to the government and export
traders.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of the current fiscal beginning last
July 1, export earnings from frozen food marked a shortage of 7.6
percent from the target of 221.67 million US dollars while jute
goods remained below the earning target of 189.55 million dollars
by almost 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
In case of leather and handicrafts, the shortage was 15.9
percent and 14.9 percent respectively. Leather export earnings
totaled 122.58 million dollars during the period as against the
target of 145.83 million dollars and export earnings from
handicrafts reached 4.47 million dollars against the target of
5.25 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
No reason was given for the decline of the export earnings, but

an imperial tomb of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) in this capital
city of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, adding yet another
attraction.
</P>
<P>
Dotted with Tang-style pavilions and terraces, the garden
occupies the grounds of the Qianling Mausoleum of Wu Zetian
(624-705), the first woman to ascend the Chinese throne, and her
husband Li Zhi (628-683), the third emperor of the Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the mausoleum is the only one in the
province never to have been broken into by grave robbers. It is
best known for beautiful stone carvings and steles.
</P>
<P>
The one piece that especially catches people's eye is the stele
with no words at the tomb of Wu Zetian.
</P>
<P>
According to legend, Wu Zetian left instructions before her
death that a stele with no words was to be erected after her
death, to let later generations judge her.
</P>
<P>
The mausoleum has not been excavated because of lack of funds
and fear of damaging the relics. Archeologists, however, have
excavated the tombs of some princes and princesses in the vicinity
and discovered large numbers of beautiful frescos and pottery
figures.
</P>
<P>
A museum containing the relics has been built. It has about
600,000 visitors each year.

<HEADLINE> Displaced Peruvians Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 300,000 persons displaced by a
guerrilla war between 1983-1993 have returned to their homeland,
the local newspaper "El Comercio" said today.
</P>
<P>
Of that total, 140,000 have returned through the backing of a
program carried out by the Presidency Ministry since 1993.
</P>
<P>
To promote their return, the program has offered assistance to
at least 600 populated centers in Ayacucho, Apurimac, Huancavelica
and Junin, the central region of the country.
</P>
<P>
The program has a budget of approximately 20 million
U.S. dollars this year apart from the financial backing From the
U.S. Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
But according to earlier national census statistics, more than
one million Peruvians fled their homes in fear of the "Shining
Path" and Tupac Amaru Revolution Movement guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas, labeled by the government as terrorists, largely
ceased their activities after defeat on the military front or
their leaders seized by government forces.

<HEADLINE> Gearing Up Wuhan's Garment Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Last month, the capital of Hubei
Province, Wuhan, had a total of 100 million yuan worth of orders
at the China International Clothing and Accessory Exposure in
Beijing, including four million US dollars' worth in exports.
</P>
<P>
The city has become a new garment center, generating more than
five billion yuan in sales annually thanks to transportation
infrastructure and its role as regional commercial center. Over
the past five years, garment sales have climbed to five billion
yuan from 400 million yuan in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The city has more than 1,300 mills, more than 50 of them
foreign-funded, whereas there were only 100 mills five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Minglu, deputy-director of the city's textile bureau,
attributed the almost overnight growth to preferential policies,
and especially to a people-oriented market strategy.
</P>
<P>
"Even people of neighboring provinces like to buy clothes here,
because they are affordable and of high quality," he said.
</P>
<P>
The city will set up several clothing conglomerates in the next
few years to sharpen its competitive edge in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
It will also hire some top fashion designers. Annual salary for
such people is now as high as 500,000 yuan in the city.

FUZHOU, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The capital city of east China's
Fujian Province will hold 26 special activities for attracting
domestic and overseas investments from May 23 to June 15.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 businesses from more than 20 countries and
regions and 30 Chinese cities are expected to participate in the
event, according to Fuzhou city government officials.
</P>
<P>
The projects that will be displayed for cooperation cover
industry, basic facilities, agriculture, commerce and trade, land

</P>
<P>
Fuzhou's economic development has been oriented to the
international market, said its mayor Weng Fulin. The city has
approved 4,560 overseas-funded enterprises with a total investment
of 15.1 billion US dollars. Of these, 2,215 have started
operation, 278 with an investment of more than 10 million US
dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Last year, overseas-funded businesses had an industrial output
value of 21.3 billion yuan, paid taxes that accounted for
one-fourth of the city's revenues, and provided 300,000 jobs.

<HEADLINE> Inland Private Economy Grows Quickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China's inland areas have witnessed
a rapid growth in the private economy during the past five years,
with the number of people employed in this sector rising 2.6 times
from 1990 to 27.64 million by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The size of such employment has almost caught up with that of
the eastern part of China, which had seen an expansion of 2.3
times by the end of 1995 over 1990.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by the latest statistics from the State
Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local governments in China's central and western
regions reported a steady rise in the tax revenue turned in by the
private economy during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
In Sichuan Province, in southwest China, the private sector's
taxes accounted for more than one tenth of province's fiscal
income last year. In Shaanxi Province, in northwest China, the
sector's taxes made up eight percent of the province's total
taxation in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The central and western parts of China are also where most of
China's minority-group people live. Private enterprises
owned by minority groups gain substantial support from their local
governments.
</P>
<P>
In Qinghai Province, in northwest China, people of the Tibetan,
Korean, Mongolian and other minority groups own 26,000 private
businesses, which account for around 40 percent of the province's
total such ventures.
</P>
<P>
However, observers point out that although the private economy
in China's central and western regions enjoyed great progress in
the number of businesses and the size of employment, it lags
behind the eastern part of China in terms of scale, technical
level, efficiency and management.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the development of the private economy is in
disparity in the central and western regions. The private sectors
of the economy in Qinghai, Guizhou Province and the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region are relatively backward.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Sees GDP Growth Rate of 4.4 Percent in 1994-95 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
DHAKA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The growth of Bangladesh's gross
domestic product (GDP) remained almost stagnant at 4.4 percent in
the fiscal 1994-95 as against 4.2 percent in the previous year,
according to the annual report of Bangladesh Bank released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The low growth of the economy during the year was due to
extensive damage of crops and disruption of economic activities
caused by political unrest, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture sector showed a negative growth of 1 percent which
was 0.3 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, the rate of inflation was 5.2 percent which, the
report said, was much less than in the neighboring countries
during the year under review.
</P>
<P>
The fall in agricultural production created an inflationary
pressure on the economy which the government had fought with a
"pragmatic monetary policy" and immediate import of foodgrains,
the Central Bank report said.
</P>
<P>
Exports in 1994-95 increased 37.1 percent to 3.47 billion US
dollars, while import grew 39.2 percent and stood at 5.83 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report added that if the supply management of food grains
could be strengthened and be matched by a pragmatic demand
management, the country would achieve a desired growth rate by
curbing inflationary pressure.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Links Gas Tax Cut with Raising Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton today
tried to use proposed cut on gasoline tax as a leverage to win
over Republicans' opposition against raising the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
The president made it clear at a White House news conference
that he would accept a temporary cut in the gasoline tax only in
tandem with a separate bill raising the country's minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came at a time when gasoline prices had been
soaring for months, resulting in motorists' discontent.
</P>
<P>
Seizing on the public discontent, Republicans proposed later
last month that the gas tax, which was imposed by the Clinton
administration three years ago, be repealed.
</P>
<P>
The 4.3-cent-per-gallon surcharge was enacted in 1993 as part
of a broader deficit reduction package championed by Clinton and
congressional Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Since May 7, the Republicans' effort to repeal the gas tax has
been blocked by Democrats in the U.S. Senate and the dispute
brought the Senate to a halt today.
</P>
<P>
At today's news conference, President Clinton emphasized that
he would sign the gas tax and minimum wage bills only if they were
free of "poison pills."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's pronouncement was the first clear indication that he
would accept a gasoline tax cut, albeit with a condition -- the
raising of federal minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
But Republicans in Congress have been against the wage increase
since the government proposed it earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Republicans and Democrats alike were
seeking to "gain political mileage" in the election year in the
dispute over the minimum wage and gas tax.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Hariri to Discuss Bilateral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton made a
telephone call to Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri
Wednesday night, just two days before a five-party meeting of the
U.S., France, Israel, Syria and Lebanon in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The first telephone contact between the two leaders in three
years came only a couple of hours after the Lebanese premier
returned to his residence in central Beirut from a 24-hour
official visit to Rome.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources in Hariri's government said that the telephone
conversation, which lasted more than 15 minutes, was mainly on
bilateral relations between Lebanon and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Both Hariri and Clinton expressed the necessity to enhance the
relations, the sources said without giving more details.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources suggested that the call very probably was
part of U.S. efforts aimed at making the Washington meeting Friday
successful.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the five member states in a proposed
committee monitoring cease-fire between Israeli forces and
guerrillas of Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God,
will discuss at least three different proposals regarding the
composition, level, headquarters, prerogative and funding of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
The five-state committee was supposed to supervise the
implementation of the cease-fire understanding reached on April
26, which put an end to 16 days of Israeli military offensives in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Two of the three proposals have been presented by the U.S. and
France respectively, and the other one put forward jointly by
Syria and Lebanon. It is still not clear whether Israel, the fifth
member of the committee, has offered its own proposal.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz announced Tuesday that
Lebanon and Syria will be represented at Friday's meeting by
their ambassadors in Washington, Riad Taffara and Walid
Al-Muallem, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Ten-fold Fines for Polluting Vehicles in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Trucks and buses belching black
fumes while plying Bangkok streets will face a 10-fold increase in
fines as of next month, said Science, Technology and Environment
Minister Yingphan Manasilkarn.
</P>
<P>
The fine will jump from 500 baht (20 US dollars) to 5,000 baht
(200 dollars), said Yingphan, who is also vice chairman of the Air
Pollution Management Committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee recently decided to crack down on trucks and
buses which have been identified as among the worst polluters on
the road.
</P>
<P>
Pollution control officials will next month start an inspection
program focusing on trucks and buses clearly emitting black fumes.
</P>
<P>
They will also check if trucks have coverings over their loads,
especially sand, soil and rock, which could disperse dust
particles into the air.
</P>
<P>
The committee will also monitor construction sites, focusing on
dust prevention walls, chutes for dropping waste building
materials from upper floors, and methods used to prevent dust
dispersing from construction sites and from piles of sand, soil
and rock at the sites.
</P>
<P>
Violators could face a fine of up to 60,000 baht (2,400
dollars) or a three-month imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Argentines Go on Goalscoring Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Argentine teams went on a
goalscoring spree on Wednesday with San Lorenzo and River Plate
both scoring five goals on their way to the quarter-finals of the
Libertadores Cup.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Gremio of Brazil also made the last eight,
ending a miserable campaign by Brazilian champions Botafogo in the
process.
</P>
<P>
San Lorenzo humiliated the once-great Penarol, beating the
Uruguayan champions 5-1 away in their second round, second leg
match for an 8-3 aggregate win.
</P>
<P>
Five-times Libertadores champions Penarol, who have suffered
along with the decline in their country's domestic game, trailed
2-0 at halftime to goals by former Brazilian World Cup midfielder
Silas and midfielder Roberto Montserrat.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Pacheco gave Penarol brief hope with an early second
half goal but further goals by Claudio Biaggio, Javier Albarello
and Montserrat destroyed Penarol in Montevideo's historic
Centenario stadium.
</P>
<P>
River Plate, lucky to be only 2-1 down from the first leg
against Peruvian champions Sporting Cristal, were 4-0 up in 33
minutes in Buenos Aires thanks to two goals by Hernan Crespo and
one each by Uruguayan veteran Enzo Francescoli and Ariel Ortega,
who scored with a stunning bicycle kick.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvians hit back through a Roberto Solano penalty and a
goal by Julinho early in the second half to come within one goal
of levelling the aggregate score.
</P>
<P>
Gremio had gained a valuable 1-1 away draw last week and
Luciano gave them an ideal start in the fifth minute when he
scored from a free header.
</P>
<P>
Botafogo dominated much of the first half but a 56th minute
goal by Carlos Miguel gave Gremio, who had central defender
Adilson sent off for a second bookable offence near the end, a
2-0 win.
</P>
<P>
Corinthians, the other Brazilian representatives, were jeered
by their own fans despite beating Ecuadorean champions Espoli 2-0
in Sao Paulo for a 5-1 aggregate win.
</P>
<P>
Barcelona, who in 1991 became the only Ecuadorean side to
reach the final of the tournament, made the quarter-finals by
beating Bolivia's San Jose 4-2 on penalties after their tie ended
2-2 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Colombian sides America and Junior both progressed, knocking
out Minerven of Venezuela and Cerro Porteno of Paraguay
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Animal Husbandry Development in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Raising livestock in north China's
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has entered a new stage of
development and done especially well since 1985, with 11
consecutive good years, thanks to a series of reforms and the use
of science.
</P>
<P>
The region can now raise 55 million head of livestock, produce
800,000 tons of meat and 60,000 tons of wools annually.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the region's total livestocks exceeded 60 million
head, the number of domestic fowl exceeded 50 million, and pigs
numbered more than 10 million.
</P>
<P>
Output of meat, milk, eggs, and wool reached 818,900 tons,
511,700 tons, 188,300 tons, and 57,200 tons respectively, with per
capita income for herdsmen amounting to 1,870 yuan, and output of
animal husbandry reaching 7.61 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology have become an important force in animal
husbandry in the region. In 1978, there were only 10.34 million
head of improved livestock, accounting for 29.1 percent of the
total. By 1995, the figure jumped to 32 million, equal to 61
percent.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of animal husbandry has been attributed
to the responsibility systems in use on grassland and for
livestock and a system under whereby herdsmen pay a certain amount
for the use of grassland.
</P>
<P>
The region's 59 banners and counties use the system on 38
million hectares of grassland, accounting for 66 percent of the
region's total usable grassland.
</P>
<P>
Improving grassland is another reason for the success. In 1983,
Inner Mongolia added 510,000 hectares of grassland, and the total
now comes to 1.33 million hectares.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ethiopia Plays Important Role In African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has been playing an
increasingly important role in Africa's political stage in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's vital role in African affairs is manifested
remarkably in its active participating in mediation of conflicts
in African countries, particularly in its neighbors. The
Ethiopian government believes that various conflicts, both within
African country and between African countries, not only harm
Africa's image, but also are major obstacles to its economic
development.
</P>
<P>
As a member of Permanent Committee of the Horn of Africa on
Somalia, the Ethiopian government presided over two conferences
on peace in Somalia and two conferences on assistance to that
country in its capital in the past years. It sent an elder
delegation of the Somali nationality to Somalia in March last
year to mediate in the conflicts there.
</P>
<P>
At the summit meeting of the Inter-Governmental Authority on
Drought and Development held in September, 1993, Ethiopia
suggested to set up a four-nation committee of Ethiopia, Kenya,
Uganda and Eritrea to help solve the southern Sudan conflict.
During the summit of the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and
Southern Africa (PTA) held in Kampala, Uganda, in November, 1993,
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi also mediated between
representatives of the Sudanese government and the anti-
government organization.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's mediation efforts have become more frequent and
prominent after it was elected as current chairman of the OAU at
the 31st summit last June.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the Central Organ of the OAU Mechanism for
Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution, Ethiopia has sent
two batches of peacekeeping forces to Rwanda. Meles sent a
special envoy to Burundi to mediate last August. An OAU mission
led by representative of OAU Chairman Meles Zenawi visited
Comoros to express Africa's solidarity with the Comoros people
last October.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- An OAU elections observer
group led by the Ethiopian Supreme Court President Kamal Bedri
worked in Tanzania for the presidential and parliamentary
elections in the country last October. To seek a solution to the
dispute between Yemen and Eritrea over the Hanish Islands on the
Red Sea, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi personally went to Sanna and
Asmara last December. Meanwhile, Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin visited Yemen and Eritrea three times in a bid to
mediate in the conflict between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia stands for economic cooperation between African
countries and appeals to the world community to help it achieve
economic integration. At the ceremony for launching the United
Nations system-wide special initiative on Africa on March 15,
this year, Meles pointed out that the international community has
the responsibility to help Africa overcome poverty. Meanwhile, he
called upon the African nations to develop economy through
self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
In recognizing the efforts made by the Ethiopian government
for the economic development in Africa, Meles was elected one of
the co-chairmen of the Global Coalition for Africa held at
Maastricht, Holland, last year. He attended the co-chairmen
meeting of the Global Coalition for Africa in Gaborone, Botswana,
last February.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government has been pursuing a foreign policy of
peace and independence, which lays stress on promoting goodwill
relations with its neighbors. It has since 1991 signed bilateral
agreements on friendly cooperation separately with Kenya, Uganda,
Sudan, Djibouti and Eritrea. The good-neighbor policy has
strengthened the nation's position in the international community
and created a favorable situation for its economic development.
</P>
<P>
It is convinced that Ethiopia will certainly play a greater
role in African affairs, make more contributions to the
resolution of African conflcits and realization of economic
integration of the continent in the coming years. enditem

<HEADLINE> Motion To Extend Emergency Passed In Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka Parliament Wednesday night
passed a motion to extend the island-wide emergency for another
month with 112 voting for and 79 against.
</P>
<P>
Briefing Parliament on the security situation in the country,
Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte said that despite
disruptive activities of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE), the government was determined to eradicate rebels and
establish peace throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, however, continued to engage in further atrocities.
It was for this reason that the emergency on an island-wide scale
had to be continued in the interest of public security and
preservation of public order, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It was also necessary so as to enable the law enforcement
authorities to maintain law and order in the country since the
provisions of the normal law in force were inadequate.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister also said that the current operation in the
Jaffna Peninsula, Riviresa 11, was not only a military offensive
in the conventional sense but also an operation conducted to
rescue the displaced, long-suffering people from the clutches of
the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
He called on all members of the Parliament to support the
government's initiatives to end the protracted ethnic conflict
and to support the continuation of the emergency island-wide.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide state of emergency was declared by President
Chandrika Kumaratunga as a precautionary measure on April 4.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Unemployment Rate Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Australia's unemployment rate rose
to 8.9 percent in April, the highest level in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today that
the jobless rate rose 0.3 percent in April seasonally adjusted.
</P>
<P>
A total of 34,100 people lost their jobs during the month,
while only 21,000 found full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
The result was worse than market expectations. Local economists
forecast that the jobless rate would remain unchanged at 8.5
percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
Today's figures showed that improvement in unemployment rate in
the past 12 months might have come to a stop.
</P>
<P>
Total employment grew by 9,800 in April, compared with the
expected 55,000.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the slow-down in creating new jobs
would see unemployment rate rise further in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Federal Employment Minister Amanda Vanstone said that the
rising unemployment figures were disappointing. She said that the
unemployment rate won't fall unless the coalition government
implements its proposed industrial relations reforms.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Provide More Loans to Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is to provide Vietnam
with loans worth about 500 million U.S. dollars over the next
three years to help economic reform, a local official report said
today.
</P>
<P>
The bank's president, James Wolfensohn, said continuing
financial support for Vietnam has been made possible thanks to
the positive results of the economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn, who is paying a four-day working visit to
Vietnam, said the country ranks second in a list of states
receiving preferential loans from the bank.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet
Monday, Wolfsensohn said more private companies would benefit from
financial support to be provided by the International Financial
Corporation(IFC), the bank's private sector funding arm.
</P>
<P>
The IFC, which has lent money to a number of infrastructure,
hotel and manufacturing projects in Vietnam, is looking for
potential sponsors for establishing eight loan schemes worth an
estimated 135.2 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
IFC investment in Vietnam is expected to rise to 375 million
U.S. dollars in near future.

<HEADLINE> Poland to Import More Fuel Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Poland plans to import 300,000 tons
of duty-free fuel oil in the next two months to cope with a
worsening oil crisis, a government spokesman said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of the oil, including 150,000 tons of petroleum
and 150,000 tons of diesel oil, will take 14.2 million
U.S. dollars off Poland's projected budget revenue for this year,
the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Poland has to import 12 to 13 million tons of oil a year.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, petroleum prices in the world market have
increased by 30-45 percent, and diesel oil prices have also risen
from 160 dollars to 200 dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
The higher prices have forced Polish oil importers to cut down
on volume which has led to tight supply in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say that the government may resume oil
rationing.

<HEADLINE> Thai Clothing Makers to Feel Tariff Cut Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai middle-range and high-end
clothing manufacturers may have to shift their production to
countries where labor cost is relatively cheap, as a result of the
government's decision to cut import tariffs, industry sources
believe.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the cabinet approved import tariff cuts for a range
of luxury goods, with the rate on clothing plunging from 45
percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Clothing makers in the middle to upper price range, priced 500
baht (20 U.S. dollars) and higher, will feel the greatest impact
of the tariff reduction.
</P>
<P>
If importers pass the tax benefits on to consumers by lowering
prices, the price advantage which locally-made middle-range and
high-end goods have over imports will vanish.
</P>
<P>
As a result, consumers are likely to turn away from local
products and look for international brands.
</P>
<P>
Once middle-range and high-end producers feel pressed by more
competitive imports, they will inevitably look to ways to cut
production costs. One of the ways would be to shift factories from
Thailand to countries where labor is relatively low.
</P>
<P>
However, tariff cuts will ultimately benefit consumers, who
will have more choices, and manufacturers will have to improve
skill and quality to maintain their competitive edge, said Supoj
Tantichirasakul, president of Pena Group, which is partly involved
in the clothing industry.

<HEADLINE> World Copper Price Pushed Up by Strike in Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Copper prices hit a five-month high
on the London Metal Exchange today due to fears that a strike in
the Chuquicamata copper mine in Chile will squeeze stocks, experts
said today.
</P>
<P>
A pound of copper closed today in London up 2.6 percent
bringing its monthly quotation to 1.285 U.S. dollars and its
annual quotation to 1.219 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean Copper Commission (COCHILCO) said that the monthly
and annual average price for one pound of the metal is 1.246
dollars and 1.173 dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The price of copper has shot up in face of concern that copper
stocks will diminish because of a strike declared by 7,000 workers
on May 2 in the Chuquicamata copper mine, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
The copper mine is the largest open pit mine in the world and
belongs to the National Copper Corporation (CODELCO), the biggest
state-owned company in Chile.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 610,000 tons of high-grade copper were extracted
from this mine, representing 6 percent of annual copper production
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The strikers are demanding a 4 percent pay hike and a 1.9
million-peso (4,690 dollars) bonus while the mine administrators
have offered a 3 percent wake increase and a 1.1 million-peso
(2,716 dollars) bonus.
</P>
<P>
The authorities say they are confident that the strike will end
this week.
</P>
<P>
The average annual price of copper in the world market closed
at 1.33 per pound in 1995. The quotation is forecast to fluctuate
between 1.15 dollars and 1.20 dollars per pound this year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Seeks to Curb Farm Subsidies by Hungary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has joined six major
agricultural exporting countries in an effort to curb farm export
subsidies by Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The payments far exceed commitments specified in the World
Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, said the seven countries --
Thailand, the United States, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand,
Canada and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Hungary has said it set aside 21 billion forint (152 million US
dollars) for export subsidies last year and 19.7 billion forint
(143 million US dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the seven countries claim that Hungary had the total
subsidies of 35 billion forint (254 million US dollars) last year,
66 percent more than agreed under WTO commitments.
</P>
<P>
Hungary is also reported to have set aside 41 billion forint
(296 million US dollars) to promote farm exports this year, 108
percent above the WTO figure.
</P>
<P>
According to The Bangkok Post today, the seven countries have

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and the United States have
signed an air traffic agreement, ending a six-year air traffic
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Thailand found in 1990 that the air agreement signed between
the two countries in 1989 was unfair, allowing unlimited flight
frequencies and seat capacities from the US, but restricting Thai
flights to the US.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement allows an unlimited number of direct flights
between the two countries and allows each nation's carriers to
operate 31 passenger and 24 cargo flights to the other country per
week from third countries.
</P>
<P>
US companies are allowed to fly to all points in Thailand,
while Thai carriers can serve eight US cities and another 10
through code-sharing agreements. Thailand has only four
international airports.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement, to take effect after exchange of diplomatic
notes, would strengthen trade, investment and tourism and support
Thailand's drive to become a regional aviation hub, Thai Foreign
Minister Kasem S. Kasemsri said Wednesday after signing the
agreement with US Ambassador William Itoh here.

<HEADLINE> Seven Guards Questioned over Jailbreak in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The East Jakarta Police (EJP) have
investigated at least seven prison guards for suspected
involvement in the escape of jailed bank swindler Eddy Tansil from
the high-security Cipinang Prison last Saturday, EJP source said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Head of EJP Col. Gories Mere said that his office has set up a
special team to search for Tansil.
</P>
<P>
"We have searched the places we believed to be his hiding
places, but so far we did not find him in any of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tansil, owner of the Golden Key Group, was found guilty by the
Central Jakarta Court in September 1994 of bank fraud involving
1.3 trillion rupiah (620 million US dollars) and was sentenced to
20 year of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Tansil escaped prison confinement with the
possible help of prison guards.
</P>
<P>
But the chief of prison security said that they knew nothing
about Tansil's plan to escape. He said, they noticed about his
absence only on Monday.
</P>
<P>
president Soeharto and Justice Minister Oetojo Oesman have
ordered a massive manhunt for the escapee.
</P>
<P>
Oetojo said on Wednesday that Indonesian representative
missions abroad have already been instructed to join the manhunt,
and Tansil's picture would soon be distributed nationwide as well
as abroad.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether an international syndicate has been involved
in Tansil's escape, the minister said there has been no indication
toward that direction.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Industrial output in Brazil
dropped by 9.3 percent during the first quarter of this year
compared to the same period in 1995, the Brazilian Institute of
Geography and Statistics (IBGE) said.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product (GDP) also fell 1.5 percent during the
first three months of this year compared with the same period in
1995, IBGE said.
</P>
<P>
The figures were evidence of a marked deceleration of economic
activity in the past few months, Silvio Salles, head of the IBGE's
Industrial Department, was quoted as saying today.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the industrial slowdown to rising unemployment
and the trade liberalization initiated in July 1994.
</P>
<P>
But Salles predicted that industrial activity this year will be
up 2 percent while the GDP will grow nearly 4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Law to Protect Shenzhen's Migrant Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Millions of people working in
thousands of private businesses in Shenzhen, in south China's
Guangdong Province, are now protected by laws, an official from
the special economic zone claimed.
</P>
<P>
Tan Guoxiang, director of the city's labor bureau, said that
since having been granted independent legislative power in 1992,
the SEZ has developed several regulations on contracts, workers'
rights, and minimum wages.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the first regulation that the local legislature
passed dealt with labor issues," he pointed out, noting that the
SEZ is now drafting more regulations on wage protection,
unemployment benefits, and reasons for dismissal in a move to
provide further protection for employees.
</P>
<P>
"Then, a legal framework that protects worker's rights, which
is in compliance with both the state labor law and international
practices, will emerge in Shenzhen," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the labor director, Shenzhen was also the
country's first city to set up a supervisory system for
implementing labor laws, with 180 supervisors and 100 arbitrators
of labor disputes.
</P>
<P>
"Through their efforts, Shenzhen's supervision of some 12,284
enterprises was quite effective, resulting in 118,000 labor
contracts, and arbitrating 245 serious labor disputes involving
more than 30 people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the labor bureau has helped resolve
some 10,000 labor disputes as well as recovering some 17 million
yuan in employees' salaries that had been either delayed or
embezzled.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning Province
has worked out a series of rules for protecting the environment
while maintaining sustainable development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Xu Wencai, vice-governor of the province, said there are still
some problems in this leading industrial base in relation to the
rapid development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Xu noted that pesticides and chemical fertilizers have made
pollution of rivers worse, and irrigation with polluted water and
industrial waste discharge have caused a hardening of the soil and
reduction in quality of farm products.
</P>
<P>
According to the new rules, the province will prohibit the use
of substandard industrial and urban waste water for irrigation,
the dumping of solid waste on farmland, and using chemicals that
have been eliminated by the state, and the province will encourage
farmers to use more organic pesticides.
</P>
<P>
It also said the local government will set up a pollution-free
agricultural products base and a supervisory network.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that the province has also decided to close a number of
township enterprises with serious pollution problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- India's ruling Congress Party on
Wednesday night conceded its defeat in the Lok Sabha (Lower House)
elections as trends available showed the party was facing a rout
in many of its erstwhile strongholds, the Press Trust of India
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the state television Doordarshan, senior
Congress Party leader Pranab Mukherjee said "We accept we are
losing as per the trends. There is no denying the fact."
</P>
<P>
He admitted the Congress Party rally would be much lower than
the 221 seats it had got in 1991 elections. There are 545 seats
in the Lok Sabha.
</P>
<P>
Party leaders would probably meet Friday when all the results
were out to "take stock of the situation," said Mukkherjee, who is
also foreign affairs minister.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his party's losing heavily in Karnataka and
Maharashtra which are ruled by opposition parties, he said
apparently national issues had not had much effect in most of the
states and that local issues had dominated.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted there was a "communication gap" in informing
people about the gains of the economic policies of the government,
adding that the salesman had been unable to sell his product.
</P>
<P>
Among the 65 seats declared so far, the Congress Party and the
Bharatiya Janata Party took 20 each, followed by the Janata Dal
with 14. The left 11 seats went to other parties and
independents.
</P>
<P>
But as per the trends available so far from about 300
constituencies, the Congress Party was headed for a rout in
Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Haryana, Punjab and
Delhi.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Brand-name products will generate a
third of total industrial production value in central China's
Hubei Province by the year 2000, according to a provincial plan.
</P>
<P>
Most brand-name products are in light industry. However, the
industry has declined because the province gave more attention in
the past years to heavy industries like steel and iron, auto and
power.
</P>
<P>
But with limited financial resources, the province is now again
giving priority to light industry.
</P>
<P>
Light industry in the province has a solid foundation. A total
of 179 light industry products in the province, such as "Vitality
28" detergent, "Bailan" (white orchid) art printing paper,
"Yangtze River" citric acid, hold national prizes for quality.
</P>
<P>
Light industry enterprises, like Vitality 28 Group, Philips
Auto Illuminating Corp. Jinlongquan (Gold Dragon Spring) Brewery,
have cooperated with German, Dutch and Malaysian companies.
</P>
<P>
Hubei plans to boost light industry in a first step to spur its
whole economy. The provincial government will take measures to
absorb funds and upgrade technology.
</P>
<P>
In attracting overseas investment, the province will encourage
more enterprises to set up joint ventures with foreign businesses.
</P>
<P>
At present, overseas investment in light industry has topped
200 million US dollars. Last year, light industry products
generated an export volume of 614 million yuan (about 74 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The export value of dry batteries, cans, citric acid, thermos
bottle and shirts surpassed 50 million yuan (about six million US
dollars).

ROME, May 8 (Xinhua) -- World number one Steffi Graf, coming
back to the Italian Open after a nine-year absence, struggled to
outplay France's Alexia Dechaume-Ballaret 6-3, 7-6 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Graf, who has not competed in Rome since winning the title on
her only previous appearance, used one hour 20 minutes to down her
french opponent, ranked 129th in the world.

on a double fault, giving Dechaume-Ballaret the chance to take
the set into a tiebreak.

<HEADLINE> Bidding Begins for China's First BOT Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Bidding for China's first power
plant to be built under the BOT (build, operate and transfer)
financing mechanism opened yesterday in Beijing, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Six international consortia handed in their bidding documents
to the government of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Company officials from Bridge of Trust Infrastructure
Investment Consulting Co, which is authorized to handle the
tendering process, said the Laibin B Power Plant is the first
infrastructure project with official recognition to try the BOT
funding scheme in China.
</P>
<P>
Under the BOT method, the government allows private enterprises
to construct and operate a project for a specified period, after
which ownership is passed on to the Chinese Government.
</P>
<P>
The opening for bids yesterday morning marked the progress
China has made in increasing infrastructure construction using
foreign funding arranged under the BOT scheme, they said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the State Planning Commission said the
government likes this investment tool as it has proven especially
successful in helping infrastructure in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"An increasingly popular way to raise funds, the BOT scheme can
attract large amounts of international commercial investment and
private capital into the public utility sector. It also helps
lessen the direct financial burden on the central government and
gets rid of loan risks," said one of the officials.
</P>
<P>
China began opening projects in the energy and transportation
sectors for BOT bidding last year after the State Planning
Commission published a circular on the choosing of candidate
projects.
</P>
<P>
Consortia at the ceremony for the opening of bidding included
the New World Consortium, incorporating New World Infrastructure
Ltd, AEP Resources International and ABB Energy Ventures; the
International Generating Company Hong Kong Ltd; and the Tomen
Consortia, including Japan's Tomen Corp, Thailand's Union Energy
Investment, Toshiba Corp and Singapore Power International.
</P>
<P>
The others are the consortium between China Energy Investment
Company Ltd and Siemens; the consortium between Electricite de
France and GEC Alsthom; and one between Britain's National Power
PLC and Japan's Mitsui and Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
They are chosen out of a total of 31 tenderers that have
applied to the bid evaluation committee on the strength of their
qualifications.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Successful in Providing Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has built a social
insurance network to cover over 90 percent of its workers.
</P>
<P>
The network in Shanghai, China's largest city and the first in
China to have high proportion of ageing population, has enabled
retirees to benefit from social development and maintain a stable
life despite the serious pressure of inflation.
</P>
<P>
"Seventeen percent of Shanghai's population, or 2.27 million,
are older than 60 years old," said Jiang Yaozhong, an official
responsible for social insurance management.
</P>
<P>
"About 1.82 million retirees, more than 40 percent of those
taking part in pension security programs, are getting full pension
benefits," he said.
</P>
<P>
Given that over the next ten years, the number of retirees will
further rise, Shanghai has since 1993 started to upgrade the
existing pension insurance system, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The city has encouraged individuals to join hands with
government and units to shoulder pension expenses, set up special
pension insurance accounts for each employee, reformed the methods
of distributing pension benefits, established new mechanism for
the accumulation of pension funds, and put in place a
multiple-tier pension insurance system.
</P>
<P>
It has also set up a special bureau, a clearance center and
management centers at district and county level to improve
management in social pension insurance.

<HEADLINE> Farewell to Arms For Oroqen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 9 (Xinhua) -- "In the high Dahinggan Mountains grow
large forests, where the brave Oroqen live; a hunter, a gun, and a
horse; they have too many animals to hunt...," went a popular
Oroqen song of the 1960s, but it's no longer a true picture of
their daily lives - they've said good-bye to their guns.
</P>
<P>
The Oroqen, who number nearly 3,000, mainly live in the
Autonomous Banner of Oroqen, in Hulun Boir League of north China's
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1958, they lived the life of hunters, but then moved out
of the forest to settle down and have been gradually changed their
means of making a living since then, trying various other ways
after 1988.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, the banner put a regulation into
effect that forbids the hunting of wild animals, meaning a final
and complete break with the traditional life.
</P>
<P>
Some policies have been worked out by the local government to
ensure that this historic transformation goes smoothly. Around 15
ha of land are assigned to each hunting family, and as many as one
million yuan (about 120,000 US dollars) are allocated by the
government to assist them in farming.
</P>
<P>
Four mechanized farming bases are also being established in two
townships, and each hunter receives a monthly subsidy of 70 yuan.
</P>
<P>
With his daily necessities taken care of, and the awareness of
the need to protect wildlife and maintain the ecological balance
enhanced, the hunting ban is going fairly smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Hunters have already turned in more than 20 guns, and all guns
are expected to be handed over by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Central American Presidents Meet to Promote Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTELIMAR, NICARAGUA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua's President
today called on Central American countries to make up for the
"lost decade" of the 1980s and strive to make sustainable
development and tourism a reality.
</P>
<P>
With the armed conflicts of the 1980s now over and peace having
returned to most of the region, Central America should take
advantage of its natural attractions and culture to build itself
into a major world tourist destination, said President Violetta
Chamorro.
</P>
<P>
The president was speaking at the opening ceremony of the 18th
Central American Summit on Tourism and Sustainable Development in
the beach resort of Montelimar on the Pacific coast of Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras
and Panama and leaders from El Salvador and Belize attended the
summit and German President Roman Herzog was a special guest.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan president said that in 1990, Central American
leaders met in the same place, but under quite different
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"Today, six years later, there have been enormous
transformations in Central America. Total peace has been reached
in Nicaragua and El Salvador. Guatemala has continued its
dialogue process and is currently in the final stage of its quest
for peace," she said.
</P>
<P>
In an increasingly competitive world, Central Americans "must
make up for the time that we lost in the decade of the 1980s" due
to the civil wars.
</P>
<P>
"We must take advantage of our privileged geographical
position, our natural tourist attractions and our cultural
attractions to offer the world a tourist destination with a
regional character," she said.
</P>
<P>
The German president told the conference that after the bloody
fighting which marked image of Central American in the 1980s, the
region is now a model of a successful process of peace and
democratization.
</P>
<P>
Herzog said that "the European Union and Germany back Central
Americans with all the means within their reach because they are
convinced that there is no other alternative to association among
regions."
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, the Central American presidents will discuss
concrete action to promote regional tourism. The final documents
of the summit are expected to be signed Thursday.

BRUSSELS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- French squad Paris Saint-Germain
took its first ever European trophy Wednesday after beating Rapid
Vienna of Austria in the Cup Winners' Cup final here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Defender Bruno Ngotty scored the solo goal of the match at the
28th minute as Paris Saint-Germain dominated for most time of the
match.
</P>
<P>
Rapid Vienna fought hard in the second half but their efforts
were all turned down by Psg goal-keeper Bernard Lama.
</P>
<P>
Youri Djorkaeff, who keeps Eric Cantona out of the French
national side, was the real star of the match and he had the
chance to score a hat-trick in the game.
</P>
<P>
Playing behind Partice Loko and Valdes Dely in the Psg attack,
Djorkaeff played the most important role in the French attack, he
touched a free-kick to Ngotty and Ngotty's 30-meter shot deflected
off Rapid's peter Schoettel and beat the goal-keeper.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia
suffered another heavy blow as he went down to the German Carl-Uwe
Steeb in the second round of the 2.2 million-U.S.-Dollar German
Open tennis tourney on Wednesday in Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
The German, world 75th-ranked, pumped up by the partisan home
crowd, finished an easy job to down Ivanisevic 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
It was Steeb's fourth victory out of their five encounters.
Like Becker, Ivanisevic is a better player on faster surfaces than
clay.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Boris Becker needed more than two hours to defeat
Spanish qualifier Emilio Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
World No. 5 Becker, who has never won a title on this surface
in his illustrious career, finally prevailed on his second match
point with a service winner after 2 hours 6 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Alvarez is ranked a poor No.187 in the world and the German
Open is the first 1996 tournament where he managed to qualify for
the main draw.
</P>
<P>
In the other matches of the day, third seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov
of Russia beat Stefano Pescosolido, 6-2, 7-6 (7-2), fourth seeded
South African Wayne Ferreira ousted Daniel Vacek of the Czech
Republic 6-2, 6-0 and sixth seed Sergi Bruguera of Spain defeated
compatriot Francisco Roig, 6-2, 7-5.

<HEADLINE> Africa Records Highest Economic Growth In Decade, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The income of individual state
in sub-Saharan African region was on the rise for the first time
since 1989, said a World Bank report obtained here today.
</P>
<P>
According to ''Global Economic Prospects 1996'', released today
in Midrand, north of Johannesburg, where the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development was held, the region's gross
domestic product (GDP) was increased to 4 percent in 1995, its
highest growth rate of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Economies were on the rise across the continent, with 30 of
sub-Saharan Africa's 48 countries recording increases in GDP
better than 3 percent, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Africa's positive economic performance was reportedly
attributed to various factors -- high world commodity price over
the last two years, more liberal economic policies in many
countries, the relatively peaceful political transition of South
Africa, and the movement from war to peace in several parts of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that South Africa, the region's largest
economy, had continued to recover for the second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's 3.5 percent GDP growth last year, although
modest, was expected to carry spill-over benefits for the area
through faster regional economic integration and increased trade
and investment flows, it added.

<P>
ATHENS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- About 3,000 Greek construction
workers held a protest rally here today to press for higher
pay.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the government to take measures to combat
unemployment in the construction branch.
</P>
<P>
After the rally, the demonstrators marched to the parliament
where representatives met with the country's Prime Minister
Costas Simitis.
</P>
<P>
President of the Athens' Construction Workers' Union
Kyriakos Kerasounlis told reporters that the meeting with the
premier had been fruitless, since Simitis did not confirm any
government pledges to satisfy their demands.
</P>
<P>
Kerasounlis charged the government with "insensitivity,
irresponsibility and provocativeness" while other trade unionists
lashed out at Labor Minister Evangelos Yannopoulos.
</P>
<P>
Construction workers had an abortive meeting Tuesday with the
labor minister following a nationwide strike.
</P>
<P>
A new 24-hour strike has been scheduled for Thursday, along
with a rally in central Athens and a march to the Labor Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The administrations of the construction workers' trade unions
are to meet later today to examine the possibility of stepping
up their labor action.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Roberto Donadoni, who just
Won the Italian league soccer title with AC Milan, has joined the
MetroStars of the Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
Donadoni's debut brought the club its first victory in the
fledgling United States' league, rallying from three goals down
for a 4-3 shootout triumph over Tampa Bay at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's Giovanni Savarese scored twice for the MetroStars
to earn league player of the week honors. But the team's long-term
success on and off the field rests with Donadoni, the Italian
World Cup star.
</P>
<P>
"I am enthusiastic to play here," Donadoni said. "The squad
will continue to improve. I have just arrived and there are so
many changes."
</P>
<P>
Donadoni must adjust from having support from Italy's Franco
Baresi and Paolo Maldini, or Milan teammates Roberto Baggio and
George Weah, to playing alongside strangers Tab Ramos of the
United States and Ruben Dario Hernandez of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Donadoni, a divorcee with one child now engaged to a Milan
businesswoman, makes the MLS maximum 175,000 dollars but has
bonuses from sponsors to reach the million-dollar level.
</P>
<P>
Money is a key point. Donadoni was made a three-year
counter-offer to stay with AC Milan, but plans to honor his
commitment to MLS, to the relief of US league talent recruiter
Sunil Gulati.

<HEADLINE> Drug Combination Slows AIDS Progression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A new AIDS drug used in combination
with an established treatment has shown effects of slowing down
the disease progression by some 50 percent, Globe and Mail
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
A study on 987 patients in Canada and the United States found
that saquinavir, when taken with the antiviral drug ddC, reduced
the recurrence of infections and cancers by half and reduced the
number of deaths when compared with the use of either drug alone.
</P>
<P>
The report said the study sponsored by a saquinavir drug
company found that about 10 percent of patients died in the groups
receiving either ddC or saquinavir alone, but 2.9 percent died
among those taking the combination over a period of 73 weeks.
</P>
<P>
However, the result was challenged by Dr. Philip Berger, a
Canadian physician who specializes in AIDS. He said the study
should be independently reviewed and it was too early to draw
conclusions on its long-term benefits.
</P>
<P>
Saquinavir is a protease inhibitor, one of a new family of
drugs that block the AIDS virus' reproduction.
</P>
<P>
Approved in Canada in March, the medication costs over 5,000
U.S. dollars a year for a patient, about twice the cost of earlier
drugs.
</P>
<P>
British Columbia became the first Canadian province in April to
cover the cost of treatment under its health plan.

LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- British legislators were urged today
by senior police officers to back a ban on keeping handguns at
home in a bid to reduce gun-related crimes, according to a BBC TV
report.
</P>
<P>
The Police Superintendents' Association put forth the request
to the Home Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons,
which is now investigating gun controls following the mass killing
in Dunblane Primary School, Scotland.
</P>

The committee was also asked to consider forcing applicants for
gun licenses to place ads in newspapers so as to allow people to

applicant.
</P>

gym of the school and opened fire at the 29 children and their

Sixteen pupils and their teacher were instantly killed and
another 12 children wounded. The whole country was then terribly

<HEADLINE> British Farmers Welcome EU Proposal on Easing Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The British Farmers' Union (BFU) has
welcomed the European Union (EU) Commission's proposal to relax
the worldwide ban on the exports of British beef products.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission recommended easing the ban on British beef
products earlier today to allow the export of gelatine, tallow and
semen.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, put forward by EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz
Fischler, is to be handed over to the EU Veterinary Committee
conference on May 15 to seek their approval.
</P>
<P>
"It is a welcome step and the sooner the better. The whole ban
was unnecessary," a BFU spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, a German source is quoted by the BBC television as
saying that Germany is unlikely to agree to relax the EU ban so
quickly.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say even if gelatine and other by-products are
allowed to be sold abroad, the question of exporting British beef
itself remains a long way off.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that British Prime Minister John Major has urged
EU Commission to hold a special EU summit to seek a quick solution
to the beef crisis.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the global ban on British beef exports in April
when the British government admitted that there was some possible
link between BSE or mad cow disease and its human equivalent CJD
disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan will send next month a
fact-finding mission on chemical weapons left behind in China by
former Japanese Imperial Army troops in closing days of World War
II, the Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The mission, to be made up of officials at government
ministries and agencies as well as the Japanese Embassy in China,
will stay in China from May 14 through June 3.
</P>
<P>
The team will visit a local area in Jilin Province,
northeastern China, to investigate the quantity of buried chemical
weapons and examine the environment in the region, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
The mission will also hold talks with Chinese officials on
Japan's future surveys of the abandoned chemical weapons in China.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese military left some two million poison gas shells
in the country at the end of the war of Japanese aggression
against China. China has urged Japan to solve the problem as soon
as possible since the chemical weapons threaten the safety of
local residents and pollute the environment.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 2nd Bus Bomb Blast in 10 Days in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Before Pakistan could recover from
the shock of a bus bomb blast on April 28 which killed 52 people,
a second bomb blast in just 10 days ripped through a passenger bus
with the loss of seven lives.
</P>
<P>
At the morning rush hour today, the ill-starred passenger bus
arrived at Shekhupura, a district headquarters some 35 kilometers
northwest of Lahore, the capital of Punjab province.
</P>
<P>
Minutes after many students from schools and colleges got off
the bus at a college bus-stop, the vehicle was blown up with a
deafening bang in front of a hospital.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports said the bomb, a device similar to the bus
bomb 10 days ago, was placed beneath the seat over the petrol tank
of the bus.
</P>
<P>
Of 42 passengers aboard, five were killed on the spot while two
others died in a hospital. One child was among the seven victims.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five people were injured, with 16 of them reportedly in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the latest blast, Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto, who is currently on an official visit to Sweden, issued a
statement strongly condemning the "dastardly act".
</P>
<P>
She reaffirmed that the harder the terrorists tried to
terrorize the people and the government, the harder will be the
government's resolve to deal with them with an iron hand.
</P>
<P>
She said such "dastardly act" will intimidate neither the
government nor the people.
</P>
<P>
The government would not compromise, she said, adding it would
fight till the last terrorist is brought to book.
</P>
<P>
President Farooq Leghari and other senior officials also
condemned the blast.
</P>
<P>
Punjab provincial authorities have been directed to mobilize
all its resources in order to bring the culprits to justice as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
Punjab, the most populous province in Pakistan, once enjoyed
relative peace, in comparison with neighboring Sindh province.
</P>
<P>
About 1,800 people died last year in violence-related incidents
in the provincial capital Karachi alone.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, however, a series of violence
has hit Punjab, especially Lahore, when law and order in Sindh and
Karachi has been greatly improved due to the government's strong
measures.
</P>
<P>
Two bombs exploded in Lahore on January 18, leaving 32 people
injured.
</P>
<P>
Six vehicles were damaged by a hand-made explosive on April 9
in Lahore, the second largest city in the country after Karachi.
</P>
<P>
Again on April 14, six people were killed when a bomb went off
in an outpatient department waiting-room of a charity cancer
hospital set up by former cricket star Imran Khan.
</P>
<P>
But the bloodiest one struck on April 28 on the eve of Eid ul
Azha, one of the biggest Muslim festival, when people rushed for
home for the festival celebration.
</P>
<P>
At least 52 people were killed when a powerful bomb attached to
the petrol tank of a passenger bus exploded in a crowded bus-stop
about 100 kilometers southwest of Lahore.
</P>
<P>
So far no one has claimed responsibility for any of the blasts.

<HEADLINE> Kim Young-sam Reshuffles His Party to Tighten Grip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Young-sam
appointed Wednesday close aides to key posts in the reshuffle of
the New Korea Party (NKP), in an attempt to tighten control over
the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Former South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hong-koo was appointed
party chairman, The second person in NKP leadership, to replace
Kim Yoon-hwan yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Kim Young-sam, also president of the NKP, retained Kang Sam-jae
as party secretary-general, the third most important post in the
ruling camp.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Kim Deok-ryong was named minister for political
affairs, Lee Sang-deuk chief policy-maker, Suh Chung-won floor
leader in the National Assembly, Park Bum-jin chief secretary to
the party president, Kim Chul the party spokesman and Lee Wan-koo
chief secretary to the party chairman.
</P>
<P>
Suh Chung-won and Kim Deok-ryong have been close to Kim
Young-sam since his days as a dissident in the 1970s when South
Korea was ruled by military-backed presidents.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the reshuffle reflects the president's
intention to place the governing party under his own clout without
breaking the party.
</P>
<P>
Kim Young-sam is banned by the constitution from seeking
re-election after his term ends in February 1998, so the
appearance of a strong party leader could have loosened his grip
on the NKP. Former Prime Minister Lee Hong-koo, who joined the NKP
shortly before the parliamentary election, has no followers of his
own within the party.
</P>
<P>
Lee has declared he had no intention to run for the presidency
next year immediately after his appointment. Kim Deok-ryong's
appointment as the minister in charge of political affairs is an
exception as all the other NKP presidential hopefuls were excluded
from major party positions.

<HEADLINE> Anti-terrorism Police Units Formally Launched in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan today formally launched
anti-terrorism police squads dubbed "special assault teams" (SAT),
ending the long-time secrecy surrounding their existence.
</P>
<P>
The 20-member teams, stationed in seven prefectures including
Tokyo and Osaka, are trained to handle emergencies such as
hijackings and hostage situations, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
SAT squads have been serving in Tokyo and Osaka for almost two
decades, but the matter had been kept top secret even within
police circles.
</P>
<P>
However, faced with a widespread feeling of insecurity among
the public due to homebred terrorism such as last year's sarin gas
attack on Tokyo subways, more openness seemed advisable.
</P>
<P>
"We concluded that people would feel reassured if they knew
about the existence of the teams and that SATs would have a
deterring effect on terrorists," Kyodo quoted a National Police
Agency official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The teams, based in the agency and the prefectural police
headquarters of Osaka, Hokkaido, Chiba, Kanagawa, Aichi and
Fukuoka, are armed with rifles and equipped with high-vision
glasses and other special tools, Kyodo said.

PESHAWAR, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, one of the
main Afghan opposition leader, is preparing to enter the Kabul
government, Jamaat-i-Islami sources learnt from a meeting of
Hezb-i-Islami.
</P>
<P>
The sources told Xinhua that the meeting chaired by
Hezb-i-Islami chief Hekmatyar today in Lagman province in eastern
Afghanistan also discussed Hekmatyar's talks with the Kabul
government.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Hekmatyar said their cooperation with
President Burhanuddin Rabbani was not against any third party,
referring to the Taliban religious student militia.
</P>
<P>
He said they had held many talks with the Taliban, which
resulted in no agreement due to the Taliban's "negative attitude."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban has besieged Kabul since last October in a bid to
topple Rabbani's government.
</P>
<P>
They have so far refused to enter into alliance with any other
faction in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jamaat-i-Islami's chief Qazi Hussain Ahmad, who
arrived in Kabul last Thursday, extended his stay in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He has been busy shuttling between rival Afghan factions,
trying to bring them to the negotiating table for a peaceful
settlement of the conflict in the country, which has suffered
seven years of civil war.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Asks for Full Publication of UN Report on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz tonight asked the United Nations to fully publish its
report on the Israeli bombardment at a multi-national force base
in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz was quoted by the state-run Lebanese National News
Agency as announcing that "we have received the contents of the
report, and we think that the grade of responsibility was
lowered."
</P>
<P>
"The effect of the report was reduced, so was its exactitude,"
the foreign minister stressed. "We ask for a full publication (of
the report)."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretariat Tuesday issued the report on the Israeli
bombardment at the U.N. peacekeeping force camp in the southern
Lebanese town of Kana on April 18, killing more than 100 refugees
seeking shelter in the camp at that moment.
</P>
<P>
In the report which was based on the investigations conducted
by the U.N. itself, the international organization described the
bombardment as deliberate.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister said earlier today that the
cease-fire understanding reached on April 26, which put an end to
the 16-day Israeli bombardments and air strikes at southern
Lebanese towns and villages, "could not be a substitute for
U.N. resolution 425."
</P>
<P>
He denied the existence of secret supplements to the April 26
understanding.
</P>
<P>
At a forum organized by chief editors of the local press,
Boueiz repeated Lebanon's call for Israel's withdrawal from south
Lebanon and western Beqaa in compliance with U.N. Security Council
resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon entered the peace process on the base of this
resolution and resolution 242, considering that Lebanon is an Arab
country concerned with the conflict with Israel," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that his country would not sign a peace
agreement with the Jewish state without Syria doing the same and
that the Lebanese and Syrian tracks were "inseparable."
</P>
<P>
He said Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres had believed that
he would benefit from the military operation in southern Lebanon
and western Beqaa in the coming Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz pointed to several goals Israel had wanted to achieve
through the 16-day aggression, including expelling some 300,000
Lebanese toward the capital, pulling the Lebanese administration
to a conflict with the resistance and dismantling the tie between
Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
"But Lebanon foiled these goals," Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed the lebanese people's right to resist the Israeli
occupation and called on the resistance (movement) to be concord
with the state.

<HEADLINE> Estonia Expels Russian Diplomat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Estonian authorities told a
Russian diplomat to leave Estonia this afternoon, only hours after
Moscow expelled an Estonian diplomat, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
Estonian Ambassador Mart Helme confirmed that Estonia's
competent bodies have "documentary evidence" of illegal activities
by the Russian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Official representations have been made to the Russian side,
but no response has been received, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Russian authorities announced the expulsion of the Estonian
diplomat from Russia earlier today, stressing that his activities
were incompatible with his diplomatic status.
</P>
<P>
The names and ranks of both diplomats have not yet been made
public.
</P>
<P>
According to a source in te Russian Foreign Ministry, this was
caused by an FSB (Russia's Federal Security Service) statement
earlier this week concerning involvement of Estonian intelligence
in weapons deliveries to the Irish Republican Army and Chechen
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Brandishing a threat to expel the Russian diplomat, the
Estonian authorities had been trying either to prevent the Russian
side from digging up evidence against high-ranking Estonian
smugglers, or to draw the attention of the international community
to Russia's so-called "spying intrigues" in Estonia, the source
said.

<P>
AMMAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordan denied here today that it has
any difference with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) which
needs mediation from any other country.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti told reporters at a joint
press conference with his Egyptian counterpart Kamal el-Ganzouri
that there was always a need for more coordination and
consultation between the parties of the Jordanian-Egyptian-
Palestinian equation to help the Palestinian side in the final
stage negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan was concerned that the peace process between
the PNA and Israel reaches its logical and reasonable end.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the Palestinian problem is the
practical foundation that solves the Arab-Israeli conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti told reporters that the final stage talks are thorny
and the time limit is long.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Palestinian negotiators will be
supported by the international community and Arab countries to
overcome hurdles and shorten the negotiations in the time limit in
order to reach a solution acceptable for both sides.
</P>
<P>
He said the ultimate settlement would help the PNA establish a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital and the
settlement of refugee issue.

<P>
NEW DELHI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- India's ruling Congress Party
tonight conceded that it may not be able to get a majority in the
Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) elections judging by the
trends available so far.
</P>
<P>
"Judging by the current trends we are not in a position to get
a majority," senior Congress Party leader and Foreign Affairs
Minister Pranab Mukherjee told state television in an interview.
</P>
<P>
India today began the counting of votes for 354 Lok Sabha seats
contested in the first two phases of polling of the current

</P>
<P>
Mukherjee avoided a question as to whether Congress would stake
a claim to form the next government if it failed to reach the 200
seat mark.
</P>
<P>
He said various probabilities needed to be taken into account
and the number was one of the important factors.

tonight.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Blamed for Fiasco over Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Michael Perry, chairman of Unilever,
the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group that owns Birds
Eye frozen foods, made a veiled attack Tuesday on the British
government's handling of the mad cow disease crisis.
</P>
<P>
Perry, speaking at the company's annual meeting, said that the
blame for the fiasco over the mad cow disease (BSE) crisis lay in
Britain and not in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said, "There is a tendency in some quarters to portray the
sources of the troubles in the BSE fiasco as lying abroad,
particularly in the hands of our European partners. This is not
where they lie. They lie at home and it is here, in the United
Kingdom, where the solutions must be sought."
</P>
<P>
Consumer confidence is the issue at the heart of the BSE scare
and the UK food companies have sought to assure consumers of the
quality and safety of their beef products, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unilever revealed last week that it had written off 15 million
pounds (22.5 million U.S. dollars) for wasted beef stocks after it
halted its Birds Eye frozen beefburger production line.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that he had every confidence in the British beef
industry's commitment and ability to put matters right.
</P>
<P>
"The sound and fury that has accompanied the handling of the
BSE crisis must not allowed to spill over into wider European
relations and get in the way of our positive commitment to the
single market," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Hopes for Success of Oil-For-Food Talks, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq says that it hopes for the
success of the ongoing fourth round of talks with the U.N. on an
oil-for-food deal on the basis of preserving its sovereignty,
national unity and dignity, while blaming the U.S. and Britain for
their interference.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported today that the Iraqi
cabinet meeting chaired Tuesday by President Saddam Hussein
stressed that any intervention by the United States and Britain in
the process of the Iraq-U.N. talks is an illegal behavior that
involves malicious political aims.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi cabinet appreciated the stance of the 13 other member
states of the Security Council which indicate that the American-
British interference with the talks is far from the objectives and
charter of the United Nations, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Iraq reiterated that the current talks should
not be an alternative to its right to implement paragraph 22 of
U.N. resolution 687 as a prelude to the total and unconditional
lifting of the economic embargo imposed on Iraq for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait since Iraq has fulfilled its commitments toward
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, President Saddam Hussein also urged the
relevant government departments to boost industry to manufacture
some parts of agricultural machinery domestically and create job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
U.N. and Iraqi officials have been negotiating an oil-for-food
agreement that will allow the country to sell up to 2 billion
U.S. dollars of oil over six months to raise money for its
beleaguered economy.
</P>
<P>
The third round of negotiations ended on April 24 without
agreement after the U.S. and Britain said a tentative accord
contained loopholes that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein could
exploit to buy prohibited military equipment and keep food and
medicine from his opponents.
</P>
<P>
A fourth round of negotiations opened on May 7 in New York.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects Iranian Statement on POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today rejected an Iranian
statement saying that Iraq has blocked the implementation of the
September 1995 accord on the issues of the prisoners of war (POWs)
and the missing during the eight-year Iraq-Iran war.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the statement issued Sunday by Abdullah Majafi,
head of the Iranian Committee of Prisoners of War, an Iraqi
Foreign Ministry spokesman said Iraq has worked in earnest to
implement the September accord to put an end to the suffering of
the Iraqi POWs held in Iran, the official Iraqi News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
During the two meetings with an Iranian delegation, the Iraqi
side has submitted practical proposals to implement the first para
of the accord which provides for an exchange of lists of POWs, he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the Iranian side has refused to hand
over lists of the Iraqi POWs and the missing registered by the Red
Cross.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq has sent back to Iran all the 39,044 POWs under
the supervision of the Red Cross. Some POWs staying in Iraq have
stated their wish of remaining here in the presence of the Red
Cross and an official Iranian delegation which was in Iraq at that
time.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Iraq-Iran war in 1988, the issues of
POWs and the missing between the two neighboring countries remain
unsettled and have become an element which hampers the
normalization of bilateral relations.

Lebanon, and ways of activating the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Jordanian summit is also due to cover bilateral

</P>
<P>
Moussa said today's summit talks are restricted to Egypt and
Jordan, and that Mubarak and Hussein will review Arab issues of
mutual concern as well as the Middle East peace process.

Asked about the reported departure of Arafat from Gaza and his
scheduled arrival in Cairo Thursday, and the report that the
Jordanian monarch will spend the night in Cairo for a tripartite
summit Thursday, Moussa said that King Hussein will be leaving
Cairo this evening after his talks with President Mubarak.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Oil Company Yields Record High Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The state-owned Kuwait Petroleum
Corporation announced today that the year 1994-95 has become the
most successful financial year since its formation in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The company's 1994-95 annual report said a record profit
amounting to 811 million Kuwait Dinar (2.68 billion U.S. dollars)
was achieved during the year, bringing the total revenues of the
corporation to 5.4 billion Kuwait Dinar (17.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The good results were attributed to the slight increase in the
oil prices and to the company's ability to transform its crude oil
into refined petrochemical products in addition to the adoption of
a wise marketing policy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the revenues led to a very healthy cash flow
from operations in excess of 4.1 billion dollars, making the
corporation able to distribute an unprecedented level of profits
of 2.4 billion dollars to its shareholder, the government of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The corporation, as the only oil body authorized by the state
to manage oil production, exports and petrochemical products in
the country, is the cornerstone of the national economy of
Kuwait. Ninety percent of the export revenues in the country comes
from oil exports which support most of the government's
expenditure bill.
</P>
<P>
Good performances of the corporation allowed it to build one
of the world's premier intergrated oil conglomerates, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Arrives in Yerevan Over Karabakh Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov arrived in Yerevan tonight for talks with Armenian
leaders to settle the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over the
Nagorno-Karabakh region, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Primakov flew in to the Armenian capital of Yerevan from Baku,
capital of Azerbaijan, where he held a tete-a-tete talk with
Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of Primakov's visit to the two former Soviet
republics is to "render assistance" in the settlement of the
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict around Nagorno-Karabakh, a source in
the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the minister makes the trip within the framework
of Russia's "shuttle diplomacy" aimed at a speedy settlement of
the Nagorno-Karabakh problem.
</P>
<P>
By such a move, Russia wants to keep its leading status within
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and make the
situation in its surrounding region stable, diplomats here noted.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Yerevan's Zvartnots airport, Primakov
stated he "carries out this mission on the direct instruction of
the Russian president (Boris Yeltsin) and we hope to make certain
progress."
</P>
<P>
"The main thing we have managed to do is to exchange POWs and
hostages," the minister said. "We have brought all the persons
kept by the Azerbaijani side and now we will take all the captives
from Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh to Baku," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Primakov, "all the decisive moves to settle the
conflict start with the exchange of the POWs and hostages."
</P>
<P>
Primakov's plane carried 35 Armenian prisoners of war and
hostages to be exchanged for 69 Azeris held by the Armenian side.

<HEADLINE> Consideration For Withdrawal From GNU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua)-- It is unavoidable for the
National Party (NP) to consider a possible withdrawal from the
Government of National Unity (GNU), NP Leader and Deputy
President F W De Klerk said today.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk was reacting to speculation that the NP would soon
pull out of the African National Congress (ANC)-led multi-party
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Cape Town, De Klerk said no decision
whatsoever had yet been taken to withdraw from the GNU.
</P>
<P>
However, a broad discussion on a possible withdrawal had been
conducted within NP meetings during the past few days.
</P>
<P>
''This is a logical question against the background of the
fact that the new constitution makes no provision in any manner
for continued joint decision making in the executive branch of
government,'' said De Klerk.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's new constitution was formally adopted by the
constitutional assembly earlier in the day, one day ahead of the
May 9 deadline set by the interim constitution two years ago.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said South Africa would pay a high price in the form
of loss of confidence for the majority rule model in the new
constitution, saying it rang the death knell for multi-party
participation in cabinet decision-making.
</P>
<P>
He said the constitution meant the end of multi-party
participation in the cabinet, with the ANC rejecting even ''a
very moderate proposal'' for a multi-party consultation body.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the NP's possible withdrawal from the GNU, ANC
national spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said there was nothing new
about speculation of NP's future role in the GNU, because similar
statements in the past ''have coincided with major events of
political significance in the country, such as the opening of
parliament''.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President's Visit to Egypt Has Far </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to Egypt Yang
Fuchang has described the visit to Egypt by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin from May 13 to 17 as "historic" and "having far
reaching significance."
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador made the remarks at a news conference today at
the premises of the Chinese Embassy in Cairo on the eve of the
Chinese President's African tour which began today in Kenya and
will also take him to Ethiopia, Mali, Namibia and Zimbabwe,
besides Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Addressing scores of Chinese and Egyptian journalists here,
Ambassador Yang Fuchang said that the Chinese President's African
tour aims at consolidating friendship, strengthening solidarity
and promoting cooperation with those countries, as well as
learning from African peoples' experience.
</P>
<P>
It stands as clear demonstration of China's interest and
appreciation of the traditional friendship with the Egyptian and
African peoples, the Ambassador said, adding that the tour will
also reflect China's firm commitment to entrench and develop the
bonds of solidarity and cooperation with Egypt and other African
countries, which is a vital part of China's independent foreign
policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador expressed the conviction that President Jiang's
visit to Egypt, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Egypt,
will certainly contribute to the deepening of understanding
between the two friendly countries, and the strengthening of the
friendship between the two peoples. It will also play a great role
in further developing cordial cooperation between China and Egypt,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ambassador said that during his visit to Egypt,
President Jiang will hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, and will meet with Speaker of the Egyptian People's
Assembly Ahmed Faghi Sorour, Speaker of the Egyptian Shura
(Consultative) Council Mustafa Kamal Helim, and the Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid. He will also attend the
signing ceremonies of several bilateral agreements in the
economic, cultural and labor fields and tour an industrial town
and some Egyptian touristic sites.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Yang underscored that China is not only keen on
strengthening its good relations with Egypt at the political
level, but also interested in furthering relations of cooperation
in the economic, commercial, scientific, technological, cultural
and other fields.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Egypt, being a country of paramount
weight in Africa and the Middle East, is playing a significant
role at the world and regional levels. He expressed appreciation
of Egypt's positive role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Concluding his news conference, the Chinese ambassador
emphasized that "we shall continue to act to the best of our
ability in supporting and promoting the peace process, and we
express our satisfaction with every progress to be achieved in the
Middle East peace negotiations."

between the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the European

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Suggests Contingency Planning for Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The international community
should proceed with contingency planning for a possible military
intervention to save lives if disaster should strike Burundi and
lead to large-scale killing of civilians, the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council available here today,
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said that the security
situation has deteriorated markedly in Burundi since early March.
</P>
<P>
Hutu armed bands led by Leonard Nyangoma, president of the
Couseil National pour la Defense de la Democratie (CNDD), have
intensified their attacks throughout the country and tried to
isolate the capital by laying mines on the surrounding routes. The
Burundi Army has responded vigorously to these attacks. Over
100,000 people have been displaced as a result of the fighting, he
noted in the report.
</P>
<P>
The consultations with the permanent members of the Security
Council, major troop-contributing countries and interested states
have revealed that they share the sense of urgency about the
situation in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
One measure that the Secretariat has been urged to take, and
which is within its capacity, is to draw up plans for a possible
peacekeeping operation to be deployed in the event of a political
agreement reached by the parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Member states have agreed that contingency planning for other
eventualities, including a worst-case scenario, should also
proceed. A number of countries have expressed a readiness in
principle to consider providing troops in the circumstances
envisaged," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential for the international community to demonstrate
to all parties in Burundi that it has the political will and the
capacity to take timely and effective action to avert another
tragedy in the Great Lakes region," he said in conclusion.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rejects Quick Access to Clinton Whitewater Video </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The federal judge hearing the
Whitewater trial today rejected a request by the media for
immediate access to U.S. President Bill Clinton's videotaped
testimony.
</P>
<P>
A group of four television networks and two other journalism
organizations Friday went to court in Little Rock, Arkansas,
asking U.S. District Judge George Howard Jr. to release the tape.
</P>
<P>
Howard said today that it was not fair to defense attorneys to
force them to deal with the side issue of the media request at
this point in the trial, according to an Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
Howard first told the networks Monday that they should make
their request with other media who have been given until May 24 to
suggest how the judge handles the tape.
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday, they asked Howard to reconsider and release the
tape when it is shown in the Whitewater trial of Governor Jim Guy
Tucker and Jim and Susan McDougal. That probably will be Thursday,
lawyers in the case said.
</P>
<P>
The White House wants the videotape to remain under seal,
fearing Clinton's political opponents would use it in campaign
ads.
</P>
<P>
The McDougals subpoenaed Clinton to rebut claims made against
them during the government's case, including David Hale's claim
that Clinton was behind a 300,000-dollar loan made to Mrs.
McDougal's advertising company.

<P>
LUANDA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Angola's parliament today
unanimously passed an amnesty law which lays a stronger foundation
for the implementation of the peace agreement.
</P>

with the move, adding that it will enhance mutual undersatnding
and trust between the Angolan government and the UNITA (National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola).
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the approving of the amnesty law,
expected to step up the pace of the peace process in Angola, is a

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's New Constitution Draws Mixed Reaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The formal adoption of South
Africa's first democratic constitution today drew mixed reactions
from parties, labour organizations and business.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution was formally adopted by the
Constitutional Assembly this morning by 421 votes, with two
African Christian Democratic Party parliamentarians voting
against it and 10 abstentions from the Freedom Front.
</P>
<P>
The African National Congress (ANC), the National Party (NP)
and Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) voted for the bill.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party, which claimed it would challenge the
lock-out clause in the Constitutional Court, also voted for the
bill.
</P>
<P>
However, the vote count excluded those of the Inkatha Freedom
Party (IFP), which withdrew from the Constitutional Assembly
early last year.
</P>
<P>
The ANC heralded the new constitution as ''the crowning
achievement of the struggle for democracy in South Africa.''
</P>
<P>
PAC President Clarence Makwetu said the new constitution was a
considerable improvement on the basis of the interim constitution
and created a fair constitutional order, a constitutional state
and a working system of government.
</P>
<P>
NP leader and Deputy President F. W. Klerk said the
constitution meant the end of multi-party participation in the
cabinet, with the ANC rejecting even ''a very moderate proposal''
for a multi-party consultation body.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Congress of South African Trade Unions said
that it had achieved the goals it had set itself and that the
constitution represented a victory for workers and advanced their
rights.
</P>
<P>
The National Council of Trade Unions said the constitution
represented the general aspirations of South African society and
guaranteed people's rights and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
However, the South African Chamber of Business said it is
deeply concerned at the constitution's failure to ensure an
equitable balance between employers' and employees' rights.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one predominantly Afrikans organizations rejected the
constitution as a threat to their freedom, but said they would
not initiate any joint action against it.

<HEADLINE> West African Foreign Ministers Call For </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of West African
countries who met in Ghana over the issue of Liberia called today
for reinstatement of Krahn warlord Roosevelt Johnson in a bid to
end the civil war in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
They believed that the sacking of Johnson from the Liberian
cabinet is the cause of renewed fighting in Monrovia, capital of
Liberia, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's Foreign Minister Obed Asamoah said, quoted by reports,
the decision was one of the seven measures taken by the ministers
who had met to prepare an aborted summit on ending Liberia's
civil war.
</P>
<P>
The emergency summit was scheduled to open today in the
Ghanaian capital of Accra where heads of state of the nine West
African countries will discuss the crisis in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
However, according to reports, Nigeria's head of state General
Sani Abacha And most invited heads of state had signaled that they
would not attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In Abuja, capital of Nigeria, the absence of Sani Abacha was
confirmed today when an official in Abacha's office was quoted as
saying "he is not going".
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Abacha had been expected to be a key player
as the summit hopes to discuss reinforcing ECOMOG, the west
African countries peacekeeping force, to give it muscle to disarm
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Both Abacha and Togo's Gnassingbe Eyadema had made last-minute
decisions to stay away citing pressing domestic matters, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the summit had already suffered an
apparent setback by a boycott by Liberia's strongest faction
leaders Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah, who are at the center
of the current fighting in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
So far only Sierra Leone's newly-elected Preident Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah is in Accra, sources said.

<HEADLINE> New Car Sales in UK Hit Two-year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new cars in Britain last
month were 17 percent higher than in April last year, the biggest
monthly rise for almost two years, according to figures released
Tuesday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
</P>
<P>
New car sales during April leapt upwards to 162,618 compared
with 138,770 in April last year. This was an increase of 17.19
percent.
</P>
<P>
April's sharp increase means that car sales for the first four
months now total 693,667, up by 4.5 percent on the same period of
1995.
</P>
<P>
The SMMT's statistics showed that new car sales to private
motorists were 15.9 percent higher last month compared with April
last year, reversing a year of almost unbroken decline.
</P>
<P>
Reductions in personal taxation, which were set out in the last
budget and came into effect last month, were seen as a possible
factor in the upturn.
</P>
<P>
However, the private share of last month's total of 162,618 new
car sales remained at 43 percent, the same as in April last year.
This was because fleet and business car buyers rose by 18.4
percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Imports continued to take a large slice of the market, with
foreign-built cars accounting for 61.3 percent of the market.

<HEADLINE> Top Anti-Drug Official Asks to Focus on Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Government's new top
drug fighter, Barry McCaffrey, told an oversight subcommittee of
the House of Representatives Wednesday that no single approach
will give the government a "jujitsu hold" on the national problem,
but the top priority must be reaching young people.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey elaborated on the government's National Drug Strategy
Goals, which President Bill Clinton announced last week in Miami
-- motivating youth to reject drugs and substance abuse; reducing
drug-related crime and violence; cutting health, welfare and crime
costs resulting from illegal drug use; better security on the
borders and breaking foreign and domestic drug sources of supply.
</P>
<P>
In his testimony to the panel McCaffrey said "Clearly, overall
drug use has come down from the '70s." The government believes "in
the last two, three, four years, cocaine use is down more than 30
percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Still, there are more than a million drug-related arrests each
year, and the estimate of hard drug users hovers around 3 million
people, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Growing at Moderate Pace, Fed Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy was growing at a
moderate pace in the last two months with little sign of any
inflation pressures, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the Fed's 12 regional banks, all
districts except New York were sharing in the economic expansion,
including varying degrees of manufacturing strength in nine of the
districts. Most districts also reported gains in retail sales.
</P>
<P>
"Price increases remained generally subdued and there were only
scattered reports of wage pressures despite continued tight labor
markets and somewhat stronger economic growth," the survey said.
</P>
<P>
While the prices of gasoline in the U.S. have been surging in
recent weeks, the U.S. Fed took the view that the spurt was likely
to be temporary and would not lead to an overall inflation spiral.
</P>
<P>
This view could have a calming effect on financial markets,
which have been unsettled in recent weeks by the jump in energy
and other commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
The survey, known as the Beige Book, will be used by Fed
policy-makers when they meet May 21 to consider interest rates.
</P>
<P>
After the government reported last week a rapid rebound of 2.8
percent in the overall economy during the first quarter this year,
some forecasters began to worry that the Fed might begin raising
rates.
</P>
<P>
However, today's report, with its benign view of inflation,
likely will reduce those fears and increase expectations that the
U.S. Fed will leave rates unchanged for now.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fed had cut short-term interest rates three times
between last July to January to stimulate an economic expansion
that was showing signs of weakening last year.

<HEADLINE> ICRC Focus on Obliterating War Effects in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- An international red cross official
said here today the organization's priority was to obliterate war
effects in the Balkan region, particularly in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
delegation to Yugoslavia Francois Bellon said the ICRC is focusing
its efforts on securing the release of remaining prisoners of all
three sides, obtaining information about missing persons, training
people to remove mines, building confidence among the national red
cross societies and continuing medical assistance to health
centers.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Tanjug news agency on the occasion of the
Red Cross and the Red Crescent Day which falls on today, Bellon
said the ICRC medical programs in Bosnia were primarily
implemented in the Serb entity Republika Srpska, where the
reconstruction of medical infrastructure is necessary.
</P>
<P>
If the ICRC stopped assisting Republika Srpska medical centers,
there would be a disaster, because no one else is there to help
them, Bellon said, adding the organization assisted the Republika
Srpska with about 800,000 German mark's worth of aid every month.
</P>
<P>
Medical infrastructure in Muslim-Croat federation is better and
other humanitarian organizations are also active there, the ICRC
official said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the return of refugees to their old homes, Bellon
said the climate was still not good for the Croatian Serb to
return to Krajina which was seized by force by the Croatian
government force in 1995, forcing tens of thousands of Serbs to
flee to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
ICRC had requested that Croatian authorities take adequate
measures to ease tension in the region and guarantee security to
the few remaining people, who are old, frightened and unprotected,
he added.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Renews Peace-keeping Mission in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council on
Wednesday voted to renew the mandate of a peace-keeping mission in
Angola for two months until 11 July 1996.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Verification Force in Angola (UNAVEM III),
with a force of 6,600 troops, is the current largest U.N.
peace-keeping operation.
</P>
<P>
It is mandated by the Security Council to verify the
disengagement of forces under the Lusaka Protocol, a 1994
agreement ending the most recent fighting. The civil war has
killed hundreds of thousands.
</P>
<P>
In adopting the decision unanimously, the council called upon
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to
fulfil by June 1996 its obligation to complete quartering of its
troops and to turn over to U.N. all arms, ammunition and military
equipment.
</P>
<P>
It also urges the government of Angola and UNITA to take all
necessary steps for UNITA to take their places in the National
Assembly and for the incorporation of UNITA personnel into the
state administration.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the council on the question of Angola, Chinese
U.N. envoy Qin Huasun said the Chinese government has been
following very closely the peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"The Angola people who have suffered greatly from the scourge
of war are looking forward to the final arrival of peace." he
said, "To achieve national reconciliation and peace in Angola
represents not only the strong desire of the Angolan people, but
also the common aspiration of the international community."
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin emphasized that the quartering of forces in
accordance with the Lusaka Protocol is one of the key links in the
Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Any delay on this question will seriously affect the whole
peace process. Therefore, we urge UNITA fulfill its commitment as
soon as possible by quartering its forces within the fixed
timetable," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Noting the Angolan question has now become the last hot spot to
be settled in southern Africa, Ambassador Qin said that China are
in favor of continued vigorous support for the Angolan peace
process by the international community in order to bring about
peace and tranquillity in the whole of southern Africa.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States is prepared to
train African peacekeepers in Liberia and provide them some 30
million U.S. dollars in aid while avoiding direct military
intervention in the bloody conflict in the African nation, senior
American officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before a hearing of a U.S. House subcommittee, U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs George Moose said
that the U.S. State Department and the Defense Department are
prepared to give more assistance to the West African peacekeeping
group Ecomog.
</P>
<P>
Ecomog, largely made up of soldiers from Nigeria, Has been
accused of being involved in the looting in the Liberian capital
of Monrovia and shirking its duties during the conflicts of rival
factions in Liberia in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The much-criticized peacekeeping group had some 10,000 troops
five years ago but it has waned to some 5,000 troops now, Moose
told the U.S. lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
"If Ecomog can demonstrate a renewed capacity to play a neutral
and effective peacekeeping role, we would be prepared to make
available approximately 30 million U.S. dollars from existing
resources in equipment and other additional assistance," Moose
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for
African Affairs Vinvent Kern told reporters that the Pentagon is
considering shipping surplus defense goods and providing training
for the Ecomog peacekeepers at a location outside Liberia.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A plunging stock market late
Wednesday snapped higher with bonds after a strong auction of new
U.S. Treasury debt sent long-term interest rates tumbling below 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Shrugging off a seemingly pivotal slide below 5,400, the Dow
Jones industrial average jumped 53.11 points to close at 5,474.06.
</P>
<P>
The stock market rebounded with bonds after an auction of new
10-year Treasury notes drew surprisingly strong bidding.
</P>
<P>
After the auction, the yield on the 30-Year Treasury bond _ a
benchmark used to set the rates charged on many types of loans _
fell below 7 percent, cheering stock investors.
</P>
<P>
The Dow and broader blue-chip indexes have been struggling in
recent weeks amid inflation worries and the persistent rise of
interest ratest.
</P>
<P>
The upward reversal in most broad-market measures was quite
abrupt.
</P>
<P>
After trailing declining issues by more than 3 to 1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, the number of NYSE advancers managed a slim
lead for the session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 2.65 to 345.98 after falling as
much as 4 points earlier in the session. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index rose 6.52 to 644.78, rebounding from a loss of
more than 8 points.
</P>

The Nasdaq composite index, down almost 20 at one point, rose
0.76 to 1,183.43, but the American Stock Exchange's market value
index fell 3.06 to 584.64.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) bus service began connecting towns in Bosnia's
two entities -- the Serb Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat
federation, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said.
</P>
<P>
Janowski said in Sarajevo that UNHCR was doing all it could to
improve freedom of movement, and the UNHCR bus would make four
round-trip shuttles between Serb town Lukavica and
Muslim-contralled Ilidza in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Janowski said that round-trip bus service would begin between
more towns in the two entities in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
"Citizens do not have to register before-hand and will get a

by UNHCR vehicles, while the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR)
will be in charge of safety measures."
</P>
<P>
Buses will have UNHCR signs, U.N. number plates and will be
painted in white, he added.

Under the Dayton agreement, the civilians must have rights to

<HEADLINE> UK to Investigate Loss of Top-Secret Video Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The British Ministry of Defense said
today that it would launch an inquiry into how top-secret army
training video tapes, which show the Army's most sensitive
techniques for fighting terrorists in Northern Ireland, were on
sale at a public market.
</P>
<P>
According to a BBC TV report, several secret video tapes
showing soldiers being trained were bought by a member of the
public at a car boot sale in the central English city of Coventry.
</P>
<P>
The BBC report said that the films could have given Irish
Republican Army guerrillas, who are fighting to end British rule
in Northern Ireland, crucial insights into army operational
techniques.
</P>
<P>
A leading defense analyst said the tapes would "put soldiers'
lives at risk if the IRA got hold of them" as they may have gaven
terrorists inside information on army tactics and capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The tapes are being returned to the Ministry of Defense, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Defense said it could not comment on the
content of the tapes but said it would launch an inquiry.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Cooperation With International Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today urged all states concerned, including the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia, to cooperate fully with the International Tribunal
and its organs in accordance with resolution 827.
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Security Council President for this month and
Chinese ambassador, said in a statement that the council deplored
the failure to date of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to
execute the arrest warrants issued by the Tribunal against the
three individuals referred to in the letter of April 24, 1996, and
called for the execution of those after arrest warrants without
delay.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Security Council on April 24, Antonio
Cassese, President of the International Tribunal for Former
Yugoslavia, wrote that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia refused
to cooperate with the International Tribunal and failed to execute
arrest warrants against three accused -- Mile Mrksic, Miroslav
Radic and Veselin Sljivancanin -- who were on its territory and
were charged with murder of 260 civilians and other unarmed men
following the fall of the city of Vukovar in November 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council recalled its decision in resolution 827
(1993) that "all states shall cooperate fully with the
International Tribunal and its organs in accordance with that
resolution and the Statute of the Tribunal and that consequently
all states shall take any measures necessary under their domestic
law to implement the provisions of the resolution and the statue,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called upon all states and others
concerned to comply fully with their obligations with respect to
cooperation with the Tribunal, and in particular their obligation
to execute arrest warrants transmitted to them by the Tribunal,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also called upon all states which had not
already done so to make provision in their domestic law enabling
them to comply fully with their obligations with respect to
cooperation with the Tribunal.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Slovenia Sign Defense Cooperation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States and the former
Yugoslav republic of Slovenia signed here today an agreement to
strengthen their defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry and visiting Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, the
two nations will exchange regularly classified military
information.
</P>
<P>
"It signals that our security cooperation has reached a higher
level of trust and openness, and it certainly is an important step
to bringing Slovenia closer to the NATO alliance," Perry told
reporters at the signing ceremony at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia, nestled on Croatia's northern border, has joined
NATO's "Partnership for Peace" military program and is seeking an
earlier full membership in the Western Military alliance.
</P>
<P>
"Slovenia is one of the countries with very good development,
the country which is considered very often as the best case among
transition countries in central and eastern Europe," Drnovsek told
the reporters.
</P>
<P>
That was a major argument for "full membership in NATO," the
Slovenian Prime Minister said.
</P>
<P>
Perry, who visited Slovenia last September, praised the
former Yugoslav republic for its active participation in the
NATO "Partnership for Peace" program.
</P>
<P>
But he made no commitment on when Slovenia could become the
full member of the 16-nation military alliance.
