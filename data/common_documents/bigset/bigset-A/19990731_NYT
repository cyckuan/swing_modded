KENNEDY'S AFTERLIFE, ASSUMED AND UNSPOKEN 
</HEADLINE>
 (yn) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the very heart of the final rites for John F. Kennedy Jr.,
his wife and her sister was a claim so utterly familiar, and yet so
disconcerting, that almost all the coverage of the event passed
over it quickly. This was not another example of media failure but
an illustration of a larger problem: how distinct religious beliefs
are transformed when they are filtered into public discourse.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar yet disconcerting claim, one widely affirmed but
nonetheless at odds with many modern assumptions, is, of course,
that the lives of the three young victims simply did not end with
that plane crash. Or, as it is put by a central prayer in the Roman
Catholic Mass of the Resurrection, celebrated for the Kennedys at
St. Thomas More Church in Manhattan: ``In Him, who rose from the
dead, our hope of resurrection dawned. The sadness of death gives
way to the bright promise of immortality.''
</P>
<P>
   In news coverage of that Mass, which was not televised or open
to members of the news media, this central message did not go
entirely unmentioned. But it was usually handled glancingly, in the
course, say, of explaining why the priests would be wearing white
vestments. And it was swamped by discussion of who attended the
service, how they looked, the political past and future of various
Kennedys and the impact on Manhattan traffic.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN, the Rev. John Gallen, the network's expert for the day
on Catholic liturgy, made a yeoman effort to interject a bit of the
rites' religious significance into the coverage, but he was clearly
struggling against television's very short theological attention
span. For every minute he had on the air, at least 10 were spent on
other topics, and more than half his own remarks were devoted to
recalling the presiding priest's relationship to the deceased, the
life of St. Thomas More and the religious issue in John F.
Kennedy's election to the presidency in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, one would think it should not have been
difficult for the news media to focus matter-of-factly on eternal
life as a major theme of the final rites. About 80 percent of the
American people say they believe in the afterlife, whether in the
Christian understanding or some other.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this is not exactly a rare, esoteric belief. For
all that, it remains a disconcerting one. As countless religious
thinkers have said, the afterlife is not just an extra, and very
long, chapter tacked on to the life lived here and now, but makes
that current life part of an altogether different plot. This belief
defies one of the most powerful world views of the age: the
scientific naturalism for which it is axiomatic that whatever is
real and true must be subject to experimental test and
verification.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two centuries, the rising intellectual tide of
that materialistic naturalism has taken its toll on believers' own
certainty about life beyond the grave. And, though millions of
Americans consider heaven a place no less real than the front
parlor, even firm believers have sometimes shied away from publicly
stressing a life to come. They have been embarrassed by childishly
literal renderings of heaven and hell, or offended by reductions of
human complexity and God's unfathomable ways to harsh and tidy
stories of punishment and reward.
</P>
<P>
   They understand the complaint that dreams of ``pie in the sky
when you die'' have been used to deflect demands for this-worldly
justice. Perhaps most of all, they reject the denigration of the
natural world and human potential that has often accompanied a
focus on a life to come.
</P>
<P>
   So despite the data on belief in an afterlife, no one can be
confident what people have in mind by it, or with what
qualifications they want to speak publicly about it. When this
belief is filtered into public discourse, it is natural to drift
toward vague or common-denominator language.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the allure of President Kennedy's remark, played up in many
news reports of the service at sea, about going back to the ocean,
``whence we came.'' His language evokes a biblical sense of the
cycle of life and death. ``Naked I came from the womb, naked I
shall return whence I came,'' says Job; ``the Lord gives and the
Lord takes away.'' Yet Kennedy's language rings with the imagery of
evolutionary theory as well.
</P>
<P>
   In Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's eloquent eulogy, the brief note that
young John and his bride would now ``be with'' his parents was
similarly open to different interpretations, with only the phrase
``where there will never be an end to love'' suggesting, without
insisting, a more specific religious belief.
</P>
<P>
   Even Father Gallen, trying to make sense of belief in the
afterlife for a presumably pluralistic audience, cast Catholic
teaching in terms of there being ``more than death'' or ``new
life'' that ``wins out over death.'' These are phrases that
certainly encompass religious belief in a personal immortality but
that are also compatible with vaguer or strictly humanistic notions
that positive, constructive forces in the world outweigh negative,
destructive ones.
</P>
<P>
   All this is understandable, and yet it means that the framework
for public discourse about beliefs like the one in an afterlife
comes close to the materialistic naturalism mentioned earlier. Only
close, because there is still ample talk of God _ which may placate
the religious sensibility _ although not a God whose deeds or
promises pose a serious challenge to naturalism.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a necessary condition of contemporary American pluralism,
in which both science and the mass media play crucial roles, that
something approaching naturalism become the default position for
rendering religious beliefs in public discourse? The answer is
unclear. The question, for believers, is very serious.

GREGORY MINOR, 62, ENGINEER WHO CRITICIZED NUCLEAR POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Calif.)   (mk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gregory Charles Minor, one of three middle-management engineers
who caused a stir when they quit the General Electric reactor
division in 1976 to protest nuclear power, died on July 20 at his
home in Telluride, Colo. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, which had been diagnosed in early June,
Jim Burch, a friend in Palo Alto, Calif., said.
</P>
<P>
   Minor, Richard Hubbard and Dale Bridenbaugh resigned from the
division of GE that built nuclear reactors, saying that they
believed nuclear power presented a profound threat to mankind. All
three were managing engineers who had spent most of their careers
building reactors, and their defection galvanized anti-nuclear
groups across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reason for leaving,'' Minor declared, ``is a deep
conviction that nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons now present a
serious danger to the future of all life on this planet.''
</P>
<P>
   In congressional testimony, the three cited the possibility of
human error and asserted that nuclear engineers had become so
specialized that none of them could see the whole picture any
longer. As a result, they said, no one was in control.
</P>
<P>
   The three founded a consulting firm, MHB Technical Associates,
in San Jose, Calif. For 20 years they conducted studies and
testified on the safety, reliability, construction and economics of
power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Minor evaluated energy programs for federal agencies, 13 states,
the governments of Sweden and Germany and public-interest groups
around the world. MHB served as technical adviser on the 1979 movie
``The China Syndrome,'' which was denounced by the nuclear industry
but seemed prophetic when the Three Mile Island plant in
Pennsylvania experienced a partial meltdown that year.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Fresno, Calif., Minor was a 1960 electrical
engineering graduate of the University of California at Berkeley.
He earned an MS degree at Stanford University in 1966. He went to
work for GE in 1960. While there, he managed an engineering group
working on new designs for reactor controls, safety systems and
control rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year he and Hubbard followed Bridenbaugh into
retirement and closed their company. Minor's illness was diagnosed
after a lengthy sojourn in France, and he opted against radiation
and chemotherapy to spend his remaining time visiting family and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Minor is survived by a son, Mark, of Salida, Colo.; two
daughters, Lisa Buckley of Soquel, Calif., and Tani Scheiner of
Sebastopol, Calif.; two sisters, Sue Bird of Hilo, Hawaii, and
Michelle Minor of Vancouver, B.C.; and six grandchildren. His
marriage to Gayle Pat Minor, of Santa Cruz, Calif., ended in
divorce.

CABLE PROGRAMMER BUYS HOLLYWOOD POST-PRODUCTION COMPANIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cable programming giant Liberty Media Corp. jumped
into Hollywood post-production Friday by announcing $162 million in
deals for control of a pair of leading players, Todd-AO Corp. and
Soundelux Entertainment Group.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty will issue shares worth $92.5 million for control of 57
percent of Todd-AO, which put itself up for sale two months ago. In
a separate transaction, Liberty has agreed to invest $70.3 million
in Soundelux in exchange for a 55 percent holding.
</P>
<P>
   The deals come at a time when Hollywood's service providers have
been hurt by intense competition and by major studios' moves to
keep a closer watch on budgets. Both companies are based in
Hollywood with a combined work force of 1,250 and a combined
history of 64 years of independent operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As consumer demand increases for entertainment and information
in all forms, the infrastructure to produce, traffic, distribute
and store program and commercial content must grow and mature,''
said Liberty President Robert R. Bennett in a prepared statement.
``We believe that these businesses can provide valuable services to
our existing businesses and will play an important role in
providing a new generation of services focused on the evolving
interactive video market.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd-AO, created in 1952 through a partnership between the late
producer Mike Todd and American Optical, said the deal will give it
the financial muscle to follow through with its strategy to become
a worldwide one-stop ``post house.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd-AO shareholders, who have seen their stock rise 60 percent
since management announced it would explore a sale, will receive a
slight, 6 percent premium for their shares at Friday's closing
prices. Liberty will pay one share of Liberty Class A stock, which
closed unchanged at $37, for every 2.5 shares of Todd-A0 stock,
which closed up $1.0625 at $14.
</P>
<P>
   Todd-AO, which has 860 employees and production offices in
Atlanta, Los Angeles, London and New York, has been expanding its
business with a $13 million deal for Sound One Corp. in New York in
June and a $16 million purchase of London-based Tele-CineCell Group
last year. The cost of acquisitions dragged down profits for its
third quarter ended May 31 to $62,000 from $1.6 million in the 1998
period with sales up 3 percent to $28.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Todd-AO, which has won 18 Academy Awards since it was founded,
hired investment bankers Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. in early June to
advise it on possible merger and sales strategies. British media
giant Carlton and rival post-production house Laser Pacific had
also been rumored to be suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Soundelux was founded in 1982 by Lon Bender and Wylie Stateman,
who remain controlling shareholders. It has 410 employees, with
about 200 in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Definitive agreements are expected by the end of August on the
deals, which will make Todd-AO and Soundelux part of
telecommunications giant AT&AMP;T Corp. Liberty, which has holdings in
such cable channels as BET, Discovery, E!, Encore, QVC and USA, was
bought by AT&AMP;T earlier this year as part of the purchase of parent
Tele-Communications Inc. and has continued to operate as an
independent entity since the AT&AMP;T deal.

CLINT YOULE, 83, EARLY WEATHERMAN ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Kan., Ariz.)  (mk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clint Youle, a weatherman at WNBQ television in Chicago who was
the first to present the weather on a national television news
program, died on July 23 at a hospital in Galena, Ill. He was 83
and had lived on a 120-acre homestead in nearby Scales Mound, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Youle made that first national appearance on ``The Camel News
Caravan'' with John Cameron Swayze on NBC in May 1949. He reported
one to three times a week from Chicago using a Rand McNally map
bought at a local store and covered with Plexiglas. He would draw
the weather systems on the Plexiglas with a black marker as he gave
the forecast. When color television came into wide use in the
mid-'50s, he added red and orange markers.
</P>
<P>
   Youle, who became known in Chicago as The Weatherman and
nationally as Mr. Weatherman, was one of several World War II
veterans who parlayed their meteorological skills into jobs in the
nascent field of television in the late 1940s. During the war, he
joined the Army Air Forces, was trained in meteorology and served
as an intelligence officer in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   The first television weatherman, according to the Museum of
Television and Radio in New York, was Jim Fidler, a radio
announcer, who in 1940 gave a forecast for an experimental station
in Cincinnati. The first New York television weather forecast came
a year later at experimental station WNBT, which later became WNBC;
it featured an animated character called Wooly Lamb.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known who gave the first commercial weather forecast
on television, said Jane Klain, a researcher with the museum. There
were several forecasters, including Louis Allen in Washington, who
were working on local stations as early as 1948, according to
``Television Weathercasting: A History'' by Robert Henson
(McFarland &AMP; Co., 1990).
</P>
<P>
   Youle, however, was the first to present the weather on a
national network, Ms. Klain said.
</P>
<P>
   He had been a news editor at what became radio station WMAQ, an
NBC affiliate, and in January 1949 offered to do the weather on
television station WNBQ, citing his military training. WNBQ would
later become WMAQ. His first wife, Cherie, did the commercials on
his Chicago show. They later divorced.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1949, he began the national broadcasts on NBC. With his
folksy manner, he became such a hit that soon he was on the air
five nights a week. He also made occasional documentaries on
country life.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, Youle complained that commercials were eating
into his air time, forcing him to be more of an announcer than a
weather forecaster. He left the Chicago station and ``The Camel
News Caravan'' in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   John Clinton Youle, who was born April 4, 1916, in Illinois,
then pursued other interests. He owned several small newspapers,
and earlier he had received a degree in English from Wheaton
College and worked briefly for The Elizabeth News in Elizabeth,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   He also invested in oil wells, worked as an investment banker
for Lehman Brothers and invented a cattle gate that allows cars and
people to pass but hits cows on the head. In his spare time, he
studied geology.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, he won a seat in the Illinois House of Representatives
as a Republican, but chose not to serve more than one two-year
term.
</P>
<P>
   Youle retired from his other pursuits in 1977. He is survived by
his wife, Carol; a son, John of Cairo, Egypt; two daughters, Susan
Millstein of Baldwin City, Kan., and Jessica Youle of Scottsdale,
Ariz.; a sister, Virginia Marshall of McHenry, Ill., and eight
grandchildren.

<P>
   Charles Mansfield, a former president and chief executive
officer of the Marine Midland Bank in Manhattan, died Monday at a
hospital in Rockville Centre, N.Y. He was 77 years old.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement released by his family, Mansfield died
of cardiac arrest following a brief illness.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield, who lived in Garden City, N.Y., and Stuart, Fla.,
also served as the chief executive officer and chairman of
Continental Copper and Steel Industries of Charlotte, N.C., now
called CCX Inc., when it was based in Cranford, N.J., and
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield was born Oct. 26, 1921, in Manhattan and graduated
from Fordham University. He served in the U.S. Army Air Corps
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He was hired in 1951 by Marine Midland and rose through the
ranks, becoming president and chief executive officer in 1974. He
left the company shortly after Marine Midland and nine other banks
merged in 1976. Marine Midland is now part of HSBC of London.
</P>
<P>
   He then spent 10 years at the helm of Continental Copper and
Steel Industries before retiring in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield was also a governor of the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mary; two sons, Charles Mansfield
Jr. of Westhampton Beach, N.Y., and Michael Mansfield of Blooming
Grove, N.Y.; four daughters, Patricia Phelan of Freeport, N.Y.,
Peggy Mansfield of Ventura, Calif., Elisabeth Mansfield of Goshen,

   John Dawson
</P>
<P>
   John Dudley Dawson, an Antioch College administrator who became
known to generations of students at Antioch for his role in
revitalizing the college's approach to co-operative work-study
education, died on Thursday at Greene Memorial Hospital in Xenia,
Ohio. He was 97 and lived in Yellow Springs, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson gained an international reputation through his work from
1936 to 1953 as director of co-operative education at Antioch, in
Yellow Springs. The idea of integrating work experience with
traditional academic study had been a hallmark of Antioch since
1920, but Dawson greatly expanded the program.
</P>
<P>
   He found jobs for students in businesses across the country,
promoted the concept of employers as ``field faculty'' and fostered
the integration of co-op work with traditional classroom study.
</P>
<P>
   From 1953 to 1967, he served as vice president and dean of
students.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 16 years, he visited more than 100 colleges and
universities around the world as a consultant on co-op education.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Haskins, Ohio, Dawson graduated from Denison University
in 1923, earned a master's degree from Ohio State University and
then went on to do further graduate work at Ohio State, the
University of Michigan and Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Nona Dawson, died in 1995. He is survived by three
sons, Evan of New York City, John of Lee, N.H., and Darrell of
Santa Fe, N.M.; and six grandchildren.

LEO V. BERGER, 78, HELPED REVITALIZE U.S. MERCHANT MARINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By SHOLNN FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leo Vladimir Berger, a Hungarian immigrant who spent much of his
childhood in New York orphanages before becoming one of the
country's largest shipping magnates, died on July 24 at Mount Sinai
Medical Center in Miami Beach. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his lawyer, Harvey Schwartz, said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger had been hospitalized for 10 weeks after breaking a hip
in a fall at his home in Bal Harbour. He was a donor to the
hospital and had recently dedicated a cardiac wing at the medical
center.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of federal subsidies, Berger worked to revitalize
America's dying international merchant marine fleet, which had
trouble competing with foreign rivals. He began in 1967 with the
purchase of an oil tanker for $1.5 million and over the years built
up his privately held Apex Marine Corp. of Lake Success, N.Y. At
its high point in the mid 1980s, Apex Marine's fleet numbered 24
ships and the company had an estimated $100 million a year in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   A nephew, Clifford Spelke, who bought Apex from Berger last
year, said he believed that every big carrier of dry goods flying
an American flag today was at one time owned or managed by his
uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Spelke said his uncle had a canny sense of when to buy ships and
when to dispose of them. Over the last several years, as the market
soured, Berger began selling ships. He sold two to the U.S. Navy
and then helped transform them into 1,100-bed naval hospitals that
serve American troops. The ships are still in service.
</P>
<P>
   Berger often testified before congressional committees in behalf
of the U.S. merchant marine fleet. ``He was very patriotic,''
Spelke said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger was born in Hungary on Sept. 1, 1920. He came to the
United States with his parents and five brothers and sisters in
1928. His parents, who settled in New York City, could not afford
to take care of the children, and they spent much of their youth in
orphanages and foster care, Spelke said. Later in life, Berger
donated heavily to Jewish organizations, including Boys Town
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Berger attended Cornell University on scholarship and earned a
Bachelor of Science in 1942. He then attended the U.S. Merchant
Marine Academy, at Kings Point, N.Y., graduating with his third
mate's license in 1943. He sailed as a cadet, third mate, second
mate and chief mate during World War II and later joined Triton
Shipping Co. He returned to Cornell, earning a law degree in 1957,
and formed Apex in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He was named the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy's alumnus of the
Year in 1985 and last fall was inducted into its Hall of
Distinguished Graduates. In 1948, during a vacation from his ship,
he married Arvilla Sheheen.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, of Bal Harbour, survives him, along with a daughter,
Phyllis Sepe of Miami, four children and 11 grandchildren. He is
also survived by two sisters, Eva Berger of Boca Raton, Fla., and
Judith Spelke of Delray, Fla., and three brothers, Martin of North
Miami Beach, Fla., Frederick of New York, and Victor of Delray,
Fla.

   NEW YORK _ H. Smith Richardson Jr. grew up in a household in
which Vicks Vaporub, the cold remedy, meant more than relief from a
hacking cough.
</P>
<P>
   He was the grandson of the man who developed that product, and
he eventually led the family business, Richardson-Vicks Inc.
Richardson died on Tuesday at New York Presbyterian Hospital after
surgery for pancreatic cancer, his family said. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's business life centered on the family company, which
was founded in 1905 by his grandfather, Lunsford Richardson. The
younger Richardson joined the company in 1938, working at Vicks
production plants and later in the sales department.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1948, Richardson assumed various management
positions at what was then Vick Chemical Co. He became president in
1957 and chairman in 1961. Under his leadership, the company grew
into one of the nation's 250 largest companies, with revenue of
$1.2 billion by 1985, the year he retired as chairman. Several
months after his retirement, the company was sold to Procter &AMP;
Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   One of Richardson's life goals, he once said, was to build upon
the successes of previous generations of Richardsons. To that end,
he positioned the company to seize opportunities in the rapidly
expanding global marketplace by overseeing the development of an
international marketing and distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1980s, Richardson-Vicks products, which include
Vicks Nyquil cold syrup, Clearasil acne medication and Oil of Olay
beauty cream, were sold in more than 144 countries, with foreign
markets accounting for 60 percent of revenue. Richardson moved to
Wilmington, N.C., from Fairfield, Conn., after his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Richardson was involved in philanthropic
and nonprofit organizations, and from 1972 until his death he was
chairman of the Smith Richardson Foundation, which his father had
created to provide support for charitable work as well as for
research and analysis of public policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Richardson had a lifelong interest in leadership
development, particularly in management and corporate governance.
He was instrumental in creating the Center for Creative Leadership,
an institute that trains executives, military officers and
politicians in business and government. Richardson was chairman of
the center's board from 1972 until 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Greensboro, N.C., Richardson lived in Irving Park, N.C.,
until the family business moved to New York in 1933 and the family
itself to Connecticut. He attended the Buckley School in New York
and St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H. In 1944 Richardson earned a
bachelor's degree in chemistry from Yale University, where he was
elected to Phi Beta Kappa. After college he served for four years
as a naval officer during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 54 years, Adele, of Wilmington;
three daughters, Adele Richardson Ray and Page Richardson, both of
Chapel Hill, N.C., and Cary Paynter of Wilmington; three sons,
Stuart of Easton, Conn., Peter of Southport, Conn., and H. Smith
Richardson III of Santa Barbara, Calif.; a brother, Randolph
Richardson, of Amagansett, N.Y.; a sister, Grace Stetson, of
Bridgeport, Conn.; 12 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

GAS PRICES REV UP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Gas prices continue to explode like a California
oil refinery and are expected to jump as much as 4 cents per gallon
within the next 10 days, thanks to tight crude oil supplies and
continuing problems at the state's refineries, energy industry
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   One watchdog group fears that prices at the pump could climb up
an additional 20 cents per gallon over the next 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   The latest scapegoat is a hydrogen pipe at Mobil Corp.'s
Torrance refinery. It caught fire Wednesday morning, putting out of
commission one of the refinery's two hydrogen plants, which are
used in the production of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The state's wholesale market responded by immediately sending
prices up about 15 cents per gallon. Analysts say any increases on
the wholesale market usually take about 10 days to reach retail
pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the statewide average for a gallon of gasoline has
increased 13 cents in three weeks to $1.46, as of Monday, according
to Claudia Chandler, assistant executive director for the
California Energy Commission in Sacramento. She predicted the
average would move up another 3 cents or 4 cents over the next
seven to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, drivers are already feeling the pinch. Between Tuesday
and Friday, prices at San Fernando Valley pumps increased about 3.9
percent from an average $1.344 to $1.396, according to the Daily
News' twice-weekly survey of area stations. At some stations, the
price for a gallon of regular unleaded gas increased by as much as
10 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The average price for a gallon of gas in Los Angeles on Friday
was $1.43, about the same as it was on July 23, said Charles
Langley, gasoline project manager for the Utility Consumers Action
Network, a consumer watchdog group based in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   He said it would not be ``unreasonable'' to expect price
increases in the next 30 to 45 days ranging from 15 cents to 20
cents. Six refineries control about 90percent of the state's fuel
supply, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market in California is so consolidated that any hiccup in
the supply line causes serious price increases at the pump,''
Langley said Friday. ``We think a lot of that is due to
opportunistic price gouging.''
</P>
<P>
   California refineries together now refine about 900,000 barrels
of oil per day, compared with 970,000 to 980,000 barrels under
normal circumstances, Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see we're down between eight and 10 percent,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   This month's price increases are being blamed on a Tosco
refinery in Avon, where there was a fire Feb. 22, and a Chevron
refinery in Richmond, where there were explosions on March 23 and
July 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two refineries going out causes a very constrained
market for gasoline,'' Chandler said. ``Chevron has a significant
portion of the California supply and they're still not back on
line.''
</P>
<P>
   The February decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to limit production has pushed up the price of Alaskan
North Slope crude _ which is the main component of gasoline in
California _ from $9.60 a barrel on Feb. 22 to $19.60 on Friday,
Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As their crude oil (price) goes up, so does the crude oil for
the rest of the world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the price of gas on the West Coast spot market _ that
is, the market on which surpluses are sold _ was at its highest
level so far this year, said Mary Welge, associate editor for the
Oil Price Information Service in Lakewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   It was about $1.10 in Los Angeles and about $1.15 in the San
Francisco Bay area, which is usually hit harder by higher crude oil
prices and other inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The spot price does not include taxes and other costs that are
added to it on the way to the gas pump.
</P>
<P>
   A tight oil supply and ``myriad refinery problems'' have pushed
up the spot price, Welge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Coast has just been a hotbed for refinery problems
since February _ just one thing after another,'' she said. ``This
has served to put a squeeze on supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the price pressure could be alleviated starting today,
when Tosco's Avon refinery is expected to go back on line, Chandler
said. In addition, Chevron expects cargos of gasoline to arrive
shortly from out-of-state refineries, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do know there are shipments coming that will help alleviate
some of the pressure on prices,'' Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   Carolin Keith, public affairs manager for Mobil Corp.'s western
region, would not say how much production was reduced as a result
of Wednesday's mishap, in which no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that we're saying at this time is that one of our two
hydrogen plants is down,'' she said Friday. ``The rest of the
refinery is operating. Some of the units are operating at reduced
rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the refinery each day processes about 130,000 barrels
of crude oil, which produces about 4.2 million gallons of gasoline,
Keith said.

L.A. CONGRESSMAN LAMBASTES CANADA OVER FILM PRODUCTION CREDITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You're a liar, Mr. Ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   That's the essence of the latest round of bashing between the
United States and Canada over runaway film production as U.S. Rep.
Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills, fired off a highly critical letter
this week to Raymond Chretien, Canada's ambassador to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same moment, Mr. Ambassador, that you claim runaway
production is so minuscule that we in California should scarcely
notice it, your Film Commissioners and Culture Ministers are
crowing about their success in luring U.S. productions to Canada,''
Berman wrote. ``113 productions, we are told, are confirmed in
British Columbia in the first six months of this year, compared
with 65 productions shot in the same period of 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman's missive came in response to Chretien's contention last
week that Berman had unfairly criticized Canada's efforts to lure
Hollywood productions with tax breaks and rebates.
</P>
<P>
   Berman also disputed Chretien's claim that only 2 percent of
film, TV and video production came from Canada, and that this
figure was ``hardly excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman noted that 232 of the 285 runaway productions were in
Canada last year and generated $2.27 billion of the $17.6 billion
in production expenditures. ``This is 13 percent of the total, not
2 percent,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Berman also said formal hearings will be held later this year in
Washington, D.C., on a series of tax incentives and credits for
producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is becoming increasingly clear to us that we too must move
in some way to protect our indigenous product, which is largely
independent film and TV productions that operate on such a slim
margin that they require financial incentives to survive,'' he
said. &QL;

HOW ABOUT SOME GATES-CRASHING? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every so often something comes over the Internet transom that's
too good not to share. When these gems arrive, they just naturally
get squirreled away for the day when your faithful scribe either
hits a dry hole or wants to play hooky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today it's the latter, and this offering comes under the heading
``The Auto Empire Strikes Back.'' It involves alleged zingers
dreamed up by resident General Motors wags in response to a
brickbat heaved their way by Microsoft czar Bill Gates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During an info technology confab in the not-too-distant past,
the world's richest man reportedly was holding forth about the
wonders of the computer age. While doing so Gates compared what his
industry had wrought with the shortcomings of what he apparently
considered a more stodgy industry. That was the auto industry,
which while a traditional linchpin of the U.S. economy during most
of the 20th century, nevertheless came up short in the progress
department, in Gates' view. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The way Gates put it, if General Motors had kept up with
technological advancements like the computer industry had, we would
be driving cars that cost $25 and got 1,000 miles to a gallon of
gas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To which GM's defenders responded, according to the recently
received missive from a Valued Contributor, those who live in glass
houses shouldn't ... well, you know the rest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They say if GM had developed technology like Microsoft, their
cars would be crashing twice a day for no reason. Other glitches
might include the following: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - When you executed a particular maneuver, say a left turn, it
would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which
case you'd have to buy a new engine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought
Car95 or CarNT, in which case you'd have to buy more seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - New seats would require all users to have the same size
derriere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - The oil, temperature and alternator warning lights would be
replaced by one ``general car default'' light. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - The airbag-safety system would ask you to respond to an ``Are
you sure you want to deploy the air bag?'' question before the
airbag would work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - On some occasions, for no reason whatsoever, your car would
lock you out and prevent your entry until you simultaneously lifted
the door handle, inserted the key and held the radio antenna. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - GM would require the purchase and use of a deluxe set of road
maps from a road-map subsidiary, whether the owner needed the maps
or not. Any attempt to delete this option would reduce car
performance by 50 percent, and prompt an antitrust initiative by
the Justice Department. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Each time highway workers repainted the lines on the roads,
car owners would have to buy a new car. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - Each time GM introduced a new model car, all motorists would
have to learn to drive all over again because none of the controls
would operate in the same manner as the previous car. (Meantime,
Macintosh would produce a sun-powered car that went five times as
fast and was twice as easy to operate.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - When finished driving, vehicle operators would have to press
the ``start'' button to turn off the engine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And who said business types don't have a sense of humor? &QL;

ANY TRADE LIKELY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR RANGERS (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers general manager Doug Melvin doesn't like
to stay on the sidelines at or near the trading deadline. He'll
explore every opportunity if there's a chance to improve his team.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rangers needed defense up the middle and starting pitching
last year, so Melvin brought in shortstop Royce Clayton and
pitchers Todd Stottlemyre and Esteban Loaiza before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The club needed pitching to win its first division title in
1996, so he made a post-deadline waiver deal for John Burkett.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the team out of contention in 1997, he traded third
baseman Dean Palmer for center fielder Tom Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   So while he was in Pulaski, Va., yesterday to look at one of the
club's rookie-league teams, he was busy trying to deal to upgrade
the starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   But before he left for Pulaski, Melvin was not optimistic about
a deal before the deadline at 11 p.m. tonight.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rangers holding a commanding lead in the American
League West, a trade would have to land a pitcher who would allow
the team to compete with the New York Yankees and Cleveland
Indians, both in the race for best regular-season record and
consequent home-field advantage, and in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors have linked the Rangers to Darryl Kile of the Colorado
Rockies and Juan Guzman of the Baltimore Orioles, but Melvin
doesn't seem convinced that any of the pitchers who are available
could have the desired impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were three guys out there last year that were pitching
well and clubs had an interest in: Randy Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre
and Carlos Perez,'' Melvin said. ``They were all pitching well and
were available. There isn't a group of pitchers you can feel that
way about this year. We're talking about people who walk more than
they strike out, about high ERAs, about taking on a salary plus
giving up players. It's a double-edged sword.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams with pitchers on the block are asking for quality
minor-leaguers, and Melvin is reluctant to pay that price.
</P>
<P>
   ``What might be the heaviest part of not making a deal is our
recognition that we feel good about our young players,'' Melvin
said. ``We feel good about Mike Lamb at Double-A, about Corey Lee,
about Danny Kolb. Ryan Glynn's got some experience now. \RJeff\S
Zimmerman, \RRuben\S Mateo and \RMike\S Venafro have given us an
indication of what they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin has downplayed the team's chances of making a deal and
then pulled off a blockbuster in past seasons, so it wouldn't be a
surprise if he pulls off a trade today, especially if the price
goes down as the day goes on.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the cost appears prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a seller's market for pitching,'' Melvin said. nn

authorities got cranky about permits, and on Friday even the sun
wouldn't cooperate with first-time film director Joanne Small.
</P>
<P>
   She was on location in the arid hills near Castaic Junction,
about 30 miles north of Los Angeles, making a short film she hopes
will launch her directing career. But she was on day two of the
tight shooting schedule for ``Joey Was Here,'' and the midday sun
was throwing glare and reflections on her actors' faces during a
crucial scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do it over and over again. We're two hours behind,''
she said. But instead of her stress increasing with the noontime
temperature, Small tried to maintain perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a sense of humor about this,'' she said.
``It's not brain surgery _ it's making a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   And in movies big or small, no matter how carefully every shot
is plotted in the script, obstacles rear up. But the key to
avoiding disasters is to plan for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something goes wrong, you have to switch gears
automatically,'' she said. ``I've been making movies too long.
There's nothing that has caught me off guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Small toiled for years in Hollywood and New York City, editing,
writing and script supervising while working toward a career
directing. This year she got the break she was looking for when she
was picked for one of eight slots in the Directing Workshop for
Women, an exclusive program offered by the American Film Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The winners _ chosen from 150 applicants _ have a $20,000 budget
and only five days in which to shoot their 20-minute masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   So Small has neither time nor money to spare.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our hardest day, by far,'' she said Friday. ``I'm not
surprised we're a little over schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie she planned to include a scene with different views
of two characters conversing. But she'll just go with one
perspective _ the glare problems Friday cost her the time she
needed to shoot the other. But she had already planned in her mind
how to edit around the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We start the day with a wish list of all the wonderful shots
we'd like to have,'' she said. ``When you're Stanley Kubrick and
you have 10 months to shoot, you get your wish list.''
</P>
<P>
   Small, however, has to keep wishing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the average production cost for a movie from one of
the seven major Hollywood studios was $52.7 million. With a budget
like that, Small could make sequels up to ``Joey Was Here 2,635.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead she's working with equipment on loan from AFI, and a
volunteer cast and crew of friends and acquaintances from the
industry who have lined up to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a guy who didn't show up this morning, and we had him
replaced within an hour,'' said Scott Carlson, one of Small's two
producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just bob and weave,'' he said. ``She trusts us to know
we'll get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Other problems popped up like targets in a shooting gallery.
</P>
<P>
   --Crew members couldn't secure permits from Agoura Hills before
the City Hall there closed Friday, so locations for scenes planned
Monday had to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
   --A crane and a Steadicam needed for weekend shooting suddenly
became unavailable, and the crew scrambled to replace them _ making
calls from Orange County to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   --Three separate California Highway Patrol officers showed up
Thursday to demand permits and scold the crew in what turned out to
be a scheduling mix-up.
</P>
<P>
   --The wardrobe mistress had a car breakdown the same day, and
someone had to meet her at the repair shop and pick up the actors'
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   --An actress slotted for one of the roles in the movie had to
quit Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called to say she got a paying gig and had to bow out,''
Carlson said. ``They're working actors. We know going into this, if
they get a paying gig, they've got to go. There's no hard
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   But Small's lead actor _ the Joey in ``Joey Was Here'' _ called
six days before filming began with his regrets. He too had gotten a
paying job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, my first reaction would've been to scream,'' Small
said. ``But my reaction was, hmm, this is interesting. This happens
all the time in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   So she contacted a budding actor she'd just met, George Stults,
a square-jawed 23-year-old blond from Detroit. Small took it as a
chance to give him his first shot and see how well she does coaxing
a performance out of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What looks to be a disaster turns out to be a miracle,'' she
said. ``He's a star. There's no question he's going big places.
And, hopefully, with me.'' &QL;

VICTIMS WERE DRAWN TO THEIR DEATHS BY LIVES IN DAY TRADING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS names of two victims in 24th graf.) 
(ATTN: Kan . )  (rk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR. AND DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There were 22 of them, 22 people with disparate lives
and interests, lives filled with children and lovers, with keeping
store and fly-fishing, with building that dream house and chasing
the American dream. But on Thursday afternoon, in a quiet office
park here, they were 22 people with a single common interest,
electronic day trading.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, a fortune could be lost or won with the punch
of a computer button. On this particular hot Thursday, Dean
Delawalla was one of nine day traders and trading house employees
who lost their lives when Mark O. Barton went on his pistol-firing
rampage in two trading offices. Thirteen other people were wounded,
nine seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Delawalla, 52, made his living day trading, showing up almost
every morning at the office park. But family and friends say day
trading was just his job, nothis life. His life, as they tell it,
was his wife, Gulshan, a medical intern, and their two children,
Saisal, 15, and Shahla, 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were everything he lived for,'' said his brother, Seroz
Delawalla. ``He spent almost all of his time with them when he
wasn't trading. In fact, he just traded to have money to take care
of them and make a nice home here in America. That was his dream
from the day he arrived in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Delawalla, a native of Pakistan, came to the United States in
1973. He had been trained as a lawyer and a banker but once in
America headed off in new career directions, first in the medical
supply business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was looking for new opportunities, exploring,'' his brother
said. ``Eventually he began trading in options. And then when day
trading came along, he got into that. What else to say? It's over
for him. A tragedy. What a tragedy. Now we must look to Gulshan and
the children.''
</P>
<P>
   For Edward Quinn of Norcross, an Atlanta suburb, trading was
just a retirement pastime. He had already made his financial mark,
as an executive with the United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   So he did not show up at the office complex every day,
frequently preferring to play a round of golf or try his hand at
fly-fishing in a local stream. But he did show up on Thursday, and
doing so cost him his life.
</P>
<P>
   A Norcross neighbor, Eve Hoffman, described him as ``a quiet
man, absolutely a devoted family man,'' who, already retired at the
age of 58, had an unquenchable passion for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain people who you are around and they love
life,'' Ms. Hoffman said. ``And there are other people who are just
getting through it. He loved life completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn left a wife of 31 years, Mary, and three grown children.
Three weeks ago he became a grandfather for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Tenenbaum usually visited in the morning at the office
where he traded. But on Thursday he went in the afternoon, and, as
with Quinn, the timing of the visit proved fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just happened to be there,'' said his brother-in-law,
Freddy Allen of Greensboro, N.C. ``It was a little unusual for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenenbaum, 48, owned a grocery store in Atlanta, Great Savings,
and was an avid golfer and a devoted jogger, putting in at least
four miles every day. He also served as president of his synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Like most survivors of the nine people killed, Tenenbaum's felt
particularly hard hit by the random way that fate had seemed to
choose him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't explain it,'' Allen said. ``It's just a tragic loss
for no reason. And it's not just his family, it's his community. A
lot of people feel the loss. It's just really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenenbaum left a wife of 18 years, Debra, and three children:
Megan, 11; Brittany, 13, and Scott, 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Tenenbaum and Allen families were to meet on Sunday in
Myrtle Beach, S.C., for a vacation. Instead, they gathered in
Atlanta Friday for a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Vadewattee Muralidhara was down at the trading
office, her family frantically began trying to reach her on
learning of the shooting. But the Muralidharas had no success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were calling everywhere,'' said her 18-year-old son, Rishi.
``She hadn't come home. She took care of us, took most of her time
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was a knock on the door. It was a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought she would be one of the witnesses,'' the son said.
</P>
<P>
   But the officer was bringing word of her death. She was 44 and
lived with her family in Peachtree City, another Atlanta suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The others killed were Russell J. Brown, 42, of the nearby town
of Cumming, and Kevin Dial, 38; Scott A. Webb, 30; Joseph J.
Dessert,cq 60, and Jamshid Havash, 45, all of Atlan- ta.No
biographical details about them were available.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the 13 people hurt in the attack were Brent Doonan, 25,
and Scott Manspeaker, 27, both of whom ran the local office of the
All-Tech Investment Group, one of the two trading houses that
Barton invaded. Both men were seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
   They grew up in Kansas and recently moved to Atlanta ``to find
their fortune in this new world of day trading,'' as one friend,
Derek Schimming, put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're young and aggressive and hungry to carve out their
piece of America,'' said Schimming, who manages a day trading
operation in Overland Park, Kan. ``They'll bounce back and they'll
make it, because that's what day trading is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Schimming was on the phone to Doonan just minutes before the
gunman burst in.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a senseless tragedy,'' he said. ``It just boggles the
mind. But like I say, people will bounce back. You have to believe
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the bounce-back seemed to be already under way Friday
morning at the office park. Cleaning crews were hard at work,
cutting out stained sections of office carpet and mopping down
floors and walls.
</P>
<P>
   The two trading firms hit by the violence _ Momentum Securities
in addition to All-Tech _ were not open for business, but other
firms were. Eric Blaier, a sales manager, lamented the violence of
the day before, but then added: ``In the game of telecom sales,
it's business as usual. Unfortunately true.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the entrance to the building where he works, someone had
left a bright bouquet of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' the attached note read. ``God bless you.''

LET GO OF PAST ILL WILL; L.A.'S BETTER OFF WITH A CHOSEN TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They staged another one of those silly NFL owners
meetings Wednesday to let everyone across the country know that Los
Angeles is no closer to getting an expansion team than it was the
last time the NFL owners staged such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   They have another one of these well-choreographed frolics
scheduled for September, and I'm sure the outcome for L.A. will be
just as murky unless L.A.'s divine trinity of Eli Broad, Ed Roski
and Michael Ovitz substitute all their grandiose rhetoric with
millions and millions of their own dollars, which they're obviously
not inclined to do.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why L.A. is so obsessed with securing an expansion
franchise that would be a fiscal strain and artistic failure when
it might be able to bring back an established team, the Raiders,
that badly wants to get out of Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   While many patrons in Southern California blanch at the idea of
Al Davis' reappearance and harbor a bitter dislike for the Raiders'
owner, the fact is his team wouldn't present the financial strain
peculiar to an NFL expansion enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL eventually decides to bestow its 32nd team to
Houston, a distinct possibility in light of L.A.'s tenuous position
at the moment, then Davis' Raiders would be a viable alternative
providing, of course, they can break away from the lease they have
with Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Please, cease with the curses, lower the volume, stop with the
anti-Al Davis venting.
</P>
<P>
   We can forgive Al Davis for his past sins, for his committing
perhaps the most feckless miscalculation in L.A. sporting history
in 1994 when he decided to return the Raiders to Oakland after
Georgia Frontiere shifted the Rams to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   After all, we are a country with a treasured history of
forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Listen, we've forgiven a president who's been telling one
whopper after another for almost eight years, climaxing with his
celebrated TV disclaimer about having sex with a White House intern
half his age.
</P>
<P>
   We've forgiven Marv Albert, exiled from his broadcasting booth a
couple of years for bizarre conduct with a female companion,
including assault.
</P>
<P>
   I flunked math and unfortunately can't count how many times
we've forgiven Mike Tyson for his endless indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Steve Howe, who was busted for cocaine use
even more than Darryl Strawberry, another guy who benefits from our
let-bygones-be-bygones nature.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, baseball's hierarchy refuses to forgive Pete Rose, even
though I'd venture to say that 90 percent of the game's fans think
it's shameful that Rose isn't in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   We certainly have it in our hearts to bury the hatchet with Al
Davis, an eccentric fellow who on an implausible whim decided to
pull up roots here at a time when his Raiders had the entire L.A.
Basin to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure L.A. fans, notoriously fickle and card-carrying
front-runners, would warmly embrace an expansion franchise, the
thought of which doesn't exactly inspire my passions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the politicians in this area are determined to bring a
new team to the Coliseum, an outdated piece of junk that should
have been torn down years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They have used their influence to keep privately owned stadiums
from being erected at Dodger Stadium and Hollywood Park, and have
forced the NFL to reluctantly accept the Coliseum as the most
practical venue to stick a new team.
</P>
<P>
   The sterling governor of California, Mr. Gray Davis, even has
got involved in this L.A. football issue, throwing an emissary,
Bill Chadwick, into the cauldron.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick supposedly has done terrific behind-the-scenes work and
accelerated the process for L.A.'s football interests.
</P>
<P>
   I say supposedly because the NFL owners still are playing it
quite coyly with L.A. for the most logical reason imaginable:
money.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has discovered it can survive quite nicely without L.A.
The value of the league's franchises has increased dramatically in
recent years, but we here have discovered we also can survive quite
nicely without the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   It's a standoff, and I hate seeing our representatives toadying
up to the NFL, hands out, hoping the league blesses them with an
expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the spectacle has become so nauseating that I find
myself actually pulling for an Al Davis sequel.

INVITE AL DAVIS TO RETURN? ARE PEOPLE IN L.A. NUTS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In this high-stakes game the NFL owners are
playing with L.A., no one seems in any hurry to show his hand.
</P>
<P>
   So why not play the Al Davis card? He's a joker that's wild. If
you turn him up it'll assuredly wipe those poker faces right off
Paul Tagliabue and his crew.
</P>
<P>
   Flat beer, the missus; nothing can get these men to pull away
from the table faster than a hand with Davis in it. He's L.A.'s
trump card.
</P>
<P>
   No one caused more NFL owners to fold in his day than Davis, who
successfully sued the league in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, of course, is the NFL owners will swallow hard and
call L.A.'s bluff. If that happens, heaven help all Angelenos,
especially the women and children who would have to be hidden were
the Raiders to return to ravage the city's good name.
</P>
<P>
   It's fine to talk of welcoming back the Raiders if that's what
it takes to scare the NFL owners into awarding L.A. a pro team at
no cost to Joe Q. Public. There's nothing like putting the fear of
the devil in some supercilious old men to keep them honest.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL owners showed a lot of nerve in serving notice earlier
this week that it's going to take a chunk of public change to
deliver a team to L.A. If anything, the NFL ought to pay L.A. for
the privilege of harboring another pro sports franchise in the
second-largest television market.
</P>
<P>
   For their rapaciousness, the owners deserve to have Davis
dangled before them like a noose. But what if they don't quake in
their Gucci loafers? The Angelenos could end up being the ones
hung.
</P>
<P>
   Want to see the blood rush from the faces of good people? Then
go to Sacramento, Carson, Irwindale, Hollywood Park or the Rose
Bowl and talk to the jilted suitors of the rogue Davis.
</P>
<P>
   They can remind L.A. of what it'll be in for if Davis worms his
way back into its city limits. Suburban Irwindale can write the
lead paragraph of the cautionary tale, having written Davis a
non-refundable check for $10 million in 1987 with the intention of
rescuing the Raiders from a crumbling Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Davis took the city's money and gave it nothing in return. Not
even a satisfactory explanation for reneging on the plans.
</P>
<P>
   He would again prove to be a man not of his word when he
finagled from R.D. Hubbard plans for a $250 million stadium at
Hollywood Park. The deal lasted about as long as the handshake,
with Davis bailing for Oakland before the 1995 season, three months
after the Rams left Anaheim for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The league's owners had sued Davis when he left Oakland for L.A.
They didn't put up much of a fuss when he retraced his steps, so
happy were they to have eradicated him from the Southern California
scene. One unidentified league official was quoted at the time as
saying, ``You could make a case that this will be better for the
league. It gives us a chance to stabilize the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has demonstrated to Angelenos that summer sticks around
longer than he does. So why should we invest so much as one bead of
sweat on the man? He'll only burn L.A., like he did before.
</P>
<P>
   If L.A. is going to have a pro football team, it might as well
start from scratch. There's no place in the Coliseum renovation
plan for all the baggage that comes with Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Remember his shameful shunning of future Hall of Famer Marcus
Allen? And what about his graceless refusal to fork over the
$250,000 he owes Mike Shanahan, whom he fired in 1989? This is the
same Shanahan, mind you, who nine years later coached Denver to its
first back-to-back Super Bowl titles.
</P>
<P>
   That's another reason L.A. should use Davis in this silly game
with the NFL owners to sweeten the pot, if it must, but nothing
more. The man is like his good friend Jerry Buss. His renegade
personality is looking more and more these days like plain old
irrationality.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain the exorbitant contracts the tight-fisted
Davis squandered on Larry Brown and Desmond Howard, two players who
happened to have the games of their lives in a Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders have missed the playoffs 10 times in the past 13
years. They are the Dodgers in silver and black.
</P>
<P>
   If Angelenos knew what was good for them, they'd follow the lead
of a former Raiders assistant coach _ dare we say bitter? _ who put
a photograph of Davis in his freezer late in the 1995 season in the
hopes it would make the franchise's luck go cold. The Raiders, 8-2
at the time, lost their final six games and haven't moved much in
the standings since.
</P>
<P>
   Which is all the more reason for them to stay put in Oakland.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, July 30 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: RULE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Monday approved, 53-45, a Republican motion to
reinstate a rule that bars senators from tacking policy amendments
onto spending bills. Supporters said the rule was necessary to
prevent lawmakers from holding the crucial appropriations bills
hostage with non-appropriations issues. Opponents said the measure
erodes good public policy by preventing minority members from
introducing and debating the issues they deem important. A ``yes''
vote favors the motion.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: MINING
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday failed to pass an amendment that would
uphold a Department of Interior regulation limiting the size of
mining waste sites to five acres. Voting 55-41, the Senate tabled,
or set aside, the amendment that would have struck language in a
larger spending bill that would allow the sites to surpass five
acres. Supporters of tabling the amendment said increasing site
acreage was crucial to the future of the mining industry. Opponents
said the measure was important because it would stop the
proliferation of toxic waste dumps on public lands. A ``yes'' vote
favors tabling the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: DEM TAX
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 39-60, a Democratic tax plan
that would have cut taxes by $290 billion. The bill, which would
have increased the standard deduction and provided education and
child care tax credits, as well as targeted relief to middle- and
lower-income families. Supporters said their tax plan is fiscally
responsible and provides tax relief for those who need it most.
Opponents said more of the estimated $3 trillion budget surplus
should be returned to Americans by way of tax cuts. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: GOP LOCK
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected a Republican ``lock box''
proposal to wall-off Social Security surpluses and gradually lower
the national debt limit. With a vote of 54-46, the proposal failed
to garner the three-fifths vote needed for passage. Supporters said
the measure would stop the raid on Social Security and Medicare.
Opponents said lowering the national debt limit could endanger
entitlement programs if there was an economic downturn. A ``yes''
vote favors the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: DEM LOCK
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected a Democratic ``lock box''
proposal that would wall-off Social Security surpluses and reserve
an additional $300 billion for Medicare. With a vote of 42-58, the
proposal failed to garner the three-fifths vote needed for passage.
Supporters of the proposal said the bill would ensure Medicare's
future. Opponents said more of the projected $3 trillion surplus
should be used for tax cuts. A ``yes'' vote favors the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   6) BILL NUMBER: NO CUT
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 54-46, a Democratic proposal
that would postpone any tax cut until the solvency of Social
Security and Medicare programs has been assured. Supporters said it
was necessary to make sure Social Security and Medicare would be
sustained in the future before cutting taxes. Opponents said the
amendment would not protect Medicare and it would just withhold the
money American taxpayers should be getting back. A ``yes'' vote
favors the proposal.

<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: ACCOUNT
</P>
<P>
   The House on Monday approved, 254-157, a bill that would require
government-wide accounting of the costs and benefits of rules and
regulations. Supporters said the bill would allow the Congress to
better understand the impact that federal regulations have on the
economy. Opponents said the bill would put unnecessary burdens on
agencies and that the benefits of federal health and safety rules
are difficult to quantify. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: CHINA
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday rejected, 260-170, an effort to overturn
President Clinton's recommendation to renew normal trade relations
with China for another year. China's trade status must be reviewed
each year. If Clinton approves normal trade relations, only
congressional action can reverse it. Supporters of limiting China's
trade status said China should be held accountable for human rights
violations and alleged espionage at U.S. nuclear laboratories.
Opponents said staying engaged with China is a better way of
encouraging reform. A ``yes'' vote favors ending the normal trade
relations.

   Steven Cook, 40
</P>
<P>
   Lots of folks knew him as Rocky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocky Balboa!'' they would cheer when he walked into the Davis
Health Care center at 2826 Campbell Ave. to get a prepared meal.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Cook would smile. Everybody knew Cook dreamed of being a
boxer. A great boxer. The 40-year-old worked out with weights and
equipment in his apartment next door to the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be somebody someday,'' he would crow to case
workers with a laugh. ``And then I'll ask: `Who are you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cook was mentally ill but lived independently. When he was found
July 21, Kansas City police reported his apartment was about 95
degrees, with no fan or air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a strong individual,'' said Danny Davis, who runs Davis
Health Care. ``He was very motivated and he was very friendly when
you met him.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his boxing bravado, Cook was also a quiet person,
sometimes even a loner, who was loyal to his friends.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 case workers and friends gathered at a memorial service
Friday at the Network Rehabilitation Services Center at 3121
Gillham Road to remember their friend. There were songs, a prayer,
laughter and memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a nice person,'' said Carol Allman, a case worker with
Davis Health Care. ``Everybody liked him.''
Ralph Generaux, 81
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Generaux said cool air hurt his bones.
</P>
<P>
   He would tape over the air conditioning vents when staying at
his nephew's house. While being driven on errands, he would close
off vents in the car.
</P>
<P>
   During the stifling heat of recent days he adamantly refused the
offer a window-unit air conditioner for his two-room apartment on
the second floor of a house near Westport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I begged him,'' said niece Jan Generaux. ``But he was so
bull-headed. He would have taken it out of the window, or never
turned it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday afternoon, a concerned neighbor called Generaux's
landlady, Lucille Isaacs. Immediately, she had a bad feeling.
</P>
<P>
   They found the 81-year-old Army veteran and cancer patient dead,
in his shorts in his straight-back chair, his head tilted back as
if asleep. One box fan was running in a window -- in the other
room. The other windows were closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a stubborn old man,'' upstairs neighbor Dwight Sexton
recalled fondly. Sexton tried to get Generaux to at least accept
another fan, but he had refused.
</P>
<P>
   Generaux had some friends in the vicinity of his home in the
3800 block of Wyandotte Street. His health had deteriorated in
recent months but he still smoked heavily. He liked to sit in his
chair and watch television, especially football and game shows.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton would pick up some groceries for him. A young girl two
houses down would bring up his mail from the street box. Isaacs and
her son Arnold Isaacs would bring him Thanksgiving and Christmas
dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew him really well,'' Lucille Isaacs recalled. ``You
could set your clock by when he paid the rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Generaux served in Europe and Africa in World War II. In later
years he was a handyman.
</P>
<P>
   Generaux had prearranged his own funeral and had all his papers
in a box in the kitchen. When his niece and nephew, Ed Generaux,
went to retrieve the box Thursday afternoon, after all the windows
had been opened, they still could hardly stand the oppressive heat
in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Generaux could be cranky. He sometimes answered the phone with
``Goodbye.'' If you asked him how he was he'd say, ``Terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who knew him well didn't fault him for his
temperament. He was old, and he was ill.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Generaux said she would become exasperated trying to
convince Uncle Ralph that cool air would make him feel better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would say, `With all that's wrong with me, nothing is going
to make me feel better.' ''
Charles Dyer, 73
</P>
<P>
   His well-worn and hollowed chair in front of the TV was empty.
</P>
<P>
   A pipe teetered on an ashtray, ready for a pinch of tobacco and
a good smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude Jones didn't want to move anything. His housemate for
the past 10 years, she hadn't even gone into his room since he died
Sunday night in his sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want to change anything right now,'' said Jones,
69, sitting on her living room couch. ``I have to get myself
together before doing anything. It just doesn't seem like he's
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The two met about 11 years ago, Jones recalled Friday. They were
next-door neighbors in a Linwood Boulevard apartment building. It
was a loud and raucous place and the two swapped dreams about
living out their older years in a quiet home all their own.
</P>
<P>
   They decided they could pay the bills together. In 1989, they
settled into a bungalow along Indiana Avenue. Each had a room. They
passed the days chatting, watching TV together, talking about the
old times or barbecuing on their porch. Dyer would sometimes invite
some friends over for a card game.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, he told Jones that he wasn't feeling so well.
He slept on the second floor, but the fans there only pushed the
hot air around. The next morning, she called for him and there was
no response. She summoned a friend, who called 9-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had gotten to be so tight. It was just me and him,'' Jones
said. ``We laughed and talked a lot.''

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Willard Medley's relatives checked on the
75-year-old Kansas City man several times a week. On Sunday, they
persuaded Medley to turn on his air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   But he mistakenly turned his heater on instead. With that error,
Medley became another of Kansas City's heat wave statistics.
</P>
<P>
   When relatives found him dead in his home Tuesday, the
thermostat read 95 degrees, hotter than it was outside.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials reported Medley's and two other
heat-related deaths in Kansas City on Friday as the mercury burst
past the 100-degree mark for the seventh straight day downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Those deaths bring the area toll to 13 and fit the pattern of
similar deaths in that they involved older residents. Most of them
didn't have air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Lindholm, chairman of the Kansas City Heat Advisory Task
Force, said everyone working in neighborhoods -- including police
officers, firefighters, and water meter readers -- was making a
concerted effort to check in on isolated people, especially the
elderly, who might need help escaping the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got just about every public servant in the Kansas City
area coming together,'' he said. ``In a few of the (death) cases,
they were within a stone's throw of a cooling center. That's just a
needless tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service has kept Kansas City's weather
status at the heat advisory level. On Thursday, the task force
upgraded Kansas City's weather status to heat alert, setting in
motion the opening of several additional cooling centers.
</P>
<P>
   At least 11 cooling centers were running Friday, although some
were not well patronized.
</P>
<P>
   Residents walked down East Ninth Street trying to shield
themselves from the heat. Some were walking home. Others were
catching buses. But the cooling center at the Salvation Army
attracted few residents.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members said some residents stopped by in the morning to
drink water or lemonade and sit on the cushioned chairs. But in the
early afternoon, the air-conditioned center was empty.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's high temperature at Kansas City International Airport
was 103 degrees, while downtown clocked in at 104. The heat index
downtown reached 114, compared with 109 at KCI.
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service meteorologists in Pleasant Hill
reported that a cold front was heading into the Kansas City area. A
low-pressure system coming across the Dakotas was scheduled to hit
the metropolitan area today, bringing showers and thunderstorms,
said Leanne Vonqualen.
</P>
<P>
   Today's high should be about 10 degrees lower than we've seen in
the past several days, Vonqualen said. Sunday is likely to be about
the same, with a dip into the mid-80s by Monday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that'll seem a lot cooler than it has been,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday could have things heating up again, she said, but added
that the worst might be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to see a heat wave like now. We have
a chance of cooler temperatures.''
</P>
<P>
   The death toll from the heat rose to 28 across Missouri by
Friday afternoon. On Friday, two more people with heat-related
illnesses were reported in critical condition at Truman Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   At least three other deaths in the state -- in Boone and Greene
counties -- were possibly heat-related, but not confirmed. The
official count is of those ruled heat-related by a medical examiner
and reported to the state Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's count was the highest in the nation amid a heat wave
that has smothered the East and Midwest. St. Louis reported no new
deaths by Friday afternoon and the toll there remained at 14. There
was one heat-related death in Cape Girardeau County.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, there also was one heat-related death
in Jackson County, two in Cass County.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, family members and friends were mourning area heat
wave victims, including Medley, Steven Cook, Ralph Generaux and
Charles Dyer.
Willard Medley, 75
</P>
<P>
   Medley always lived life on his own terms, relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always told him that if it got too hot, we would come get
him. But he was too proud to ask for help,'' grandson Casey
Clevenger said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Kansas City, Medley traveled the world in the Navy and
as a truck driver. He lived in Carrollton, Mo., for a time and
returned to Kansas City in the early 1970s. He had lived in the
same house since.
</P>
<P>
   Medley was known as a wizard with his hands, fixing cars,
tinkering with appliances and pounding nails. He built the deck at
his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a jack-of-all-trades,'' grandson Larry Medley Jr.
recalled. ``We never had to call someone to fix something while
Grandpa was around.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Medley's eyesight and hearing started to fail, he found
it tougher to keep up his home. When Medley recently complained
about a high water bill, Clevenger discovered a basement pipe that
had burst weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Anderson, Medley's next-door neighbor, said he feels
guilty about not investigating when he hadn't seen him for several
days. He had assumed everything was all right because he thought he
had heard Medley's air conditioning running.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should all keep an eye out for the older folks,'' he said.
``I know I'm going to make sure my family is taking care of my
grandmother in St. Louis. You never know when something can
happen.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 31:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This is the measure of phenomenal. Two weeks ago Friday, a little
$60,000 movie, produced by two filmmakers no one ever heard of,
starring three unknown actors and shot mainly in the woods outside
the tiny country town of Burkittsville, Md., opened in 27 theaters
around the country, from New York City to Orlando, from Orange
County, California, to Baltimore. It has no sex, no guns, no
visible violence. It is about the ``legendary'' Blair Witch, whom
no one ever sees, and the three aspiring young documentary
filmmakers who interview people in the town about her by day, and
then chase her through the dark woods with their cameras at night.
They die trying to capture her on film, one by one. By the end of
the first showing of the movie _ which is supposedly their
unfinished documentary, found after their disappearance in the
woods _ the teens and twentysomethings of America had found a scary
new thrill, and the witch had become a movie star.
</P>
<P>
   In 26 of those 27 theaters, including New York's, ``The Blair
Witch Project'' broke every previous attendance record. No one at
this point can explain its success, or knows what will happen as
the movie opens in 1,000 theaters across the nation this weekend.
There is reason to credit the Internet, on which the producers
began to put out the word 18 months ago. There is reason for
parents to be thankful that their children are drawn to a movie as
innocent as a ghost story told over a campfire at night. There is
reason to think that Burkittsville, where the town signs have
already been stolen for souvenirs, is about to be besieged.
</P>
<P>
   It hopes to take advantage. ``Hi, this is the Town Office,
Burkittsville, Maryland,'' callers to the mayor's office are told.
``If this is in regard to `The Blair Witch Project,' it is fiction.
However, we welcome you to our community, and you will see that we
have rich farmlands, mountains and a quaint village. Looking
forward to meeting you.''

   The Clinton administration and Congress are struggling to decide
what Washington should do to help Colombia, one of Latin America's
most complex and troubled nations. The country's two overwhelming
problems are a growing trade in cocaine and heroin and a 35-year
civil war against Marxist guerrillas. President Andres Pastrana is
well intentioned, and deserves American support. But Washington
must draw a sharp distinction between the two struggles. Helping
Colombia to reduce its narcotics production is an American
interest. Getting involved in a brutal guerrilla war _ one that
neither side can win _ is not.
</P>
<P>
   The issues have gotten confused because both sides in the
political conflict benefit from drug trafficking, in different
ways. The largest guerrilla group controls much of the area where
coca is grown and protects peasant growers. Some groups also raise
much of their war treasury by shielding and taxing local
traffickers, and may transport some drugs inside Colombia. On the
other side, many top-ranking and mid-level army officials have
close links to paramilitary groups, which also control drug-growing
areas. Some paramilitaries are extensively involved in cocaine
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's army, which has demonstrated more interest in
fighting the rebels than fighting cocaine, has in the past misused
American counternarcotics aid, turning it against the guerrillas.
That is why Washington must be careful about military aid, and
ought not to buy the idea that an effective drug policy must
include fighting the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   As President Pastrana recognizes, only negotiations can end the
war. He has taken courageous steps to advance peace talks _ steps
the rebels have largely rebuffed. They have escalated their
military offensive. Barry McCaffrey, the White House drug chief, is
recommending that the United States give $600 million to Colombia,
some of which is likely to go toward fighting the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has already been drawn too far into the
conflict. Such new aid would widen the war. Instead, Washington
should give all possible support to the peace effort. The army in
the past has been ineffective, and still maintains close links to
the paramilitaries, who run death squads that have massacred
thousands of peasants. Nor is military aid likely to end the drug
problem.
</P>
<P>
   The American-sponsored approach so far has centered on aerial
spraying, but cocaine and heroin production in Colombia are
soaring. Pastrana would like to see fumigation combined with help
to bring roads and electricity to coca areas, so peasants have
alternatives. Bolivia and Peru have had some success with this
mixed strategy, and Washington should emphasize it in Colombia. &QL;

EDITORIAL: AN IRRESPONSIBLE TAX CUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 31:
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate have now passed unreasonably large tax cuts
that provide huge benefits for the rich and would assure that the
current era of budget surpluses will be a brief one. Whatever bill
emerges from a House-Senate conference committee will deserve a
veto.
</P>
<P>
   Economically, the case for a tax cut is very weak. The economy
is booming, and the Federal Reserve may need to raise interest
rates again to keep inflation from rising. Applying fiscal stimulus
through a tax cut now would be likely to bring on even higher
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, the argument that the money will be
available for large tax cuts is based on optimistic economic
forecasts and on completely unrealistic estimates of government
spending. The Republicans know that Congress will never live up to
their promises regarding spending cuts, which is one reason they
are trying to push through a tax cut now before they face the
difficult spending issues.
</P>
<P>
   If there is to be a tax cut, it should be relatively modest,
allowing for the possibility that the economic forecasts will prove
too rosy. A good bill would concentrate relief on lower- and
middle-income taxpayers and would encourage them to save more
money. The Senate bill cuts tax rates for lower-income people, but
not for those at the top, while its savings provisions are targeted
at the wealthy who are already saving and would most likely just
shift money from taxable accounts to the expanded Individual
Retirement Accounts that the bill would authorize.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Congress should embrace a modified version of the
Clinton administration's Universal Savings Accounts, as Vice
President Al Gore suggested Friday. Those accounts would provide
subsidies to encourage savings by those who will need the money the
most.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also rightly suggested that if anything is to be done to
reduce the so-called ``marriage penalty,'' which affects largely
middle- and upper-income households where husband and wife both
work, there should also be changes in the earned income tax credit,
which creates a marriage penalty for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   One way to bring the tax-cut bills down to a reasonable size
would be to drop all the special-interest provisions that were
inserted at the request of lobbyists providing campaign
contributions. Both the House and Senate bills are full of such
things _ some benefiting only one industry or even one company.
That seems odd coming from a Congress that only a year ago was
preaching the need for tax simplification.
</P>
<P>
   The real negotiations are likely to begin after President
Clinton vetoes the tax bill that a conference committee will
produce when it meets to reconcile the House and Senate versions.
When those talks get under way, the president should keep in mind
that it would not be a disaster if there were no agreement on taxes
this year. Failure to agree would allow the government to pay down
the huge federal debt by a small amount, thus reducing the burden
on future generations. That would clearly be better for the country
than accepting a bad tax bill.

COMFORT IS KING IN CONVERSION VAN
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big Ford van was cruising northward on Interstate 17, but
the boys in the back were busy having an adventure in outer space.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Picard was shouting or ders across the bridge of the
Starship Enterprise as the big, beefy 1999 conversion van roared up
the steep freeway grade north of Black Canyon City.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later (our time, not space time), we were parked in the
lot of a Camp Verde fast-food joint. Van shades drawn, the
dad-pilot joined the boys to eat burgers and watch the explosive
conclusion of Star Trek: Insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   A decidedly weird outing. And it was a jolt to watch the end of
the space movie, pop it out of the VCR, then draw the shades and
find ourselves surrounded by the bright sunlight of rural Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Though really, no weirder than watching The Waterboy on the
movie screen of a Boeing 747 flying at 30,000 feet in the middle of
the night.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, a conversion van is the vehicle of choice for
long-distance traveling. Not quite as commodious as the Starship
Enter prise, there's plenty of room in terms of modern-day
earthbound vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion van was a full-size, rear-drive Ford Econoline
panel van, the kind most often seen toting a plumber's business
supplies or delivering appliances. Once the converter gets done
with it, you'd hardly recognize its proletarian ori gins.
</P>
<P>
   This type of conversion van, sold complete at Ford dealerships,
is a Universal Luxury Conversion Van, made by the Glaval Corp. of
Elkhart, Ind. (It's the official con version-van company of NASCAR,
by the way, which essentially means you get a cool NASCAR sticker
in the rear windows.)
</P>
<P>
   And along with the plush seven-seater accommodations, wood trim
and extensive comfort and appear ance features, it comes with a
built-in television, complete with VCR and game ports for Sega,
Nintendo or Play Station.
</P>
<P>
   A kid's dream.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors recently fueled the debate about TVs in cars, and
whether family values were being heavily undermined, earlier this
year when it unveiled minivans that included optional built-in TV
sets.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever your feelings about either having kids joining Mom and
Dad on the open road or disappear ing into a video cocoon, the
point is that, for many families, this feature could spell the
difference between having a great trip or having a miserable trip.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the TV feature, the conversion van seems like the
most comfortable, painless way to take a long trip, especially if
you take them often. Riding up high in a luxury van is akin to
traveling by motor home or corporate jet.
</P>
<P>
   The seats on this Universal model are big, cushy affairs, more
like easy chairs than car seats. In some ways (especially with the
TV), they resemble living rooms on wheels, allowing various
configurations of the number and positions of the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Big picture windows with shades, thick rugs, lots of cubbies and
plenty of cupholders are all part of the comfort mix. Every
passenger has loads of wiggle room in every direction.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the TV, our test vans were equipped with fabulous sur
round-sound stereo systems, some of the best I've heard in a
factory-equipped vehicle. For grown-ups, this is a much hotter
setup than the TV.
</P>
<P>
   All the components, including the trick rear seat that folds up
for additional cargo or flops flat into a double bed, seem
well-constructed and durable.
</P>
<P>
   One beef concerns the driver's seat power control, mounted awk
wardly in the front of the bottom cushion and looking tacked on
rather than properly integrated. Also, too much of the wood-tone
material on the dash and center console is of hard plastic, not
quite matching the real wood decorating the rear compartment.
</P>
<P>
   And the double rear doors, so handy for tradesmen, are awkward
for families and create a tangible blind spot in the center where
the doors meet, when seen through the rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few significant glitches on our test vans,
including one that had a rear AC unit that wasn't hooked up to the
vents and a TV that was wired incorrectly to the VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Two different types of Universal conversions were driven, one
with a high top and one with a standard roof line.
</P>
<P>
   The high-top, basically a fiber glass height extension, was
nicely finished in wood with an exotic recessed lighting system,
which gave the interior a spacious feel. A second rear-mounted
air-condition ing system provided cool air through ceiling vents, a
nice system for interior comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The low-top was not quite as jazzy, though comparably equipped,
including the rear AC. A big difference was that, instead the TV
being mounted up high (obviously, in back of the driver and
front-seat passenger), it was mounted on a console on the floor.
Two things are faulty about this TV mounting: It blocks passage
from the front seats, and the outboard passengers in the third
bench seat can't really see the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Either van is a nice driver, handling as well as possible for
such a heavy, basic sort of truck and responding well to throttle,
brake and steering inputs. The big Ford vans are a class act, and
the conversion equipment does nothing to take away from that.
</P>
<P>
   Both vans were equipped with Ford's strong 5.4-liter V-8, a
smooth, quiet-running engine that accelerates nicely and tackles
hills with ease.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford van has a base price of about $19,000, reaching $25,930
fully equipped for converting, in cluding $700 for the bigger
engine and $1,800 for the exterior-trim package, rear AC and remote
lock ing. Fully converted by Glaval, with an entire page of extras,
the price hits a substantial $43,000.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of different configurations for these vans,
and some are undoubtedly less expen sive.
</P>
<P>
   Though the price of the conver sion van is not cheap, it is
compara ble to its main competition, Detroit's big luxury
sport-utility vehicles, such as the upscale Cadillac Esca lade and
Lincoln Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion van has much more a sense of being a vacation
machine, though, especially for those families who often venture
out into the far reaches of our home. &QL;

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, July 30 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: RULE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Monday approved, 53-45, a Republican motion to
reinstate a rule that bars senators from tacking policy amendments
onto spending bills. Supporters said the rule was necessary to
prevent lawmakers from holding the crucial appropriations bills
hostage with non-appropriations issues. Opponents said the measure
erodes good public policy by preventing minority members from
introducing and debating the issues they deem important. A ``yes''
vote favors the motion.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: MINING
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday failed to pass an amendment that would
uphold a Department of Interior regulation limiting the size of
mining waste sites to five acres. Voting 55-41, the Senate tabled,
or set aside, the amendment that would have struck language in a
larger spending bill that would allow the sites to surpass five
acres. Supporters of tabling the amendment said increasing site
acreage was crucial to the future of the mining industry. Opponents
said the measure was important because it would stop the
proliferation of toxic waste dumps on public lands. A ``yes'' vote
favors tabling the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: DEM TAX
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 39-60, a Democratic tax plan
that would have cut taxes by $290 billion. The bill, which would
have increased the standard deduction and provided education and
child care tax credits, as well as targeted relief to middle- and
lower-income families. Supporters said their tax plan is fiscally
responsible and provides tax relief for those who need it most.
Opponents said more of the estimated $3 trillion budget surplus
should be returned to Americans by way of tax cuts. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: GOP LOCK
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected a Republican ``lock box''
proposal to wall-off Social Security surpluses and gradually lower
the national debt limit. With a vote of 54-46, the proposal failed
to garner the three-fifths vote needed for passage. Supporters said
the measure would stop the raid on Social Security and Medicare.
Opponents said lowering the national debt limit could endanger
entitlement programs if there was an economic downturn. A ``yes''
vote favors the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: DEM LOCK
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected a Democratic ``lock box''
proposal that would wall-off Social Security surpluses and reserve
an additional $300 billion for Medicare. With a vote of 42-58, the
proposal failed to garner the three-fifths vote needed for passage.
Supporters of the proposal said the bill would ensure Medicare's
future. Opponents said more of the projected $3 trillion surplus
should be used for tax cuts. A ``yes'' vote favors the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   6) BILL NUMBER: NO CUT
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 54-46, a Democratic proposal
that would postpone any tax cut until the solvency of Social
Security and Medicare programs has been assured. Supporters said it
was necessary to make sure Social Security and Medicare would be
sustained in the future before cutting taxes. Opponents said the
amendment would not protect Medicare and it would just withhold the
money American taxpayers should be getting back. A ``yes'' vote
favors the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   VOTE : 1 2 3 4 5 6
</P>
<P>
   --- --- --- --- --- ---
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: ACCOUNT
</P>
<P>
   The House on Monday approved, 254-157, a bill that would require
government-wide accounting of the costs and benefits of rules and
regulations. Supporters said the bill would allow the Congress to
better understand the impact that federal regulations have on the
economy. Opponents said the bill would put unnecessary burdens on
agencies and that the benefits of federal health and safety rules
are difficult to quantify. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: CHINA
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday rejected, 260-170, an effort to overturn
President Clinton's recommendation to renew normal trade relations
with China for another year. China's trade status must be reviewed
each year. If Clinton approves normal trade relations, only
congressional action can reverse it. Supporters of limiting China's
trade status said China should be held accountable for human rights
violations and alleged espionage at U.S. nuclear laboratories.
Opponents said staying engaged with China is a better way of
encouraging reform. A ``yes'' vote favors ending the normal trade
relations.

PARK SERVICE WON'T LET HOPIS GATHER GOLDEN EAGLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ When the two Hopi priests came to Wupatki
National Monument in late May looking for eaglets to slay during a
religious ceremony, it didn't take Superintendent Sam Henderson
long to say no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say we're not in the business of giving away our
rare animals,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident has drawn the attention of the upper levels of
the U.S. Interior Department in what Park Service officials say is
the first case of Native American religious rights pitted against
the rights of the U.S. Park Service to protect its wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The Hopis plan to fight the decision handed down Thursday by
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who upheld the Park Service's
decision to deny the Hopi priests their golden eagles.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the Greasewood clan in the village of Hotevilla on
Third Mesa planned to smother the birds at the conclusion of Home
Dance ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners of the ancient Hopi religion believe that eagle
spirits act as messengers to the world of their deities to inform
them of tribal members' needs. The Hopis also use eagle feathers in
a variety of ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The Hopis will go to court if necessary for the right to gather
eaglets, said Leigh Kuwanwisiwma, director of the Hopi Tribe's
cultural preservation office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be very careful in exhausting all our
administrative appeals, and the federal courts are another
option,'' Kuwanwisiwma said.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, a federal judge in Phoenix upheld the right of
Hopi religious leaders to gather eaglets for ceremonies after 11
Hopis were arrested while searching for the birds on the
neighboring Navajo reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Although eagles are protected by federal law, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service has granted an exemption to the Hopis for their
summer ceremonies. Tribal priests also use red-tailed hawks in the
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwanwisiwma said religious leaders are permitted to gather up
to 40 eaglets and hawks for the ceremonies but generally gather
only 12 or 13. Kuwanwisiwma also said that Hopi priests have sought
out eagles on Coconino National Forest and that the tribe has a
``working agreement'' with Kaibab National Forest for ``Hopi
religious use of the forest.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribal officials said the last place they expected to have
problems was in Wupatki, where the Hopis' Anas azi ancestors built
huge multistory housing blocks on the high-desert plains north of
Flagstaff. The area was abandoned in the early 1200s, apparently
during an extended drought.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwanwisiwma said he and many other Hopis have gone to Wupatki
repeatedly without incident to gather eagle feathers and to bring
offerings to their ancient clans, including the sprinkling of corn
pollen at family sites.
</P>
<P>
   But taking live eagles is quite different, said Henderson, the
Wu patki supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I immediately contacted our field solicitor in Santa Fe and
was told that we do not give out permits for wildlife collection,''
Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hopi priests had both a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and
Arizona Game and Fish permit to take the birds, Henderson said. But
the permits also required the ap proval of the federal land
managers before the birds could be captured.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful, however, that there are even any eagles within
the Wupatki boundaries, Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three old nests in a sink area near the Citadel ruin
but one of our specialists looked at it and other logical areas and
said there was no evidence of any recent occupation,'' Henderson
said. ``One person reportedly said he saw a golden eagle soaring
near the Visi tors Center recently, but there's been no
confirmation of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the problems with the Park Service represent a big
slap in the face to traditional Hopi people, said Amos Poocha,
director of community services of the Bacavi community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Home Dance is used to celebrate the harvest of our
crops,'' Poocha said. ``But the Park Service is not even allowing
us to go home.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Frogs are sneaking indoors and squirrels lie
panting in the shade.
</P>
<P>
   This heat blast doesn't feel any better to them than it does to
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finding frogs in our buildings,'' said Nancy Honerkamp,
superintendent of Weston Bend State Park. ``We just had two in one
of our restrooms with water. They were green water frogs. I think
their puddle is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother Nature's creatures adapt to the heat, but it troubles
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had squirrels lying on their bellies with their arms and
legs out in the shade, panting,'' said Lynn Youngblood Sloan,
director of the Burr Oak Nature Center in Blue Springs. ``They'll
lie there 15 to 20 minutes and when the ground warms under their
body, they take their front paws and pull themselves to a cool
place. Anything to get cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The squirrels are trying to digest a full meal after visiting
feeders at the Missouri Department of Conservation center. But the
heat keeps them and other critters from making it to their normal
tree perches for a post-meal nap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had doves lying in the grass and spreading their wings
out to cool off,'' Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   The heat may kill creatures already weak with disease or
advanced age, said Wendy Sangster, a Conservation Department
biologist.
</P>
<P>
   But most animals find shade and stay quiet during the daylight
hours, moving about to feed and drink at night or in the early
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife isn't as easily spotted because the animals seek
shelter from the heat. Deer and turkey that normally feed early and
late during daylight in fields at Burr Oak haven't been seen
lately, Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Honerkamp has seen deer and turkeys moving in fields in
full sunlight when the heat is most fierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like they're disoriented,'' she said. ``They may
be desperate to find water. It's possible they're moving to
watering holes they don't normally use.''
</P>
<P>
   Backyard trees may be strangely void of songbirds because
they're staying quiet to keep cool or seeking water.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of birds coming into my watering spots have their mouths
open and look like they're panting, they're thirsty,'' said Laura
Gray, director of the Martha Lafite Thompson Nature Sanctuary in
Liberty. ``It's the first time I've ever seen birds wait in line
for the bird bath.''
</P>
<P>
   People can help their backyard wildlife cope by making sure bird
baths are full or by placing additional containers of water outside
for animals.
</P>
<P>
   The heat does increase the chance for fish kills in ponds and
streams, said Dan Lekie, a biologist for the Kansas Department of
Wildlife and Parks, although few have been reported to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animals are better prepared to handle this than we are,''
Lekie said. ``They don't get used to air conditioning and then go
back into the heat. They're just there. They don't become dormant.
But they become more lackadaisical and do less and less.''

SPACE GEOLOGIST GETS WISH FOR LUNAR BURIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN STANLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eugene M. Shoemaker always wanted to go to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, he got his wish.
</P>
<P>
   The Lunar Prospector spacecraft was scheduled to crash into the
moon early Saturday, scattering the Arizona geologist's ashes
across the landscape he dearly loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene is the first human to be laid to rest on another
celestial body,'' said Carolyn Porco, pro fessor of planetary
sciences at the University of Arizona. ``This puts a human face on
the heavens, and they will never again be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunar Prospector was launched last year to orbit the moon and
map its surface. Knowing the craft would fall to the surface when
its fuel ran out, scientists placed Shoemaker's ashes aboard it as
a tribute to him. The plan angered some Navajos and other Native
Americans who hold strong taboos about death and consider the moon
sacred.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's crash landing, however, is no accident.
</P>
<P>
   An engineer in Texas came up with the idea of deliberately crash
ing the Lunar Prospector and ob serving the debris cloud to
determine whether there is water on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists believe Prospec tor detected signs of water
frozen in the lunar soil. If so, that water may be used someday to
support manned lunar colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker, a longtime Flagstaff resident, invented the field of
astro geology (space geology) in the 1960s. He trained astronauts
and led the team that examined the moon rocks brought to Earth by
the Apollo missions.
</P>
<P>
   He first made his reputation on Meteor Crater near Winslow in
1960, Porco said. Shoemaker's work proved the crater was the result
of a cosmic impact, rather than volcanic as everyone else had
assumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene made the connection be tween the heavens and the Earth in
a way no one had done before,'' said Porco, who worked with
Shoemaker on NASA's Voyager missions in the 1980s. ``He was a
pioneering fig ure, way ahead of everyone else. He almost
single-handedly convinced NASA to provide geological train ing for
astronauts. All the science we got from Apollo wouldn't have been
there without him.''
</P>
<P>
   And, she added, Shoemaker des perately longed to test his ideas
on the moon. Personally.
</P>
<P>
   It was not to be. In 1963, Shoemaker was diagnosed with a
medical condition that ended his dream of being an astronaut and
going to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the biggest disappoint ment of his life,'' Porco said.
</P>
<P>
   His dream lost, Shoemaker plunged into his work.
</P>
<P>
   David Levy, comet hunter and Parade magazine science editor,
discovered 13 comets with Gene and his wife, Carolyn. The most
famous was their find in 1993 that a comet had been ripped into
pieces by Jupiter's gravitational forces. Astronomers described the
chucks of comet as ``a string of pearls.''
</P>
<P>
   Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 made headlines when astronomers realized
it would slam into Jupiter's atmos phere with the force of millions
of nuclear explosions. The cosmic col lision in July 1994 was
visible even in small telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   About an ounce of Shoemaker's remains were encapsulated in a
polycarbonate vial about the size of a lipstick container and
placed aboard the Prospector when it was launched in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The vials, made by Celestis Inc. of Houston, have carried the re
mains of 55 people into space, including Star Trek creator Gene
Roddenberry and 1960s LSD advo cate Timothy Leary. Leary was later
involved with the L-5 Society, an organization that advocated elabo
rate space cities orbiting the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker is the first to have his remains stay in space. The
others burned up as they re-entered Earth's atmosphere, like
meteors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene was so dearly loved and admired. If anyone deserves this
honor, it's him,'' Porco said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees.
</P>
<P>
   When Prospector was launched, Albert Hale, then Navajo tribal
chairman, said the plan to put Shoemaker's remains on the moon
showed ``gross insensitivity to Na tive American religious
values.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Navajo and some other Indian tribes, having anything to
do with the remains of a dead person is a major violation of tribal
traditions. It usually can be countered only by having expensive
ceremonies done by tribal medicine men.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, an attorney in private prac tice in Window Rock, didn't
know whether the tribe's medicine men planned a ceremony to restore
harmony, but recalled that they did so when it was discovered ashes
had been spread in the San Francisco Peaks, sacred to the Navajo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust the leadership to uphold our tradition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Porco and Levy don't understand Hale's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never dreamed anyone would be offended by this,'' Porco
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the moon belongs to everybody,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Porco came up with the idea of a ``space burial'' for Shoemaker
while reading an account of his death in an auto accident in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just hit me,'' she said. ``So, I got on the phone
immediately. I selected the epigraph and had it laser engraved on
brass foil.''
</P>
<P>
   The epigraph is from Romeo and Juliet:
</P>
<P>
   And, when he shall die,
</P>
<P>
   Take him and cut him out in little stars,
</P>
<P>
   And he will make the face of heaven so fine
</P>
<P>
   That all the world will be in love with night,
</P>
<P>
   And pay no worship to the garish sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those words just seemed a perfect fit, as inspirational as
Gene was,'' Porco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a scientific purpose for this crash,'' Levy said.
``We're hoping to find evidence of water on the moon. But whether
we do or not is secondary to the attempt. . . . If he were alive, I
know he'd be pleased.'' &QL;

HEAT WAVE BRINGS MEMORIES OF KC'S TERRIBLE YEAR OF 1980 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- In 1980 the heat was almost biblical.
</P>
<P>
   Crops browned over. Fish floated dead on the surface of Swope
Park Lagoon. And Kansas City area residents fell as if stricken by
plague.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, officials had attributed the deaths of 13 Kansas
City area residents to the heat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, 176 died of it.
</P>
<P>
   Through Thursday, the Kansas City area had endured six straight
days of triple-digit readings downtown. But starting on July 4,
1980, temperatures topped 100 for 17 straight days downtown.
</P>
<P>
   It represented the worst heat wave in 44 years.
</P>
<P>
   Residents -- mostly those without air conditioning -- fled to
malls, libraries or pools. But in some tragic instances, they
remained behind locked doors and windows as their dwellings became
ovens.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the 1980 heat wave's principal legacy today is a
heightened awareness of the dangers of prolonged heat, especially
on the indigent and elderly living alone.
</P>
<P>
   But that year's heat, unlike a flood or a high wind, was a
cumulative disaster that seemed to sneak up on the city.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Biery, then director of the Kansas City Health
Department, said the heat's timing was terrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes about two weeks for the human body to acclimatize to
go through that transition,'' Biery said. ``But this hit us in
early July. People were still thinking `spring' and suddenly they
were in the middle of 105-degree days.''
The worst weekend
</P>
<P>
   Between 7 a.m. and noon July 11, 1980, officials found 12
victims. The worst weekend may have been July 12-13, when as many
as 15 bodies jammed the 22-by-22-foot freezer in the county morgue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that it was just one body after another, most of
them elderly people, and by the time they got to us they were
decomposing,'' said Bonita Peterson, then Jackson County medical
examiner and now an independent pathologist.
</P>
<P>
   The scene of death was almost exclusively indoors.
</P>
<P>
   During a 1936 heat wave, Kansas Citians had escaped to the
outdoors. Before the arrival of air conditioning, residents formed
overnight communities during vast sleep-ins in open spaces like
Swope Park.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, many of the city's older and indigent residents stayed
inside.
</P>
<P>
   One factor was economic. The death rate in 1980, a study later
suggested, was some 10 times higher among people in lower-income
brackets. They often were apartment dwellers, often without air
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the dead had fans or air conditioners they didn't
use.
</P>
<P>
   ``People apparently just thought they could tough it through, or
not spend their pension money on utilities,'' Biery said.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1980, Kansas City Power &AMP; Light customers used more than
twice the current they had the previous July.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the deaths was fear of crime.
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper reporter, accompanying the crew of a mortuary
transport firm, noticed how windows in the apartments of the
deceased often were locked or sealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them had their windows nailed shut,'' said Gerald
Hoff, a Kansas City Health Department epidemiologist.
</P>
<P>
   Isolation also caused people to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older people tend not to ask for help, they tend to be
isolated and don't always have family around to check on them,''
said Roger Coleman, executive director of the Westport Allen
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, it's very easy for them not to know what is
happening to them, or why they are not feeling well.''
</P>
<P>
   Daytime high temperatures downtown proved the manifestation of
monotony: 103 degrees on July 4, 103 again on July 5.
</P>
<P>
   The daytime peaks may not have been the more deadly, officials
later speculated. It was the high nighttime temperatures, and the
lack of any respite, that apparently discouraged many.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not just an ordinary hot summer in Kansas City,'' Biery
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was unusual was that the nights stopped cooling down. We
noticed that we didn't really have a rising death rate until the
official evening temperatures did not go below 85 for the third day
in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   From July 8 through July 11, inclusive, low temperatures stayed
between 85 to 89 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became convinced it was a psychological factor,'' Biery
said. ``We had anecdotal information that people just sort of gave
up at night after the third day.''
A deadly trend
</P>
<P>
   Across the country 1,265 persons died from the heat wave and
drought.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri had the greatest number of deaths with 311, while
Kansas had 72. Missouri Gov. Joseph Teasdale declared a state of
emergency on July 14, alerting National Guard units and asking for
federal funds to purchase fans and air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, social service agencies did what they could,
providing meals, fans and other assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember delivering ice and fans, particularly to those who
were in walk-up apartments,'' said Jim Nunnelly, then chief
administrator of the Samuel U. Rodgers Community Health Center on
the city's East Side. ``I also remember clearing a room and
allowing elderly people who wanted to come inside the building and
beat the day's sun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Police Department established a heat wave
command center. Before disbanding on July 25, it handled more than
10,000 calls for information and assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, two-thirds of those dead had been
white, one-third black. A slight preponderance were women.
</P>
<P>
   But the demographic group that seemed to suffer the most was the
under-informed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there is a much higher awareness,'' said Coleman. ``It
seems that 15 minutes of the news every night is devoted to the
weather. TV is constantly bombarding people on how to take care of
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Peterson: ``That wasn't true at the time.''

FINANCIAL WORLD EXPECTS CONSUMERS' Y2K FEARS TO CAUSE MARKET
SHIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS and DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Year 2000 problems at U.S. corporations will not affect the U.S.
economy and stock market, but consumer concerns about Y2K could
cause shifts in the market, a new report from Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The financial company said the top Year 2000 issue is emerging
as ``Y2K problem two'' -- worry by both corporate and individual
consumers that the computer bug will result in problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a second Y2K problem which is not based on what is
known, but rather is based on what is feared,'' according to Jeanne
G. Terrile, first vice president of Merrill Lynch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the financial company's second annual report on Y2K, Terrile
said the possibility that Y2K would have a negative effect on the
U.S. economy had diminished. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our surveys show that, based on factual evidence, the risk of
serious economic dislocation from Y2K noncompliance is
diminishing,'' Terrile said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But the turn of the millennium is a big event which will
surely get more and more media coverage, and some of that coverage
will no doubt raise fears,'' Terrile said. ``To the extent that
those fears are acted upon, investment and fund flows could be
altered.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Merrill Lynch report gave U.S. banks high praise for
completing their Y2K projects. However, banks might spark fears if
they borrow to increase their cash reserves in case Y2K-nervous
consumers come to withdraw money at the end of the year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Terrile said there were indications the U.S. economy would heat
up in the fourth quarter as corporations beefed up inventories to
cover themselves for any potential Y2K-related supply chain
problems. That could lead to a slight economic downtown during the
first quarter next year as spending slows, she said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Corporate Y2K ratings
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications, parent of Southwestern Bell, received a
``below average'' rating for Y2K readiness in a survey by Weiss
Ratings Inc., a Florida company that rates the Y2K readiness of
American corporations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Weiss readiness survey, released this week, found that
spending to complete Y2K projects at major corporations jumped as
much as 500 percent in the first quarter of the year, ``indicating
that management may have greatly underestimated the scope of their
Year 2000'' problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications and 21.2 percent of the Fortune 1,000
companies received below-average Y2K readiness ratings from the
Weiss survey. The company's rating was downgraded since the last
Weiss survey, when SBC received an ``average'' rating. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SBC, expected to spent $265 million on Y2K, has so far spent 65
percent of its budget, a Weiss analyst states, which is considered
``low'' as compared to a peer comparison group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Janet Rainford, Y2K communications director for SBC,
criticized the rating given by Weiss, saying the firm was just out
to make a name for itself with its apples-to-oranges comparisons
between Fortune 1,000 firms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She said SBC increased its Y2K budget by $10 million in the
latest Securities and Exchange Commission filings after the recent
purchase of a non-Y2K-compliant company. SBC is 99 percent ready
for Y2K, she said, and will meet the end-of-the-year deadline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Farmland Industries received the bottom ranking of ``low.'' The
survey said the company's spending had doubled from $3 million to
$6 million during the first three months of the year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roger Willt, an information technology executive with Farmland,
said the ranking did not accurately reflect the farm cooperative's
Y2K efforts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Willt said Farmland's Y2K budget increase reflected spending for
third-party testing of all Y2K systems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Independent testing is a good thing, Weiss raters say, but
planning for it this late in the game reflects poorly on the firm's
Y2K planning efforts. Farmland calls the move prudent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All along, private industry has been loath to discuss Y2K
efforts publicly for fear of becoming targets for opportunistic
lawyers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I talk with our important customers and explain our
state of readiness,'' Willt said, ``they become more comfortable
with our efforts.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also in the same rankings, AlliedSignal Inc. received a ``high''
rating. Of its $150 million Y2K budget, the firm has left to spend
$28 million, or 19 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What does this all mean? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The information disclosed by the companies to the SEC does not
permit definitive conclusions regarding their current status,''
said Martin Weiss, chairman of the ratings company. ``But it does
give us a pretty good indication upon which we base our opinion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, many firms have failed to disclose even the
basics such as their Y2K budgets and expenditures, despite SEC
guidelines that call for these disclosures.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weiss Ratings is at www.weissratings.com on the Web. &QL; 
Up in the air
</P>
<P>
   Poland's national airline, LOT, said it would ground all its
planes Jan. 1, 2000, to avoid any potential problems. It's
considered to be the first mass cancellation in Europe because of
Y2K worries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be mistake-free and that's why we are taking this
step,'' spokesman Monika Krajczynska told Reuters news agency.
``The management has decided to cancel all flights on this
sensitive day because of the possibilities of complications or
problems.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The state-run airline, which flies to most eastern and western
European capitals and North America, will resume flights on Jan.
2. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, Vietnam Airlines has canceled all flights just prior to
Jan. 1. And in Indonesia, airline PT Garuda has said it might not
fly on New Year's Day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Europe and North America, airline officials are confident
their systems will be fine on Jan. 1. A recent report from the Air
Transportation Association of America says 95 percent of all U.S.
air carriers are Y2K ready. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And a host of Y2K luminaries say they will be in the sky when
2000 arrives. They include John Koskinen, chairman of the
President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion; Jane Garvey, head of
the Federal Aviation Administration; and Peter de Jager, the
Canadian computer guru who first alerted the world to the potential
for problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But will they find their luggage when they land? &QL;

TIAHRT ANGERS AIDS ACTIVISTS BY LEADING FIGHT AGAINST NEEDLE
EXCHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Republican Rep. Todd Tiahrt of Kansas has again
provoked the ire of home-rule advocates and AIDS activists in the
nation's capital by successfully leading a fight to ban federal
support of needle-exchange programs to help drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
   The debate came during consideration this week of a $4.7 billion
spending bill for the District of Columbia, which the House passed
but which President Clinton has threatened to veto if the final
version includes the ban on needle exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Tiahrt and other conservative Republicans, however, have tried
to put the brakes on several city programs that highlight the
political divisions on social policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``By handing out needles we encourage drug use,'' Tiahrt said.
``It does not help the children of Washington, D.C., to take
taxpayer money to fund these programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, now operating in more than 110 cities,
intravenous drug users can get clean needles in exchange for old
ones. Supporters argue that it takes contaminated needles off the
streets, which helps to reduce the transmission of AIDS and other
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Its backers include D.C. Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey and
former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. Noting that he has worked
on the AIDS epidemic since it became a public health problem, Koop
told the Republican House leadership in a letter this week that
needle-exchange programs ``can be an effective means of preventing
the spread of the disease without increasing the use of illicit
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is the leading cause of death of Washington residents
between ages 30 and 44. The city also has the highest rate of new
HIV infections in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is both arrogant and misguided,'' Rep. Albert Wynn, a
Maryland Democrat, said of Tiahrt's measure. ``We would never
attempt to impose the will of Congress on the citizens of Kansas.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tiahrt said Congress ``should not use taxpayer dollars to
enable heroin addicts to continue their self-destructive
behavior.'' He has cited an Office of National Drug Control Policy
report that stated that the public health risks of needle exchanges
exceed the benefits and that the ``science is uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue drew attention because Congress is responsible for the
city's annual budget. After it banned the use of city spending on
needle exchanges last year, a private, nonprofit group took over
the program. Home-rule supporters said the issue was a example of
how Congress intrudes on the city's right to govern itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows how democracy really is a life-and-death issue,''
said Wayne Turner, an AIDS activist. ``This is self-determination,
and people die when Congress interferes with our own process.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the city budget raised another home-rule issue.
The House agreed to allow the city to release the results of a
voter initiative last fall on the use of marijuana for medical
purposes. The votes remain uncounted -- although exit polls show
that the measure probably passed -- because Congress last year
outlawed the use of federal money on a ballot initiative that would
have legalized marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington spending bill passed by the House this week
continued the ban on the legalization of medical marijuana. But the
final bill has to be worked out in conference with the Senate,
whose version includes neither the ban on marijuana nor needle
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Art Spitzer, legal director for the local American Civil
Liberties Union office, called it an ``outrage'' that the medical
marijuana vote was held last fall and that the results still
weren't known.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district's ability to make its own local policies is still
a plaything on Capitol Hill,'' he said.

 The following article is based on reporting by Kevin Sack, Francis
X. Clines, John Kifner and David Barstow and was written by Sack.  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After bludgeoning his wife and two children to death
with a hammer, and just eight hours before slaughtering nine people
in the brokerage houses where he traded, Mark O. Barton typed a
chilling confession on his computer and warned that he planned to
live just long enough to kill ``the people that greedily sought my
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which Barton apparently wrote near sunrise Thursday
and then left in the Stockbridge, Ga., apartment where he had
killed his family, suggested that he was tortured by his
estrangement from his wife, by financial troubles and by
unexplained fears that he said had been ``transferred from my
father to me and from me to my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in Henry County, Ga., which includes the Atlanta suburb
of Stockbridge, released the letter Friday as the authorities
searched for clues to the motive behind Thursday's killing spree,
the deadliest in the state's history.
</P>
<P>
   Because Barton, 44, shot and killed himself in his van as he was
apprehended by police Thursday night, law enforcement officials
said they were unlikely to ever know exactly what caused him to
snap.
</P>
<P>
   But the often rambling letter, printed neatly on Barton's
letterhead and signed robustly in large script, offered a
remarkable glimpse into the twisted thinking of a man who seems to
have carefully calculated his three-day rampage.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, along with recollections from people who knew
Barton, suggests that the rage that played out on a hot afternoon
in a glitzy suburb here had its roots in the earliest years of his
life. And perhaps, authorities say, he had expressed the rage
before.
</P>
<P>
   He was the only suspect in the 1993 bludgeoning deaths of his
first wife and her mother. The next year, he was under
investigation for possible molestation of his then 3-year-old
daughter. As a course of that investigation, a clinical
psychiatrist evaluated him as someone who was ``certainly capable
of homicidal thought and homicidal action.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton's mother, Gladys Barton, who lives in South Carolina,
released a statement Friday afternoon saying that she was deeply
saddened by the shootings, but that she loved her son. ``I wish
there was some way to explain why this tragedy occurred or some way
it could have been prevented,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Barton's father, Truman, died almost two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, a chemist and securities day trader, wrote in his letter
that he killed his current wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday night and
his two children, 11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Mychelle, on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was little pain,'' he explained, in the letter, which
police said was left on a living room coffee table. ``All of them
were dead in less than five minutes. I hit them with a hammer in
their sleep and then put them face-down in the bathtub to make sure
they did not wake up in pain, to make sure they were dead. I'm so
sorry. I wish I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton went on: ``Words cannot tell the agony. Why did I? I have
been dying since October. Wake up at night so afraid, so terrified
that I couldn't be that afraid while awake. It has taken its toll.
I have come to hate this life and this system of things. I have
come to have no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Jim Simmons of the Henry County police said that Leigh Ann
Barton moved out of the couple's rented house in Morrow, Ga., in
October, and moved into the two-bedroom apartment in nearby
Stockbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, he said, Barton and his two children from his
first marriage, showed up at the apartment, needing a place to
live. Leigh Ann Barton took them in.
</P>
<P>
   Barton wrote that he killed his wife because ``she was one of
the main reasons for my demise,'' but then added that he regretted
killing her. ``She really couldn't help it and I love her so much
anyway.'' He said he then killed his children to exchange ``five
minutes of pain for a lifetime of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton also left handwritten notes on top of each child and his
wife, said Chief Jimmy W. Mercer of the Henry County police. Each
note paid brief tribute to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The children had been placed in their beds and covered. A
stuffed teddy bear was left on top of Mychelle's body and a Game
Boy computer on Matthew's. Ms. Barton's body was found in a bedroom
closet, placed behind boxes and under clothes, presumably so that
it would not be discovered by the children, Mercer said. He said
the suspected murder weapon, a hammer, also was found.
</P>
<P>
   Barton noted in his letter that investigators might notice
similarities between the deaths of his family members and those of
his previous wife, Debra Spivey Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise
Powell Spivey, 59, both of whom were found in a camping trailer,
bludgeoned with a sharp, heavy blade. But he denied killing them.
``There's no reason for me to lie now,'' he wrote. ``It just seemed
like a quiet way to kill and a relatively painless way to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Alabama slayings at a lakeside campground near
Cedar Bluff, Barton's dark, troubled side was hardly unknown to the
authorities. And several months later, in February of 1994, Georgia
child welfare officials and the Douglas County, Ga., district
attorney's office began an investigation after Barton's daughter,
then 3, told a day care worker that he had molested her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were extremely concerned because of the context, that he
was the prime suspect in a murder case,'' said David McDade, the
district attorney, who said the reports he read ``make me shudder
to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, nothing could be done to challenge Barton's custody
because the child was too young to testify, McDade said. But during
the investigation, Barton was evaluated by a clinical psychologist
who, McDade said, found he ``certainly was capable of homicidal
thought and homicidal action.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion fell on Barton in the Alabama case, investigators
said, because he had taken out a $600,000 life insurance policy on
his wife four days before her death, because they were known to be
having marital problems, and because he was already having an
affair with the woman who would become his second wife, Leigh Ann
Vandiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the number one suspect all the way through and still
is,'' said Richard Igou, the district attorney in Cedar Bluff at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found traces of what they thought might be blood
in Barton's car, but before they could conduct further tests, the
chemist told them he had spilled a soft drink on the area, ruining
any potential evidence. He gave what they felt were ``rehearsed''
answers to questions and refused to take a polygraph test,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason he was not charged was they could not place him
inside the campground,'' said Paul Dale, then a reserve captain in
the Cherokee County, Ala., sheriff's department. Dale, who was one
of the first officers on the scene, said there were no fingerprints
or witnesses. `'When I heard the name, and heard the way the two
kids and the second wife died, it didn't come as a real surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Investor's Life Insurance of Nebraska, which issued the policy,
settled Barton's claim for $450,000, with $150,000 going to a trust
fund for the children, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Barton had been carrying on an affair with Ms. Vandiver, a
co-worker at a chemical company, Lintech International, where he
had been a salesman and she a customer services assistant, the
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   In October of 1993, a month after the slaying of his first wife,
Ms. Vandiver divorced her husband, David K. Lang. A year later,
both left their jobs at Lintech, according to Julie H. Van Brunt,
the company's administrative manager, who declined to discuss the
reasons for the resignations. They were married on May 26, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   They lived in Morrow, a middle-class suburb south of Atlanta,
where their house at 6475 Sinclair Place was notable only for the
multiple phone lines and banks of computers on which Barton did his
work, mostly at home. He dressed in casual clothes and helped out
with the local boy scouts.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent months had been troubled, apparently at least
partly because of financial problems due to Barton's losses as a
high-risk day trader. As winter came, a neighbor, Cindy A.
Northcutt, said the children confided to her that Ms. Barton had
left her husband.
</P>
<P>
   In May, she said, Barton held a yard sale. But it was not the
type that people have to get rid of old, unused junk. She said it
seemed as though Barton was trying to sell virtually every item of
furniture he possessed.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the unsolved murders of his first wife and
mother-in-law, Barton had been quietly pursued by his former
father-in-law, William Spivey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like that if those people in Alabama had done their job
that there'd be 12 people alive,'' Spivey said in an interview,
fighting to contain his outrage that it took the Atlanta shooting
spree to spark fuller scrutiny of the earlier slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's police and political leaders remained grim and
devastated Friday as they reviewed the details of Thursday's
carnage. In addition to the eight men and one woman who were
killed, 13 people were injured, some of them critically, in the two
brokerage houses where Barton sprayed fire with two handguns. Ten
people remained hospitalized Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of Allen C. Tenenbaum, 48, a synagogue president
and father of three who was killed while visiting All-Tech
Investment Group Inc., held the first funeral for a victim Friday.
Gov. Roy E. Barnes ordered that flags at the state Capitol be flown
at half-staff and Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell announced that a
citywide interfaith memorial service would be held on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, Barton visited the office of his lawyer,
Joseph H. Fowler, to work on some ``routine will and estate
issues,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Barton's wife and children were found at about
3:30 p.m. that day, shortly after he had finished his shooting
spree in Atlanta's Buckhead financial and entertainment district.
They were discovered by an apartment manager who had been called by
a concerned co-worker of Ms. Barton, Simmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's police chief, Beverly Harvard, said that police
received their first emergency call at 2:56 p.m. from a woman
reporting that shots had been fired in the offices of Momentum
Securities Inc. at Two Securities Centre on Buckhead's bustling
Piedmont Road.
</P>
<P>
   She said Barton spent about 30 minutes at the office, where he
had been trading for several months, before pulling his weapons and
firing. ``He had made comments to the extent that it was a bad
trading day and something to the effect that it was going to get
worse,'' Ms. Harvard said. Four people were killed in that office.
</P>
<P>
   James Lee, president of the Houston-based company, said Friday
that Barton met the firm's financial requirements for trading and
had signed documents saying he understood the risks of day trading.
He did not say whether Barton had suffered significant losses.
</P>
<P>
   By 3:07 p.m., Barton had crossed Piedmont Road and entered
All-Tech's office in Building 8 of the sprawling Piedmont Center
office complex, where he had traded until April. ``He acted
normally and said he hoped he wasn't disturbing anyone's trading
day,'' said Linda Lerner, the general counsel of the Montvale,
N.J.-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lerner said Barton entered the branch manager's office and
spoke to him and his secretary for several minutes before pulling
his weapons and shooting the two employees. Both were seriously
injured but survived, she said. In the ensuing shooting spree,
however, five customers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harvard said Friday that Barton fired 40 rounds from his 9
mm Glock semiautomatic handgun and his .45-caliber Colt
semiautomatic pistol. She said he purchased the Glock in 1993 from
a gun shop in Warner Robins, Ga., and had properly registered it.
</P>
<P>
   The Colt, however, was registered to a Texas man who bought the
gun in 1983, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Ms. Harvard said she did not know
how Barton had obtained the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   A third gun, a .22-caliber pistol, also was recovered by
authorities at the apartment, but the ATF spokesman said it
apparently was not involved in this week's shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Two other weapons, an H&AMP;R .22-caliber pistol that Barton
purchased from a South Carolina pawnshop in 1976 and a .25-caliber
Raven semiautomatic pistol that was purchased from a Georgia
pawnshop in 1992 by someone else, were found in the van where
Barton killed himself, the spokesman said. Police also found 200
rounds of ammunition in the van.
</P>
<P>
   After Barton escaped, police first learned of his whereabouts
when he tried to steal a woman's car at 7:40 p.m. at Town Center
Mall in Cobb County, northwest of Buckhead, according to Cobb
County police.
</P>
<P>
   By about 8 p.m., police had trailed Barton's green Aerostar
minivan to a BP service station in nearby Acworth, where he killed
himself as officers approached him with guns drawn, Ms. Harvard
said.

KANSAS CITY SINGER TRACES OLD `AMERICAN' SONGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was late afternoon on July 4th when, without fanfare or
announcement, Connie Dover, one of America's finest interpreters of
Celtic music, stood before some 50 of her friends and neighbors in
the front yard of a Platte County, Mo., farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   And there she sang an old song.
</P>
<P>
   The water is wide,
</P>
<P>
   I cannot cross o'er ...
</P>
<P>
   Her style that day was piercingly simple, unembellished by the
lilting grace notes that often mark the Celtic ballads for which
she is best known.
</P>
<P>
   Beside her on a folding chair sat Phil Cunningham, a Scottish
musician and recording producer.
</P>
<P>
   He accompanied Dover on the accordion, his chording as spare and
evocative as the distant droning of a lone bagpipe melded with the
wind.
</P>
<P>
   When Dover was done, she was greeted not by cheers but rather by
a collective sigh, as if she had touched something deeper and more
connective than simple appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   And then she and Cunningham bade farewell. For early the next
day they were heading south to a recording studio near Nashville,
Tenn., to do the final ``mix'' on Dover's fourth solo album, a
recording that marks a significant departure for her.
</P>
<P>
   Her previous albums were all recorded in Scotland and reflected
her fascination with the music she found there and in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But Dover chose to record her latest album in this country. For
it is a unique song collection that traces the evolution of Celtic
music on the American frontier.
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Water is Wide' is a good example,'' she said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a ballad that almost everyone knows, though they're not
sure how or when they learned it. It's part of a musical tradition
we all seem to share. It's considered an American song, and indeed
it is now, but it was actually born across the seas.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the ballad made its first published appearance in
Edinburgh, and initially told of a Scottish noblewoman falsely
accused of adultery and left heartbroken and alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That story has disappeared in the American version,'' Dover
said. ``But what's left are the deeper expressions of longing, love
and sorrow that derived from it. We lost the narrative along the
way, but we kept the core.''
Old, new country
</P>
<P>
   Dover first conceived of this special album, titled ``The Border
of Heaven,'' more than 10 years ago. And she was uniquely prepared
to undertake the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised in Arkansas and Missouri; I studied at Oxford;
I've recorded in Scotland, and I've worked on a Wyoming cattle
ranch,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dover, who grew up in Kansas City, experienced her first real
immersion in Celtic culture when she spent her junior college year
studying history at Oxford University.
</P>
<P>
   While in Great Britain, she took special tutorials in the
British ballad tradition and traveled repeatedly to Scotland to
research old songs.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after her return home, she achieved local fame as the
lead singer for the Kansas City-based band called Scartaglen.
</P>
<P>
   But her wide-ranging interests and intense wanderlust led her
constantly into new musical territory. In 1992, for example, she
met the renowned cowboy balladeer Skip Gorman on a Wyoming cattle
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a trail cook, and Skip was out there singing and
collecting songs,'' she said. ``We started singing together for
fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd sing an old song I'd found in Oxford, and Skip would say,
`You know, that reminds me of a cowboy tune.' And he'd sing it, and
we'd both marvel at the similarity. The more we sang together, the
more we understood how connected the musical forms truly are.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dover's new recording, scheduled for release this winter, she
and Gorman sing ``The Streets of Laredo'' together.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, you hear that melody and think of a dusty Texas
cow town,'' Dover said.
</P>
<P>
   But in its first incarnation, the song told not of a doomed
cowboy but of a young sailor dying of syphilis in a London
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tracing its evolution, you find that an old Irish ballad was
transmuted to meet the needs of people who found themselves in a
different world,'' Dover said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America there are versions that tell of miners, loggers and
gamblers, all dying young, regretful and alone. Only the melody and
the common thread of loss and melancholy remain.''
</P>
<P>
   As the project matured in Dover's mind, she went to Scotland
again to research ballads at the University of Edinburgh's School
of Scottish Studies.
</P>
<P>
   She began haunting antiquarian book shops throughout the British
Isles and the United States, seeking old ballad collections. She
roamed across America, tracing various versions of the songs she'd
found abroad.
</P>
<P>
   She spent days at the public library in Miles City, Mont., and
then scoured the McCracken Research Collection at the Buffalo Bill
Historical Center in Cody, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   And as she repeatedly discovered American counterparts for
numerous old Celtic songs, she felt a deepening sense of
rootedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important not to feel random in this world,'' she said.
``But instead to feel the significant ties we share to the past and
to each other. This work has been a way for me to feel my own place
in a long series of human connections.''
Evicted, betrayed
</P>
<P>
   In her research, Dover came across the story of an 18th-century
bagpiper who joined thousands of other Scots fleeing eviction,
famine and English oppression as the Highlands were ``cleared'' to
make way for sheep.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1773, the piper, along with some 200 others,
boarded a rotting hulk bound for Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   But the piper was penniless, and the ship owners ordered him
ashore. His countrymen, however, took up a collection to pay his
fare and then shared their own meager rations with him throughout
the long voyage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how important their music was to them,'' Dover said.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Nova Scotia, the Highlanders proudly disembarked,
wearing their tartans and marching behind their picked piper. But
they faced a cruel surprise. They had been promised land that did
not exist, and 122 starved to death that winter.
</P>
<P>
   Moved by the story, Dover sought a song to reflect the
experience of dislocation and loss associated with emigration -- a
song to begin her album.
</P>
<P>
   She found it in Nova Scotia with the aid of Rosemary McCormack,
a Gaelic scholar and folklorist.
</P>
<P>
   In English it is titled ``The Blessing,'' and its narrator sings
of friends who have forever left their Scottish homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Farewell to you and Goodnight to you,
</P>
<P>
   Goodnight to you and blessings go with you ...
</P>
<P>
   Dover's rendition on the album is as direct and unadorned as was
her singing on July 4th. It is a heartfelt simplicity that
represents her recognition of a profound historical process.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are forced to strip their existence down to its
bare bones and divest themselves of everything they can't carry,
they still have their songs and memories,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as a song is passed down from person to person, from
generation to generation, it is only the essence that survives. And
that essence is often as stark and haunting as the half-forgotten
past.''

maybe Pepsi's other core product, fruit juice, too. By Constance L.

A PERILOUS PEACE IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it is true that Washington and its NATO allies stumbled into
an unwanted war for Kosovo, it is equally true that the victors
have stumbled into a treacherous stewardship of postwar Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Peace, of course, is better than war, but Kosovo is still cursed
with killing, looting, destruction of artistic treasures,
unaccountable people in power, and a well-meaning but ungainly
civil administration run by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The basic concept of Kosovo as a temporary protectorate in the
care of NATO peacekeeping soldiers and UN administrators is
beginning to look like an unworkable contradiction. Because the
international custodians have left ambiguous the crucial question
of who will govern a territory that still belongs to Serbia only in
the most technical sense, the province is being taken over,
undemocratically, by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   This de facto takeover by the men with guns has been made easier
because the UN has been characteristically slow to dispatch the
international policemen promised.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the police arrive, the most they can be expected to do
is limit the revenge killings of Serbs and the looting of their
property. They will not be able to prevent the KLA from exercising
power within the society of Albanian Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   When the 5,000 UN civil administrators arrive, they are to
collect taxes and customs duties and administer Kosovo's utilities,
public health, education, communications, and reconstruction. These
UN administrators are to hire both Serb and Albanian employees.
Already, Albanian Kosovars are complaining that the first UN
officials are perpetuating the kinds of unfairness the Albanians
suffered under the defeated Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The primary goal of the international community should be to
foster true democratic governance by Kosovars, preventing Kosovo
from becoming a replica of Albania's bandit state. Then the
question of whether Kosovo will be an autonomous province or an
independent state should be addressed squarely. And the sooner UN
administrators terminate their protectorate, the better.

A DOCTORS' BILL OF RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 1, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The matter of how doctors should conduct themselves in relation
to their patients was supposed to have been settled some 24
centuries ago by one of the fathers of medicine, Hippocrates. Part
of the Hippocratic oath that doctors swear to uphold even to this
day says: ``I will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients
according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet who has not heard doctors lamenting that harm is being done
day in and day out by health plan bookkeepers who are denying care
to patients and overruling what doctors recommend?
</P>
<P>
   Heretofore the evidence has been largely anecdotal, but a recent
survey conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health and the
Kaiser Family Foundation found that nearly 90 percent of the
physicians interviewed reported care denials from health
maintenance organizations and that two-thirds of these denials
caused serious harm. Half said such denials had caused a decline in
the overall health of their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care came as a way of controlling skyrocketing health
costs, and HMOs are here to stay. Happily for New Englanders, the
National Committee on Quality Assurance's annual report on the
industry says the Bay State's HMOs are the best in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is the doctor who knows best what is best for the
patient. Although excessive or unnecessary medical procedures
should be and will be discouraged, doctors should not be asked to
acquiesce in doing harm to their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is now debating a patients' bill of rights, and the
Kaiser Family Foundation's Drew Altman got it right when he said:
``This study shows that whether you're for the Republican or
Democratic approaches, there's a need to reduce the disputes
between health professionals and health plans and a need for a
mechanism to resolve these disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   What is called for is a doctors' bill of rights that will
protect the caregivers of this country from being forced to break
their oath, which was in force long before managed care.

`SCHOOL OF THE ASSASSINS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the CIA masterminded a coup against the government of
Guatemala in 1954, the human rights record of the United States in
Latin America has too often been a shameful one. One of the most
notorious symbols of this is the Army's School of the Americas,
which trains Latin American soldiers. It ought to have been closed
long ago, and a proposal sponsored by Representative J. Joseph
Moakley and approved in the House this week will, it is to be
hoped, bring that day closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in El Salvador a couple of years ago, I was often
asked `How can you keep that school open?' '' Moakley said. ``They
called it the `School of the Assassins.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley led a congressional investigation into the murders of
six Jesuits in El Salvador in 1989. Nineteen of 26 soldiers
implicated in the deaths were graduates of the school. So were
those who plotted the murders of Archbishop Oscar Romero and four
American nuns; Peruvian officers convicted of murdering nine
students; and scores of others implicated in human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, instructors used manuals that included information
about paying bounties for enemy dead, false imprisonment, and the
use of truth serum. Because of a US fixation on anticommunism, the
school had little regard for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The school has since changed its focus to instructing soldiers
in drug interdiction. There are enough human rights dangers here to
question whether that training should be done, let alone at a place
with a vile reputation. Moakley is not opposed to the notion of
some sort of training, but definitely not at the School of the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Moakley took up leadership on this cause from former US
representative Joseph Kennedy. Senator Edward Kennedy will shepherd
the proposal through the Senate. The measure would not close the
school but would prevent the Army from paying students to attend
and would send a strong signal that the school should be shut for
good.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America is enjoying a resurgence of democracy, and the
United States should nurture these fragile governments to maturity.
Closing the school would show that the United States is ready to
live up to its ideals throughout the hemisphere.

DODGERS MAKE ALL THE WRONG MOVES IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin Brown threw 115 pitches. It was enough for
23 outs, and apparently no more.
</P>
<P>
   With the Los Angeles Dodgers holding a four-run lead and an
Arizona runner on second, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson opted for
his makeshift bullpen rather than his $105 million stud.
</P>
<P>
   Five batters later, pinch-hitter Greg Colbrunn doubled in two
runs off Jeff Shaw and Arizona had the lead. The Diamondbacks went
on to win 6-5 Friday in yet another example of how everything the
Dodgers touch eventually turns to mush.
</P>
<P>
   Brown pitched 72/3 innings. He allowed five hits and two runs,
but watched as the Diamondbacks scored five times in the eighth to
deprive the right-hander of his 12th win.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Pedro Borbon walked his only batter and Shaw (2-4) blew
his second straight save opportunity after only blowing one through
his first 21 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing the Dodgers try these days works. They held a bonfire in
the bullpen once to exorcise the demons and came away with nothing.
They've rearranged the lineup, and nothing. They've tried playing
with the stockings pulled up to their knees, and nothing.
</P>
<P>
   So as the non-waiver trading period ticks down to its 9 p.m.
deadline today, the Dodgers expect nothing to happen.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Kevin Malone will be tempted to deal one of his
prized young starters _ Ismael Valdes, Chan Ho Park or Darren
Dreifort. But the Dodgers' decision makers say it's unlikely
anything will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, it seems, can turn around the season. Nothing can make
it end soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've reiterated to Kevin that he really needs to look
long-term,'' Dodgers CEO and president Bob Graziano said. ``He's
going to look at what's going to improve the club long-term _ not
just dumping payroll or just making us better for the rest of this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that philosophy that's kept this past week quiet at Chavez
Ravine. (Bad baseball has kept it quiet for the season.)
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers actively shopped first baseman Eric Karros, pitcher
Carlos Perez and second baseman Eric Young, who is now on the
disabled list and can't be traded. But the interest was in the
three pitchers, with whom the Dodgers don't want to part with
unless they are blown away by an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, offers for Dreifort, Valdes and Park haven't been up
to the Dodgers' liking so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``There doesn't seem to be any moves available to get better,''
said Malone, who's also hampered by expensive, multiyear contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Dodgers (45-58) will probably elect to keep their
current course. Not the one that has them hopelessly floundering
near the bottom of the division, but the one of building the farm
system and scouting department so they aren't reliant on free
agents and trades. Done correctly, the farm system supports the
major-league club when injuries occur and provides prospects that
can set up in-season trades for playoff pushes in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is going to remain consistent,'' Malone said.
``Our focus is on building, and in scouting and in development.''
</P>
<P>
   While Malone said he still believes something could happen to
turn around the season and thrust the Dodgers back into playoff
contention, the reality is they are 12{ games out of a postseason
spot with 59 games remaining. The math isn't flattering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see (a deal) happening,'' Johnson said. ``Recently, I
had discussions with Kevin, I always talk with him, about
personnel. In certain areas, especially in the pitching end of it,
unless you get some of it back, (it's tough to part with it).''
</P>
<P>
   So Graziano and Malone and Johnson agree it doesn't make much
sense to make a deal now just for the sake of trying to save an
irretrievable season when the cost may be next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this season hasn't gone according to plan,'' Malone
said. ``If we can get better now, to help us get better for the
future, we'll probably look to improve.''

SAMPRAS ON BRINK OF REGAINING NO. 1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pete Sampras sits on the cusp of tennis history
and talks about a change of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   By beating eighth-seeded Wayne Ferreira of South Africa 4-6,
6-3, 6-3 Friday in the quarterfinals of the Mercedes-Benz Cup at
UCLA, Sampras needs only to beat qualifier James Sekulov in today's
1 p.m. semifinal to take over the world's No. 1 ranking again.
</P>
<P>
   By doing so, he would set the mark for being No.1 for 271 weeks,
breaking Ivan Lendl's record.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here was the second-seeded Sampras on Friday, happy that he
ended a four-match losing streak to Ferreira but talking about how
being No. 1 is no longer as important as it has been the past six
years, when he finished the year No. 1 each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong, I still love being No. 1,'' he said. ``But
to stay No. 1, unfortunately, you have to eat, live and breathe
tennis, especially if you want to stay there. You're dealing with a
lot of factors off the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the year, I got pretty comfortable with what it takes to
be No. 1 .... Earlier this year, I tried to figure out what my
priorities were.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, top-seeded and defending champion Andre Agassi
earned a semifinal berth when his opponent, seventh-seeded Lleyton
Hewitt of Australia, retired with a sprained left ankle with Agassi
leading 5-4 in the first set. Agassi next meets another Australian,
Andrew Ilie, tonight at 7:30.
</P>
<P>
   Small injuries last year started Sampras on his personal
inventory. He missed L.A. last year to have a wart removed from his
foot. He injured his left quadricep in the U.S. Open semifinal loss
to Patrick Rafter. He withdrew from a tournament in Lyon with a
back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year he skipped the Australian Open because playing
the final seven weeks of the 1998 season in Europe to finish No. 1
was too much.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent Davis Cup Sampras played only doubles, yet still
enjoyed the experience of competing for his country. In other
words, enjoy watching Sampras play now because he might not enter
as many tournaments next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play more Davis Cup in the future,'' he said. ``Of
course, the Slams will always be a pinnacle of my year. (But) the
big thing is to play more Davis Cup. In other years, it was hard to
give that commitment to being No. 1 and playing Davis Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   With his future plans firmly set, Sampras went out Friday and
played what he said was his best match against Ferriera, whom he
hadn't beaten since 1995 on clay at Hamburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Although he lost the first set, Sampras felt he was playing
well, charging the net more and getting 59 percent of his first
serves in.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the times we played, that was the best he's played,''
Ferreira said. ``He was more aggressive, chipping and coming in a
lot more, which he never did.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt didn't give himself a chance to catch Agassi. He reached
for a shot but came up short, spraining his ankle in the process.
He stayed down for more than 10 minutes before walking over to the
sideline to get his ankle taped. He tried to hit a few balls in
practice but decided he couldn't continue.
</P>
<P>
   He was to have his ankle X-rayed Friday night at UCLA Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' he said in a statement. ``The injury came
at a really bad time. Hopefully, it will heal in the next couple of
days and be ready for the Canadian Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi said he didn't see Hewitt's injury because, satisfied
Hewitt wasn't going to get the shot, he had turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly didn't think it was a good idea to continue the
match,'' Agassi said. ``You risk yourself to a possible different
injury, let alone injuring something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras continues today against Sekulov, who wants to beat
Sampras so Sekulov's countryman, Rafter, can retain the world's top
ranking for a second week.
</P>
<P>
   As if Sampras needed any more motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for telling me,'' he said. ``I'll go to sleep thinking
about it.''

DAY TRADERS LIVE ON THE EDGE IN CYBERSPACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Tom Pothoff's workday starts at the bleary
hour of 5:30 a.m. His mind and his instincts had better be sharp.
His livelihood depends on it.
</P>
<P>
   Pothoff has about an hour to digest the day's financial news and
decide which way the Wall Street wind is blowing before he hunkers
down for his daily ride on a financial roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   Pothoff earns his living as a day trader, a profession where a
long-term hold on a stock can last all of 45 minutes. Guess wrong,
blink or take a coffee break, and large chunks of cash can vanish
into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when I buy a stock and my heart will just
start pounding,'' Pothoff said Friday after the market had closed.
``There is stress obviously, but it's not like people are ready to
do something drastic. If they had a losing trade, it's all part of
the game. Hopefully you win more than you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a little uncomfortable now for some in this profession
awash in the harsh spotlight of tragedy. Its most notorious
practitioner has become Mark O. Barton, a former day trader who
killed 12 people in Atlanta, including his wife and their two
children, and then killed himself Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nine victims were shot at two day-trading brokerages. The
killings have focused national attention on the high-stakes,
frantic practice of trading stocks online, most of the time from
home but many times from offices across the country just like the
ones Barton ambushed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a relatively new profession, fueled by the speed and access
of the Internet. In it, practitioners try to amass profits by
trading stocks based on minute-by-minute changes in prices. Trades
take seconds, which is how long it can take for small fortunes to
be made and lost even though the price may shift only by pennies.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage industry estimates say individual traders can
sometimes account for up to 25 percent of a day's stock market
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The peaks can be very high.
</P>
<P>
   And the valleys very low.
</P>
<P>
   A letter left behind by Barton suggested he was depressed about
trading losses, police said Friday. Barton, a former chemist, had
lost roughly $105,000 in stock trading in less than two months.
</P>
<P>
   The industry appeared to be aware of the stresses associated
with day trading before Barton went on his killing spree.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the National Association of Securities Dealers
board approved a rule that would require online brokerage services
to screen customers to determine whether they are suited to the
lightning-fast daily trading style.
</P>
<P>
   ``With day trading, there's no quicker way to stare into the
abyss of your soul,'' said Joey Anuff, a San Francisco day trader
and editor of Suck.com, a Web site owned by Lycos that focuses
attention on bad Web sites. ``A day trader's life is always about
the deal they missed or a stock they got stuck with.''
</P>
<P>
   Anuff is writing a book, ``Dumb Money: Confessions of a Day
Trader,'' that he says will be published in September by Random
House. He says that day trading can be a stressful occupation.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to attract people who like being drawn to the edge,
where the abyss can be filled with profits or financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extreme activity,'' Anuff said. ``You have to operate
from a mind set of total confidence without any hesitation. If you
hesitate, you're dead. And you have to face the fact that the
problem is you. You'll never be able to blame your losses on anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can't just log on and start trading.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders typically lease software that facilitates this type
of electronic commerce for about $300 a month. An investment in
high-speed Internet access and powerful personal computers are also
musts.
</P>
<P>
   So is an investment of at least $5,000 in an account with
companies that support electronic day trading.
</P>
<P>
   Pothoff, for example, monitors two computer screens full of
financial information, business news shows and a chat room for day
traders.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, his initial assessment told him the trading day
would not be good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down 18 points below fair value, which meant it was
going to be a pretty bloody day,'' he said, referring to a
calculation day traders use to assess whether the market will be
gaining or losing ground. ``It started off pretty bad and continued
throughout the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Pothoff did not like the signals the market was sending on
Friday, so he did not make any trades. Nevertheless, it was still a
workday filled with a constant rush.
</P>
<P>
   That's a little bit too much excitement for Phillip Soufer. He
tried day trading and didn't like it. Now he's a position trader,
holding onto stocks for a longer period of time than day traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like a few days or a few weeks to be more prepared. It's a
lot more dangerous to day trade because you have to be more precise
with your timing. It's a lot more stressful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stress doesn't bother Abbie Zands. He trades by the minute
and then runs a party rental equipment company after the market
closes.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is a risk. But then that's part of the attraction,
too, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely grates on you,'' he said of day trading. ``You
just treat people around you different depending on how you did
that day. It's hard not to take what you are doing during the day
and displace it on your loved one. But you've got to take
responsibility for your actions and no one else.''
</P>
<P>
   Zands made two trades on Friday. They went the right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a decent weekend,'' he said. &QL;

JOHNSON IS LOOKING AT ARMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers need a left-handed power
hitter, more flexibility on the bench and starting pitching depth
in the organization. But there's little the Dodgers can do to solve
those problems now. Instead they'll look to the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the Dodgers placed Robinson Checo on the
disabled list Friday and promoted Matt Herges. A seemingly
meaningless swap of pitchers that has relevance for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to look at as many arms as I can at the major-league
level,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``You can always use a
good, young arm. I think everybody can use good, young pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not about Herges, 29, joining the starting rotation or
Checo staying in the minors. It's about Johnson understanding the
options he might have heading into next season and what areas the
Dodgers need to attack in the offseason via trades or the
free-agent market.
</P>
<P>
   The non-waiver trade deadline is 9 p.m. today. But the Dodgers
entered their three-game series with Arizona tied for last place
and 11{ games behind the Diamondbacks. They haven't won more than
five straight all season and haven't been at .500 since June 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say (we're) out of it,'' Johnson said. ``But at the
same time, we haven't been able to mount any kind of attack, any
kind of winning streak, so we might as well look at other things
and not remain status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the season ends, the Dodgers will most likely look at
pitchers Mike Judd, Eric Gagne and Ricky Stone. Maybe to add depth
to the bullpen, maybe to show the front office who's available for
spot starts or in-season promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Herges for Checo: Checo allowed one run in five innings
Wednesday but was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a groin
pull and will be eligible to be activated Aug. 13. Herges was
called up from Triple-A Albuquerque and was available in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he's unsure how he'll use Herges, who was 8-3 with
a 4.59 ERA in 20 starts with Albuquerque. The Dodgers don't need a
fifth starter until next Saturday, which means Herges could work
out of the bullpen for a few days before stepping into Checo's
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Herges was a non-roster invitee to big-league camp in spring
training. He's been in the Dodgers' organization since 1992, but
this is his first time with the Dodgers. He spent the past three
seasons bouncing between Albuquerque and Double-A San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm feeling kind of numb,'' Herges said. ``I've
pitched well this season, but my last two starts weren't very good
so I didn't think it would be me.''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Arizona announced right-hander Andy Benes, who is 6-9 with
a 5.30 ERA, will start Sunday's series finale against Chan Ho
Park.... Right-handed reliever Antonio Osuna will undergo Tommy
John surgery in the next few weeks. The recovery time is
approximately one year.... Gary Sheffield has four more years left
on his contract. The length was incorrectly stated in Friday's
paper.

REMAINING ANGELS KEEP ON LOSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The locker to Gary DiSarcina's left was once
occupied by Dave Hollins. To his right was the empty locker of
Randy Velarde. And it made the Anaheim Angels shortstop pause for a
moment Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I've got cooties,'' DiSarcina said.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, though, is well aware of the harsh reality for teams
that have fallen out of the pennant race before the trading
deadline. Teams will trade proven and productive veterans for young
and talented prospects. And in doing that, the front office is
calling this season a wash.
</P>
<P>
   While Hollins was sent away months ago, Velarde and pitcher Omar
Olivares were traded to the Oakland A's Thursday for three
minor-leaguers. Pitcher Chuck Finley could be sent to the Yankees
or Indians any minute now, with the trading deadline coming tonight
at 9 (PDT). Reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa also has drawn interest
from teams.
</P>
<P>
   With all the trade talk, there was plenty of action in the
clubhouse before Friday's night's game between the Angels and
Minnesota Twins. And that was more than the Angels could say about
the game, a 3-1 loss before a fireworks-show-anticipating crowd of
38,319 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Twins pitcher Brad Radke threw a complete-game, seven-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have now lost 13 of their past 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   The only good news for the Angels was that starter Ken Hill went
61/3 innings and allowed only one run and six hits. But all that
means is he is another candidate to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   As for Velarde and Olivares, DiSarcina was sad to see them go,
especially Velarde, his double-play partner. But he added: ``I'm
happy to see them go to a winning team.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Angels are not a winning team really seems to tick off
first baseman Mo Vaughn. Vaughn, who signed a six-year, $80 million
contract and was counted on to put the team over the top, was
animated during a clubhouse conversation that turned the heads of
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have an opinion on (the Velarde/Olivares
trade),'' Vaughn said. ``The main thing this team has to focus on
is to get ready for the first day of spring training.... My concern
is seeing what's left after the season and making sure the
attitude's straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, what's here in February is important. My concern is
not September, it's February. That's when we'll be able to make a
better evaluation.''

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Jim Edmonds left his temporary teammates at
Single-A Lake Elsinore and rejoined his Anaheim Angels teammates
Friday, if only for a day.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds took batting practice in front of Terry Collins to show
his manager his surgically repaired right shoulder is fine. Edmonds
will go back to play for Lake Elsinore tonight at San Bernardino,
then is expected to join the Angels' roster Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After going 0 for 4 in his first game for the Storm on Monday,
Edmonds went 6 for 11 in his next three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Terry and told him I'm ready,'' Edmonds said. ``He
said to play in one more game (tonight) and see how it goes. It's
felt really good, better than I thought it would.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see him hit today,'' Collins said. ``He's much
better than when we left (on the last road trip).''
</P>
<P>
   Though he'll probably be back Sunday, Edmonds probably won't be
in center field for about two weeks. Instead, he'll be the DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a deal with the doctor,'' Edmonds said. ``I could come
back if I don't play the outfield.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels medical staff is more concerned about Edmonds
reinjuring the shoulder playing defense, where he might dive for a
ball or run into a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Greene returns: Replacing Randy Velarde and Omar Olivares _
traded Thursday to the A's _ on the roster were Andy Sheets and
Todd Greene. Greene had been sent to the minors to work on a swing
that has been out of whack, and he hit .243 with five homers and 14
RBI in 19 games while at Triple-A Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets is expected to make some starts at second, but Jeff Huson
started Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Pitcher Mike James, out all season recovering from
reconstructive elbow surgery, will begin a rehab assignment at Lake
Elsinore today. James could be activated in about a week....
Pitcher Tim Belcher (broken right pinky finger) will throw his
second simulated game today and is expected to return to the
starting rotation by next weekend.... Outfielder Matt Luke,
recovering from a strained muscle in his side, injured his wrist
swinging at Lake Elsinore. There is no timetable for his return.

 SOX-BOS  
 YANKEES TROUNCE RED SOX
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Face-saving in the Fens took a flier early for the Red
Sox Friday night, from the moment the Olde Towne Team took the
field against the Yankees and heard boos from a Yawkey Way mob
(33,777) that brought their Bronx cheers with them.
</P>
<P>
   It only got worse from there, as Sox starter Mark Portugal put
his name in the history books by giving up home runs to the first
two Yankee batters, Chuck Knoblauch and Derek Jeter, then added
redundancy to the list of Sox insults by literally falling flat on
his face before the first inning was over.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, too, was the night, as the Sox made two errors in the
second inning, when the Yankees scored four more times, then
surrendered three more runs in the third en route to a 13-3
spanking that dropped Boston back into third place, a half-game
behind Toronto and 7 1/2 games behind the Bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given up leadoff home runs before, but not back-to-back,
right out of the chute,'' said Portugal, who lasted just four outs
in his shortest stint in nearly three years and tied an American
League record when he was taken deep by Knoblauch and Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch hit Portugal's second pitch of the game into the
left-center-field screen for a 1-0 Yankee lead. Jeter, who has
reached base in 98 of the 100 games in which he has played, hit
Portugal's fifth pitch into the center-field bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The home runs by the game's first two batters tied an AL record,
which has been done 25 times in all, three times this season. The
Yankees hadn't done it in 44 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a horse (fertilizer) day at the ballpark,'' said
Portugal, who also did a full gainer off the rubber when his right
foot gave way while he was delivering a pitch to Chili Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``One game, forget about it, and go out and kick Roger's butt
tomorrow _ hopefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's allusion to Clemens was a reminder that the heavy
artillery is still to come Saturday afternoon on national TV, when
the former Sox ace makes his premier appearance in pinstripes on
Yawkey Way.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees may not bear the greatest-team-ever tag they wore
last season, when they won 114 regular-season games, but they're
still on pace to win 99 this season. As if that isn't bad enough
for the We-Hate-New York faction, consider this: The Mets moved
into first place in the National League East Friday night, making
this the latest point in a season the Yanks and Mets have led their
respective divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch had five hits, matching a career high, Jorge Posada
doubled twice and homered, and Scott Brosius had three hits for the
Yankees, who pounded out 16 hits six days after a 21-run, 21-hit
salute against the Cleveland Indians in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had lost two straight in the blast furnace that
doubled as Chicago's Comiskey Park the last two nights, but
recovered behind Hideki Irabu, who surrendered John Valentin's home
run off the Coke bottles and a fly ball by Troy O'Leary misplayed
into a double by left fielder Shane Spencer in the first, then held
the Sox to four hits the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they felt a little cooler tonight than in the
last couple of days,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said, ``but they
seemed a little lighter, a little livelier.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bombers were still showing life during their last at-bat,
when fill-in outfielder Chad Curtis had to be restrained from Sox
reliever Mark Guthrie, who already had taken a bullet for the team
by absorbing a four-run seventh inning, which jacked his ERA to
6.44.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to me, `Why are you taking them, swing at the ball,'
'' Curtis said of his exchange with Guthrie. ``Then he called me a
few choice words.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment, I was more inclined to have him scream in my
face than at the back of my head.''
</P>
<P>
   The night was one long slap upside the head for the Red Sox, who
struck out 12 times against Irabu, the Japanese import who matched
his career high in whiffs. Irabu, who was the beneficiary of last
weekend's onslaught against the Indians, is now 7-0 with four
no-decisions in his last 11 starts.
</P>
<P>
   He was especially tough on Butch Huskey, the new Sox DH, who
made a compelling case against flying back and forth from Seattle
in the span of a day by whiffing three times and popping out in his
final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say that had any effect on my game,'' said
Huskey, as he fastened his seat belt and put his seat in an upright
position after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal could only wish he could pin his night on an excuse
like jet lag. The Sox starter, who has never beaten the Yankees,
lost for the third time this season against the Bombers and sixth
time in his career, the first three losses coming another lifetime
ago, when he was with the Twins over a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   His ego took a further beating in the second, when errors by
Nomar Garciaparra and Trot Nixon led to three unearned runs out of
the four the Yankees scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``My team got me back in it, and I went out there and gave it
back up again,'' Portugal said. ``They did everything they could to
keep us in the game, and I gave it up.''

BIG SECOND HALF BOOSTS SPARKS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The undermanned Utah Starzz, which suited up
just eight players, gave the Los Angeles Sparks a little more
trouble than anticipated Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sparks (15-6) scored 11 unanswered points midway through
the second half to finally shoot down the Starzz 87-77 en route to
their fifth consecutive victory before 5,576 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the prettiest game at first, but once we got started
we were on our way,'' Sparks coach Orlando Woolridge said.
``Gordana (Grubin) had some great 3-pointers at clutch times, and
we had some great individual efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Grubin, who scored 16 points and dished out five assists, made
back-to-back 3-pointers to give the Sparks some breathing room,
66-58 with 6:36 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Utah failed to answer, going scoreless for four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The last-place Starzz (7-14) were clearly at a disadvantage with
leading scorer Natalie Williams out with a foot injury and newly
acquired players Cindy Brown and Korie Hlede in Salt Lake City
getting their physical exams. They were acquired Thursday from
Detroit, in a trade for Utah's Wendy Palmer and Olympia
Scott-Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   But the Starzz didn't look like a depleted team in the first
half. The Sparks were troubled by Utah's defense and trailed 39-37
at the break.
</P>
<P>
   If not for Lisa Leslie's steady work against 7-foot-3 Margo
Dydek, who had 19 points, 11 rebounds and five blocks, the Sparks
would have been in deep trouble. Leslie responded with 24 points,
19 of which came in the first half, along with 10 rebounds and six
steals.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks' Mwadi Mabika added 11 points and 10 rebounds.

PONCIANO MULLS COACHING OFFERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A few weeks from now Ron Ponciano could be
standing on a football practice field in Van Nuys or designing a
defensive scheme for a small school in Kansas. Either way, he isn't
finished with Cal State Northridge, the school that fired him as
head coach July 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going away,'' Ponciano said. ``The truth will come
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano is considering an offer to be the defensive coordinator
at McPherson College, a Division II program in Euclid, Kan. He also
has a standing invitation to be the assistant head coach at Valley
College.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues haven't shied away from Ponciano, who was let go by
CSUN for what the school considered ``serious and substantial''
violations of NCAA rules. He said he isn't sure which job he will
take.
</P>
<P>
   But he is sure he will be vindicated by what he thinks is in the
report, which is expected to be released Wednesday or Thursday.
Ponciano said the school's top two allegations against him are: (a)
As the head coach in 1998, he bought a plane ticket for a recruit;
and (b) he misappropriated state funds when he was the Matadors'
defensive coordinator in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sources within the school said the report, written by internal
auditor Peter Dinauer, is finished. Its findings were planned to be
announced Friday, but representatives of the NCAA have come to
Northridge, sources said, to read the report and conduct their own
investigation, causing the delay.
</P>
<P>
   The CSUN investigation began May 19 when the athletic department
received an anonymous letter detailing several allegations against
Ponciano and offensive coordinator Rob Phenicie. Phenicie resigned
under pressure on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Dinauer, who joined the university May 12, is heading what the
school terms an ``internal inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kearin, a former Matadors assistant, was hired last week as
the interim head coach for this season. Football practice begins
Aug. 10 and the season opener is Sept. 4 at home against Western
Oregon.

BREAST CANCER STAMP RAISES AWARENESS, FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Dianne Feinstein is a U.S. senator representing California.) 
By DIANNE FEINSTEIN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today we celebrate the one-year anniversary of the Breast Cancer
Research Stamp.
</P>
<P>
   This innovative stamp is the first of its kind in our nation's
history that is dedicated to raising funds for a special cause. The
stamp costs 40 cents, with 7 cents devoted to important breast
cancer research programs.
</P>
<P>
   To date, more than 40 million stamps have been sold nationally.
That's $8 million raised for research. In terms of scientific
progress, the money is enough to fund the laboratory work of
roughly 39 cancer researchers for one year to help find a cure for
a disease that afflicts more than 2 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Californians have contributed $1.4 million to research, or 22
percent of the total raised nationally.
</P>
<P>
   If all the stamps printed by the U.S. Postal Service over the
next year are sold, we can raise over $16 million for research. And
when all are sold, the Postal Service promises to print more.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp was the brainchild of Dr. Ernie Bodai, a Sacramento
surgeon and oncologist who has treated thousands of women for the
disease. The idea came to him while writing holiday cards a few
years ago. Ernie then teamed with Betsy Mullen, a tenacious
33-year-old breast cancer survivor, to lobby Congress on behalf of
the stamp. After two years, this idea became a reality, which I was
proud to sponsor in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp has gotten support from the White House, breast cancer
survivors, celebrities and corporate America. It gives the average
citizen an easy opportunity to contribute to a good cause.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is this stamp raising funds to fight a disease that
afflicts one in eight women, it is also raising awareness about the
disease itself. This stamp says to people that further research
dollars are needed to conquer breast cancer, while at the same time
raising the awareness that breast cancer is a real threat.
</P>
<P>
   Today, too many women do not get breast cancer screenings. Of
the more than 2 million Americans living with breast cancer today,
1 million do not know it yet. Since early detection represents the
key to recovery, I hope this stamp will remind every woman to make
an appointment today for the 10-minute test.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer now claims the life of a woman every 12 minutes.
It's the leading killer of women between the ages of 35 and 55 _
women in the prime of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Congress has raised breast cancer research funding
by 600 percent since 1990, additional funding is still desperately
needed. Sadly, Americans now spend more on candles and candle
accessories than on all research by the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the National Cancer Institute could only fund 30
percent of research grant applications _ a decline of 60 percent
since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In light of that, breakthroughs in cancer research have turned
more and more people into cancer survivors than cancer victims.
According to the American Association for Cancer Research, 8million
people are alive today because of cancer research. The bottom line
is that every dollar we can raise will save lives.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, each and every one of us has had a family member
or friend who has been ravaged by breast cancer. I, for one, am
tired of losing loved ones and friends to this terrible disease.
</P>
<P>
   As Karen Hauser from Columbus, Ohio, said, ``The stamps are
beautiful. I'll continue to buy them as long as they are available.
I can't give $100,000 to research, but I use stamps every day.''
</P>
<P>
   I could not agree more. All Americans can now do something
actively and personally to help this cause by purchasing these
stamps. Let's make the second year of the Breast Cancer Research
Stamp even more successful than the first.

REMAINING ANGELS KEEP ON LOSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The locker to Gary DiSarcina's left was once
occupied by Dave Hollins. To his right was the empty locker of
Randy Velarde. And it made the Anaheim Angels shortstop pause for a
moment Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I've got cooties,'' DiSarcina said.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, though, is well aware of the harsh reality for teams
that have fallen out of the pennant race before the trading
deadline. Teams will trade proven and productive veterans for young
and talented prospects. And in doing that, the front office is
calling this season a wash.
</P>
<P>
   While Hollins was sent away months ago, Velarde and pitcher Omar
Olivares were traded to the Oakland A's Thursday for three minor
leaguers. Pitcher Chuck Finley could be sent to the Yankees or
Indians any minute now, with the trading deadline coming tonight at
9 (PDT). Reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa also has drawn interest from
teams.
</P>
<P>
   With all the trade talk, there was plenty of action in the
clubhouse before Friday's night's game between the Angels and
Minnesota Twins. And that was more than the Angels could say about
the game, a 3-1 loss before a fireworks-show-anticipating crowd of
38,319 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Twins pitcher Brad Radke threw a complete-game, seven-hitter.
The Angels have now lost 13 of their last 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   The only good news for the Angels was that starter Ken Hill went
61/3 innings and allowed only one run and six hits. But all that
means is he is another candidate to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Finley is rumored to be going to the Yankees for
pitchers Ramiro Mendoza and Ryan Bradley (Ayala High). And he's
rumored to be going to the Indians for second baseman Enrique
Wilson and pitcher Willie Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Or he might not go anywhere at all.
</P>
<P>
   Finley met with Angels general manager Bill Bavasi after
Friday's game and Bavasi filled Finley in on the latest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy said `It's your decision, but I've got to make sure I
get your market value,' '' Finley said. ``He's going to come to me
and say they've met our demands, now it's up to you, or they didn't
meet my demands, you're staying here.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley told Bavasi his deadline for a deal is 3 p.m. today, not
the league-imposed 9 p.m. (PDT) deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not entertaining anything after that,'' Finley said.
``I've got to get ready to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley is scheduled to start tonight's game against the Twins,
and if he does, he's staying put. Sources close to Finley have
indicated the left-hander is leaning toward staying.
</P>
<P>
   The main sticking point of a potential trade involves a contract
extension. Finley is a free agent at the end of the season and both
the Yankees and Indians are reluctant to part with anything
significant if Finley plans to re-sign with the Angels next season.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, though, won't say whether or not he's open to signing an
extension with Cleveland or New York, joking: ``You're assuming
I'll live that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley and the Angels reportedly have been talking about a
two-year extension worth $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   As for Velarde and Olivares, DiSarcina was sad to see them go,
especially Velarde, his double-play partner. But he added: ``I'm
happy to see them go to a winning team.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Angels are not a winning team really seems to tick off
first baseman Mo Vaughn. Vaughn, who signed a six-year, $80 million
contract and was counted on to put the team over the top, was
animated during a clubhouse conversation that turned the heads of
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have an opinion on (the Velarde/Olivares
trade),'' Vaughn said. ``The main thing this team has to focus on
is to get ready for the first day of spring training. ... My
concern is seeing what's left after the season and making sure the
attitude's straight. For me, what's here in February is important.
My concern is not September, it's February. That's when we'll be
able to make a better evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without Finley, Vaughn seems intent on taking control of
the Angels clubhouse after a season that has blown up in his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of comments made, and the first thing
everybody on the club has to do is worry about themselves and how
they play the game,'' Vaughn said. ``In this clubhouse people need
to stop pointing fingers. Admit your mistakes then go out and play
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of getting involved in things we shouldn't be
getting involved in. We have to concern ourselves with looking in
the mirror and not worrying about what everybody else is doing.''

MECHE, A-ROD RIGHT AT HOME AGAINST ORIOLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Guys like Randy Johnson and Ken Griffey Jr. might have
built the place. But so far, Safeco Field was made for Gil Meche
and Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Working in tandem for the second time in 10 days, the
20-year-old Meche turned in another precocious outing on the mound
Friday while Rodriguez backed him with the ultimate offensive move,
a grand slam. Their efforts added up to a 7-4 Mariners victory over
the Baltimore Orioles before a sellout crowd of 44,931, the club's
eighth full house in nine Safeco games.
</P>
<P>
   A rookie completing his first month in the majors, Meche (2-1)
became the first Mariners pitcher to win twice at the new ballpark.
He went 61/3 innings, scattering five hits, leaving only to break
in a new reliever, not because he was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases full and one out in the fifth, Rodriguez erased a
2-1 Orioles lead by lining one high into the left-field seats, for
his 12th homer of the month and fifth career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   If this all sounds a bit familiar, Meche went seven innings and
notched his first victory while Rodriguez cleared the bases with
another slam to break up a tie game on July 19 at Safeco, their
teamwork leading to a 7-5 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.
Indeed, the replay board works at the new yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might bring it up to him tomorrow, just to give him a
hint,'' Meche said of this two-man trend. ``It's huge. It's a
pretty good feeling when you're down and someone gives you a whole
bunch of runs like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking new ground Friday night was Steve Sinclair. Replacing
Meche, the newly acquired left-handed reliever struck out the first
batter he faced _ as well as the second _ in one inning of work.
Tradition for lefties in the Mariners bullpen this season, as the
since departed Damaso Marte and Allen Watson can attest, has been
to serve up a first-batter homer in their debuts. Or in Marte's
case, a first-pitch homer.
</P>
<P>
   Meche was pulled with one out and one runner on in the seventh.
He could have kept going, having thrown just 100 pitches. But
manager Lou Piniella saw a chance to insert the new guy from the
Toronto organization, an opportunity to settle his insecure
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get Sinclair into the game in a situation to get
the nervousness out, and their lefties were coming up,'' Piniella
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Said Sinclair, ``Being the only left-hander out there, I know I
have to do the job, especially in big games.''
</P>
<P>
   A five-game big-league veteran now, Meche was sharp, throwing a
shutout for the first four innings. He retired his first three
batters in a most unusual way, having each foul out.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie got knocked around a little in the fifth when, with
one out and two runners on, he grooved a 3-2 pitch to Charles
Johnson. The ball sailed over Griffey's head in center field for a
double, hitting the wall on one bounce and giving Baltimore a 2-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was overmatched his first time up against Meche, going
down swinging in the third. He was impressed with the young
right-hander's stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he pitched very well,'' the Orioles catcher said.
``He located his pitches very well. He threw hard. He had a good
slider. He had us down long enough for the bullpen to come in and
close the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Meche survived his fifth-inning peril. The same could not be
said for veteran Orioles reliever Arthur Rhodes in the bottom half
of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing starter Jason Johnson and entrusted with a 2-1 lead
and the bases loaded, Rhodes struck out Griffey on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez worked the Baltimore lefty to a 2-2 count, then
crunched a ball over the hand-operated scoreboard in left. It was
his 24th homer and his club's seventh grand slam this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was actually a pretty good pitch, a fast ball in,''
Rodriguez said, not totally satisfied. ``I was fortunate to put
good wood on it and put it over the fence. I was just hoping it
wouldn't go foul. ... I still have to play better. I've been
playing like a dog lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Not according to the numbers. Despite missing 32 games with a
knee injury, the Mariners shortstop is now hitting home runs more
frequently than Griffey, the American League leader with 33.
Rodriguez's long-ball rate is one every 11.33 at-bats; Griffey is
one every 11.75.
</P>
<P>
   For those who believe in things cosmic, the next tag-team match
at Safeco for Meche and Rodriguez comes against the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays on Wednesday.

   &UR; FOR SUNDAY AMs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Aug. 1:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-DECLINE (Tokyo) _ After a dazzling century in which Japan
emerged on the globe first as a feared military power and then as a
formidable economic one, Japan's influence may be on the wane. The
real problem is not the economic crisis that dominates the
headlines, but a pair of intertwined long-run concerns: The work
force is shrinking fast, and Japan undermines its economy's
productivity by squandering money on life support for moribund
industries and backward regions. By Nicholas D. Kristof. (With
photo, map.)
</P>
<P>
   CONGO-PEACE (Goma, Congo) _ ``Lusaka dead?'' asked Bizima
Karaha, a spiffy rebel alternating between two cellular phones,
then a third served up like soup by a hovering assistant. ``What I
can say is that the Lusaka accord is suffering.'' The accord,
drafted earlier this month, is the closest that the huge African
nation of Congo has come to peace since its most recent rebellion
began a year ago, on Aug. 2, 1998. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-SATELLITE-LIMITS _ Only months after tighter restrictions
on satellite exports took effect, concern is growing within the
aerospace industry and in Congress that the new rules are
entangling manufacturers in red tape, delaying launches and hurting
American satellite makers in foreign markets. By Andrew Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   EAST-EUROPE-MEN (United Nations) _ Across many of the
post-Communist countries of the former Soviet Union and in parts of
Eastern Europe, the ratio of men to women is falling, the United
Nations says in a new report, because men in those countries are
leading shorter and less healthy lives. By Paul Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-NUKES (Washington) _ At first, the questions from his
Chinese hosts seemed harmless enough to George A. Keyworth, a
nuclear scientist. It was 1980, and Keyworth, the chief physicist
at Los Alamos National Laboratory, had traveled to China to lecture
on his research into fusion energy _ not about nuclear weapons. He
was determined to stick to his topic, and not wander into loose
talk about secret information. But in hindsight, as it investigated
leaks of nuclear secrets to China, a congressional committee has
charged that the episode, while inadvertent, bordered on a
negligent breach of security by a senior scientist. By James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PRIVATE-FARMS (Birobidzhan, Russia) _ Here in the Russian
Far East, private farming is a calling only for the brave. Viktor
V. Shubin has made a go of it, but in the neighboring Amur region,
Sergei Kitayev gave up farming after two years and is driving a
taxi, his dreams defeated by an economy that has given little
support to enterprising farmers. By Celestine Bohlen. (With photo,
map.)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REBUILD (Gornje Obrinje, Kosovo) _ The green countryside
here is strangely quiet; the sounds of children only intermittently
pierce the silence. The Yugoslav tanks and Serbian police cars that
intimidated the Kosovo Albanians who live here are gone and NATO's
troops are scarcely felt or even needed. But now that the fighting
is over, Kosovo's Albanians face an uncertain future. By Jane
Perlez. (With photo, map.)
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-PALESTINIANS (Jerusalem) _ Palestinian officials said
Saturday that an Israeli request for changes in the two sides'
latest peace agreement was not acceptable and that the two-week
delay agreed on last week for considering those changes was a waste
of time. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   NANTUCKET-DEVELOP (Nantucket, Mass.) _ Nantucket is an island
under siege. Once treasured by a relative few for its cobblestone
streets, picket fences bathed in icy-pink roses and isolation,
Nantucket is awakening to the din and clash of construction,
threatening both its look and its historic integrity. By Tracie
Rozhon. (With photo and map.)
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY-CAMPAIGN (Des Moines, Iowa) _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley's
presidential campaign headquarters in Iowa is a dark, spartan
affair. The rent: $250 a month. By contrast, Vice President Al
Gore's headquarters is a sprawling, sleek space in a choice
neighborhood. The rent: $4,000 a month. At first glance, the Gore
operation is far more impressive. Yet impressions can be deceptive.
By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI-TRAFFIC (Miami) _ In 1999, people tell traffic horror
stories the way they used to tell crime horror stories of the Miami
of 10 years ago. Gridlock has replaced home invasions and drug
murders on the front pages of South Florida newspapers, as Miami
chokes on its own traffic. By Rick Bragg. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   GA-SHOOT-TRADERS _ The pause in the relentless stream of stock
tips scrolling up the screen in the Internet chat room called
Daytraders was brief, and it was mechanically enforced. But after
the shooting spree last week at two Atlanta firms that specialize
in the rapid-fire buying and selling of stocks known as day
trading, several hundred online investors observed a virtual moment
of silence. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   GUN-ID-SYSTEM _ As cities and states challenge the gun industry
to change its marketing practices, one proposal that keeps coming
up is the creation of a nationwide data base of bullets and
ammunition shell casings. Like a human fingerprint, every gun that
is fired leaves a unique series of marks on a bullet and shell
casing. There is just one problem: Over the last decade, the FBI
and the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have
championed two competing bullet and shell tracing systems and
poured more than $40 million into them. By Barry Meier.
</P>
<P>
   TEST-BAN-TREATY _ In the wake of the Chinese spy scandal,
support is growing in the United States for ratification of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a global accord meant to end the
development of new kinds of nuclear arms. The process of treaty
deliberation and approval had been moribund for nearly two years,
but is now showing signs of life. By William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   HUMAN-GENOME _ The human genome may be as much as four billion
chemical units in length, one-third larger than previously thought,
according to new calculations by Celera, a company that has
undertaken a project to decode the genome by 2001. By Nicholas
Wade.
</P>
<P>
   NYC-SUMMER (New York) _ Across the city, there are parks and
playgrounds, schoolyards and street corners that have always served
as improvised summer retreats, unglamorous, but rich and fully
used. They are the places of summers lived out by children for whom
a fancy day camp is a pipe dream, and by fathers and grandmothers
for whom vacation is an absolutely local experience. By Joe Sexton.
(With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   VA-HOSPITALS (Washington) _ Even after eliminating half of its
hospital beds in the last five years, the federal health care
system for military veterans still spends more than $1 million a
day to operate unneeded hospital buildings, where a dwindling
number of veterans receive care in underpopulated wards, federal
investigators say. By Robert Pear. (With photos.)
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-GUNS (Washington) _ As Americans puzzled over the
latest deadly shooting spree, House leaders appointed
representatives Saturday to a conference between House and Senate
lawmakers on gun control, a long-delayed, pivotal step toward the
enactment of any new restrictions on firearms by this Congress. By
Frank Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-TAX-BREAKS (Washington) _ As House and Senate leaders try to
reach a deal on tax cuts, it is not just the average taxpayer who
has something at stake. A wide array of businesses and industries
is fighting to protect tens of billions of dollars in special
benefits that have made the competing tax cut bills the most
lucrative for business in years. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   RESTAURANT-TAX-LOBBY (Washington) _ Americans are eating out
more often than ever before. And yet, association lobbyists managed
to convince House Republicans this summer that restaurants were
suffering enduring harm from the government's decision in 1993 to
reduce the tax deductibility of business meals, to 50 percent from
80 percent. By Joel Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   WELFARE-REPORT (Washington) _ Thirty-five percent of all adult
welfare recipients were working last year, or actively preparing
themselves for work, and all states met the basic work requirements
of the 1996 welfare law, the Clinton administration said today. By
Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COLUMNS &LR;  (Moving in ``k'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   DOWD-COLUMN _ On Friday afternoon I went to see ``Runaway
Bride.'' It wasn't hooky. It was work. I needed to check out
Richard Gere's portrayal of a hard-boiled New York newspaper
columnist. Pundits, after all, have enough of an image problem
without Hollywood mucking it up further. By Maureen Dowd.

   GIVE GREED A CHANCE
</P>
<P>
   As the three-day happening called Woodstock '99 twanged to a
halt, a handful of revelers went wild, setting fires, looting and
even, by some accounts, raping. So now historians, who delight in
drawing comparisons between generations, can make all sorts of
pronouncements about how society has changed in that nice round
30-year interval since the original bash.
</P>
<P>
   Take those $4 bottles of water _ a sign of ``Commercialstock,''
as one festival-goer put it. But you don't see people burning up
trendy bistros after shelling out $7 for a glass of mediocre wine.
</P>
<P>
   As for attacking ATMs in hopes of a shower of $20 bills _ a
close cousin to the greed blossoming in the Internet economy, or
just plain old greed?
</P>
<P>
   Has life become one big violent video game? The reports of
sexual assaults suggest, grimly, that it has. Has media madness
taken over? Listen to one who was there: ``I can't wait to get home
to watch this on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   And how's this for the prototypical '90s music fan: a
professional body piercer who just happened to bring along a gas
mask.
</P>
<P>
   But to reduce this to basic reasons for the fire this time: it
was wet then, dry now. How does the poem go? ``Some say Woodstock
will end in fire, some say in mud''? Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   What now? Will there be yet another Woodstock, even farther from
the town that happens to bear that name? Or will the turn of the
millennium wash away rerun mania and let the world start fresh?
</P>
<P>
   And considering what they now stand for, who will want to wear
those Woodstock '99 T-shirts, whether stolen or paid for?
</P>
<P>
   _ By HUBERT B. HERRING
</P>
<P>
   A SPOT FOR THE ETHICALLY CHALLENGED
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how this society loves its sports stars! It pays them in a
single day what, say, a good music teacher earns in a year. It puts
them on towering pedestals. It deifies them.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that these athletes start looking in the
mirror and saying: ``Yes, I really am special. The world's petty
rules don't apply to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider parking spaces for the handicapped. Athletes, one might
reasonably think, would be the last to need such perks. Their
physical prowess is so _ gosh! _ awesome that they should be able
to leap over vast parking lots in a single bound.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of football players at the University of California
at Los Angeles apparently started believing a bit too strongly in
their specialness. Nine of them just pleaded no contest to faking
various disabilities, like knee injuries, and then submitting
applications signed by nonexistent doctors to get handicapped
parking permits for the campus.
</P>
<P>
   The people who really deserve those parking permits were not at
all amused. As the players emerged from the Los Angeles courthouse,
protesters in wheelchairs chanted, ``Hey hey, ho ho, parking cheats
must go.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a bogus handicapped permit is a misdemeanor that can mean
six months in jail, so the players got off easy. Each one was
suspended for two games, put on two years' probation, ordered to
pay about $1,500 and must put in 200 hours of community service,
half of it with the Special Olympics. That should get them in shape
to jog across a parking lot.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A KILLING SPREE LEAVES A TRAIL OF BODIES IN GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   A 44-year-old independent stock trader went on a shooting
rampage in Atlanta, killing 9 people at two office buildings before
killing himself as the police tried to arrest him. Another 12
people were injured, 7 from gunshot wounds. The police later
discovered that he had bludgeoned his wife and 2 children to death
in an apartment in suburban Stockbridge.
</P>
<P>
   The trader, Mark Barton, eluded police for five hours after the
shootings, in Atlanta's glitzy Buckhead district. Officers finally
caught up with him in nearby Cobb County. In a note left near the
bodies of his family, Barton vowed to kill ``the people that
greedily sought my destruction.'' He wrote that he regretted
killing his wife, Leigh Ann, and that he killed the children,
Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 8, to spare them the pain of living
without parents.
</P>
<P>
   Barton had been the only suspect in the bludgeoning deaths of
his first wife and her mother six years ago in Alabama. The
authorities there said they never had enough evidence to charge
him.
</P>
<P>
   AN ARREST AND A CONFESSION IN THE YOSEMITE MURDERS
</P>
<P>
   In June, the FBI said the people responsible for the murders of
three female sightseers at Yosemite National Park last February
were safely locked away on other charges.
</P>
<P>
   But after a park naturalist was found beheaded last month, the
man arrested in that case, Cary Stayner, 37, confessed to all four
murders.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is now investigating why Stayner, a handyman at the
motel where the three sightseers were last seen, was dismissed as a
suspect when he was interviewed in February.

even, by some accounts, raping. So now historians, who delight in
drawing comparisons between generations, can make all sorts of
pronouncements about how society has changed in that nice round
30-year interval since the original bash.
</P>
<P>
   Take those $4 bottles of water _ a sign of ``Commercialstock,''
as one festival-goer put it. But you don't see people burning up
trendy bistros after shelling out $7 for a glass of mediocre wine.
</P>
<P>
   As for attacking ATMs in hopes of a shower of $20 bills _ a
close cousin to the greed blossoming in the Internet economy, or
just plain old greed?
</P>
<P>
   Has life become one big violent video game? The reports of
sexual assaults suggest, grimly, that it has. Has media madness
taken over? Listen to one who was there: ``I can't wait to get home
to watch this on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   And how's this for the prototypical '90s music fan: a
professional body piercer who just happened to bring along a gas
mask.
</P>
<P>
   But to reduce this to basic reasons for the fire this time: it
was wet then, dry now. How does the poem go? ``Some say Woodstock
will end in fire, some say in mud''? Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   What now? Will there be yet another Woodstock, even farther from
the town that happens to bear that name? Or will the turn of the
millennium wash away rerun mania and let the world start fresh?
</P>
<P>
   And considering what they now stand for, who will want to wear
those Woodstock '99 T-shirts, whether stolen or paid for?

   A SPOT FOR THE ETHICALLY CHALLENGED
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how this society loves its sports stars! It pays them in a
single day what, say, a good music teacher earns in a year. It puts
them on towering pedestals. It deifies them.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that these athletes start looking in the
mirror and saying: ``Yes, I really am special. The world's petty
rules don't apply to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider parking spaces for the handicapped. Athletes, one might
reasonably think, would be the last to need such perks. Their
physical prowess is so _ gosh! _ awesome that they should be able
to leap over vast parking lots in a single bound.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of football players at the University of California
at Los Angeles apparently started believing a bit too strongly in
their specialness. Nine of them just pleaded no contest to faking
various disabilities, like knee injuries, and then submitting
applications signed by nonexistent doctors to get handicapped
parking permits for the campus.
</P>
<P>
   The people who really deserve those parking permits were not at
all amused. As the players emerged from the Los Angeles courthouse,
protesters in wheelchairs chanted, ``Hey hey, ho ho, parking cheats
must go.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a bogus handicapped permit is a misdemeanor that can mean
six months in jail, so the players got off easy. Each one was
suspended for two games, put on two years' probation, ordered to
pay about $1,500 and must put in 200 hours of community service,
half of it with the Special Olympics. That should get them in shape
to jog across a parking lot.

   A KILLING SPREE LEAVES A TRAIL OF BODIES IN GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   A 44-year-old independent stock trader went on a shooting
rampage in Atlanta, killing 9 people at two office buildings before
killing himself as the police tried to arrest him. Another 12
people were injured, 7 from gunshot wounds. The police later
discovered that he had bludgeoned his wife and 2 children to death
in an apartment in suburban Stockbridge.
</P>
<P>
   The trader, Mark Barton, eluded police for five hours after the
shootings, in Atlanta's glitzy Buckhead district. Officers finally
caught up with him in nearby Cobb County. In a note left near the
bodies of his family, Barton vowed to kill ``the people that
greedily sought my destruction.'' He wrote that he regretted
killing his wife, Leigh Ann, and that he killed the children,
Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 8, to spare them the pain of living
without parents.
</P>
<P>
   Barton had been the only suspect in the bludgeoning deaths of
his first wife and her mother six years ago in Alabama. The
authorities there said they never had enough evidence to charge
him.
</P>
<P>
   AN ARREST AND A CONFESSION IN THE YOSEMITE MURDERS
</P>
<P>
   In June, the FBI said the people responsible for the murders of
three female sightseers at Yosemite National Park last February
were safely locked away on other charges.
</P>
<P>
   But after a park naturalist was found beheaded last month, the
man arrested in that case, Cary Stayner, 37, confessed to all four
murders.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is now investigating why Stayner, a handyman at the
motel where the three sightseers were last seen, was dismissed as a
suspect when he was interviewed in February.

   CLINTON FINED FOR CONTEMPT

   President Clinton settled Paula Corbin Jones' sexual misconduct
lawsuit last year for $850,000, hoping to be done with the sordid

   UMPIRES FLIP-FLOP
</P>
<P>
   When your team loses, it's the umpire's fault. Every baseball
fan knows that. But umpires, perhaps tiring of the whipping-boy
role, decided to lash out. Barred from striking, though, they just
submitted resignations en masse _ certain that this would be a
devastating tactic. But the leagues said, go ahead and quit; we'll
hire replacements. No, wait, the umpires said, we didn't mean it.
But it was too late: a third of the 66 union umpires are out of the
game, though their leader still vows a ``fight to the death.''

   NEW RULES FOR REPORTING SHIPBOARD CRIMES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Facing rising concerns in Congress and elsewhere about crime on
ships, the cruise-ship industry adopted a uniform standard for
dealing with the investigation and reporting of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The International Council of Cruise Lines, which represents 90
percent of the cruise business in the United States, said its
members agreed to report all allegations of onboard crime to the
FBI and other appropriate law enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the cruise ships let victims decide whether to
report crimes, and some victims and their lawyers complained that
there was pressure to cover up assaults. Carnival Cruise lines said
there were 108 accusations of improper sexual conduct by crew
members in a recent 5-year period.

   Relations between China and the United States are at a low, but

engaging China was more productive than isolating it.

   MAKING CANCER GROW
</P>
<P>
   Molecular biologists have finally succeeded in a seemingly
simple task: to turn a normal human cell into a cancerous one. In
the end, it took just three genes, two that are associated with
cancers and a third that allows cells to keep doubling without
limits. Scientists hope to use these precisely engineered human
cancer cells to find better ways to detect and treat cancer.

   CELEBRATION, Fla. _ The start of the school year here is just a
few days away, so it was no surprise that there was a line of
parents at the Celebration School office the other day. But the
reason for the line was: They were queueing up to withdraw their
children.
</P>
<P>
   When Celebration School first opened three years ago, some of
the same people had lined up to enroll their children in the
ballyhooed educational gem designed by top experts from across the
country. It was to be a world-class institution that would take
children from kindergarten through 12th grade in the highly planned
brave new town created here by Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   The school, at the literal and figurative center of the town,
was to use the most advanced educational methods. And the plans
even called for an adjoining teaching academy to share the
innovations with educators nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But as the beginning of the fourth school year approaches on
Aug. 6, administrators, teachers and even executives of Disney's
Celebration Co. are being whipsawed by turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the families most deeply involved in the school have
transferred their children to other schools or even packed up and
left town. Among them are the president of the Parent-Teacher
Association and her immediate predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration has two primary causes. Some people are fed up
with the potpourri of progressive methods; few textbooks are used,
for instance, and, at first, no grades were given. Others are
leaving because they believe the school is pulling back from that
progressive approach and the innovations that drew them to
Celebration in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the sometimes contradictory motives offers a
lesson in what can happen when high-minded educational theory
collides with the expectations of parents and the realities of
public schools in Florida, a state that ranks near the bottom in
most measures of educational quality.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, through its Celebration Co., is developing this town,
about 20 miles southwest of Orlando, as an alternative to the
isolation of suburban sprawl. Since the first residents moved in
three years ago, the town has grown to more than 2,000. Most are
drawn by the small-town feel, which includes tree-lined sidewalks,
ample parks, turn-of-the-century architecture and a convenient town
center.
</P>
<P>
   Celebration School is vital to the cozy atmosphere _ and it's a
big part of the draw _ but there is nothing old-fashioned about the
school. Although it is public and part of the Osceola County school
district, the school was designed largely by education experts
brought in by Disney from leading universities, including Harvard,
Auburn and Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``By bringing in experts from places like Harvard and other
places and blending their theories with real-world practices, we
began to think that there would be a vision of a public school that
would be a lighthouse for new ideas,'' said Don Killoren, the
former general manager of Celebration Co., which is developing and
operating the town for Disney.
</P>
<P>
   In brainstorming sessions over two years, long before ground was
broken, the experts came up with the kindergarten-through-12th
grade approach, something rarely seen these days. This, they said,
would provide continuity for students, teachers and families. And
resources could be shared among the grades. For instance, an
excellent high school teacher might be available occasionally to
work with bright children from lower grades.
</P>
<P>
   Classrooms are as big as 5,000 square feet to accommodate the
multi-age groupings that theorists like Harvard's Howard Gardner
say promote better individual learning. The age range is fairly
narrow in the upper grades, but classrooms of up to 100 students
serve children from kindergarten through fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, there were no letter grades. Instead students
and parents were provided with ``authentic assessments,''
individualized evaluations of their children's strengths and
weaknesses. Standardized tests were replaced by interdisciplinary
projects designed by the students themselves, with portfolios, not
report cards, as a record of their work. Computers and other
technology took the place of textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Classroom schedules were flexible so students could work at
their own pace. Even the language reflected the progressive
education theory. Teachers are called ``learning leaders'' and
students are ``learners.'' They meet not in classrooms but
``neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of these concepts have been tried in one form or another at
progressive schools, but had never been used all at once in a
brand-new school. In one of the early planning sessions, Robert
Peterkin of Harvard had cautioned that it would take years for
everything to work smoothly. ``I would just urge Disney to realize
that there will be ups and downs, that this is a long haul,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He proved prescient. The school opened in the fall of 1996 in
temporary quarters, with about 200 students and a handful of
teachers. The adjustment was difficult for parents and teachers
alike, but there was always the promise of how well it would go the
next year when everyone moved into the new building.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, nearly 800 students started school in the
new building, but many of the problems remained. Parents complained
about the lack of homework and the inability to track progress
without grades and tests. The unstructured classes confused some
parents and students. Teachers struggled with the burdens of
multi-age classrooms and working without a written curriculum, all
under the intense scrutiny of worried parents and the national
media.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1998, a handful of people had pulled their
children out. They felt their children couldn't afford to wait
until everything worked smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Others banded together and sought changes, with some success.
Grades were instituted for the high school, largely to help
students get into colleges, where portfolios are seldom part of the
application process. Textbooks were brought in to augment the
technology. More structure was imposed on class schedules.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The compromises brought a dash of real-world practicality to the
ivory tower theories. The simple passage of time helped people
adjust and adapt to the new methods. As the school year ended last
May, the controversy seemed to have simmered down. Certainly some
parents were still dissatisfied and a few decided to leave, but
most appeared to sense progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graduation for me last May was just a real high point because
I felt people were finally beginning to feel at home,'' said Dot
Davis, the director of Celebration School.
</P>
<P>
   But then came a bombshell. Officials announced in July that the
kindergarten-through-high school concept would be abandoned, and a
2,000-student regional high school would be built in another part
of town. The reasons were economic, not educational. Faced with
overcrowding and a sparse budget for construction, the Osceola
County school district had struck a deal with Celebration Co.,
which would donate 50 acres for the high school. The plan would
save the district $10 million. And it would save Disney the cost of
building more schools as Celebration grows to its projected
population of 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mekdeci, Celebration Co.'s liaison officer with the
school district, said the company will spend about $25 million on
the high school and on expansion of the existing school, which will
serve elementary students.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many parents felt betrayed. After three years of fighting
for progress in the innovative community school, they were facing a
return to what they considered the most traditional of education
plans, the huge regional high school.
</P>
<P>
   School officials have tried to mollify parents by promising to
maintain the progressive curriculum through a ``school within a
school'' at the future high school. In its contract with the school
district, Celebration Co. included language specifying that the
district would adhere to the initial philosophy of the school.
</P>
<P>
   The departures do not amount to a stampede, but the school has
not yet compiled figures on the number of students leaving. And
those who are leaving have a myriad of reasons beyond the school.
In many ways, the departures represent a normal shake-out in any
new venture, particularly in a new town where people came with
expectations of a perfect life.

not yet compiled figures on the number of students leaving. And
those who are leaving have a myriad of reasons beyond the school.
In many ways, the departures represent a normal shake-out in any
new venture, particularly in a new town where people came with
expectations of a perfect life.

   It used to be easier to spot the telltale signs of a revolution
in the making. There were the Molotov cocktails, the
placard-bearing protesters, the fiery speeches, the subversive
tapes made by shadowy underground leaders with ski hoods and
thrilling stage names. If and when they succeeded, revolutionaries
often tightened their grip on power through the mass media: the
heroic movies, stirring music raining down from communal
loudspeakers, television news cut and tailored to suit the regime.
</P>
<P>
   But now China, home of the very visible Long March and the
agit-prop film, followed by the big-character poster and the
Goddess of Democracy, has been caught off guard by a vast, silent,
virtually invisible movement (if not exactly a revolution) that
came together not on the streets but on the Internet. Its
distinguishing activity is collective deep-breathing. Its ideology,
if it can be called that, includes the notion that Buddhist-style
concentration can cultivate ``supernormal'' powers. Its leader, Li
Hongzhi, is a former office clerk who now lives in New York. Its
tens of millions of members appear to dress like the white-collar
middle class people they are.
</P>
<P>
   The panicked reaction by the Chinese government _ which in
recent weeks banned the movement known as Falun Gong and sent 1,200
state employees who were members to that Asian communist
mind-cleanser, re-education, is perhaps even more startling than
the movement itself. It demonstrates in a flash of instant history
that totalitarians, already flummoxed by the fax machine and the
cellular phone, may be facing the biggest high-tech challenge of
all in the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the first time that the Internet's been used in
China in a way that's been threatening to the government,'' noted
Elizabeth Economy, senior fellow for China at the Council on
Foreign Relations. She said that the China Democracy Party, whose
leaders were arrested last year, was found to have used the
Internet to organize across the country. ``The thing that was so
threatening was certainly not the number of people, but rather that
this was inter-provincial, that in over two-thirds of Chinese
provinces, the China Democracy Party was able to establish
branches. And this was explicitly political in the way that Falun
Gong is not. The China Democracy Party still exists. It's still
there, and it can emerge at any time because of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's power to change behavior, from consumer buying
habits to self-education, self-diagnosis and new directions in
leisure activity, is well understood in the West. Its networking
power has been used extremely effectively by low-budget civic and
political organizations in fields as diverse as environmental
protection and international criminal law.
</P>
<P>
   But it has often been assumed in industrial countries that
access to computers and the Internet was limited to such small
elite groups in the developing nations that there would be little
public impact in the near future. Experts have focused on just the
opposite trend: that developmental gaps between the people of rich
and poor nations, whatever their political systems, would only
widen catastrophically in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came the China Democracy Party and, now, the much
bigger Falun Gong with tens of millions of members; they prove that
all it takes is an elite that can motivate the masses to give the
one-party state a scare. It is worse still for totalitarians when
those citizens with access to computers draw on old traditions and
religions to broaden the appeal of troublesome sects or cults.
</P>
<P>
   In societies accustomed to sharing a still-rare technological
tool, one computer (like one village television receiver or a
communal phone) can serve many people, especially if they are
hungry for the information being provided. And to a totalitarian
state, the Internet is a double fright because it can be
simultaneously intensely private and endlessly public, a terror
because it operates unseen at both levels. Had 10,000 Falun Gong
supporters not suddenly appeared as if by magic in April outside
the private residence compound of the Chinese leadership in
Beijing, where they proceeded to conduct their peaceful meditative
exercises, who would have known the breadth of the movement's
reach?
</P>
<P>
   This is a profoundly disturbing discovery for China or any
country where there are still unsettled and potentially dangerous
political questions about the pace and direction of modernization.
Most governments are aware of the need to liberalize the flow of
information in order to attract international business and to
secure a place in the global economy. International lending
organizations are demanding data once withheld by secretive
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government has made the decision that it wants to
continue to advance information technology,'' said Ms. Economy.
``They recognize the challenges that it is going to pose for them,
but they think that it is too important to their economic
modernization to stop. What they are trying to do obviously is to
control it.''

   But to counter the threat, the government is still falling back

through the Internet?

<P>
   Re-education, a Maoist method of mind control also recently
resurrected widely in Tibet, is now as out of date as the doctored
newsreel or the propagandistic ``documentary'' used by fascists and
communists alike to drum up pride in the state and its ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Few countries can opt out of the technological revolution,
though even the United States sees a need to police it in order to
protect national security. Only a regime like Saddam Hussein's in
Iraq, which really wants only to sell oil, not establish a modern
business environment, can enforce a ban on Internet use under a
pervasive reign of terror. In any case, international sanctions
have reduced Iraq's telephone service to a ludicrous level, cutting
off until very recently those who might have tried to evade
restrictions in their hunger for information from the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam, clinging to a communist political-control mindset, has
been ambivalent on the issue of technology without borders. India,
a democracy and a software exporter, tried at first to monopolize
Internet connections but gave up under public pressure for better
services.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in Singapore, where one party has dominated
politics ruthlessly, but where educated people are recognized as
the nation's most valuable natural resource (and foreign companies
are welcomed), Internet access has been made simple.
</P>
<P>
   When historians look back on the latter part of the 20th
century, they may be tempted in the short term to see it as an era
that rendered Orwell passe, an age when exploding technology ended
the possibility of totalitarian thought control _ at least until
dictators or new mind-closing movements devise new methods of
isolating people. There are already fears that racist hate groups
or new age religious cults with authoritarian or apocalyptic
tendencies are getting ahead of the deprogramming organizations
that try to rescue members trapped in mind-altering sects. But on
balance, many experts would bet on more opening of minds through
interconnectedness.
</P>
<P>
   In the Muslim world, the use of mass communications _ including
the Internet as well as a new generation of smuggled tapes and the
open discussion encouraged by Qatar's pioneering Al-Jazira
satellite television network _ is aiding a significant if still
disparate movement for re-examination of the basic precepts and
writings of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result is a collapse of earlier, hierarchical notions of
religious authority based on claims to the mastery of fixed bodies
of religious texts,'' said Dartmouth anthropology professor Dale
Eickelman in June in the 1999 Templeton Lecture on Religion and
World Affairs at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in
Philadelphia. ``Quite simply, in country after country, government
officials, traditional religious scholars and officially sanctioned
preachers are finding it very hard to monopolize the tools of
literate culture. The days have gone when governments and religious
authorities can control what their people know, and what they
think.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is probably worth remembering that the
early totalitarians based a lot of their strategy on mastering what
was then cutting-edge communications technology. Manipulating film
images and broadcasting propaganda were essential to their efforts
to imprison rather than liberate people's imaginations. So their
heirs in China may be right to have a special fear of a new, barely
understood medium like the Internet _ and of any organization
clever enough to master this newest technology.
</P>
<P>
   And for the West, the extraordinary success that the Falun Gong
has had with cyberspace challenges any optimism that the Internet
will promote only rational, enlightened, open-minded patterns of
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Accessible communications, Eickelman and others say, foster the
growth of civil society and strengthen dissent in places like Iran
or Egypt. But in Muslim nations, as almost everywhere in the world
at the century's end, there is still a race on between the forces
of liberalizing change and those of reactionary fundamentalism,
between those who would expand tolerance and those who preach hate,
between the agents of mind control and advocates of a free exchange
of political ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to remember that the Internet can serve
government's purposes, too,'' said Ms. Economy. ``It's not always
going to be a force for positive change from our perspective.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even after eliminating half of its hospital beds in
the last five years, the federal health care system for military
veterans still spends more than $1 million a day to operate
unneeded hospital buildings, where a dwindling number of veterans
receive care in underpopulated wards, federal investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Veterans Affairs receives more than $17
billion a year to provide health care to veterans, but spends
one-fourth of the money caring for the 4,700 buildings at its
medical centers around the country, the investigators said. Forty
percent of the buildings are at least 50 years old, and many are
listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators said that if the government shut down some
of the buildings, it could use the money to provide more health
care to more veterans in outpatient clinics and at private
hospitals closer to their homes. Admissions to veterans hospitals
have fallen sharply because the number of veterans is declining and
care is shifting from hospital wards to outpatient clinics.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress is moving to make it easier for the Department of
Veterans Affairs to close unneeded hospitals, the agency shows
little interest in doing so, and veterans groups, one of the more
powerful lobbies in Washington, are resisting.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
said in a recent report that it might actually be in the interest
of veterans to close some hospitals because that would free money
to enhance other health care services for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., chairman of the health subcommittee
of the Committee on Veterans Affairs, said, ``We should be taking
care of veterans, not buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Fla., said the department was
``shortchanging the delivery of health care services so it can heat
empty, obsolete buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans groups see the hospitals as a national asset that must
be preserved, a lifeline for veterans suffering from severe
illnesses and injuries. They say veterans have earned the right to
care. In a letter to Congress last week, Steve A. Robertson,
legislative director of the American Legion, said his organization
``does not believe there are any unneeded VA facilities'' and
``does not believe that any strong case has been made to close one
VA medical center.''
</P>
<P>
   The veterans department operates the nation's largest health
care delivery system, with 172 hospitals, 132 nursing homes, 73
home health care programs and more than 650 outpatient clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The department's real estate includes two sophisticated teaching
hospitals just six miles apart in downtown Chicago; tiny hospitals
with fewer than 20 beds in Missouri and Pennsylvania; and a big
medical center with 100 buildings in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,600 buildings, more than one-third of the total, are so
old that they are formally listed or eligible for listing on the
National Register of Historic Places, a distinction that requires
the government to protect their historic character when making
alterations. Some were military forts or barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hospital sites, with more than 50 buildings, look
like small towns or college campuses. Of the 4,700 buildings, fewer
than 1,200 actually provide medical care to veterans. Some of the
buildings are empty. Some are used as warehouses, engineering
shops, laundries, firehouses or boiler plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are spending zillions of dollars to keep up vintage 1930s
buildings that are not designed to provide modern health care,''
said Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer, who was undersecretary of Veterans
Affairs for five years, until June 30, and is now the department's
chief consultant on health care. ``We probably have 30 hospitals
with a daily census of 20 to 40 patients. When you get down to a
census that low, the hospital is incredibly expensive to maintain,
and the quality of care suffers. If you have a heart attack, you
don't want to go to a hospital that last saw one six months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Kizer has orchestrated radical changes in the system, which
serves 3.6 million of the nation's 25 million veterans each year.
He forced hospitals into regional health care networks, slashed
hospital admissions, emphasized outpatient care and shifted money
away from the Northeast to Sun Belt states in the South and the
West, where many veterans now live.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen P. Backhus of the General Accounting Office, said
the transformation of the veterans health care system ``appears to
be losing momentum'' as the agency postpones tough decisions about
closing hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech to the American Legion, Togo West, the
secretary of Veterans Affairs, said: ``We are closing no medical
centers this year. We have no plans to close any medical centers
next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Most veterans hospitals, Backhus said, already have ``excess
inpatient capacity,'' and the department will probably need only
10,000 hospital beds in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While many veterans with active military service are potentially
eligible for some VA medical care, most of those who receive such
benefits have either service-connected disabilities or low incomes.
About 90 percent of veterans have other health insurance and seek
medical care elsewhere. Many veterans say they find it difficult to
get into the VA health care system. Veterans groups complain that
the government has imposed restrictions and limited care to save
money. Some veterans see VA care as inadequate, inconvenient or
inaccessible. Still others do not know they are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the number of military personnel has been
declining since the end of the Cold War. The number of veterans is
expected to drop by 36 percent, to 16 million, by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The House committee recently approved a bill that would make it
easier for the secretary of Veterans Affairs to close obsolete,
inefficient hospitals and use the money saved to build outpatient
clinics or upgrade other medical services to veterans. The bill
would also make it easier for the department to keep money from the
sale or lease of its property.
</P>
<P>
   In a week or two, the full House is expected to consider the
bill, which has bipartisan support. The Senate is working on
similar legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The number of hospital beds in the veterans system has declined
by 55 percent, to 23,850 today from 53,082 in 1994, while the
number of outpatient visits to clinics and hospitals increased 39
percent, to 35 million last year from 25.2 million in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In some markets, VA hospitals and clinics compete with one
another to serve a rapidly declining population of veterans. Many
veterans hospitals are near private hospitals that also have unused
beds. The government is allowed to buy care for veterans at such
hospitals, but has used this option to only a limited degree.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala., said that efforts to close veterans
hospitals have been opposed by labor unions, local elected
officials, members of Congress and medical schools that use the
hospitals for teaching and research.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Thomas, a spokesman for the American Legion, said, ``Those
who sacrificed for freedom should not have to sacrifice health
care.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another group, Paralyzed Veterans of America, has expressed
concern that the closing of hospitals would damage the government's
ability to care for veterans with spinal cord injuries. The VA
pioneered the treatment of such injuries, but Richard B. Fuller,
legislative director of the organization, said, ``These specialized
services are in jeopardy'' because they cannot easily be provided
in outpatient clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Many health care experts see a surplus of hospital beds in the
Chicago area, which has four veterans hospitals. The General
Accounting Office says the government could save $20 million a year
and still meet the needs of veterans if it closed one.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel H. Winship, dean of the School of Medicine at Loyola
University in Chicago, said: ``Chicago does not need four VA
medical centers. It could do well with two or, more optimally, with
three.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In theory, the two hospitals six miles apart in downtown
Chicago, Lakeside and West Side, are being ``integrated'' under a
single management team. But Winship said there was still ``a great
deal of duplication of medical services,'' in part because medical
schools were reluctant to combine training programs.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans hospitals are affiliated with 107 medical schools
across the country and have provided training to more than half of
the nation's doctors. They have conducted important research on
AIDS, cancer and hundreds of other topics.
</P>
<P>
   But Kizer said the medical schools had been ``a big obstacle''
to change at VA hospitals because ``they have a difficult time
recognizing that most health care will be provided in an outpatient
setting in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The first VA hospital closing in decades came about not because
of farsighted health planning, but because of an earthquake. The
department closed a medical center in Martinez, Calif., and decided
not to build a replacement hospital. Instead, it established a
full-service outpatient clinic and signed contracts with private
hospitals to care for veterans closer to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency also continues to operate small hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   William P. Cockerill, director of resources at the VA Medical
Center in Poplar Bluff, Mo., said his hospital had 16 beds, down
from 225 in 1990. Laurie Tranter, a spokeswoman for the Department
of Veterans Affairs, said the agency was operating medical centers
with just eight hospital beds in Butler, Pa., 17 beds in Iron
Mountain, Mich., and 25 beds in Bath, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, auditors say, the department spends $35 million a
year to maintain vacant space in various buildings.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTUCKET, Mass. _ On Orange Street, a winding thoroughfare in
the historic Old Town, carpenters are gutting a 19th-century
federal house. They have stripped off the original plaster walls
and jacked up the well-worn wide floorboards, replacing them with
freshly sawed lumber. The rat-a-tat-a-tat of a nail gun rips
through the salt-swept air.
</P>
<P>
   Near the town's old windmill, a 1950s bungalow has been
demolished and a house three times its size is rising, almost as
wide as its site. Behind it, a new guest house has knocked out an
old apple tree.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, the Baptist Church, which has been without a
steeple since the early 1960s, is about to get a new one from
Sprint Communications _ designed to hide the company's cell-phone
antenna inside. Some older citizens argued that the steeple should
be wood, but the town approved fiberglass, which Sprint said would
transmit a better signal.
</P>
<P>
   Nantucket, an idyllic, mist-covered island 30 miles out at sea,
is under siege. Once treasured by a relative few for its
cobblestone streets, its picket fences bathed in icy-pink roses and
its isolation, Nantucket is awakening to the din and clash of
construction, threatening both its look and its historic integrity.
Wealthy visitors who crave a piece of its weathered charm are
buying up houses and ripping them apart, on a scale never seen here
before _ often with the aid of loopholes in the town's laws.
</P>
<P>
   That may come as a surprise to people who have not visited
lately or to those who believe that Nantucket is protected by the
strictest preservation guidelines _ 184 pages _ in the country. And
it is true that the town prescribes only eight historic paint
colors for doors. But it is also true that landowners can shoehorn
a second house onto their quarter-acre lot _ and that is exactly
what dozens of people are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the pace is frightening,'' said Eugenie Voorhees,
chairwoman of Nantucket's Historic District Commission, the agency
charged with protecting the island's landmark houses but which
seems powerless to stop many of the changes here. ``We had the
lesson of the Hamptons. We had the lesson of Cape Cod. And we still
got it wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Big money is arriving on the island in private planes and
100-foot yachts, paying prices that even real estate agents never
dreamed of: In the last decade, the price of the average antique
house near Main Street has soared from $350,000 to close to $2
million, an increase three times greater than for similarly
well-located houses in the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning, the nine-seater Cessnas take off from Hyannis,
bearing carpenters with tool belts; one architect estimates that
300 workers arrive every summer workday on ferries and planes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nantucket has always been a blue-chip kind of place, it
was a kind of seedy blue-chip place, where the money was so old it
was brittle, and very, very quiet. Homeowners often did not bother
to paint until they saw the bare wood on the clapboards; autumn
clematis clambered rundown fences; old buoys piled up in front of
ramshackle wharf dwellings. Most visitors rode bicycles; if they
stayed all summer, they brought over a rusty Jeepster.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nantucket's cobblestone streets are clogged with Mercedeses
and Range Rovers. The Hub, the town's newspaper shop, displays
racks of Town and Country magazines showing recent arrivals like
Arie L. Kopelman, president of Chanel, on his tidy brick path,
wearing Nantucket Red sailing pants with Belgian shoes _ footwear
rarely seen near a sailboat. His wife, Coco, is seen clutching a
tiny Nantucket basket.
</P>
<P>
   Up on Cliff Road, where vintage cottages are knocked down almost
as soon as they go on the market, the fashion designer Tommy
Hilfiger two years ago paid $4.6 million for a house with views of
Nantucket Sound. As a sign of how much things have changed, the
Hilfigers are being applauded for not demolishing it.
</P>
<P>
   On- and off-islanders debate whether the development is worse in
the Old Town or outside it, amid the rugosa rose and heather, and
some prominent urban planners say the added density in town is a
natural evolution and even adds to the charm. Robert D. Rivers,
administrator of Nantucket's Historic District Commission, said
that roughly 15 to 20 antique houses were demolished or gutted each
year, out of 2,200 historic structures on the island, ``and that
puts a sizable dent in the resources.'' Many are gutted to
accommodate air conditioning or to create today's enormous
kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gut rehabs are beginning to take out the structure of so many
houses,'' said William R. Klein, Nantucket's first director of
planning and now the research director of the American Planning
Association. ``You're losing a part of the historical integrity of
the building. It's a real important connection with the generation
that lived before us. It's very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nantucket Building Department says the number of building
permits has stayed the same over the last three years. ``But what's
changed _ and it doesn't show up in any statistics _ is the scale
of the construction, and the dollar amounts,'' said Steve Butler, a
building inspector. ``We've been crazed trying to monitor things.''
</P>
<P>
   Nantucket's design guidelines were written in 1967, and cover
only new construction: roof slopes, materials and the shape of new
skylights and dormers. In the late '60s, and even during the
guideline's revision four years ago, the town fathers did not
envision the destruction of the old structures built before the
middle of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The goal for the Old Town of Nantucket, the guidelines read, is
``to preserve as unchanged as possible the old structures built
before the middle of the 19th century in their original settings
and conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a kinder, gentler time,'' Ms. Voorhees said. ``People
didn't think about pushing the envelope. Now it's a runaway
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission has the power to prevent demolition _ but not
interior renovation _ of listed historic buildings. But new
homebuyers have found loopholes: After they have gutted the inside,
they just keep going, often claiming that the beams and floor
joists were rotten.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the commission filed suit in Nantucket District
Court, charging the owners of one house with effectively
demolishing their 100-year-old farmhouse. ``They claim it's a
renovation,'' Ms. Voorhees said, ``but there's only four boards
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem could be the way the commission is set up.
Most historic boards are appointed with slots for preservation
experts, while Nantucket's commission may be the only elected
historic board in the country, and its members are not always
up-to-date on preservation strategies, Rivers said. Altogether, he
said, the commission's ``tools are just not adequate to deal with
this new phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone rues the changes in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an Italian hill town: full of life and very
walkable,'' said Robert Davis, founder of Seaside, the Florida
Panhandle resort town whose Main Street is partly modeled on
Nantucket's.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Andres Duany, the noted town planner who is a
leading proponent of ``new urbanism,'' a model of suburban design
based on principles of traditional towns, say they worry more about
the outskirts of town, where development is so intense that a new
shingle-style villa was built, speculatively, in front of a giant
water tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably going to ask $3 million,'' said Curtis
Barnes, of Nantucket Real Estate. ``You've got to go with progress
but then there's a time when you say `Hell, no.' But I've never
heard `Hell, No.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, two of the town's most prominent summer residents
Boston architect Graham Gund and Max Berry, a high-powered
Washington lawyer, founded the Preservation Trust of Nantucket.
Berry, who who has been coming to the island for 30 years, said he
had become frustrated with the town's bureaucracy and its elected
historic commission.
</P>
<P>
   Some islanders, however, say that the commission did right by
Berry in approving his new 6,000-square-foot Victorian replica at
the end of Brant Point, which replaced a smaller
turn-of-the-century beach house. Berry founded the Preservation
Trust right afterward, and to some it appeared as if he decided to
preserve the island after he got to build what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   One of the focuses of the trust is on promoting deed
restrictions that protect historic interiors. Under the trust's
program, the homeowner agrees to restrict changes to the property
in perpetuity, and also donates money to pay for the inspections
necessary to oversee such restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   But the value of a house is diminished by the restriction, and
in the last two years, only two people have signed up.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to blame the property owners for the rush to
construct. But the problem is not the millionaires, argued
architect Hugh Newell Jacobsen, who has designed a half dozen
houses here. ``The town fathers have got to change the zoning if
they don't like these houses.''
</P>
<P>
   They tried to do just that two years ago, when townsfolk voted
down a moratorium on houses more than 3,500 square feet. And now,
even development critics here point out that Nantucket already has
50 percent of its undeveloped acreage in conservation easements and
land banks.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody here is eager to sell out.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that couple,'' said Curtis Barnes, the real estate agent,
pointing out a gray-haired man and woman parking their bicycles in
front of their immaculately groomed and perfectly located North
Main Street clapboard cottage.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always walking up to them and offering them
millions,'' he said. ``But they just keep saying no.'' He paused,
and smiled proudly. ``See, we're not  &UR; all &LR;  heathens.''

BRADLEY POSES A QUIET THREAT TO GORE'S RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, N.H.)  (js) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley's presidential
campaign headquarters in Iowa, which he opened here last week, is a
dark, spartan affair whose only adornments are a few stray
basketballs signed by the former star of the New York Knicks. The
rent: $250 a month.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Vice President Al Gore opened his campaign
headquarters two months ago, a sprawling, sleek space in a choice
neighborhood here with cool gray decor and state-of-the-art
computers. The rent: $4,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the Gore operation is far more impressive, and
has double the staff members. Yet impressions can be deceptive.
Bradley is assembling a staff of veterans, and husbanding his
resources so vigilantly that Rob Tully, the Iowa Democratic
chairman, said no one should doubt that the former senator poses an
unmistakable challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is a race here,'' Tully said. ``I would probably
give the advantage to Gore right now in terms of organizing. But
the reality is Bradley's done a great job catching up to the vice
president. I told Bill Bradley that he could win the Iowa caucuses.
He could.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a common refrain, not only in battleground states like
Iowa and New Hampshire but among political players in Washington:
The Bradley campaign is no fly-by-night insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Methodically and with quiet discipline, Bradley and his aides
are assembling an organization that is far more sophisticated about
presidential politics _ and more flush with money _ than those run
by past candidates who sought to topple a front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore is still the heavy favorite for the nomination, and
has an overwhelming lead in most early polls, Bradley is now viewed
as a plausible alternative by the Democratic establishment _ and a
contender who, at the very least, will force the vice president
into a costly and possibly bloody battle for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's operation is stocked with veterans of Democratic
campaigns who say they have learned from the mistakes of the past
and are determined not to repeat them. Already, they have begun
aggressive efforts to build state organizations and put their
delegates on slates in New York and other states where it is a
painstaking process that has eluded many candidates in the past.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday in New Hampshire, for example, Bradley led more than
200 volunteers in a door-to-door drive to meet and identify
potential supporters in the state's primary. Such an effort is
highly unusual this early, especially for a candidate who is not
the front-runner. Many of the volunteers were recruited on the
Internet, which the Bradley campaign is using as an organizing
tool. In all, the campaign said 500 Bradley volunteers knocked on
the doors of 35,000 houses in New Hampshire last week.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the dexterity of the Bradley operation is
that officials of the AFL-CIO said that Bradley's energetic,
behind-the-scenes intervention had helped persuade leaders of the
politically powerful federation not to make an early endorsement of
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has devoted so much energy to courting labor
that it was practically a given that he would win an early
endorsement from the federation, beginning with the recommendation
by executive committee next month. But now, AFL-CIO officials say,
the committee's vote has been put off.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's endorsement of Gore is still likely. But the delay plays
into the Bradley strategy of undermining the notion that Gore's
nomination is inevitable _ and gives the campaign precious time to
cultivate union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like Bradley's any better on trade than Gore is,''
said Steve Rosenthal, political director of the AFL-CIO ``But
Bradley has been working this very hard. There are some people
saying, `This guy deserves a chance to be heard and has shown he's
a pretty serious candidate.' You have people in there who really do
understand how to work with the labor movement. It's made some
people look twice.''

<P>
   Now that an organizational structure is taking shape, Bradley is
entering a new phase of his campaign, where he is expected to be
more visible on the national stage. After rejecting requests for
months from national television programs in a calculated effort to
keep his profile low _ and refusing to lay out detailed positions
on any issues except gun control and campaign finance _ he will
appear on Sunday on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, the low-key and sometimes plodding Bradley
is expected to reach out to liberals as he addresses such issues as
education, foreign policy and universal health insurance _ matters
that Gore has discussed in great detail.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Berman, Bradley's campaign chairman, said that he had
studied other presidential candidates who had taken on a
front-runner _ including Ronald Reagan in 1976, Edward M. Kennedy
in 1980 and Gary Hart and John Glenn in 1984 _ and that his
organization would be vastly more prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're Gary Hart but we have money,'' said Will Robinson,
Bradley's senior adviser, who was a top campaign official for
Walter F. Mondale in 1984 and Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. ``We're
Gary Hart but we're putting together a structure and an
organization and a full slate. We're Gary Hart but we know the
rules.''

</P>
<P>
   The most concrete sign of the potency of the Bradley
organization is that it has amassed nearly $12 million this year _
compared with almost $18 million for the vice president _ and has
spent its resources far more carefully. Gore has only about $2
million more than Bradley in the bank. That means that the Bradley
campaign has the financial capacity to be competitive through at
least the first round of contests.
</P>
<P>
   A convincing testament that Bradley is being taken seriously
comes not from his campaign but from his opponent's. Steve
Hildebrand, Gore's Iowa director, sounded envious as he reeled off
names of his friends on the Bradley campaign, including Sen. Paul
Wellstone of Minnesota and Robinson, Iowa field director for
Mondale in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what I'm worried about: This is such a family fight,
and he's got all these smart people,'' Hildebrand said. ``I know
how good they are. I wish I had Will to call to talk about this.
And Paul Wellstone wouldn't be a United States senator if it
weren't for caucus organizing. Paul gets it. He's on the phone all
the time calling Iowans.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most Democrats involved in the process argue that the
party's nomination is Gore's to lose. As an incumbent vice
president who has been plotting his campaign for years, Gore enjoys
numerous institutional advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Gore appears to have the support of most of the
so-called super delegates _ members of Congress, party officials
and others who will automatically be sent to the Democratic
convention and who account for about 20 percent of the total
delegates. As a result, Gore will likely start with almost 40
percent of the delegates he needs for the nomination. Gore, a
Tennessean, will also benefit from deep loyalty from blacks and
other minority groups as well as from white Southern Democrats who
will have a predisposition to back a fellow white Southerner.

<P>
   ``Any time you have two people on the ballot, there's a
possibility that either can win,'' said David Axelrod, a strategist
in Chicago who has advised the Gore campaign. ``But I think the
odds are very much in Gore's favor because of the many advantages
he brings to the race. Part of the Hart deal that made him so
strong in Iowa is that he snuck up on Mondale; there's no sneaking
up on the radar screen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone, who has endorsed Bradley, acknowledged that while
``he can do it _ it's still a big mountain to climb.'' The
senator's advisers are hard-pressed to explain how they could wrest
the super delegates from Gore.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Asked how Bradley could win over Southerners, Berman, his
campaign chairman, played down the former senator's New Jersey
base, saying: ``Even in the South, you drive down the street and
you see the same Blockbusters, the same McDonald's. Now, Wal-Marts
are in the Northeast. There are both regional differences and huge
commonalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Iowa, Gore has been far more active in signing up early
support. Already, he has captured the crucial endorsements from the
Iowa affiliates of the United Automobile Workers and the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   Hildebrand, the Gore director in Iowa, said of Bradley and his
people: ``I came here April 15 and he had all the momentum, he had
good crowds. But they didn't capitalize on it. It took them forever
to staff up. They could have stopped the UAW endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   Gina Glantz, Bradley's national campaign manager, acknowledged
there was concern that the campaign was slow to establish an office
in the state. ``There were people who really wanted us to get
going,'' she said. ``They were saying, `Hurry up! Hurry up!' I
understand their disappointment but we're not a campaign that looks
back.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Glantz, who was the field director for Mondale in 1984,
argued that by keeping costs down, the Bradley campaign may have
more to spend in the heat of the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Lucas, Bradley's Iowa campaign manager, who recalled several
underfinanced presidential campaigns he had worked on, said: ``The
secure funding is just an unbelievable benefit here. If you looked
at the odds, you'd have to go with the Vice President. But there
could be some big world event that just changes the nature of this
thing overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's advisers concede that the inviting climate for their
candidate is not merely of his own making but that they have
capitalized on a concern among some Democrats that Gore, whose lead
had seemed so insurmountable, has had a somewhat shaky start.
</P>
<P>
   ``That fact that there was this constant drumbeat of
inevitability made our achievements seem that much greater,'' Ms.
Glantz said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Bradley's rise is complicating life for
Gore, who is trying to set his sights on the leading Republican
contender, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Tully, the Iowa Democratic chairman, said: ``The vice
president's office asked me, `Why are you saying all these great
things about Bradley? Why don't you say nice things about us?' But
we're going to report it as we see it.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ After a dazzling century in which Japan emerged on the
globe first as a feared military power and then as a formidable
economic one, its influence may be on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is not the economic crisis that dominates the
headlines, but a pair of intertwined long-run concerns: The work
force is shrinking fast, and Japan undermines its economy's
productivity by squandering money on life support for moribund
industries and backward regions.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few decades, unless Japan somehow manages to arrest
current trends, it may find that its share of global economic
output has shrunk considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's working-age population peaked in 1995 and is falling
quickly. The overall Japanese population will still rise a tiny bit
until 2007, because of the long life expectancy of today's
retirees. But after that, the Japanese government's official
projections show the country's population tumbling rapidly, from
126 million today to 100 million in 2050 and 67 million in 2100.
</P>
<P>
   ``If influence is measured by GDP, then Japan's influence will
decline,'' said Chikashi Moriguchi, a prominent Japanese economist
who has studied the aging of Japan, referring to the gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
   While other industrialized countries also face low fertility
rates and aging societies, Japan is in a particular bind because
for cultural and sentimental reasons, it cannot easily avail itself
of the two obvious solutions: easier immigration to shore up the
population and ruthless restructuring to boost productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has some tremendous underlying economic strengths, ranging
from well-trained and committed workers to huge private savings.
Companies like Sony and Toyota may continue to expand and become
even more titanic global businesses while their home market becomes
relatively smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the link between population size and global economic
influence is far from absolute, as India demonstrates at one
extreme and Hong Kong at the other. Even if Japan's share of the
world's economy continues to decline, ordinary Japanese may live
more enjoyable lives in a less crowded country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan will be more of a middling power, less important than it
is now in the scheme of things, and it may be more comfortable with
that,'' said Hugh Patrick, director of the center on Japanese
Economy and Business at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan's shrinking population, many economists argue, makes
it difficult to see how Japan can continue to play the role of
Asia's leading power. Historically, the world has usually adjusted
more easily to the ripples from a declining power like Japan than
to those of a rising power like China, but the economic and
political ramifications will still be far-reaching.
</P>
<P>
   What will Japan look like in a few decades?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows, of course, but the late-night horror television
scenario might be something based on life today in the little
island of Akashima, in the Goto chain in southern Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshie Kokou, a friendly 70-year-old fisherman, stood on a bluff
on Akashima the other day, smiling shyly and speaking lovingly of
the throngs of friends and family members who surrounded him. The
only catch is that Kokou was standing in the cemetery. Akashima's
hospital, school, stores and most of its homes are abandoned, and
aside from Kokou only four people still live on the 128-acre
island.
</P>
<P>
   Akashima, its seaside cliffs jutting out of a blue-black ocean
that is hospitable mostly to the passing whales, has lost people
(it had 300 inhabitants at its peak a few decades ago) not so much
because women had fewer babies as because people moved to the
cities. But Akashima offers a glimpse of Japan's difficulties in
generating the kind of boom in productivity that might help make up
for a shrinking work force.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1950s through the 1980s, productivity grew much more
quickly in Japan than in the West. But Japan's total factor
productivity, the broadest measure, is now growing by only about
one-half of one percent per year, much less than half the level of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, the reason is that Japan steadily lost its
capacity for what the economist Joseph Schumpeter called ``creative
destruction.'' Japan never built up a huge public welfare system,
but it has instituted safety nets and subsidies to create a welfare
state for companies and towns and declining industries.
</P>
<P>
   The result is welfare dependency among inefficient corporations
and moribund economic sectors and fading islands and villages.
Instead of ``picking winners,'' Japan is now picking losers and
subsidizing them on a huge scale.
</P>
<P>
   Even tiny Akashima, a minnow in the Sea of Japan, is taking up a
whale's share of the national resources. Just the other day,
several barges chugged into Akashima's port to begin a $2.5 million
project to expand it and build a new pier.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem odd to be spending so much money on a project that
serves only five full-time residents, but that is only the
beginning. The government also provides a $490,000 annual subsidy
to the twice-daily ferry to Akashima and a neighboring island,
Oshima, which has 70 residents.
</P>
<P>
   At a huge cost, the government also has laid down undersea
cables to Akashima to carry electricity to the five residents.
Indeed, to demonstrate its absolute disregard for expense and
efficiency, the government has laid down not just one cable but
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is to insure a stable supply of electricity,'' said Choji
Tanikawa, an official in the regional offices on the main island of
Fukue.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the other subsidies: the underwater telephone
cable, the postal delivery, the weekly clinic by a public doctor.
The island of Oshima next door has what must be one of the best
student-teacher ratios in the world: there are three students and
nine teachers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All the subsidies help reproduce mainland life even on the
remotest islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody left here, but I like it,'' said Tama Shiowaki,
a 74-year-old woman who was bustling down the path on Akashima.
``Feel this fresh air! I get up at 5 a.m. to feed my chickens and
ducks, and I'm so healthy here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope young people come back,'' she said. ``When I was a
kid, there was a store over there,'' she said, pointing to a
collapsed building peeking from the thick brush. ``And over there.
And there. And down by the cemetery as well. And now they're all
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   In another world, the bustle of downtown Tokyo, Kaoru Yosano is
minister of international trade and industry and is thus charged
with maintaining Japan's future international competitiveness.
Sitting at a conference table in his vast office, the size of a
typical Japanese apartment for a family of five, Yosano sips his
tea and admits that he is struggling for solutions to the
population problem _ in vain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no easy answer,'' Yosano said bleakly. ``My mother
was one of eight children. My father was one of 11. My wife and I
were each one of five children, and we ourselves have two children.
When we look further ahead at the next generation, well, I don't
hear much from my sons about having babies.''
</P>
<P>
   (Yosano's two sons, both married, one with one child and the
other without any, both declined to be interviewed.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Former Primer Minister Takeshita once told me that in the year
2500, Japan's population will be down to one person,'' Yosano said
with a glum smile. ``When that happens, I suppose Japan's global
influence inevitably will have declined.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan is not, of course, the only country facing low birth
rates. Japanese women give birth to an average of 1.4 children,
while World Bank figures show Spain, Bulgaria and Latvia tied for
the lowest ``total fertility rate'' in the world, at 1.1. Even the
United States will grow primarily because of immigration because
its total fertility rate, of 2.0, is slightly below the level
needed for a self-sustaining population (which is 2.1 to account
for such factors as babies who die before adulthood).
</P>
<P>
   So what sets Japan apart is not so much that its women are
having fewer babies, but rather the combination it represents: The
world's second-largest economy is now one of the world's least
fertile and fastest-aging societies. Latvia's fertility crisis will
affect Lithuania; Japan's will shape the entire global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the challenge is a shrinking work force. The
government predicts that the working-age population of Japan will
drop by about 650,000 a year over the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   If those projections hold up, then even assuming that more women
and old people hold jobs and that productivity continues to grow
steadily at the same rate as in the 1990s, then Japan's gross
national product in 2050 will be 5 percent smaller than it is
today. Assuming that the rest of the world continues to grow
economically at about the same pace as it has in recent decades,
that would leave Japan with less than one-third the share of global
output that it now enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, each Japanese worker will have to support more
non-workers, as the aged rise from one-sixth of the population now
to one-third by the middle of the next century. This means that
simply for Japan to retain its present per capita income, each
worker will have to increase output to make up for the growing
numbers who are idle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Japanese living standards are going to
improve,'' said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Morgan
Stanley in Tokyo and one of the first Japan specialists to focus on
demographic constraints. ``Japan's GNP is going to shrink, and on a
per capita level it may also be a little bit lower.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this is fixed, of course. If Japan could boost
productivity dramatically, then fewer workers could still produce
as much as today's work force or even more.
</P>
<P>
   But the pattern of subsidies to Akashima _ repeated in small
islands and hamlets around Japan _ helps explain why Japanese taxes
and utility charges are so high, and why Japan has steadily seen
its productivity growth slow down. Because it lays down undersea
cables for people like Mrs. Shiowaki, NTT charges unified telephone
rates across the country that are so high that they have stifled
Japan's growth of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has some dazzling technologies, and these could perhaps be
the basis for boosting productivity and allowing Japan to hold its
own economically for a time. But Japan's strongest sectors, such as
technology, are hobbled by regulation and by the burden of having
to support the weakest industries.
</P>
<P>
   High per-minute telephone connection charges mean that most
Japanese do not spend much time surfing the World Wide Web, for
instance. National law forbids discounting books, to protect small
shops and consumers in remote areas, so there is no incentive to
buy books on the Internet. The upshot is that Mrs. Shiowaki has her
inexpensive telephone, and Japan has no Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, high electrical charges, postal rates and taxes have
made it increasingly difficult even for efficient Japanese
businesses to compete internationally. It is, for example, more
expensive to mail a letter within Tokyo than to mail it from
America to Tokyo. Japanese companies began to do their mass
mailings from America, to save on postage, so the Japanese
government banned the mailing of domestic advertising from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Why does Japan so obstinately subsidize its past at the expense
of its future?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is a political system in which small towns and rural
areas wield disproportionate influence, such that an upper house
member of Parliament from rural Tottori prefecture has only
one-fifth as many constituents as a member from Tokyo. The late
economist Mancur Olson, in examining why great economies lose their
dynamism, emphasized the rise of special interests that win
protections and clog up the gears of a market economy; although
Olson was writing primarily about the experience of the West, the
same analysis applies to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what is just as important as special-interest politics is a
profound Japanese commitment to equality across the country, and a
revulsion for ``jaku niku, kyo shoku'' society _ one where the
strong eat the weak. Most Japanese accept that businesses may be
predatory abroad, but there is some yearning for them to be
vegetarians at home. There is a genuine and broad-ranging sympathy
for the weakest elements of the economy, and there are virtually no
calls for cutting off the spigots of cash for rural areas or
declining industries.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Japan has fostered a gentle, merciful brand of
capitalism, one that keeps dying businesses on artificial life
support. The effort to run a country as if it were a Disney movie
strikes Americans as deeply admirable and hopelessly naive, and
Japan has indeed found it increasingly difficult to nurture an
economy drawn entirely in cheerful pastels.
</P>
<P>
   In a system too squeamish to let industries or islands die,
taxes increasingly go to rescue the feeblest competitors, those
that in a more ruthless system would have gone the way of
blacksmiths and buggy-whip factories. Take Japan's ubiquitous
sento, or public baths, for although they are a tiny industry they
are symptomatic of Japan's difficulties letting go of its past.
</P>
<P>
   These sento are glorious nooks of steam and history, privately
owned, where people can go and scrub and then relax together in an
oversize, overheated tub. After adjusting to the sensation of being
boiled alive, it is difficult to think of anything more pleasant
than a Japanese bath, or anything less essential.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, of course, the sento were necessary
institutions, because many families had no bath or shower at home.
Now nearly all homes have baths, and young people almost never use
the sento, but Japan cannot muster the courage to let them go
bankrupt. So, even though their time is past and they have no hope
of competing in the market place, many sento are kept alive with
government loans and subsidies that each year total almost $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   The result is not only higher taxes but capital and labor that,
in the public bath industry, are at Indonesian levels of
productivity and dropping. Everybody knows one way to raise
productivity here _ let the sento go bankrupt _but Japan is not
prepared to pay that price.
</P>
<P>
   The same kinds of sentimental subsidies keep islands like
Akashima alive. There has not even been any discussion of cutting
back the ferry service to once daily, and islanders seem stunned
when they are asked whether the government should continue to
provide expensive services to a tiny, aging population.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never talked about cutting off services,'' said
Mankichi Kokou, 73, an Akashima resident. ``Even if this becomes a
ghost town, the services will continue. They have to.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a good deal of talk about how Japan may be beginning a
``third revolution'' of social and economic transformation as great
as the Meiji period beginning in 1868 and the post-World War II
era. Increasing mergers and the breakdown of the lifetime
employment system give some evidence of this, and officials are
talking a good game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential that we radically transform this nation's
system and character in order to promote further prosperity,''
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as Obuchi suggested, the key changes are yet to
come. Japan's steps have been tentative, and South Korea has more
obviously embraced markets in just the last 18 months than Japan
has in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Another way that Japan could stave off the demographic
projections is by encouraging large-scale immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, in particular, has shown that a country need
not worry too much about low birth rates so long as immigrants fill
the ranks of workers. And America has brought in not only low-wage
laborers, working as nannies or farm workers, but also computer
technicians and software engineers who have contributed enormously
to the dynamism of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great strength of America is that it draws in continually
the best of everywhere,'' said Jagdish Bhagwati, a Columbia
University professor of international economics who is from India.
``Japan cannot really match that openness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan has the bottleneck,'' he said, ``of not being really
open to foreign cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It has been 145 years since Japan abandoned its ``sakoku''
policy, which meant barring almost all foreigners. Yet even now
Japan is more hostile to immigration than any other industrialized
country: It is, for example, exceptionally difficult for foreigners
to acquire Japanese nationality without marrying a Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Chinese are sneaking into Japan to take
dirty or dangerous jobs, and they are beginning to leave an imprint
on the country. But because some of the Chinese immigrants are
gangsters who are handy with cleavers, many Japanese are more
frightened than ever of large-scale immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the government would try to find any other means of
solving the labor shortage rather than mass immigration,'' said
Charles Horioka, an American economist at Osaka University. ``Japan
is so concerned about maintaining cultural and racial
homogeneity.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tokyo made an all-out effort, it could recruit many of the
best young scholars and engineers from India, Taiwan, Vietnam and
China to study and work in Japan. That could revitalize the economy
and create a boom of entrepreneurship, but few in Japan seem
enthusiastic about that idea, and many seem fatalistic about the
waves of Asian migration that bypass Japan and continue on to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``English has become a common language, so it's natural for the
best and brightest to go to America to study,'' said Yosano, the
international trade minister. ``If they come to Japan, then they
face the language barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I envy America for attracting them, but that's just the way it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is for Japan to try to boost its own
fertility rates, by persuading women like Miki Fujii to have
babies. Mrs. Fujii, 32, has a good office job in Tokyo and the last
thing she wants is a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a matter of whether having a child is worth all
the stress and pressure,'' Mrs. Fujii said. ``Besides, I'd get no
help from my husband. He has this traditional idea that women
should raise children and that they enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard men say they're staying at work late because going
home early means having to take care of children, and they'd rather
work than do that,'' Mrs. Fujii continued. ``I totally understand
that. I think it's quite natural to feel that way. I know I would
feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan is a difficult place for a woman to raise a child, partly
because in practice this is a nation of single mothers. Husbands
stagger home late from the office or a bar, and a government poll
found that fathers spend an average of just six minutes a day
looking after their children.
</P>
<P>
   Profound social changes _ such as the emergence of husbands who
changed diapers _ might help fertility rates. But the Japanese
government's bleak population projections already assume some
recovery in fertility. If the total fertility rate stays where it
is, then the population will plummet even faster: to 92 million in
2050 and 50 million in 2100.
</P>
<P>
   Some Scandinavian countries have raised fertility a bit by
offering improved child care and various other incentives, and some
Japanese localities are even offering cash rewards for extra
children. Still, in countries like Sweden that have tried this
approach, the cost has been considerable and the long-term increase
in fertility very slight.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, an increase in birth rates would take a long time to
work through the system, for nearly all of Japan's labor force in
the year 2025 has already been born.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot evade the phenomenal change in population structure
and phenomenal change in population size,'' said Makoto Atoh, one
of Japan's leading demographers. ``It's an inevitability derived
from the current level of fertility and longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   Atoh said that Japan could partly compensate for the decline in
the labor force by having the elderly hold their jobs longer and by
encouraging more women to work. Fewer Japanese women hold jobs than
in most Western countries, so there may be room to expand the rate,
he noted, but he said that Japan's population will shrink so
quickly that adjusting to it will be very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem of the aging of Japan's population will be how
to pay for it. The social security system is underfinanced by a
huge sum about equivalent to Japan's entire annual gross domestic
product, and corporate pension funds are underfinanced by hundreds
of billions of dollars, leaving them with a burden equivalent in
scale to the banking crisis that has dogged Japan's economy for the
last half-dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   As for Akashima, the island remains a gorgeous but depressing
reminder of what can happen to a place when its population ages.
Most of the remaining people on Akashima say they believe that
there will still be at least one person living on the island for
the next decade, but there is the sobering example of another
nearby island, Himejima, which has been entirely abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of my young days, I remember how my friend lived
over there, and another friend's house was over there,'' said
Yoshie Kokou, the fisherman, pointing sadly at clumps of bushes.
``And I long for the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear young people aren't having kids now,'' he said. ``I
guess it's just the changing times.''

   It's not just young upstarts from Silicon Valley or Silicon
Alley anymore. Even the old freight-delivery dowager UPS is
declaring itself an Internet player (it ships a lot of stuff bought
on Web sites) and announcing that it is going public. The IPO craze
has reached the point that the stock exchanges themselves are
hatching plans to sell shares. So I believe the time is right to
take the Internet-IPO phenomenon a pioneering step further, which I
plan to do, with my new company, me.com.
</P>
<P>
   The company promises to be an extraordinary opportunity for a
select group of investors, and I'm giving you a chance to be one of
them. Since I am in the pre-IPO stage, the exact details of my
company are still a closely guarded secret. Good buzz, as we all
know, can be worth billions in today's frenzied market.
</P>
<P>
   A careful blend of mystery and hype are key ingredients in the
marketing plan of any good Internet start-up. As part of the
comprehensive marketing strategy, I will also be shaving my head,
piercing two or three body parts (as yet undisclosed), and lying
shamelessly about my age.
</P>
<P>
   The company is positioned across three markets with explosive
growth potential _ the Internet (see company name above),
intellectual property (I have lots and lots of ideas) and the human
genome project (hey, I have as many genes as anyone else).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the company's losses are already mounting. But as we all
know, in the Internet era there are no losses, only investments. In
the hyperspeed land grab for mind share and market share in the New
Economy, actually making money is a character weakness _ a sure
sign of a worrisome lack of imagination in not being able to come
up with more and more ways to spend money. The financially meek,
after all, will not inherit the high-tech economy's Next Big Thing.
</P>
<P>
   Me.com has already attracted the financial backing of Dick
Digit, the Internet visionary and co-founder of harebrained.com, a
company I regard as nearly as path-breaking as my own. Dick, of
course, is now a gazillionaire because harebrained.com was acquired
only four months after it was founded for a stupefying sum by a
major computer company desperate to jump on the Internet bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to the company's long-term (a maximum of six
months) strategy, which is founded upon two plans that are
calculated to trigger results. Plan No. 1: Create some buzz and
persuade Microsoft that America Online is anxious to buy me.com,
which will prompt Microsoft to buy the company so that its
archrival will not get it. Plan No. 2: Plan No. 1 in reverse.
Convince America Online to snap up me.com to keep it out of
Microsoft's clutches. Either way, me.com is a decided winner.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I think I should say a bit about an aspect critical to
business but regrettably neglected in most Internet start-ups _
management. The management structure and philosophy behind me.com
is, I'm proud to say, one of its unique features. It is the
ultimate ``lean'' company, quick and responsive, distinctively able
to react faster than flame mail over a T3 line. Me.com has a
totally flat organizational structure, no layers of bureaucratic
flab bogging down the decision-making process. I am the chairman,
chief executive officer, chief technology officer and sole employee
of me.com. It's all me, just me.
</P>
<P>
   Addendum: F.Y.I.
</P>
<P>
   The Net being the Net, if you actually go looking for www.me.com
on the Web, as many of you wannabe gazillionaires will doubtless
do, it will indeed take you somewhere, though, unfortunately not to
me(AT)me.com. Last week, Net surfers would find a page that was
part of the corporate Web site for Job 1 Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale,
Calif., a company that provides ``financing and strategic services
for start-ups.'' But Brian Job, a graduate of Stanford and the
Harvard business school, said he had just sold off the Web address,
or domain name, to an eager bidder. And like everything else on the
Net, me.com is changing fast.

EXPORT RULES ARE SAID TO BE A THREAT TO SATELLITE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only months after tighter restrictions on satellite exports took
effect, concern is growing within the aerospace industry and in
Congress that the new rules are entangling manufacturers in red
tape, delaying launches and hurting American satellite makers in
foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, commercial satellites and their components have
been treated like weapons for export purposes, requiring licenses
from the State Department rather than the more lenient Commerce
Department, which had jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The shift was ordered by Congress in a measure passed last
October in response to revelations that two U.S. satellite
manufacturers, Hughes Electronics Corp. and Loral Space and
Communications Ltd., might have helped China improve its rocket and
missile technology while investigating Chinese launch failures in
which the companies lost satellites. Both companies, which are
under criminal investigation, maintain they did not harm national
security.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace industry executives say the rules have hindered them
from supplying even U.S. allies. And beyond exports of finished
products, it can take months to obtain licenses that are needed to
bid on foreign projects, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The result, industry executives say, is that U.S. companies are
losing foreign customers who are worried that delays could
jeopardize billion-dollar projects. They say such problems could
threaten the competitiveness of the $30.7 billion U.S. industry,
which leads the world and had an $11.5 billion trade surplus last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the State Department does not change the way it does export
licensing, the U.S., which has dominated commercial space, will
lose position and it will have an effect for a decade,'' said Dr.
Richard A. Aubrecht, vice chairman of Moog Inc., of East Aurora,
N.Y. His company has lost some small contracts to supply parts for
satellites that are being manufactured in Europe, he said. ``The
reason given is they are unwilling to sign up with a U.S.
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin Corp. could not bid in time to supply a
television broadcasting satellite to a European company, a contract
potentially worth more than $100 million. In a July 16 letter, the
company, Societe Europeenne des Satellites, said its urgent need
for capacity made it impossible to wait for Lockheed to obtain a
needed permit.
</P>
<P>
   Claims of lost business are difficult to verify, and some
customers are willing to wait. Last year, Loral warned the Clinton
administration that it would lose a contract or have to pay
penalties if it did not get a permit to export a satellite to China
on time. The permit came late but there were no penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration opposed the return of satellite
export licensing to the State Department, which had jurisdiction
before 1996. But State Department officials say industry complaints
are based more on fear than actual losses, and point out that the
U.S. satellite industry managed to maintain leadership even when
satellite exports were last controlled by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that to some extent this is concern over what people
think might happen,'' said Eric D. Newsom, assistant secretary of
state for political and military affairs. ``I have no specific
evidence of any business having been lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives say the business now moves at a faster pace, making
delays less tolerable. With the development of multisatellite
systems providing direct-to-home television broadcasts, telephone
and Internet service, commercial launches have tripled since the
early 1990s. Satellites are built and launched within 18 months,
down from two-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, foreign satellite manufacturers and operators say the
rules could discourage them from buying American.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just creating a lot of difficulties for us as operators
and certainly creates a market disadvantage for American
manufacturers,'' said Conny Kullman, chief executive of Intelsat,
the 143-nation organization that operates international
communications satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Kullman said there was a delay in a license for Loral to ship
components for Intelsat's next generation of satellites to Alcatel
S.A., a French manufacturer that was to make part of the
satellites. The license came just before Intelsat was to implement
an alternative plan that would have delayed the first satellite's
completion by two months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Executives say some restrictions have no bearing on national
security. Lockheed needed a license to send defective parts back to
their German manufacturer for repair.
</P>
<P>
   Launch schedules could be imperiled, some executives say,
because permits are needed for American manufacturers to present
technical information to foreign companies that underwrite space
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has truly paralyzed the space insurance business, and
that will paralyze the space business,'' said Douglas A. Heydon,
president of the U.S. unit of Arianespace Inc. ``Business is
essentially grinding to a halt.''

   Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., still lacks insurance
for the next satellite for its DirecTV television service,
threatening to force a delay in the scheduled August launch. The
company said it had received permission to talk to insurance
companies and hoped to settle the matter soon.
</P>
<P>
   Delays in launching U.S. satellites on foreign rockets come at
an awkward time, because several U.S. rockets have recently failed.
</P>
<P>
   Even some congressmen who have criticized the industry's
dealings with China have expressed sympathy, but say jurisdiction
will not be returned to Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're to some extent valid,'' Rep. Curt Weldon,
R-Pa., said of industry complaints. But, he added, ``the process
didn't work'' before.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said the State Department had not
used $2 million appropriated by Congress to hire more examiners.
``It's not the law,'' he said. ``It's the failure to carry out the
responsibility as directed by the law.''

   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., is pushing for looser
restrictions for exports to allies.

   ``The industry has to recognize that they're getting hit because
some people in the industry reacted in an irresponsible way that
was damaging to our national security,'' he said. Nevertheless, he
added, ``We can't let the misdeeds of some people in this very
important industry cause an overreaction that will damage the whole
industry.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In an interview and in Senate testimony last month, Newsom of
the State Department conceded that its Office of Defense Trade
Controls was understaffed, with 14 State Department and four
military officers reviewing 45,000 munitions license requests a
year. The transfer of satellite exports will add 2,500 to 3,000 to
that total.
</P>
<P>
   He said the $2 million was not spent because the State
Department had to review priorities in the face of an overall
funding shortage. But he said the department was prepared to hire
as many as 23 people, mainly to review license requests. Newsom
also said the State Department intended to set up an expedited
system for exports to major allies.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of commercial satellite exports to Commerce
Department jurisdiction, which started in 1992, was completed by
President Clinton in 1996 after an industry lobbying effort led by
C. Michael Armstrong, then the president of Hughes and now head of
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, the Clinton administration was charged in
Congress with being lax on security after the revelations about the
China disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest losses for U.S. companies under the new tighter
rules have been in sales to China. Hughes forfeited a $450 million
contract to provide communications satellites to a Singapore
company with ties to China's military.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the State Department suspended a license for Loral
to export a satellite to China, delaying the launch. If the
contract is canceled, Loral will have to refund $124 million and
absorb about $50 million in other costs, the company has said.
</P>
<P>
   An executive at one of the three major U.S. satellite makers _
Hughes, Lockheed Martin and Loral _ said none of them met the June
15 bidding deadline to supply one or two satellites to APT
Satellite in China, a contract that could be worth $100 million to
$300 million. Two French companies did place bids. But APT still
seems willing to give the Americans more time.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some problems stem from confusion over the new rules and
cautious interpretations of them in the wake of the China
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace Industries Association officials say Raytheon could
not bid to supply $50 million of chips to Alcatel because the State
Department did not rule last fall on whether the chips were subject
to the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system went dormant,'' said Joel Johnson, vice president
for international affairs at the trade group. ``No one would make a
decision.'' Raytheon declined to comment.

FEARS OF RAPE AND VIOLENCE: WOMEN NEWLY SEEKING ASYLUM

<P>
   No one denies that their stories are horrific: beatings, rape,
genital mutilation or the threat of it. But foreign women seeking
asylum on these grounds have received a mixed welcome in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the door opened a bit for some women who
claimed that their sex rendered them victims of persecution. In a
landmark decision, the Board of Immigration Appeals granted asylum
to Fauziya Kassindja, who said her clitoris would be cut off if she
were forced to return home to Togo. The board, the highest
administrative court for asylum cases, agreed that female
circumcision was equivalent to the more widely recognized rights
violations of political and religious persecution. Ms. Kassindja's
case also met other important criteria _ a well-founded fear of
persecution because she belonged to a social group, in her case
women of her tribe who opposed genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kassindja ruling has not, as many women's groups and
human rights lawyers hoped, blazed an unambiguous trail for others
seeking a safe haven from persecution based on sex. In late June,
the board denied asylum to Rodi Alvarado Pena, a Guatemalan woman
who had escaped both a brutal husband and apathetic authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 15 members of the appeals board said Ms. Alvarado had
not proved she was persecuted because of her social class or
opinion. Her husband raped and beat her regardless of her beliefs,
the judges ruled, and while Ms. Alvarado may merit protection on
humanitarian grounds, asylum is not meant to be an all-encompassing
remedy for people fleeing oppressive societies.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the attention to these cases, rights advocates are
challenging the conventional wisdom. Ms. Alvarado's supporters have
petitioned Attorney General Janet Reno and the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco to review the decision by the
Board of Immigration Appeals. They also may try a novel tack:
portraying Ms. Alvarado as a victim of torture who should not be
sent back to her torturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision has really garnered the attention of people
across the country on different levels _ from Congress to the
immigration advocates, to women's groups and people in the
administration,'' said Karen Musalo, a professor at Hastings
College of Law at the University of California in San Francisco.
``But for the time being, it is a binding precedent that has
devastating consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Applicants for asylum must first prove they cannot return home
because of ``persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on
account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular
social group, or political opinion.'' The law was a product of the
Cold War, written with dissidents from totalitarian regimes in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption was that there is a distinction between
political and economic suffering and between what was political and
personal,'' said Gary Rubin, the director of public policy of the
New York Association for New Americans. ``Now the line between
personal and political is being renegotiated and things that people
thought were personal tended to have political meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   In the recent past, the meaning of ``social group'' has been
extended to include those persecuted on the basis of sexual
orientation, ethnicity and even, in the case of journalists,
profession. Gender as social group seemed the natural next
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 the executive committee of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees said women facing abuse because they
transgress the customs of their society are a special ``social
group.'' It took another eight years before the United Nations
recognized violence against women as a human rights violation. The
same year, spurred in part by the reports of a systematic pattern
of rape in Bosnia, Canada adopted pioneering guidelines granting
refugee status to women facing persecution on account of their
gender. Two years later the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service broadened its own guidelines to give greater weight to
women seeking asylum who feared genital mutilation and sexual
violence. In 1996 female circumcision, whether part of a woman's
culture or not, was outlawed in this country.
</P>
<P>
   But inconsistent rulings in recent cases here and in Canada show
that each woman seeking asylum on grounds of gender-based
persecution must fight the battle anew. Last year, the board denied
asylum to Adelaide Abankwah, a Ghanaian who feared she would be
circumcised forcibly if she returned home. The board said she had
not proved that her fear was reasonable. Ms. Abankwah was released
only on July 20, after two years in a New York City detention
center, when a federal appeals court ruled she could not be
expected to provide the kind of proof the board had demanded. ``A
genuine refugee does not flee her native country armed with
affidavits, expert witnesses, and extensive documentation,'' the
court said, and sent the case back to the immigration board.
</P>
<P>
   A different issue, central to Ms. Alvarado's case, is likely to
affect asylum seekers fleeing countries where violence against
women is considered within the rights of husbands and fathers. Ms.
Alvarado's lawyers argued that she belonged to a persecuted social
group they defined as ``Guatemalan women who have been involved
intimately with Guatemalan male companions, who believe that women
are to live under male domination.'' The judges said the group
defined was not cohesive enough to qualify for asylum. They also
said Ms. Alvarado had not shown that her husband beat her because
she was, or he believed her to be, opposed to the patriarchal
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Women's advocates say the only act of opposition that women in
such cultures can take is to flee their country. And a society that
fails to punish batterers or ignores women's basic human rights is
enforcing a political policy, they say.
</P>
<P>
   That is the disputed new frontier for women seeking asylum. As
an immigration judge in Virginia ruled in 1994 in the case of a
Jordanian woman who ran away from an abusive husband, a woman can
challenge the system simply by seeking a new life in the United
States. The judge, Paul Nejelski, wrote, ``The respondent has
espoused a belief that she is an individual.''

FEARS OF RAPE AND VIOLENCE: WOMEN NEWLY SEEKING ASYLUM

<P>
   No one denies that their stories are horrific: beatings, rape,
genital mutilation or the threat of it. But foreign women seeking
asylum on these grounds have received a mixed welcome in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the door opened a bit for some women who
claimed that their sex rendered them victims of persecution. In a
landmark decision, the Board of Immigration Appeals granted asylum
to Fauziya Kassindja, who said her clitoris would be cut off if she
were forced to return home to Togo. The board, the highest
administrative court for asylum cases, agreed that female
circumcision was equivalent to the more widely recognized rights
violations of political and religious persecution. Ms. Kassindja's
case also met other important criteria _ a well-founded fear of
persecution because she belonged to a social group, in her case
women of her tribe who opposed genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kassindja ruling has not, as many women's groups and
human rights lawyers hoped, blazed an unambiguous trail for others
seeking a safe haven from persecution based on sex. In late June,
the board denied asylum to Rodi Alvarado Pena, a Guatemalan woman
who had escaped both a brutal husband and apathetic authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 15 members of the appeals board said Ms. Alvarado had
not proved she was persecuted because of her social class or
opinion. Her husband raped and beat her regardless of her beliefs,
the judges ruled, and while Ms. Alvarado may merit protection on
humanitarian grounds, asylum is not meant to be an all-encompassing
remedy for people fleeing oppressive societies.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the attention to these cases, rights advocates are
challenging the conventional wisdom. Ms. Alvarado's supporters have
petitioned Attorney General Janet Reno and the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco to review the decision by the
Board of Immigration Appeals. They also may try a novel tack:
portraying Ms. Alvarado as a victim of torture who should not be
sent back to her torturer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision has really garnered the attention of people
across the country on different levels _ from Congress to the
immigration advocates, to women's groups and people in the
administration,'' said Karen Musalo, a professor at Hastings
College of Law at the University of California in San Francisco.
``But for the time being, it is a binding precedent that has
devastating consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Applicants for asylum must first prove they cannot return home
because of ``persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on
account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular
social group, or political opinion.'' The law was a product of the

TAX CUT BILLS WOULD GIVE BUSINESSES BILLIONS IN LONG-SOUGHT
BENEFITS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As House and Senate leaders try to reach a deal on
tax cuts, it is not just the average taxpayer who has something at
stake. A wide array of businesses and industries is fighting to
protect tens of billions of dollars in special benefits that have
made the competing tax cut bills the most lucrative for business in
years.
</P>
<P>
   With the new era of surpluses leading Republicans to push for
the largest tax cut since Ronald Reagan's in 1981, the latest bills
have proved a bonanza for the lobbyists who clog the corridors
outside the House and Senate tax-writing committees.
</P>
<P>
   In several instances, the vast $792 billion tax cut measures
passed by the House last week and the Senate on Friday give
corporations victories that they have been seeking since Reagan
crowned his second term with an overhaul of the tax code. That
overhaul made way for a reduction in individual tax rates by
closing scores of corporate loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Many lobbyists say they had been stymied for years because
federal deficits had made tax breaks with a large cost to the
Treasury unthinkable. But with a pro-business Republican Congress
now dealing with a federal surplus, Clint Stretch, the director of
tax policy at the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche, was only half
joking when he said that some of the tax breaks in these bills were
ones companies had been seeking ``probably since the dawn of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with broad-based personal tax cuts, the House bill
includes $80 billion or more in business tax reductions over the
next 10 years, while the Senate bill has about $50 billion. Despite
their differences, each of the two bills provides $792 billion in
total tax cuts over the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The measures include tax relief for multinational corporations
and for small businesses, assistance to the oil and gas industry,
aid to the nuclear energy industry, a tax reduction for railroads
and one for seaplanes, and a reduction in the corporate capital
gains tax that analysts say will be particularly helpful to the
insurance and timber industries.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever plan emerges from conference faces a veto from
President Clinton because of its size. And it will be months before
the shape and contents of a final package will be clear. But
industries and their lobbyists were still scrambling to get their
provisions into the bills, in hopes that they would be favored for
inclusion in the final bill. And some seemed almost giddy at their
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the sun, moon and the stars,'' said Kathleen O'Leary, a
lobbyist for the National Restaurant Association, which in the
House bill won a phased-in provision to make 80 percent of the cost
of business meals tax deductible, instead of the current 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The business meal deduction had been reduced in Clinton's
deficit reduction package of 1993. Ms. O'Leary said the association
had hoped to win it back inch by inch. In fact, the association had
been supporting legislation that would raise the deduction to 80
percent only for companies that earned $5 million or less. But the
House applied it to all business, at a cost to the Treasury of $8.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders defend the tax provisions as ones that will
help declining industries and keep American business competitive
overseas. ``These tax relief measures will make sure that we are
competitive in the next century and that we can keep our economic
growth moving in the right direction,'' said John Feehery, a
spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress is promoting such tax breaks at the same time it is
struggling to find ways to cut scores of domestic programs by 10
percent or more to stay within the boundaries of the 1997 balanced
budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   And that has led Democrats to charge that Republicans are
putting special interests ahead of the common good. ``Without a
single dime of the surplus dedicated to strengthening Medicare, the
Republicans managed to shovel in almost $100 billion worth of tax
breaks for special interests,'' said House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, voted for the
Senate tax bill but also excoriated some special interest
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we justify giving a $33 million tax break next year to
companies producing electricity from chicken waste, when senior
citizens have to forgo some of their Social Security benefits if
they must work to make ends meet?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Democrats have their favored causes, too. On the
final day of debate on the Senate tax cut, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy,
D-Vt., won a tax break for maple syrup producers who tap trees on
timberlands. Under the provision, they would have the same income
threshold for paying unemployment tax as maple syrup producers
whose trees are on farms.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, industries argue that they are just receiving tax
treatment equivalent to that granted other businesses or clearing
up quirks in the tax laws. But such changes can raise broader
policy questions.
</P>
<P>
   Take the tax provision won by military contractors. Since the
early 1970s, Congress has used the tax code to subsidize U.S.
exports by allowing American companies to exempt about 15 percent
of their export income from tax. But in 1976, Congress decided that
weapons exporters should get only half the tax benefits allotted
other exporters.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas, who took up the cause of the military
contractors, said in a letter to House members, ``Let's stop using
the tax code to punish our defense industry.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued for and won a provision in the House bill to give the
contractors the same tax treatment as other exporters _ at a cost
to the Treasury of $1.1 billion over a decade. The Senate bill
phases in the change differently, costing $798 million over the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   But not all members of Congress see such a subsidy as a public
good. ``Why in the world, when the U.S. has such a substantial
portion of the market, do taxpayers need to subsidize us to promote
conventional arms races all around the world?'' asked Rep. Lloyd
Doggett, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the military contractors' victory may prove
short-lived. Lawmakers say a panel at the World Trade Organization
recently made a preliminary ruling that this entire provision of
the American tax code was an illegal export subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest business provisions in the House tax bill is
a change in the way multinational corporations are allowed to
allocate their worldwide interest deductions. The change has the
effect of allowing them to take more credits for paying taxes
overseas, and thus reduce their domestic taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In the House bill, which phases the change in faster than the
Senate's, the cost to the Treasury is $24.8 billion over a decade.
The Senate version would cost $12.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an expensive provision to fix,'' said William H.
Laitinen, assistant general tax counsel to General Motors, one of
the many companies that wanted the change. ``But now there's some
more leeway from the projected surplus.''

<P>
   My friend the fiction writer is sensitive, so I asked the
dreaded question directly. ``How's the novel coming along?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Very well, thanks,'' she answered. ``I'm workshopping it right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, individuals are workshopping short stories,
novellas and plays. Others have screenplays or theater pieces in
development. Still others engage in content creation. They create
content, or provide it, for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Actively productive souls everywhere are developing scripts.
Workshopping books. Providing content.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't anyone  &UR; write &LR;  anymore?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. Some pesky writing tasks have been eliminated,
with the popularity of projects like the script-free MTV show ``The
Real World,'' which chronicles the daily taped lives of not
entirely compatible roommates. Or the summer horror flick ``The
Blair Witch Project,'' where rather than writing dialogue in
advance, the filmmakers sent the actors into the woods,
intentionally frightened them for days on end, and then filmed
them. What once had to be written can just be lived.
</P>
<P>
   But even when writing occurs, why is it no longer called
writing? I started to wonder this back in the heady days of the Web
entertainment boom, when I was hired to write a Web drama. At that
point, the Microsoft Network was using the ``television model'' to
try to conquer the Web. The ``show'' would ``air'' twice a week on
an MSN ``channel.'' I was the sole writer.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I was definitely sole. But the writer part became
increasingly unclear. A few weeks into the assignment, MSN
executives were starting to notice that the Web is like TV about as
much as it's like a sliding door _ they both have a screen. They
wanted to stop calling the episodes ``episodes.'' The producer
asked me what we should call them. ``Stories?'' I asked.
``Chapters?'' ``Chapters!'' said the producer. ``Jenny Lyn, that's
very `print.''' She told me to stop being ``so print.'' She said
the suggestion was ``very old media'' of me.
</P>
<P>
   This was an insult. Old media, once a role model for new media,
had become an evil twin as the new form struggled for its identity.
And the words of old media had gone too. When the producer
introduced me to the programming staff, I expected her to say I was
the writer of the site.
</P>
<P>
   Instead she said: ``This is Jenny Lyn. She's the creative on
this project.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally I was flattered. I didn't have to worry about being
creative. I was the creative. Creative, an adjective in my youth,
was now a glamorous noun.
</P>
<P>
   But this new job title also betrayed an underlying suspicion by
the producers that writers don't really  &UR; do &LR;  anything; they somehow
simply  &UR; are. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Creative'' had become a noun in the same alarming way
``workshop'' turned into a verb. Once, writers attended fiction
workshops. Now, writers workshop fiction. The act of sharing the
work with others has become part of its creation, and the sense of
the individual starts to get lost. Once, writers escaped into the
wilderness to cultivate their voices. Now, they gather together
with each other or with development executives to hone their craft,
make contacts, compare their voices, or make their voices sound
more like one another. Meanwhile, the only people going into the
wilderness are the terrified actors in ``The Blair Witch Project''
who aren't cultivating their voices but do scream a lot.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the way that sensational events occur in book
publishing is by avoiding cultivating those voices. Instant books
bear the name of one writer but are actually divided up among
different writers, all refraining from writing in their own style.
</P>
<P>
   That's how book-packaging houses _ the writing factories of the
literary industrial revolution _ get them done so quickly. If a
book is, say, about a timely vegetable scandal, one writer will be
assigned the tomatoes, the next the carrots, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Such compartmentalization has occurred in the film and
television industry for years, but has gotten more extreme with the
growth of the sheer numbers of people on writing staffs, performing
uncredited rewrites, or doing ``polishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, the publishing and film worlds will soon have a joint
writing factory in the form of Tina Brown's media convergence
empire, which will put nonfiction articles into ``development''
before they are even written.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter and author William Goldman has decided to expose
the anguish of the development process in a new way. In July, he
offered studio chiefs a spec screenplay _ yes, a screenplay written
for no pay by one of Hollywood's highest paid writers _ to studios.
But there's a catch. The screenplay, ``The Big A,'' is not
finished. Any studio head who wants to read it must return a
written response with comments. And Goldman plans to publish these
comments, plus critiques from six screenwriters, along with the
incomplete screenplay, in a forthcoming book.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, the ultimate expression that film development has
mechanized the writer's creative process is the screenwriting
software that solves story structure problems and suggests plot
twists. If it actually worked, perhaps writers could simply
``program'' or ``input'' instead of having to ``write'' in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The unspoken threat of the digital era is that it will chip away
at the individual author's voice and intent, that content will
become more and more automated and mass produced.
</P>
<P>
   The heroes of the digital era will be those who restore
individual voices. It seems remarkably fitting that it was Peter
Norton who purchased the love letters of J.D. Salinger, the last
guy to escape into the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Norton made his fortune inventing Norton Utilities, featuring
the Norton Disk Doctor, a program that salvages the memories of
crashed computers. With heart-warming functions like ``UnErase,''
it is one of the few software innovations with a sense of justice.
Norton demonstrated that sense of justice and respect for memory
and author's intent when he purchased the letters for $156,500 and
then offered to return them to Salinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may want them returned,'' Norton said. ``He may want me to
destroy them. He may not care at all.'' He said he would leave it
up to the writer.

</P>
<P>
   Well, I was definitely sole. But the writer part became
increasingly unclear. A few weeks into the assignment, MSN
executives were starting to notice that the Web is like TV about as
much as it's like a sliding door _ they both have a screen. They
wanted to stop calling the episodes ``episodes.'' The producer
asked me what we should call them. ``Stories?'' I asked.
``Chapters?'' ``Chapters!'' said the producer. ``Jenny Lyn, that's
very `print.''' She told me to stop being ``so print.'' She said
the suggestion was ``very old media'' of me.
</P>
<P>
   This was an insult. Old media, once a role model for new media,
had become an evil twin as the new form struggled for its identity.
And the words of old media had gone too. When the producer
introduced me to the programming staff, I expected her to say I was
the writer of the site.
</P>
<P>
   Instead she said: ``This is Jenny Lyn. She's the creative on
this project.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally I was flattered. I didn't have to worry about being
creative. I was the creative. Creative, an adjective in my youth,
was now a glamorous noun.
</P>
<P>
   But this new job title also betrayed an underlying suspicion by
the producers that writers don't really  &UR; do &LR;  anything; they somehow
simply  &UR; are. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Creative'' had become a noun in the same alarming way
``workshop'' turned into a verb. Once, writers attended fiction
workshops. Now, writers workshop fiction. The act of sharing the
work with others has become part of its creation, and the sense of
the individual starts to get lost. Once, writers escaped into the
wilderness to cultivate their voices. Now, they gather together
with each other or with development executives to hone their craft,
make contacts, compare their voices, or make their voices sound
more like one another. Meanwhile, the only people going into the
wilderness are the terrified actors in ``The Blair Witch Project''
who aren't cultivating their voices but do scream a lot.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the way that sensational events occur in book
publishing is by avoiding cultivating those voices. Instant books
bear the name of one writer but are actually divided up among
different writers, all refraining from writing in their own style.
</P>
<P>
   That's how book-packaging houses _ the writing factories of the
literary industrial revolution _ get them done so quickly. If a
book is, say, about a timely vegetable scandal, one writer will be
assigned the tomatoes, the next the carrots, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Such compartmentalization has occurred in the film and
television industry for years, but has gotten more extreme with the
growth of the sheer numbers of people on writing staffs, performing
uncredited rewrites, or doing ``polishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, the publishing and film worlds will soon have a joint
writing factory in the form of Tina Brown's media convergence
empire, which will put nonfiction articles into ``development''
before they are even written.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter and author William Goldman has decided to expose
the anguish of the development process in a new way. In July, he
offered studio chiefs a spec screenplay _ yes, a screenplay written
for no pay by one of Hollywood's highest paid writers _ to studios.
But there's a catch. The screenplay, ``The Big A,'' is not
finished. Any studio head who wants to read it must return a
written response with comments. And Goldman plans to publish these
comments, plus critiques from six screenwriters, along with the
incomplete screenplay, in a forthcoming book.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood, the ultimate expression that film development has
mechanized the writer's creative process is the screenwriting
software that solves story structure problems and suggests plot
twists. If it actually worked, perhaps writers could simply
``program'' or ``input'' instead of having to ``write'' in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The unspoken threat of the digital era is that it will chip away
at the individual author's voice and intent, that content will
become more and more automated and mass produced.
</P>
<P>
   The heroes of the digital era will be those who restore
individual voices. It seems remarkably fitting that it was Peter
Norton who purchased the love letters of J.D. Salinger, the last
guy to escape into the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Norton made his fortune inventing Norton Utilities, featuring
the Norton Disk Doctor, a program that salvages the memories of
crashed computers. With heart-warming functions like ``UnErase,''
it is one of the few software innovations with a sense of justice.
Norton demonstrated that sense of justice and respect for memory
and author's intent when he purchased the letters for $156,500 and
then offered to return them to Salinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may want them returned,'' Norton said. ``He may want me to
destroy them. He may not care at all.'' He said he would leave it
up to the writer.

PRETTY MEAN WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon I went to see ``Runaway Bride.'' It wasn't
hooky. It was work.
</P>
<P>
   I needed to check out Richard Gere's portrayal of a hard-boiled
New York newspaper columnist. Pundits, after all, have enough of an
image problem without Hollywood mucking it up further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ike,'' wrote The Wall Street Journal's film critic, Joe
Morgenstern, about Gere's columnist, ``is condescending and
reprehensible as well as implausible.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know. I found Ike quite plausible.
</P>
<P>
   He's always writing columns at the last minute, unable to come
up with any ideas until 1 hour, 27 minutes and 52 seconds before
deadline. When he has no good idea, he directs a bitter diatribe at
the opposite sex. When he gets bummed by the
windmill-relentlessness of his job, he lurks in bars, flirting and
hating himself. He reads Yeats, knowing that's real writing.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds pretty accurate to me.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gere's charm can't save the movie or the flatlining genre
of romantic comedy. As The Washington Post put it, ``Forget the
`Bride,' the Audience Should Run.''
</P>
<P>
   We have fallen pathetically far from the witty days of Preston
Sturges and his fabulous heroines, Barbara Stanwyck in ``The Lady
Eve'' and Claudette Colbert in ``The Palm Beach Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Modern romantic heroines often seem just plain mean.
</P>
<P>
   In ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' Julia Roberts wreaked havoc
with her best friend's life _ even getting him fired _ to try to
break up his engagement so she could have him.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Addicted to Love,'' a bitter Meg Ryan sets up a creepy
video system to spy on her ex and his new girlfriend, and schemes
to ruin him.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' and ``Notting Hill,'' the
gorgeous heroines treat Hugh Grant shabbily, then go off with
wealthier or more famous men, then show up months later assuming
they can simply flash their dazzling smiles and our stammering hero
will forget their callous behavior. (He will.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the difference is that nobody really believes in romance
anymore,'' suggests Jeanine Basinger, a professor of film studies
at Wesleyan University who has written nine books about the movies.
``My students at Wesleyan want it, but they're not convinced it's
possible. Everything is too cheap and easy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the hero and heroine would be unable to
consummate immediately. Often colliding from different classes,
they would work toward a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In the era of instant gratification, the couple can couple
anytime, so the device used to slow things down is a less
sympathetic heroine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old movies, women were mean only as a way of turning
the tables on society's idea that men were superior, that men had
all the cards in the game of romance,'' Ms. Basinger says.
</P>
<P>
   No more gold-lame ditzes like Katharine Hepburn in ``Bringing Up
Baby'' and Carole Lombard in ``My Man Godfrey,'' who do their
damage blithely. The new heroines are aggressive and calculating.
They have adapted all those traits they once scorned in men: they
lie, they spy, they cheat, they plot revenge, they treat sex
casually and they slither away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauties, however, have become the beasts,'' wrote Rita
Kempley, the Washington Post movie critic.
</P>
<P>
   When Barbara Stanwyck played a harsh trick on Henry Fonda in
``The Lady Eve,'' it was only to teach the rich boy a higher moral
lesson, the importance of forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A romantic comedy has to have the characters grow to some kind
of realization that the world is bigger than their own little
concerns,'' says Elizabeth Kendall, who in 1990 wrote, ``The
Runaway Bride: Hollywood Romantic Comedy of the 1930s.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. Hollywood's latest runaway bride, Ms. Roberts, a
hardware-store owner, humiliates a passel of men in her Maryland
town by dumping them at the altar. She defends her selfishness with
more selfishness, arguing that she has not yet found herself.
</P>
<P>
   When she spends more time on her own needs _ like how she likes
her eggs cooked _ and when she's able to fulfill herself creatively
by selling lamps she fashions from electrical conduits and
switchboxes to a Soho boutique, then she'll finally be able to stop
toying with men's hearts.
</P>
<P>
   So now women can be just as jerky and self-absorbed as men.
That's progress?
</P>

<P>
   When securities day trader Mark Barton walked into two Atlanta
brokerage firms Thursday and fatally shot nine people, it seemed
like another gruesome indicator of a trend toward workplace
violence and rage.
</P>
<P>
   Barton, 44, had traded with at least one of the firms and had
apparently experienced significant financial losses in recent
weeks, investigators said. In a note left behind after he took his
own life, Barton said he wanted to kill ``the people that greedily
sought my destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear that what has been dubbed ``workplace rage''
is really on the rise, researchers say. And similar doubts have
been raised about other so-called ``rages,'' namely road rage and
air rage. Some experts suggest that the labels reflect only a
national penchant for lumping similar but isolated acts of violence
into categories _ and question whether media coverage is making
them appear to be bonafide trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what's going on is that anecdotes are being
christened as trends,'' said Barry Glassner, a professor of
sociology at the University of Southern California and the author
of ``The Culture of Fear: Why Americans Are Afraid of the Wrong
Things,'' published in June by Basic Books. ``There is no reason to
believe that we have any new alarming situation in American
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Glassner said such problems get wide publicity in part because
of television news, which thrives on showing chilling footage of
each new act of public rage, and because politicians and others use
them to advance their own agendas. ``There are lots of people
making money off of these scares,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some psychologists say these are not spurious trends, but the
natural consequences of more drivers on the road and more
passengers in the air. Some, like Dr. Ervin Staub, a professor of
psychology at the University of Massachusetts, attribute them to
the decline of close communities and accelerating changes in
society that make people more frustrated and angry.
</P>
<P>
   Still others say that regardless of how many incidents there
actually are, the labels serve the useful purpose of raising
awareness about a problem and making people more careful about
their safety. After all, drunken driving was common long before
Mothers Against Drunk Driving came into existence, but it wasn't
until after the group's formation that society began to seriously
focus on the problem and take significant steps to curb it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a lot of skeptics tend to agree with Dr. Robert Baron, a
professor of management and psychology at the Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, who says, ``All these social phenomena,
they're just as slippery as eels.''
</P>
<P>
   Baron, whose expertise is workplace violence, said: ``A lot of
people are convinced there's a heck of a lot more than there used
to be. But there isn't, from all the statistics that are out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallup polls conducted for the last four years on workplace
anger show no increase in percentages of people who report feeling
angry at work, said Batia Wiesenfeld, an assistant professor of
management at New York University, who helped conduct the polls.
Only 2 percent reported feeling extremely angry, while under 10
percent reported feeling ``quite a bit angry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rates of anger are not extraordinarily high and they have
not been changing that much over the past few years,'' Wiesenfeld
said.
</P>
<P>
   With air rage and road rage, there may be similar gaps between
perception and reality. Two weeks ago, after an airline passenger
severely beat a Continental Airlines gate agent at Newark
International Airport, airline workers organized protests to demand
that airlines do more to protect their employees from what they
said were increasing incidents of passengers punching, kicking and
biting.
</P>
<P>
   There have certainly been some high-profile cases of alarming
passenger behavior in recent years _ most notoriously the 1995
incident in which a banker from Greenwich, Conn., assaulted a
flight attendant and defecated on a food cart on a flight from
Buenos Aires to New York.
</P>
<P>
   But while airlines report a growing problem, it may be
attributable to significant increases in the number of airline
passengers rather than a higher rate of unruly passenger behavior.
And definitions of unruly behavior vary from airline to airline,
and can run the gamut from verbal abuse to assault. While their
statistics are not exhaustive, federal aviation authorities have
recorded only about 200 incidents in which passengers interfered
with flight crews, about one for every 3 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
   With road rage, the numbers seem to vary considerably, depending
on the definition of terms like ``aggressive driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arnold Nerenberg, the clinical psychologist who popularized
the term road rage, has a Web site, www.roadrage.com, that makes
some alarming statements, like, ``Twenty-eight thousand Americans
died in 1996 because of aggressive driving,'' and, ``There are
estimated to be close to two billion episodes of road rage per year
in our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28,000 figure comes from 1997 congressional testimony by the
head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, who
said that aggressive behavior included tailgating, passing on the
right, flashing headlights to pass a car, weaving through busy
lanes, honking or screaming at other drivers and exchanges of
insults. The testimony indicated that such behavior was a factor in
nearly 28,000 deaths _ not the sole cause.
</P>
<P>
   At that same hearing, Nerenberg testified that a survey he
conducted of 585 drivers had found that 53 percent of drivers had
``road rage disorder,'' which he described as one driver's clearly
expressing anger to another at least twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   Glassner said one consequence of inventing a term like road rage
is that it is self-perpetuating; more incidents are reported
because people suddenly have a category to group them in.
</P>
<P>
   Another consequence is that people become more concerned about
their own safety.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Nathan, a psychologist at Albany Medical College,
sells an audio tape called ``Road Rage Readiness,'' that dispenses
pointers like who is most likely to engage in it (young men in
high-performance cars, he says). He also offers exercises designed
to help drivers control their frustration over, say, being cut off
by an aggressive driver.
</P>
<P>
   His training approach has altered over time to reflect what he
suggests is increasing fear about road rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I used to teach people to think that there might be
some really good reason for the person to cut us off _ maybe he had
to get to the hospital,'' Nathan said. But now he teaches people
``to assume the worst _ that the road-rager has a gun on seat next
to them and would use it.''
</P>
<P>
   The most distressing consequence of the ``rage'' trends, critics
say, is that they take attention away from dangers that are clearly
much more common: drunken driving fatalities, for example, or
injuries suffered on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things are a lot more preventable too,'' Glassner said.
``How do you imagine that you're going to prevent somebody who is
going off the deep end from getting violent in the workplace? What
disturbs me about this attention to these pseudophenomena is that
we lose focus on what is really out there.''

   RABAT, Morocco _ Weren't funerals supposed to be solemn, somber
affairs, where mourners whispered the right words and shop talk was
taboo?
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't have known it last week in Rabat, the setting for
the latest mourning ritual in what has become the year of the power
funeral in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   There was the new prime minister of Israel, Ehud Barak, in his
first three-way meeting with President Clinton and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat. There was Clinton again, bonding anew with
King Abdullah of Jordan, his youthful new ally. And there was Barak
again, in a clinch with Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika,
whose country is still formally at war with Israel. Syrian
President Hafez Assad was nowhere to be seen, but not out of any
lack of respect for the departed, King Hassan II of Morocco. The
Syrian leader knew what the other guests were plotting, and he had
no intention of allowing himself to be cajoled or even bumped into
a first-ever encounter with an Israeli leader.
</P>
<P>
   Once known as the domain of vice presidents and other varieties
of deputies, state funerals are turning out to be a good place for
the bosses themselves to do business. Back in February, even Assad
joined the galaxy of presidents, princes and prime ministers who
turned out to mourn the loss of Jordan's King Hussein. (There, the
organizers had promised to keep the Israelis out of his sight.)
Russian President Boris Yeltsin made that pilgrimage, too, despite
being woozy from ill health, apparently not wanting to be left out
of such an all-star gathering.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Bahrain buried its emir, Sheik Isa bin Salman
al-Khalifa, too quickly for many leaders to attend the funeral
itself. Morocco chose a more accommodating course, setting aside
the Muslim tradition that says a body should be buried within 24
hours of death. That made Rabat, for a day, the diplomatic capital
of the world, with a slew of side talks that included a state
dinner for French President Jacques Chirac given by King Mohammed
VI just hours after he had laid his father to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Even for regular folks, of course, funerals tend to bring
together people who might otherwise prefer not to be in the same
room. As everyone knows, a shared loss sometimes leads to
reconciliation, with hugs and tears at graveside or a wake. It is
only natural, then, for diplomats to try to translate that funeral
factor into diplomacy _ particularly in the Middle East, where
leaders tend to find reasons not to get together. Any meeting
between an Israeli prime minister and an Arab leader is still
considered news. Even the Arabs have trouble finding common ground;
it has been three years since they last gathered for a summit.
</P>
<P>
   And there is recent precedent for state funerals producing
diplomatic gestures. The death of Israel's Yitzhak Rabin in 1996
brought King Hussein and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to
Jerusalem for their first public visit. A meeting between Assad and
King Abdullah after King Hussein's funeral has left relations
between Syria and Jordan warmer than at any time in decades. And in
Rabat, the guests at King Hassan's funeral included Bouteflika, the
first Algerian leader to visit Morocco in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   As everywhere, bigger breakthroughs require more than mourning
gestures. But with pivotal leaders like Assad and Arafat
approaching their 70th years, this year of the power funeral may
also serve as a reminder that their time too, inevitably, is
running out.

ROAD TO CAPITALISM TAKING TOLL ON MEN IN THE FORMER SOVIET BLOC 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PAUL LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Across many of the post-Communist countries of
the former Soviet Union and in parts of Eastern Europe, the ratio
of men to women is falling, the United Nations says in a new
report, because men in those countries are leading shorter and less
healthy lives.
</P>
<P>
   These countries are paying ``a high social and human cost for
their transition to a market economy,'' the U.N. Development
Program says in its report on the former Communist countries of the
Soviet Union and the old Soviet bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking feature has been ``the loss of lives among
young and middle-aged men, which is reflected in an abnormally low
ratio of men to women across the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The causes, the report says, ``include rising suicide rates,
declining life expectancy, poor health care and an increase in
self-destructive behavior _ including drug and alcohol abuse and
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking as a standard of comparison the ratio of 96 men to every
100 women found in Britain and Japan, the report calculates that
there are 9.6 million ``missing men'' in the countries of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation lies partly in a recent decline in men's life
expectancy in many of the countries. The life expectancy of Russian
men has fallen by four years since 1980, to 58 years, 10 less than
in China. Life expectancy has also declined in Ukraine, Belarus and
Armenia as well as in Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the report points to a decline in overall birth
rates and high mortality rates in almost all the countries
surveyed, which it attributes to reduced living standards,
increased insecurity and unemployment, and the deterioration in
social services, including health services, since the end of
communism.
</P>
<P>
   These factors have also resulted in a sharp increase in the
number of suicides. Since 1989, the suicide rate in Russia has
risen 60 percent, in Latvia 95 percent, and in Lithuania 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition to a market economy has thus been accompanied
by a demographic collapse and a rise in self-destructive behavior,
especially among men,'' the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   As further evidence of the high cost of making the transition to
a market economy, the report says the number of people in the
region living on an income as little as $4 a day rose to 32 percent
of the population in 1994, from 4 percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Drug crimes in Russia climbed fivefold between 1991 and 1996,
and diseases that could be contained by immunization are
reappearing on a significant scale.
</P>
<P>
   The report stresses rising levels of corruption and the growing
importance of the black market for the region's unemployed. It
estimates that the black market accounts for 25 percent of total
Russian economic output and as much as 40 percent in Yugoslavia,
Armenia and Macedonia.

LATIN AMERICA'S LEFTISTS SAY ADIOS TO REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>

Horwitz in Paris for details and prices (Phone: 47 42 17 11; FAX:

   MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay _ If looks alone were what mattered, Jose
Mujica could still play a Tupamaro rebel in some new Costa Gavras
film about Uruguay's desperate revolutionaries. Never mind that
this one-time guerrilla is now a member of Congress who monitors
the budget of the same military that once tortured him. True to his
old style, Mujica still chain smokes, rarely shaves and wears
grubby, carelessly fitted blue jeans to the office.
</P>
<P>
   But listen to what the 65-year-old had to say in an interview
not long ago: ``Since the Soviet experiment proved to be a colossal
failure, the left is still searching for answers to today's social
problems _ but through the system and not through some utopian
notion that does not exist in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking _ the acceptance of democratic pluralism and
compromise, mixed with hefty dollops of self-criticism and the
rejection of old doctrines and platitudes _ is helping the left
re-emerge as a winning force not only here, but in much of the rest
of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Former Marxist guerrillas already participate in governing
coalitions in Venezuela and Bolivia, and they field mayors in many
cities and towns in El Salvador. Polls indicate that Tabare
Vasquez, the Uruguayan socialist candidate, could do well in the
presidential election in October, at least in a first round of
voting. More moderate Social Democrats stand a good chance of
taking power in Argentina in a coalition with centrists. And
Ricardo Lagos, a Socialist Party presidential candidate, is running
strongly in Chile, where elections are scheduled in December; if he
were to win, he would become the first Socialist Party president in
Chile since Salvador Allende, who was elected in 1970 and deposed
in a coup in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   As in Europe, the left in Latin America is doing well with
voters in part because it has shucked old ideological trappings and
moved toward the center. But here the changes are more abrupt; this
is, after all, a region known for its polarized, muscular and often
murderous style of politics. The belligerent style of the old left
is fading in South America's most modern countries, even while
guerrilla forces of varying sizes continue to struggle on in
Colombia, Peru and Mexico, where establishing order has been
complicated by drug trafficking. The idea that politics is an
alternative to violence _ and not that violence is a mere extension
of politics, as Mao and Che Guevara preached _ is growing in
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Even Fidel Castro says the days of armed struggle in Latin
America are over. In his case and perhaps the cases of others, this
may be more a change of tactics than a change of heart. But even if
so, it is a reflection that the world itself has changed. Castro's
Cuba no longer has the wherewithal to support revolutionary
insurgencies. And even before the Cold War was over, the United
States began shifting its favor away from repressive right-wing
military regimes.
</P>
<P>
   In most Latin American countries, this has brought about a less
polarized climate in which leftists have far more space to operate
than they had a generation ago. Then, they were being cut down in
the streets or spirited out of their beds by goon squads, never to
be seen again.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, centrists and economic conservatives were the first
beneficiaries of the move away from military government in the
1980s. But today most of Latin America is in a recession, with
unemployment rising and the gap between the rich and poor growing,
and many voters are looking for alternatives. Latin voters also
seem to be angrier than ever about corruption in government, an
issue that has hurt traditional ruling parties. When the left draws
closer to the center, it looks more and more like an attractive
option.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Berlin Wall has fallen and the left has changed,'' said
Jaime Estevez, a Chilean economist and a leading adviser to Lagos.
``The Socialist Party under Allende was like an Eastern European
party, and many Chileans felt threatened by it. Nixon and Kissinger
supported the coup against Allende, but it is very simplistic to
say they were the sole cause of the coup. Now we are a Western
European-style party and only the most politicized on the right
feel threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagos, a mild-mannered Chilean Socialist running in a coalition
with the Christian Democratic party, is leading strongly in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new world,'' Lagos laughed as he described his career.
He was on his way to Moscow as Allende's ambassador to the Soviet
Union when Gen. Augusto Pinochet overthrew Allende's elected
government 26 years ago with support from Washington. Now Pinochet
is under house arrest in London awaiting possible extradition to
Spain to stand trial on charges of crimes against humanity, and
Lagos has cordial relations with the U.S. Embassy in Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos said the Socialist Party had changed not only because the
Cold War had ended, but because few people in the party liked what
they saw when they were in exile in places like East Germany and
the Soviet Union during the 1970s and 1980s. Places like Sweden and
Spain, according to Lagos, ``were far more agreeable'' for those in
exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's our work now?'' Lagos asked rhetorically. ``Without
affecting investment, savings and economic growth, we need to
produce a society a little more just with less of a social gap and
more equality of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A little more just'' is hardly a call to man the ramparts _
but it is the kind of phrasing leftist politicians use these days
to calm voters. The political pitch is different from country to
country, of course, and some on the Latin American left have still
not dropped the old oratory.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with the Argentine daily Clarin, Jorge
Briceno, the military commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC, threatened the United States for increasing
its military involvement against Colombian drug trafficking and, by
extension, against the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not Yugoslavia,'' he said. ``If the United States
intervenes it will be another Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in Colombia, the left is reaching for new messages and
symbols. In July, another leader of the FARC held a summit in his
jungle headquarters with none other than Richard Grasso, president
of the New York Stock Exchange. The picture of Comandante Raul
Reyes warmly embracing an icon of American capitalism was surely a
staged gesture to show reasonableness, and it made the front pages
of virtually every newspaper in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Grasso invited Reyes to make a tour of Wall Street. The
guerrilla leader is said to be thinking the invitation over.

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Ibrahim Rugova, where have you been?
</P>
<P>
   In the two months since NATO won the war in Kosovo and the young
fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army proceeded to grab power, the
diffident and puzzling pacifist who was once considered Kosovo's
president made only one flying visit to the province. Instead,
Ibrahim Rugova remained in Italy, leaving his party and his
reputation to wither. Only on Friday, after direct prodding from
Western leaders, did he return to the province to live, or so he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova has had reasons to stay away, some of his own making. But
they reflect the extraordinary difficulty that NATO and the United
Nations face, despite their theoretically unlimited powers, in
trying to build any fair, democratic political order in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A 55-year-old literary critic educated at the Sorbonne, Rugova
was the moderate around whom the world's hopes for reconciliation
in Kosovo revolved for nearly 10 years. Back when Yugoslavia first
began to fall apart, Kosovar Albanians elected him as their leader
in secret (and thus not entirely credible) elections, and his
policy of Gandhi-like passive resistance to the Yugoslav government
was widely supported until about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, after Kosovo's extraordinary burst of violence,
Rugova's time looks to be over. He and his party are being pushed
aside by the hard young men of the Kosovo Liberation Army and their
political leader, Hashim Thaci, only 29, who at least tried to
fight the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington and the West also played an important role in the
decline of Rugova and the rise of Thaci, and thus in the
radicalization of Kosovo. Because Thaci has a history of
intolerance for dissent, many Albanians quietly wonder whether real
politics, moderate or otherwise, will be possible in Kosovo by the
time, a year or more away, when the United Nations and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe organize
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova remains popular among the middle-aged and the educated.
But he is a reluctant politician who dislikes pressing the flesh or
even uttering firm statements, and he has always been an annoying
figure for American diplomats. In February, when talks to reconcile
the Serbs and Kosovar Albanians were foundering at Rambouillet, the
Americans were happy to promote Thaci, rather than Rugova, as the
Albanians' chief negotiator. It was Thaci whom they backed as the
prime minister of a provisional government.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova has made many mistakes. He was passive in dealing with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and trusted in Milosevic's
promises. His policy of urging Kosovar Albanians to boycott Serbian
and Yugoslav elections was instrumental in keeping Milosevic in
power from at least 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Once NATO began bombing Serbia in March, Rugova criticized the
humanitarian catastrophe that befell Kosovo's Albanians, even as he
met with Milosevic during the war. His willingness to do so,
although he insists it was under duress, is widely believed to have
put his life in danger from supporters of Thaci and the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   And Rugova suffered a great loss with the killing in May of his
thoughtful adviser, Fehmi Agani, a man capable of talking to all
sides. Agani is nearly universally believed to have been killed by
the Serbian police, but the police still insist he was killed by
the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15, Rugova returned to Pristina to a welcoming crowd.
But he only stayed a few hours, refused to meet Western
peacekeepers and U.N. administrators and then quickly returned to
Italy, apparently objecting to the number of seats Thaci had
allocated to the KLA's political allies in a new Council for
Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, criticized
Rugova for remaining in Italy and not returning to Pristina ``to
play the role his own elections have entitled him to play.'' Even
before Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stopped in Rome to
deliver a similar request _ having visited Kosovo herself _ Rugova
admitted that Dini was right and promised to return.
</P>
<P>
   But his presence cannot erase his main failure, which was his
inability to win independence or even more autonomy from Milosevic,
creating a vacuum of frustration that made the rise of the Kosovo
Liberation Army inevitable. His position was undercut by the
failure of Washington to deal with the problem of Kosovo at the
1995 talks in Dayton that ended the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton shattered the Kosovars' expectations that their policy of
nonviolence would be rewarded, as well as their trust in the West.
The beneficiaries at Dayton were the fighters in Bosnia, not the
pacifists in Kosovo, weakening Rugova's authority considerably. The
Americans argued that there was no time to deal with Kosovo at
Dayton, but then the Clinton administration did little to deal with
it afterward, either. It was the summer of 1998 before the West
really took notice _ after the rise of the KLA had produced a
Serbian counter-terrorist offensive that was so brutal that even
the West could not turn away.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in its intensifying campaign against Milosevic _ and in
its mistaken belief that a few days of bombing would cause him to
yield over Kosovo _ the Clinton administration finally sealed
Rugova's political fate by embracing the KLA and Thaci at
Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   Albright devoted much of her attention there to Thaci, and her
close aide and spokesman, James Rubin, has taken on Thaci as a
project, conducting negotiations with him over the KLA's promises
to demilitarize.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason that Rugova was not in Pristina on
Thursday when Albright made a triumphal visit there, giving Thaci a
warm hug.
</P>
<P>
   While all that may help explain why Rugova kept away from Kosovo
for so long, it offers little hope that his return will rally the
forces of reconciliation and compromise. After so many deaths,
there is too much Albanian rage, and Rugova is too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Even members of his own party, the Democratic League of Kosovo,
are fed up with him now. His absence ``has caused us great harm,''
said Fadil Hysaj, one of the party's leaders. ``There can be no
more politics based purely on loyalty to one person.'' The future
of a moderate Kosovar politics, Hysaj suggested, was now at stake.

EXOTIC ANIMALS FEEL AT HOME IN VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With Hollywood next door and enough space to keep
prying eyes out of back yards, suburban San Fernando Valley
residents own nearly half of the licensed exotic animals citywide _
some so unusual they must be seen to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   Like Jan Giacinto's serval, Taroo, an African cat with a golden
coat and black spots that she is licensed to keep at her Tarzana
home with an Amur leopard and other no-so-wild wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a wild animal trust you gives you such an incredible
high and a wonderful feeling,'' said Giacinto as her cats roamed
freely like any house tabby. ``To be able to hug a tiger and
scratch a cheetah and for them to give you kisses on the face _
there is nothing like it.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Bob Dunn, who has a couple of dozen
chimpanzees, apes and zebras tucked away at his 5-acre Sylmar
ranch. His pets have appeared in movies such as ``Ace Ventura Pet
Detective II'' and ``The Jungle Book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've raised and housed Michael Jackson's chimp Bubbles since
he was a baby,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   As exotic as their animals, Giacinto and Dunn themselves are
rare: In a city of some 3.7million people, they are among only 97
people who hold wild animal permits, including Valley residents
with 43.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that is just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Lt. Annetta
Vernon, senior animal control officer for the Los Angeles City
Animal Care and Control Center. ``There are lots of exotic animals
and reptiles out there that are not under permit.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the recent discovery of a serval in a Woodland Hills back
yard. And last week, authorities found another house in Woodland
Hills with an animal farm of live piranhas, black widows and
rattlesnakes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more famous cases occurred in August 1997 when an
unlicensed boa constrictor swallowed a West Hills woman's Chihuahua
whole.
</P>
<P>
   Many exotic animals end up in unlicensed hands after being
smuggled into the United States. A snake can bring the seller $200,
and people will pay $10,000 for a Komodo dragon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles is the number one port for live pets and fish,''
said Mike Osborn, supervisory wildlife inspector for U.S. Fish and
Game.
</P>
<P>
   Giacinto, who is president of the 51-year-old, Tarzana-based
World Wildlife Preservation Society, estimates there are 500 to
1,000 people in the Valley who own unlicensed exotic pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of people in the Valley who have pets
illegally,'' said Giacinto, who has bred and sold white and orange
tigers, cheetahs and other wildcats for use in movies, television
shows and by magicians. ``I know a lot of people who have snakes
and hedgehogs who don't have permits.''
</P>
<P>
   The licensing of exotic animals is for their welfare, and
generally permits are issued only for animals used for educational
or commercial purposes, such as the movie and television industry,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The boa constrictor-Chihuahua incident sparked stricter
regulations that allow home inspections to ensure the animals'
cages are large enough and secure and that the animal is properly
cared for.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping them is not easy _ or cheap. For instance, Giacinto
feeds Taroo 1{ pounds of raw London broil steak every day.
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions in the Valley, alligators kept as people's
pets inside bathtubs outgrew their quarters, escaped and ended up
lounging in the home's swimming pool, said West Valley animal
shelter Lt. Richard Felosky, who helped fish the prehistoric beasts
out.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, a Valley resident discovered a bear wearing
a top hat in his front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, you say to yourself, This guy has had too much to
drink,'' said Louis Dedeaux, a senior animal control officer for
Los Angeles animal services. ``But when I got out there, it was a
bear with a top hat and a vest. It came from a circus.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 19, state Fish and Game officials took possession of an
African serval and a California bobcat in Woodland Hills because
they were not licensed. Giacinto said the owner of the animals _
who works in the movie industry _ called her for advice after his
animals were taken.
</P>
<P>
   She told him to get permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are his babies,'' said Giacinto. ``You see something
like that happen and it scares you. It would be like taking one of
my kids away from me. I would die.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people with permits are famous. Giacinto is
currently taking care of two of Cher's Bengal cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``She calls up all the time to see how they are doing,'' said
Giacinto, who has sold tigers to Las Vegas entertainers Siegfried &AMP;
Roy and to Jermaine Jackson, whose family is from Encino.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 105-member World Wildlife Preservation Society,
Giacinto and other members encourage people to get permits for
their animals and teach them how to properly care for their pets.
</P>
<P>
   The society recently held its monthly meeting at the Sylmar home
of 83-year-old Frank Inn, who gained fame in Hollywood as an animal
trainer for teaching Benji tricks and for animals that have
appeared on the television shows ``The Beverly Hillbillies,''
``Green Acres'' and ``The Addams Family.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also spent much of his life teaching others how to train
and care for animals. ``I now have a dog I call Benji the III. They
are talking about making another movie with him in it,'' Inn said.
</P>
<P>
   Giacinto knows the pleasures of owning a pet that gives its
owner unconditional love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fascinated by big cats all my life,'' Giacinto said.
``Ever since I was a little kid, I've adored cats. My mother had to
drag me out of `Tarzan.' I had dreams about swinging through the
jungle.''

SCIENTIST FINDS BLURRY LINE BETWEEN FRIENDLY TALK AND SECURITY
BREACH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At first, the questions from his Chinese hosts
seemed harmless enough to George Keyworth, a nuclear scientist.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1980, and Keyworth, the chief physicist at Los Alamos
National Laboratory, was in China to lecture at a research center,
happy to engage in some simple academic give and take. He knew the
audience was filled with Chinese nuclear weapons experts eager for
insights into American weapons designs, but he figured he could
handle whatever questions they threw at him.
</P>
<P>
   Keyworth had traveled to China to lecture on his research into
fusion energy _ not about nuclear weapons. He was determined to
stick to his topic, and not wander into loose talk about secret
information. But a congressional committee, as it investigated
leaks of nuclear secrets to China, has charged that the episode,
while inadvertent, bordered on a negligent breach of security by a
senior scientist.
</P>
<P>
   In China, Keyworth found himself being peppered with
increasingly detailed inquiries that related directly to nuclear
weapons. Benign inquiries about fusion and astrophysics soon gave
way to pointed requests for information about such highly
classified matters as the ignition conditions of the hydrogen
isotopes deuterium and tritium _ and about the then-new neutron
bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Keyworth now says he fended off the demands for specifics, but
he did respond in one instance by offering an analogy. Deuterium
and tritium ignite at such low temperature levels, he told the
audience, that you could just about get ignition by dropping them
on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Keyworth came home believing he had avoided the traps laid out
for him by the Chinese, and had not betrayed any American secrets.
Yet he was concerned enough to report the incident to Los Alamos
and to intelligence officials. ``When I came back, I used this
example many times to show how completely benign conversations
could turn into uncomfortable situations in China,'' Keyworth said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, Keyworth moved on to the high-profile post as
science adviser to President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   But 19 years later, the episode was resurrected by a House
select committee that investigated China's nuclear thefts and
illicit technology transfers. In its May report, the committee
mentioned it _ without identifying Keyworth _ as a cautionary
example of the security risks that American scientists confront in
dealing with China.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Keyworth case underscores how international
exchanges often lead government scientists into gray areas, where
the line between vigorous scientific debate and the compromise of
national security information can be blurred. Scientists from
government weapons labs involved in exchanges in China and other
countries need useful and creative discussions with fellow
scientists, but must constantly remember the difference between
stretching the rigid bounds of classification and breaking them.
</P>
<P>
   And it also shows how scientists view their own foreign
scientific exchanges differently than do counterintelligence
watchdogs.
</P>
<P>
   In the congressional report, from the select committee chaired
by Rep. Chris Cox, R-Calif., a scientist is depicted as having
crossed an obscure line. The report states that ``the incident
involved the inadvertent, bordering on negligent, disclosure of
classified technical information by a U.S. scientist lecturing'' in
China. The report adds that the scientist ``was pressured'' by
counterparts there ``to provide a solution to a nuclear
weapons-related problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than decline,'' the report says, ``the scientist, who
was aware of the clear distinction between the classified and
unclassified technical information that was under discussion,
provided an analogy.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials at several government agencies confirmed that
the reference in the Cox report is to the Keyworth episode.
</P>
<P>
   Keyworth says he is outraged that the episode has been
resurrected in the Cox report in a way that he says is distorted.
He says that no one from the Cox committee tried to reach him to
discuss the matter. And he strongly denies that he provided any
classified information to the Chinese during the exchange. The
analogy he provided was nothing more than simple physics and was
``absolutely unclassified,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I most certainly did hold scientific discussions in China, and
many of those discussions did run right up against the rules of
propriety, no question,'' Keyworth said. ``But I don't believe
those bounds were crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials say that the Cox committee was never told the
identity of the scientist, and only included the episode in the
report based on classified briefings it received, either from the
FBI or the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   Keyworth says he can think of no other incident that fits the
description in the Cox report.
</P>
<P>
   Several American officials say that the FBI did look into the
episode in the 1980s. The FBI ultimately decided that since
Keyworth had voluntarily described the episode when he returned
there was no reason to pursue the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Keyworth recalled that not long after he left the White House in
January 1986 he was interviewed by FBI agents, who told him they
were interested in learning more about the growing contacts between
Los Alamos and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI said they had observed that a considerable amount of
exchange had been developing between Los Alamos and China, and they
said they were curious about its nature and content,'' Keyworth
said. ``I discussed that with them, I believed to their
satisfaction. But the question of an improper exchange of
information was never raised. I dealt with them on a helpful
basis.''

WHITE HOUSE RELEASES GLOWING DATA ON WELFARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Mont., Wis., Iowa, Wyo., Md., N.C., N.M., Pa., Ark.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thirty-five percent of all adult welfare recipients
were working last year, or actively preparing themselves for work,
and all states met the basic work requirements of the 1996 welfare
law, the Clinton administration said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration issued new data on state welfare programs
ranking the states' performance in moving people from welfare to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon, Montana, Wisconsin, Iowa and Wyoming reported the
highest employment rates for welfare recipients, with more than 55
percent working at least 20 hours a week in each state.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland, North Carolina, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Arkansas
reported the lowest rates, with fewer than 20 percent of recipients
working. But these states, like most of the nation, have
substantially reduced the number of people on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton plans to cite these data on Tuesday when he
goes to Chicago for a conference of the Welfare to Work
Partnership, a group of business executives committed to hiring
welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Reed, the president's chief domestic policy adviser, said
Clinton would urge the executives to redouble their efforts and
``finish the job of welfare reform.'' He said the president would
also admonish Republicans in Congress to keep their hands off the
money promised to states in the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   Each state is entitled to a fixed amount of federal welfare
money, regardless of how many people qualify for assistance.
Welfare rolls have shrunk far more than most officials expected,
and $4 billion of federal welfare money remains unclaimed at the
Treasury. Some Republicans in Congress, seeking money for other
federal programs, have said they may take some of it, an idea
opposed by governors of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some in Congress want to break faith with the states,'' Reed
said. ``We will lock arms with the governors against that notion.
The job of welfare reform won't be done until we move every
able-bodied person from welfare to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says the proportion of welfare recipients who are
working is four times as high today as in 1993, when he took
office.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's report provides the first full year of work data
available under the 1996 law. Every state and the District of
Columbia met the basic work requirements for 1998. The law
stipulates that 30 percent of adults on welfare should work at
least 20 hours a week, but the requirement is relaxed in states
that have substantially cut their caseloads, as most have.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the administration reported that most states had
met the work requirements for 1997, when 25 percent of welfare
recipients were supposed to be working. Those data were based on
just three months of experience, and not all states had to file
reports.
</P>
<P>
   New York state, with 37.5 percent of its adult welfare
recipients working last year, was close to the national average.
Connecticut, at 41.4 percent, was above the average, while New
Jersey, at 26.5 percent, was below. Florida, California and
Illinois were close to the average, with rates from 35 percent to
38 percent.
</P>
<P>
   States are subject to financial penalties if they do not meet
the work requirements. But a little-known feature of the law can
radically reduce the requirements for states that have sharply
reduced their welfare rolls. If, for example, a state has reduced
its caseload by 25 percent since 1995, the proportion of welfare
recipients required to work in 1998 is reduced by 25 percentage
points. So just 5 percent of recipients must be working.
</P>
<P>
   This feature of the law completely offset the federal work
requirement in states where the caseload dropped more than 30
percent from 1995 to 1998. That happened in five states, Indiana,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Wisconsin and Wyoming. As a matter of state
policy, those states continued their aggressive efforts to help
welfare recipients find work.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of the states would have met the work
requirements for 1998 without any special credit or dispensation,
because more than 30 percent of their welfare recipients were
working.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, White House officials said, Clinton will plead with
Congress once again to provide more money for child care. The
administration says the demand for child care is growing as more
parents enter the work force.
</P>
<P>
   When the Welfare to Work Partnership was created in May 1997,
many people saw it as a symbolic gesture by public-spirited
companies. But on Friday, Eli Segal, its president, said: ``This is
not about charity or corporate responsibility. It's about the
bottom line.''

<P>
   BIROBIDZHAN, Russia _ Zhuang Yimin reaches into the pigpen, and
pulls out a piglet, which squeals frantically as he clips its tiny
teeth with gardening shears. He drops it onto its mother's ample
belly, and picks up its sibling for another deft display of the pig
management skills he brought here from Harbin, China.
</P>
<P>
   His boss this summer is Viktor V. Shubin, 45, a former land
surveyor who decided to try his hand at private farming in 1991,
the year the Communist lid finally came off the Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Russian Far East, private farming is a calling only
for the brave. Shubin has made a go of it, but in the neighboring
Amur region, Sergei Kitayev gave up farming after two years and is
driving a taxi, his dreams defeated by an economy that has given
little support to enterprising farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Vitaly Komlov, director of the Birobidzhan agriculture
department, said that of the original pioneers who staked out land
in the early 1990s here, only a fraction _ about 350 _ had stuck it
out. Many have steadily expanded their domains _ private farms now
account for 35,000 acres compared with 6,200 in the mid-90s. But
their farms make up less than 10 percent of the region's arable
land. The rest is held by the rickety remnants of the old Soviet
collective farm system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very difficult climatic conditions here,'' Komlov
said, ``and a lot of farmers weren't able to handle the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Shubin's success is due in large part to the tips learned from
Chinese seasonal workers, who showed him first how to raise
vegetables, then watermelons and now pigs. In addition to Zhuang
and his wife, who work with his 80 sows and their offspring, he has
hired another 36 Chinese workers. They spend their nights in a
dormitory on his farm and long days in the fields, carefully
coaxing watermelon plants through holes in the plastic sheeting
that keeps the soil moist.
</P>
<P>
   All together, about 600 Chinese farm workers are in Birobidzhan.
The region was settled by Russian Jews sent here by Stalin in the
1920s. It is still officially known as the Jewish autonomous
district, although after steady emigration to Israel and the West,
only 10,000 of its 210,000 residents are Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement with the Chinese appears to have worked well for
everyone, at least on Shubin's farm, an untidy spread of sheds,
equipment and rutted roads 20 miles outside the town of
Birobidzhan.
</P>
<P>
   Zhuang and his wife, Lizhe, 35, make about $120 a month _ or
twice their regular wage in Harbin. They work long hours, but as
Zhuang said through an interpreter, ``I didn't come here to travel,
but to work.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Other Chinese workers said that with the money they make during
six months of work in Russia, they can take six months off at home,
tending to their houses and garden plots. In exchange for their
labor, Shubin initially gave the Chinese employees a share of the
crop, selling the rest on contract to the Russian military and
other government organizations. Now as China's appetite for Russian
timber increases, he is offering his Chinese partners cut lumber,
felled from his forests and cut by Russian workers on his farm.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Here in Birobidzhan as in the rest of Russia, farmers do not
actually own land. They either rent it with 50-year leases or are
allowed to hold it for themselves and their heirs. After eight
years of economic reform, there is still no law regulating the sale
of land.
</P>
<P>
   Shubin, for instance, insists that his 2,200 acres _ which
include farmland, forests and bogs _ are his, outright. But he is
not allowed to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   In some parts of Russia, land _ even under these uncertain terms
_ is a valuable commodity. Here in the Far East, in a region that
gets hit alternately by blizzards and monsoons, where most of the
land is forested or soggy, or both, the local government seems
almost willing to give it away _ or to rent it for as little as 60
cents a year per hectare, about two-and-a-half acres.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Starting with 250 acres, Shubin at first went into beekeeping.
But when that venture failed, he moved on to vegetables _ then a
rare commodity in the Far East, where agriculture traditionally has
been large scale and mechanized, and unsuited for labor-intensive
cash crops.
</P>
<P>
   In the Soviet era, vegetables were shipped in from western
Russia, and fruit from the Caucasus, at subsidized prices. Then,
when the border with China opened, Chinese traders rushed in to
fill the vacuum, at cheaper prices.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more and more Russian farmers here are growing vegetables
and watermelons themselves, borrowing Chinese techniques. ``They
have centuries of experience at raising vegetables,'' Komlov said,
``and Russians are ready to learn from them.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Shubin, 45, and his wife, Tatyana, a physician, have no
complaints. They drive a Japanese car, live in a newly acquired
house in Birobidzhan and have taken vacations in Thailand. One of
the farm's newly built sheds is stacked high with wooden barrels to
store pickled cucumbers and cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Shubin plans to plant rice. ``The Chinese grow rice
on the other side of the Amur River,'' he said. ``There is no
reason why we can't too.''
</P>
<P>
   But for every success story like Shubin's, there is a sorrier
tale, told by a farmer who did not clear the hurdles of a rigid
agricultural system that has still not adapted to a free market and
the wild gyrations of that market here.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the tale told by Kitayev, who lives several hundred
miles away in the Amur region. Like Shubin, he decided in 1991 to
strike out on his own, moving from the Pacific island of Sakhalin
to the empty spaces along the Amur. Like Shubin, he began with 250
acres, on the outskirts of the city of Blagoveshchensk.
</P>
<P>
   He planted buckwheat and soybeans, he raised cattle _ 40 head _
and pigs, 56 in all. He borrowed from local banks to buy equipment,
and he lined up contracts for the sale of his crops.
</P>
<P>
   But for everything he did right, something went wrong. The
interest rates on credit shot up, at one point by 100 percent a
year. The price of animal feed also skyrocketed. Some of his seed
stock disappeared when he put it in the shed of a local collective
farm for safekeeping. And when he went to sell his harvest, his
buyers balked at the contracted price.
</P>
<P>
   He stuck it out for two seasons, but when the soybean contracts
collapsed he turned his crop into oil and sold it himself, in
five-quart bottles, to North Korean and Chinese workers who live in
these parts.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kitayev is back driving a taxi, which was his first job
as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   Would he ever go back to commercial farming? Not now, said
Kitayev. The disappointments were too great, too bitter. ``Ten
years ago, there was an incentive to try,'' he said. `` I was an
optimist. But even optimists get tired.''

   GORNJE OBRINJE, Yugoslavia _ The green countryside here is
strangely quiet; the sounds of children only intermittently pierce
the silence. The Yugoslav tanks and Serbian police cars that
intimidated the Kosovo Albanians who live here are gone and NATO's
troops are scarcely felt or even needed.
</P>
<P>
   The homes of the Delijaj family, brick dwellings scattered along
a dirt track, are also quiet as the men and women, seemingly
drained of emotion and uncertain of the future, rebuild lives
wrecked by a year of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months ago, 21 members of the extended Delijaj family were
killed in a gully here, their bodies left strewn across the forest
floor. After a summer of guerrilla warfare against the Serbian
police, it was a dramatic display of Serbian violence, the mass
killing that first propelled NATO into threatening to bomb
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing eventually came, in March. When it did, the
survivors of the killings here, unlike many other Kosovo Albanians
who fled to neighboring Macedonia and Albania, stayed put in this
Drenica Valley region, a heartland of the Albanians' Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The men, led by Imer Delijaj, 39, the young patriarch of the
family, fought, apparently prevailing in three battles against the
Serbian police and the Yugoslav army but then losing control of the
village in the final month.
</P>
<P>
   The women, the elderly and the children were dispatched to the
nearby town of Glogovac, where they holed up in a relative's house,
surviving on rations ferried from the village at night by Delijaj's
brother Enver. The village's teen-age boys, a favorite target of
the Serbian forces, were sent to hide in the Berisha Mountains
where, Delijaj said, they scavenged from nature.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the war is over, Delijaj, who said he was the local
commander covering seven villages for the Kosovo Liberation Army,
is proud of one thing.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every house in the village was badly damaged during the
fighting and six of his soldiers died, he said. But here, there was
no repeat of the killings last September. Those who were unarmed
survived, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to defend the young men during the war,'' he
said, as he sat on a cushion on the floor of his house. ``In some
villages many young men were killed in massacres. We sent ours into
hiding.''
</P>
<P>
   In the village, sustenance came from three cows and a cache of
flour. In the Berisha hills, the young men learned to survive on
grass and milk. ``It's very difficult for a human to die from
starvation,'' Delijaj said.
</P>
<P>
   In September he lost 10 members of his immediate family,
including his wife and three of his four children, in the killings
carried out by the Serbs, apparently in retaliation for many deaths
in house-to-house fighting with the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Delijaj said his loss made him more determined in the fighting
this spring. Now he weighs his grief against the outcome: a Kosovo
regained for the Albanians by NATO bombs, nominally administered by
the United Nations and NATO-led peacekeepers _ a Kosovo formally
still part of Yugoslavia yet rapidly losing its Serbian minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost a lot, and have a lot of pain that can't be
recovered,'' he said. ``But the weapon on my shoulder was worth it
because someone had to die. It is much better that 10 people of my
family die and we are freed from Serbian policemen always coming to
ask whether we have weapons. It's a national war _ if you don't
sacrifice, then you can't take the gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Delijaj _ who has remarried and served lunch of fresh
vegetables and bread prepared by his new wife, Nexhmije, to several
visitors _ expressed doubts about how permanent or how fulfilling
the victory might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a game of waiting,'' he said. ``It's not clear
from the agreements that Kosovo will be free in 10 years. There's
not a single clear definition for the future of Kosovo. It's not
freedom if you are free for one day. This country will be run by
NATO and the United Nations and the borders guarded by Serbia. And
then we go to the woods again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As an example of what he sees as the hold Serbia keeps over
Kosovo, Delijaj said that thousands of Kosovo Albanians were still
being held in jails in Serbia after being sent there at the start
of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Western human rights organizations have reported that at least
2,000 Kosovo Albanians are in Serbian jails. Delijaj has no
evidence but is convinced the number is higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not freedom when our prisoners are held in Serbia,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Until he is certain that Kosovo will be independent and safe
from Serbian control, he will keep the best of his weapons, he
said. So far, he said, he and his fellow fighters in the village
have complied with NATO requests to hand in weapons, but _ in a
pattern believed common throughout much of the province, where it
is traditional to bear arms _ have turned in only their worst.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Delijaj said he no longer considered himself a soldier in
the rebel force. ``I said I would remain if they paid me,'' he
said. He does not want to be a policeman, as may other rebel
fighters who meet standards being established by the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he is considering returning to work at the
ferrous-nickel plant in Glogovac. He was employed there as an
electrician until 1992, when he was laid off, along with many other
Albanians, by the Serbian management. Now that many Serbs have
left, he will be able to reclaim his rightful job, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Delijaj seemed unimpressed by any of the political leaders in
Kosovo. ``I have one thought about Rugova, Krasniqi, Thaci and
Qosja,'' he said, reciting the last names of four prominent Kosovo
Albanian leaders representing competing streams of political
thought. ``They should take directions from the people and if they
were together it would be better for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also unimpressed by the quality of the ministries of the
so-called provisional government of the Kosovo Liberation Army. He
went, he said, to one of the ministries where he had friends from
the guerrilla force to find out whether forensic experts would come
to examine the bodies of his slain family members. ``I went three
times and I still can't get an answer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If he can find the money, Delijaj said, he would like to conduct
a reburial. But first, he would like the Finnish pathologist Helena
Ranta, who came to the grave site last December but was barred by
the Serbs from doing much work, to return.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, he would like the exhumed bodies taken to a safer
place than the soggy ground near his house where they were hastily
buried last September and where today a tangle of wildflowers and
tall grass covers the makeshift graves.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong's victory last Sunday in the three-week Tour de
France was especially dramatic because of his return from
testicular cancer that had spread to his abdomen, lungs and brain.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong would never have ridden this year in bicycle
racing's most storied race, let alone win it, except for one
exhausting week in April 1998 on the roads and mountains of western
North Carolina with two exceptional friends.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's doctors say the cancer is gone now. His racing
career would have been gone, too, but for the rescue effort of
Chris Carmichael and Bob Roll, who subtly showed him how he could
help himself by racing again.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael has coached Armstrong since Armstrong was a teen-ager
on the U.S. national team. Roll is a longtime friend of both
Carmichael and Armstrong. He has ridden in four Tours de France and
now, at age 38, races mountain bikes.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's cancer was diagnosed in October 1996 and arrested by
two operations and four intense one-week chemotherapy sessions. He
sat out all of 1997, returned to racing in 1998, quit an
early-season race in France and flew home to Austin, Texas, ready
to retire from the sport.
</P>
<P>
   In telephone interviews last week _ Carmichael from France and
Roll from Denver _ reflected on what happened to change Armstrong's
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never seemed comfortable in Europe,'' Carmichael said. ``He
wanted to ride, but I think because everybody wanted him to. He was
saying, `Cycling is not that important to me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came back, I saw he had never given himself a chance
to decompress. You go through what he did as a racer; you never let
doubt enter your mind. You just pound through it. Then, all of a
sudden, you're not racing, and things like brain surgery and
chemotherapy become more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're an office worker and get sick like that, you just
don't go back to work and pick up a pencil. Things are not the
same. Lance needed to understand that life would be different. He
needed time to sort things out. When he did, he realized he
couldn't quit that way, that if he was going to end his career he
had to find a race to end it.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong picked the U.S. pro championship in Philadelphia that
June for his final race. Carmichael had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought if he committed to one race, the desire might come
back to race again,'' Carmichael said. ``And if it didn't, who said
he had to race again? But we said if you're going to race even once
more, you have to be in shape. Let's put together a training camp
and get ready.''
</P>
<P>
   At Carmichael's suggestion, they decided to train out of Boone,
N.C. In 1995 and 1996, Armstrong won the Tour DuPont, then
America's leading stage race, partly because he rode so well in the
North Carolina hills, especially Beech Mountain near Boone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that getting him on those roads,'' Carmichael said,
``he would start reflecting that he was back where he started to
become the king of American cycling. He could get good memories
flowing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong needed a training partner. When Carmichael suggested
Roll, Armstrong said, ``That's perfect.'' And when Armstrong called
Roll, Roll's wife, Chiara, urged her husband to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bob has incredible talent and personality,'' she said.
``He could boost anybody's morale. Bob made Lance remember all the
good things about cycling.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael was sure that would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance wasn't going to get down with Bob around,'' Carmichael
said. ``We knew he would be inspiring for Lance. Bob is loose, with
no anxiety. Riding with Bob on those hills could get Lance's
thoughts rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Roll recalled a conversation with Armstrong the previous summer
at a bike show in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was at a real low point,'' Roll said. ``He couldn't get a
job and was pretty dismayed at the way the bike industry and teams
had come to treat him. The Tour de France was the last thing on his
mind. One thing that had sustained him when he was sick was the
thought of racing again. His goal was to be a healthy, functioning
person, but once he got to Europe in 1998 I think he had serious
doubts about the viability of the whole racing thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, Armstrong and Roll began a training camp far from
a phone, far from any modern comforts. As Roll put it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris wanted somebody to remind Lance where the sport came
from, what the sport meant to people and to Lance and his
generation of riders. We had no specific agenda. We'd ride those
mountains for seven or eight hours a day, and we talked as we rode.
We talked about the future and what Lance could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trained hard in miserable weather conditions, but I don't
care if it's raining or hot, if I'm in France or Morocco, I just
love to be on a bike. Any day on a bike is a good day. Lance picked
up on that, and we rode with a little more intensity every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we went along, I tried to remind Lance how gifted he is as
a bike racer, how important it was for his peace of mind that he
try his hardest and take whatever comes, whether it's the Tour or a
local criterium in Texas. If you make your best effort, you should
be satisfied. If you turn away from the sport without having made
your best effort, it would always bug you.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael recalled that week in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just the three of us,'' he said. ``They rode their
bikes hard and I followed in a car. We rented a cabin, and at night
I did the cooking and they washed the dishes. In seven days, they
rode over 800 miles, mostly climbs. There was no flat land there.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, after seven hours of riding, we did Beech Mountain.
Lance hit it and left Bob just as they got into the meat of the
climb. Lance's name was still painted on the road from two years
before, and that reminded him of the good times.
</P>
<P>
   ``April was beginning and it was 40 degrees and raining. Lance
was riding and I was yelling at him, just like in a race. I said,
`Want to get in the car? There are 20 miles to go.' He said, `No
way.'''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Carmichael said, Armstrong changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he realized he wanted to race and he would do it for
his reasons,'' Carmichael said. ``I had a feeling he would be
stronger than before. I wasn't thinking he would win the Tour de
France, but I thought he would come back with a new attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those things you don't plan. You just have to go
in there for the right reasons. It's all a fairy tale right now,
but you don't go in there thinking you're writing a fairy tale. It
was a great time for him. It was closing a wound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if he was going to die. Here was a kid I started
coaching when he was 17 and I didn't know if I was going to his
funeral. But he came back and I coached him and cooked for him.
That's real satisfying. That week in the mountains brought him
back.''
</P>
<P>
   When the accounts from Carmichael and Roll were relayed to
Armstrong, he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That week was the turning point, absolutely,'' Armstrong said.
``Everything about it was special _ the people, the conversations,
the setting, the lousy weather, the cabin. I learned there that I
still loved racing and training. I learned I really loved it.'' &QL;

BRADLEY POSES A QUIET THREAT TO GORE'S RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 11th graph to change `next month' to `this month')  
 (ATTN: Iowa, N.H.)  (js) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley's presidential
campaign headquarters in Iowa, which he opened here last week, is a
dark, spartan affair whose only adornments are a few stray
basketballs signed by the former star of the New York Knicks. The
rent: $250 a month.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Vice President Al Gore opened his campaign
headquarters two months ago, a sprawling, sleek space in a choice
neighborhood here with cool gray decor and state-of-the-art
computers. The rent: $4,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the Gore operation is far more impressive, and
has double the staff members. Yet impressions can be deceptive.
Bradley is assembling a staff of veterans, and husbanding his
resources so vigilantly that Rob Tully, the Iowa Democratic
chairman, said no one should doubt that the former senator poses an
unmistakable challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is a race here,'' Tully said. ``I would probably
give the advantage to Gore right now in terms of organizing. But
the reality is Bradley's done a great job catching up to the vice
president. I told Bill Bradley that he could win the Iowa caucuses.
He could.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a common refrain, not only in battleground states like
Iowa and New Hampshire but among political players in Washington:
The Bradley campaign is no fly-by-night insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Methodically and with quiet discipline, Bradley and his aides
are assembling an organization that is far more sophisticated about
presidential politics _ and more flush with money _ than those run
by past candidates who sought to topple a front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore is still the heavy favorite for the nomination, and
has an overwhelming lead in most early polls, Bradley is now viewed
as a plausible alternative by the Democratic establishment _ and a
contender who, at the very least, will force the vice president
into a costly and possibly bloody battle for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's operation is stocked with veterans of Democratic
campaigns who say they have learned from the mistakes of the past
and are determined not to repeat them. Already, they have begun
aggressive efforts to build state organizations and put their
delegates on slates in New York and other states where it is a
painstaking process that has eluded many candidates in the past.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday in New Hampshire, for example, Bradley led more than
200 volunteers in a door-to-door drive to meet and identify
potential supporters in the state's primary. Such an effort is
highly unusual this early, especially for a candidate who is not
the front-runner. Many of the volunteers were recruited on the
Internet, which the Bradley campaign is using as an organizing
tool. In all, the campaign said 500 Bradley volunteers knocked on
the doors of 35,000 houses in New Hampshire last week.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the dexterity of the Bradley operation is
that officials of the AFL-CIO said that Bradley's energetic,
behind-the-scenes intervention had helped persuade leaders of the
politically powerful federation not to make an early endorsement of
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has devoted so much energy to courting labor
that it was practically a given that he would win an early
endorsement from the federation, beginning with the recommendation
by executive committee this month. But now, AFL-CIO officials say,
the committee's vote has been put off.
</P>
<P>
   Labor's endorsement of Gore is still likely. But the delay plays
into the Bradley strategy of undermining the notion that Gore's
nomination is inevitable _ and gives the campaign precious time to
cultivate union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like Bradley's any better on trade than Gore is,''
said Steve Rosenthal, political director of the AFL-CIO ``But
Bradley has been working this very hard. There are some people
saying, `This guy deserves a chance to be heard and has shown he's
a pretty serious candidate.' You have people in there who really do
understand how to work with the labor movement. It's made some
people look twice.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Now that an organizational structure is taking shape, Bradley is
entering a new phase of his campaign, where he is expected to be
more visible on the national stage. After rejecting requests for
months from national television programs in a calculated effort to
keep his profile low _ and refusing to lay out detailed positions
on any issues except gun control and campaign finance _ he will
appear on Sunday on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, the low-key and sometimes plodding Bradley
is expected to reach out to liberals as he addresses such issues as
education, foreign policy and universal health insurance _ matters
that Gore has discussed in great detail.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Berman, Bradley's campaign chairman, said that he had
studied other presidential candidates who had taken on a
front-runner _ including Ronald Reagan in 1976, Edward M. Kennedy
in 1980 and Gary Hart and John Glenn in 1984 _ and that his
organization would be vastly more prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're Gary Hart but we have money,'' said Will Robinson,
Bradley's senior adviser, who was a top campaign official for
Walter F. Mondale in 1984 and Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. ``We're
Gary Hart but we're putting together a structure and an
organization and a full slate. We're Gary Hart but we know the
rules.''

   The most concrete sign of the potency of the Bradley
organization is that it has amassed nearly $12 million this year _
compared with almost $18 million for the vice president _ and has
spent its resources far more carefully. Gore has only about $2
million more than Bradley in the bank. That means that the Bradley
campaign has the financial capacity to be competitive through at
least the first round of contests.
</P>
<P>
   A convincing testament that Bradley is being taken seriously
comes not from his campaign but from his opponent's. Steve
Hildebrand, Gore's Iowa director, sounded envious as he reeled off
names of his friends on the Bradley campaign, including Sen. Paul
Wellstone of Minnesota and Robinson, Iowa field director for
Mondale in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what I'm worried about: This is such a family fight,
and he's got all these smart people,'' Hildebrand said. ``I know
how good they are. I wish I had Will to call to talk about this.
And Paul Wellstone wouldn't be a United States senator if it
weren't for caucus organizing. Paul gets it. He's on the phone all
the time calling Iowans.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most Democrats involved in the process argue that the
party's nomination is Gore's to lose. As an incumbent vice
president who has been plotting his campaign for years, Gore enjoys
numerous institutional advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Gore appears to have the support of most of the
so-called super delegates _ members of Congress, party officials
and others who will automatically be sent to the Democratic
convention and who account for about 20 percent of the total
delegates. As a result, Gore will likely start with almost 40
percent of the delegates he needs for the nomination. Gore, a
Tennessean, will also benefit from deep loyalty from blacks and
other minority groups as well as from white Southern Democrats who
will have a predisposition to back a fellow white Southerner.

<P>
   ``Any time you have two people on the ballot, there's a
possibility that either can win,'' said David Axelrod, a strategist
in Chicago who has advised the Gore campaign. ``But I think the
odds are very much in Gore's favor because of the many advantages
he brings to the race. Part of the Hart deal that made him so
strong in Iowa is that he snuck up on Mondale; there's no sneaking
up on the radar screen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone, who has endorsed Bradley, acknowledged that while
``he can do it _ it's still a big mountain to climb.'' The
senator's advisers are hard-pressed to explain how they could wrest
the super delegates from Gore.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Asked how Bradley could win over Southerners, Berman, his
campaign chairman, played down the former senator's New Jersey
base, saying: ``Even in the South, you drive down the street and
you see the same Blockbusters, the same McDonald's. Now, Wal-Marts
are in the Northeast. There are both regional differences and huge
commonalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Iowa, Gore has been far more active in signing up early
support. Already, he has captured the crucial endorsements from the
Iowa affiliates of the United Automobile Workers and the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   Hildebrand, the Gore director in Iowa, said of Bradley and his
people: ``I came here April 15 and he had all the momentum, he had
good crowds. But they didn't capitalize on it. It took them forever
to staff up. They could have stopped the UAW endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   Gina Glantz, Bradley's national campaign manager, acknowledged
there was concern that the campaign was slow to establish an office
in the state. ``There were people who really wanted us to get
going,'' she said. ``They were saying, `Hurry up! Hurry up!' I
understand their disappointment but we're not a campaign that looks
back.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Glantz, who was the field director for Mondale in 1984,
argued that by keeping costs down, the Bradley campaign may have
more to spend in the heat of the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Lucas, Bradley's Iowa campaign manager, who recalled several
underfinanced presidential campaigns he had worked on, said: ``The
secure funding is just an unbelievable benefit here. If you looked
at the odds, you'd have to go with the Vice President. But there
could be some big world event that just changes the nature of this
thing overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's advisers concede that the inviting climate for their
candidate is not merely of his own making but that they have
capitalized on a concern among some Democrats that Gore, whose lead
had seemed so insurmountable, has had a somewhat shaky start.
</P>
<P>
   ``That fact that there was this constant drumbeat of
inevitability made our achievements seem that much greater,'' Ms.
Glantz said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Bradley's rise is complicating life for
Gore, who is trying to set his sights on the leading Republican
contender, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Tully, the Iowa Democratic chairman, said: ``The vice
president's office asked me, `Why are you saying all these great
things about Bradley? Why don't you say nice things about us?' But
we're going to report it as we see it.''

<P>
   GOMA, Congo _ ``Lusaka dead?'' asked Bizima Karaha, a spiffy
rebel alternating between two cellular phones, then a third served
up like soup by a hovering assistant. ``What I can say is that the
Lusaka accord is suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   The accord, drafted last month, is the closest that the huge
African nation of Congo has come to peace since its most recent
rebellion began a year ago, on Aug. 2, 1998. The deal's complexity
is mind-bending, involving six countries charged with putting down
no fewer than nine guerrilla outfits that operate inside Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate obstacles are the three home-grown rebel
groups fighting to oust the president of Congo, Laurent Kabila.
When the accord was drafted in Lusaka, Zambia, the outside powers
who have, for various reasons, intervened in this Congo war signed
it. Three rebel groups, squabbling not over its substance but over
who among them should sign, did not.
</P>
<P>
   A second meeting, stretching over six days, tried to resolve the
controversy, but ended on Tuesday in Tanzania with no agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Many outside officials worry that this infighting will kill the
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our real concern is that if we don't get it in the very near
term, the whole process may unravel,'' said one Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   The dissension is perhaps inevitable. From the start, the rebels
have been mere allies of convenience, representing half a dozen of
the fractious constituencies inside Congo, from exiled
intellectuals to former officials under the dictatorship of Mobutu
Sese Seko, who held destructive sway over Congo for 30 years before
he was ousted from power in 1997 and then died.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the rebels operate on a second, more complex level: to
represent the interests of neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, which
support competing rebel groups with arms and troops.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears that all sides _ the rebels as well as their
sponsors _ are maneuvering for their roles in the next act in this
violent drama in Central Africa, whether it is peace or yet more
war.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the failure of the rebels to sign involves one
man, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, a soft-spoken professor who was
recently ousted as the leader of the rebel group called the
Congolese Rally for Democracy. Wamba dia Wamba has insisted that he
still sign, even though he no longer has any troops supporting him.
</P>
<P>
   But the new leaders of the group, known by its French initials,
RCD, refuse to sign if Wamba dia Wamba does.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters more complicated still, the leader of the third
group, Jean-Pierre Bemba, the son of one of Congo's biggest
businessmen, will not sign unless Wamba dia Wamba does.
</P>
<P>
   Karaha, a top official in the Rally for Democracy, accuses Wamba
dia Wamba of sacrificing peace for millions of people for his own
political gain.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent talks in Tanzania, Karaha said, ``I personally
asked Wamba, I said, `Professor Wamba, my dear colleague, do you
believe deep in your heart that you are the president of the RCD,
that you can sign the cease-fire and give orders that will be
respected?'
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer was `no.' Followed by a `but _ But I want to sign
with one of you guys.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then later in the talks, Karaha said, ``He said, `I want to sign
because I want guarantees for my future political career.' We said,
`Whoa, things are now starting to become a little clearer.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wamba dia Wamba, calling Karaha a ``liar,'' denied the
conversation ever took place.
</P>
<P>
   But he did say that who signs the document is important: the
signatories have an amplified voice in how the next step in the
Congo _ a national dialogue between Kabila, the rebels and other
opposition groups _ is shaped. He is essentially afraid of being
cut out of that debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way it can be guaranteed that someone who is not a
signatory can become a member of the national dialogue,'' he said
in an interview by satellite telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and other observers have no doubt the in-fighting is
real. Rwanda, which backs the Rally for Democracy, says that this
internal fight alone is blocking the signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It matters who gets power,'' said Emmanuel Ndahiro, a
spokesman for the Rwandan military and a top government official.
``They have an internal disagreement and it has to be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   But many outsiders believe that both Rwanda and Uganda could
force the groups to sign, if they chose. Just as Rwanda supports
the Rally for Democracy, Uganda is allied with Wamba dia Wamba and
Bemba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rebel groups are still dependent on their sponsors,'' the
Western diplomat said, discounting claims from Rwanda and Uganda
that they are powerless to influence their clients.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The question thus becomes: If they really want peace, why are
Rwanda and Uganda not forcing the rebels to sign?
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that they want to gain points internationally for
talking peace while still waging war against Kabila. Even since the
accord, the Rally for Democracy has continued to advance on the
diamond-producing city of Mbuji-Mayi and Bemba has made gains in
the northwest, while Kabila's troops resist.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory is that the failure to sign represents
maneuvering on the part of Rwanda and Uganda, against each other,
to influence the next government of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Rwanda in particular has made clear its interest
in Congo's internal politics. It says it entered the war to keep
its borders clear of militant Hutu, who carried out the killings of
at least half a million ethnic Tutsi there in 1994, then fled to
Congo. Since then, they have launched raids into Rwanda from Congo,
and Rwanda wants some control over the borderlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rwanda would like to have a way of having control over the new
regime that is going to come to Congo,'' Wamba dia Wamba said.
``One way of doing that is either to push through with the war or
to be in a position to control the national dialogue that is going
to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Without saying why, Karaha suggested that Uganda was to blame
because it has not asked Wamba dia Wamba to step aside. The Rally
for Democracy, Karaha noted, has no objection to including Uganda's
other ally, Bemba, in the peace document.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was 11:13 in the morning on Wednesday, and the
temperature was 88 degrees and climbing. Samuel Marrow, 74, had
risen with the sun, but now he wanted out of it. And so, as he had
over the course of the last 51 summers, he walked down Quincy
Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and over to
the former Tompkins Park, now known as Herbert Von King Park.
</P>
<P>
   A seat in the shade, a moment of mercy after a month of historic
heat, was all Marrow was looking for, and he found it where he
always had _ on the bench six strides inside the Greene Avenue
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   There, in the simple cool, he could see everything, looking back
in time as well as straight in front of him. On his right was the
tree from which several young boys were hanged in the gang wars of
the 1950s. To his left was a line of young children, the children
of the neighborhood's poor and working class, running sprints in
the sun, the temperature draining from them everything but their
smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to Brooklyn from North Carolina after the war,'' said
Marrow, who back then worked in a shipyard in Kearny, N.J. ``I'd
get home hot and dirty, but gather my kids and come here. Back
then, you could spend the night out in this park. It's always been
the coolest park in Brooklyn. There's a lot of history here.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the history, in many ways, of a certain kind of summer in
New York City, the summers lived out by children for whom a fancy
day camp is a pipe dream, summers lived out by fathers and
grandmothers for whom vacation is an absolutely local experience.
Across the city, there are parks and playgrounds, schoolyards and
street corners that have always served as improvised summer
retreats, unglamorous, but rich and fully used.
</P>
<P>
   They are found at the backs of falling-apart schools and
squeezed between housing projects, or, like Von King Park, standing
squarely at the center of a storied neighborhood of culture and
strife. And at midsummer, people are driven to them before
daybreak, and many don't leave until well past midnight, early
bedtimes seeming a needless cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   In those parks and schoolyards, people taste the modest, sweet
freedoms and comforts of shade and laughter, invented games, the
little dramas of romance and athletics. Of course, they are not
places of complete summer sanctity: There is commerce in drugs,
sometimes in revenge; people bring their dinner to the park, and
others roll dice; anger can rise like the heat, quickly and with
menace.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, when the temperature rose to 97 degrees, teen-agers
flirted openly, the strength of their hormones undefeated by the
heat. And on a center bench, the resident storytellers and wise
guys were in full voice, their tales driven by pride and nostalgia,
boredom, hope and the brown bags between their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it is smoldering everywhere else, there are places in
this park that can feel refrigerated,'' said Lemuel Mial, a Parks
Department official who has worked at the park since 1967. ``Of
course, it's not totally innocent, either. But this, I think, is
the bright green spot of the neighborhood. And summer here is going
day and night.''
</P>
<P>
   To spend 24 hot and unpredictable hours in Von King Park, then,
is to appreciate what that kind of summer of constraint and
creativity can feel like.
</P>
<P>
   6:17 a.m., 78 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Bill Crowder, 54, sat in a quadrangle of the day's first
sunlight and opened his flute case. It would be the sixth straight
day of temperatures over 90, the 28th day of a month that would
become the hottest ever recorded in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of like the gypsy of Bed-Stuy,'' he said. ``Actually,
I can play this flute in the house now. My new roommate doesn't
mind. But I have to come back to my roots to play. This park is my
roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after daybreak, Von King Park _ its name was changed in
1985 to honor the neighborhood advocate who had earned the
unofficial title of ``mayor of Bed-Stuy'' _ is populated by the
elderly, the unemployed and the ambitious, Tracy Moore's ambition
amounting to doing pull-ups on the playground bars before it got
too hot and before he had to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:49 a.m., John Stevens, 73, a former porter, began the
park's first game of checkers. ``It's too hot and too early to
think clearly,'' he said, laughing, ``but it ain't too hot or too
early to cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   The working people from the streets around the park _ it is
bordered by Greene, Lafayette, Marcy and Tompkins Avenues _ also
walk through, wearing the uniforms of hospital orderlies and
Sanitation Department workers. And they each steal a second or two
of breezy relief.
</P>
<P>
   Hard luck can bring people to the park, too. Ruben Gonzalez, 47,
played in the park as a child, and he remembered how he used to
come dressed in a suit and shoes with his father. Gonzalez had been
away for years, but returned to Von King Park when he was sent
there to work for his welfare check.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have improved the park a lot, created more things for
kids,'' he said. ``I brought my daughter here the other day. I told
her it wasn't like this when I was here. But I told her to sit
where I had sat. It felt good for me to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m., the sun had climbed up off Tompkins Avenue, a hot
coin rising in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Laurine Harrison, a grandmother and former bookkeeper, sat in a
swing, her pleasure nothing more lavish than to stretch her arms
and legs. And Eddie Vick, 66, a former boxer, walked with his
grandson, his shirt soaked across his broad shoulders, his
grandson's hand lost in his aging boxer's fist.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Bryant, 11, had waited in his Greene Avenue apartment for
hours before getting the final OK to go to the park with his
brother, Kaheem, to play their invented game of Black Mat Tag.
``This park is enough for us,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   12:49 p.m., 92 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Jolly, 15, walked onto the basketball court at the
southeast corner of Von King Park. There, with five others, the
day's first game started. It was a game of dubious shot selections
and endless talk, with the chief conversational constant being the
total failure to mention the word ``job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Work? I'm working on my jump shot,'' said Aaron, his laugh as
soft as his shot floating through the netless hoop. Aaron is one of
eight siblings, and he said he had worked earlier in the summer at
a nursing home. He was waiting to be called back.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, he listened only for the call of ``next.''
</P>
<P>
   A generational shift had taken place at the park as the
afternoon arrived. It is largely the young who are out in the
midday heat, and even they treated the sunlight as a flame to
dodge.
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters come from the row houses along the park's
borders, and from the Louis Armstrong projects on Quincy Street, a
set of buildings that function as squat, remorseless ovens. The
children turn the park's asphalt paths into racing strips, and the
two sprinklers empty a reservoir's worth of water into the air.
</P>
<P>
   It is not Cape Cod, but it is more than all right, something
deeper than simply a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two options,'' said Stacey Tyler, the mother of six
children, four of whom were with her in the sprinkler. ``I can stay
at home and run the hose on them, or I can use the city's water. I
just got my water bill, and so that settled that.''
</P>
<P>
   The park has a rich history. In 1857, it became the first park
formally established by the city of Brooklyn, and it was originally
named for Daniel Tompkins, the abolitionist and four-term governor
of New York. Its final design was by Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law
Olmstead, the designers of Central Park. A library once stood at
its center, and it was often used for military reviews. It is full
of oak and maple trees.
</P>
<P>
   The multiple uses of the park are organized, accidental, and
occasionally urgent. There are nighttime concerts, and a handful of
dance and arts programs are run out of the park building. A local
church that had been damaged by fire now conducts its Sunday
services in the park's outdoor auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   And it gets used, too, as a place for people to come and hold
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came because of the heat,'' Luisa Matos said.
</P>
<P>
   Next to her, Shawn Blake smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came for love,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two, both 19, had just discovered Von King Park, and shortly
after 2 p.m., with the temperature at 95 degrees, they sat side by
side and talked of their future. They had dated for two and a half
years, and had moved to Brooklyn only months before from St. Thomas
in the Virgin Islands. They had taken an apartment together and
were looking for work. Von King Park offered a place for their
hearts to calm down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it will work out,'' Ms. Matos said. ``I want
to go to school as well as work. But it's going to be hard, I
think.'' She put her head on her boyfriend's shoulder and closed
her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   6:10 p.m., 96 degrees
</P>
<P>
   The sun's slow, almost exhausted decline over Marcy Avenue at
the west end of Von King Park had done nothing to thwart the
temperature's ascent. Through that heat and the first hints of
twilight, Homer Stewart walked with his 6-year-old son, Kwame.
Stewart, who works for a bank in Flatbush, had changed his suit for
shorts and was about to have his first game of catch with his son,
an exercise in sweat and tenderness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the baseball lover,'' Stewart said of his son. ``And we
are here to register for the park's baseball program.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the two moved to the ballfield at the northwest corner of
the park, where the baseball games begin after dusk.
</P>
<P>
   The park in the early evening is more full than ever, its
characters including the near-permanent residents who have, during
the day, moved from one bench to another, their courses charted by
their own private maps of quiet desires and distractions.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Queen Curry, 69. She was born in Camden, S.C.,
but moved to Bedford-Stuyvesant 30 years ago and raised four
children. The park was always there, full of pleasures and perils.
She said one of her children had been ensnared by the drug scene
that prevailed at the park years ago. ``I've made a whole circle
around this park,'' she said, listing the houses she had lived in
on the four surrounding streets. ``But I always walked through
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some choose to march through it, and shortly after 8 p.m., the
sounds of a drum and bugle corps rise. There, gathering for
practice, are the Toppers, who say they make up the oldest active
African-American drum corps in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In sunglasses and baseball caps, Victor English and Daniel
Wright, bugles in their white-gloved hands, work their way through
a medley as night falls. ``We're doing this as a hook for kids in
the park,'' said English. ``I started in 1961, and the drum corps
taught me discipline, self-respect. And it gave me the chance to
get out of this city.''
</P>
<P>
   9:11 p.m., 89 degrees
</P>
<P>
   With the darkness, the degrees of separation in the park had
grown more stark. Certain corners of the park had grown slightly
sinister, taken over by teen-agers and other young men and women,
the language often loud and hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say this park is nice, that it has grass and whatnot,''
said a 16-year-old who identified himself as Little G. ``But young
people get hurt in this place, too. And the police precinct is
right on the corner. But they don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, almost everyone, including police officers at the 79th
Precinct at the southeast corner of the park, agrees that Von King
Park has come a long way during the last decade on the question of
safety. There were years, Officer Jeannette Morales said, when
almost all the pursuits of criminal suspects either started, ran
through or wound up in the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we even track the number of incidents in the
park these days, the number is so low,'' said Morales, who has been
the precinct's community affairs officer for six years. ``Cops even
play handball in there.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of security is hardly universal, though. A girl was
raped in the park on July 22.
</P>
<P>
   But, as late night approached, there still were mothers in the
park with their children, gamely hanging on and hanging out by the
sprinklers, the spray of water looking in the dark air like a kind
of fine smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Figueroa was there with her daughter Angelica, 3. The
night hours in the park are what Ms. Figueroa can manage, for she
does not get off work until 6. They would stay until Angelica fell
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place where you feel like you can break away,'' Ms.
Figueroa said. ``Break away from the heat. And, you know, break
away from the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   With midnight coming, and the forecast calling for four more
days of 90-degree heat, a breeze still ran through Von King Park, a
breeze that felt freighted with something _ rain, mischief, peace,
the scent of summer.

HOUSE AND SENATE BEGIN TASK OF RECONCILING GUN MEASURES
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Americans puzzled over the latest deadly
shooting spree, House leaders appointed representatives Saturday to
a conference between House and Senate lawmakers on gun control, a
long-delayed, pivotal step toward the enactment of any new
restrictions on firearms by this Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But the fate of those restrictions remained in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders said that the compromise legislation
likely to emerge from the committee, which is charged with
reconciling the differences between the juvenile crime bills that
passed the House and the Senate, would not include the strict
regulation of gun shows that gun-control advocates in both parties
have, to this point, made their line in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Those advocates could therefore decide to reject any package of
more modest measures that would come out of the committee as too
paltry.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, opponents of gun control could line up against
any new restrictions at all, creating enough negative votes from
the two camps to doom the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the outcome of one of the most bitter debates
in Congress this year may not be determined until September, weeks
after schools around the country have reopened. It was the shooting
deaths of 12 students and one teacher at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., in April that started the current gun control
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans and Democrats said Saturday that while the
shootings in Atlanta on Thursday, which occurred at an office
complex and left nine dead, might hasten a resolution, the incident
would probably not substantially change the positions of any of the
conference participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should permit the shooting in Atlanta
yesterday to detract from a thorough, sobering, deliberate dialogue
in the conference,'' Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., who is among the
conference members appointed by the House, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., said, ``If the Republican leadership
did not act after the tragedies in schools, I worry they won't act
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats said they found hope in the fact that the House,
by a 305-84 vote, including a majority of Republicans, approved
instructions for the House conferees that called for some type of
regulation of gun shows that would ``effectively preclude criminals
and other prohibited purchasers'' from obtaining firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions further said that conferees should reject ``any
measure that would weaken the effectiveness of background checks
currently conducted'' at gun shows, which is precisely what
Democrats had argued was what the Republican-favored measure did.
</P>
<P>
   But the language in the nonbinding instructions probably was too
vague, and the attention that most lawmakers paid to it was too
cursory, to conclude that House members who voted for the
instructions had become receptive to the more stringent gun-show
measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat-sponsored gun-show measure that was approved in the
Senate _ but that failed in the House _ required all vendors at gun
shows to conduct mandatory background checks on customers and gave
those vendors up to three business days to get the results from law
enforcement officials. Currently, only licensed dealers at gun
shows must conduct those checks, while hobbyists and collectors are
exempt, and the dealers have three business days to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The much less-stringent measure that most House Republicans
favored, and that had passed in the House as an amendment to a
gun-control bill that ultimately failed, obligated all vendors to
conduct background checks but limited those checks to 24 hours.
Under this proposal, federally licensed dealers would, in fact,
have less time to conduct the checks.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders had said that they would not object to
the inclusion of individual measures that had been approved by the
House before its gun-control package died.
</P>
<P>
   Those include child-safety locks and a ban on the possession of
assault weapons by most people under age 18.
</P>
<P>
   But they said the legislation would not include the more
stringent gun-show measure that a majority of House members
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle, the Democratic minority leader, said that
gun-control advocates would be hesitant to endorse any legislation
that lacks what they consider a strong gun-show provision.
</P>
<P>
   The reconciliation conference will probably begin next week.
Senate leaders had appointed that chamber's conferees on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the senior House Republican among
the conferees, discouraged any hopes of a conclusion before
Congress begins a monthlong recess on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect this to be a difficult _ but certainly not impossible
_ conference,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   The three Republican Senators appointed to the conference are
Orrin Hatch of Utah, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Jeff
Sessions of Alabama. The two Democratic Senators are Patrick J.
Leahy of Vermont and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The House appointed different conferees for different aspects of
the juvenile crime legislation. For gun control, all the conferees,
seven Republicans and five Democrats, are from the House Judiciary
Committee.

FOR DAY TRADERS, A MOMENT OF SILENCE AND SOME SOUL-SEARCHING

<P>
   The pause in the relentless stream of stock tips scrolling up
the screen in the Internet chat room called Daytraders was brief,
and it was mechanically enforced. But after the shooting spree last
week at two Atlanta firms that specialize in the rapid-fire buying
and selling of stocks known as day trading, several hundred online
investors observed a virtual moment of silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violent acting-out is often associated with high levels of
stress, and we cannot ignore the setting in which he chose to vent
his rage,'' the chat room's manager, David Mason, told his
assemblage on Friday, referring to Mark Barton, who killed nine
people at the two trading sites before shooting himself.
</P>
<P>
   In cyberspace and in trading rooms, many of the nation's
swelling ranks of day traders repudiated the notion that Barton's
own day-trading activities contributed to the violent outburst.
</P>
<P>
   ``This had nothing to do with day trading,'' said a middle-aged
woman getting into a Mercedes convertible in the parking lot of the
All-Tech Investment Group in Montvale, N.J., on Friday afternoon.
``The guy was a nut,'' said the woman, who described herself as a
day trader.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident _ along with the mediocre performance of the
stock market in recent days _ has also prompted a smidgen of
soul-searching among the amateur investors who use the instant
availability of stock information via the Internet to buy and sell
the same stocks within a single trading day for quick personal
profit, or loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day trading's stresses are not more or less than most jobs,
but there are different kinds of stresses,'' wrote an investor who
uses the name Eileen in the Daytraders chat room. ``E.G., there is
no security at all, and no regular paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Those particular stresses, like coping with wild gains and
losses from day to day, are unfamiliar to most Americans, who have
begun to indulge in day trading by the thousands only in recent
years. That is in part why All-Tech, where Barton once traded in
the Atlanta office and where he opened fire last week, employs a
psychologist as part of its training program for those wanting to
become day traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to train people in what goes through your mind when
you're trading,'' said Mark Shefts, president of All-Tech. ``We
want to help make people aware of what goes through your mind when
you're making money and when you're losing money.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that being aware of what you are doing, however, does
not always help you stop.
</P>
<P>
   A 31-year-old San Francisco lawyer said that in addition to
borrowing as much as he was allowed against his stock portfolio, he
had borrowed $20,000 from his credit card company and put the money
directly into the market. As a result, at times he borrowed up to
$40,000 to buy securities, mostly in Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``During conference calls and drafting sessions, I would sneak
out to check my portfolio,'' said the lawyer, who asked that his
name not be used because he did not want his firm to know about his
trading or his family to know about his debts. But, he said, he
could not resist the potential payoff. ``I was a gambler sitting at
a table'' in Vegas, he said. ``My palms got sweaty thinking about
how much money I could make.''
</P>
<P>
   When the market soured, the lawyer said, he simply had to admit
to himself, ``Well, that was dumb.'' He then waited out the market
until it rebounded, and paid off the interest on the money he
borrowed to buy the securities in the first place. He remains
heavily in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while psychologists warn about the stress of living in a
state of perpetual high risk and investment experts warn that
long-term investing has proved far more profitable, most day
traders blame the mechanics of the system for their heightened
sense of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone interview on Friday with a 37-year-old day trader in
Texas was continually interrupted as he checked the status of the
unfulfilled order he had placed minutes before with the online
brokerage Charles Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hold an order for up to eight minutes,'' fumed the
investor, who said his account had dropped to $94,000 from $120,000
a month ago. ``That's fine for some old guy who buys Pepsi one
morning and sells it the next.''
</P>
<P>
   But the delay foiled his ability to take advantage of an uptick
of three-eighths in the stock price. ``My order was at one-eighth
and I would have sold at the half,'' he said. ``I'd already be out
with three or four hundred dollars in my pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   The trader, who is known in online trading chat rooms as Captain
Jack but did not want to see his real name in print, pays someone
else to run his oil business so he can trade full time.
</P>
<P>
   Jokes about ``going trader,'' replacing ``going postal'' as the
term for seemingly random violent eruptions, circulated through
day-trading discussion forums on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gardner, co-founder of the Motley Fool, one of the oldest
investment information sites on the Internet, said he thought there
was a connection between Barton's trading and his rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair to say that day trading caused this, but I do
think there's a casino mentality to it that would tend to draw
somebody who was very intense,'' Gardner said. ``It makes sense
that the outcome of that intense personality and intense failure
would compound the likelihood of this kind of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, an advocate of long-term investing, admonishes day
traders to face the fact that their strategy is just ``bad math.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true, but most day traders seem to agree with Jim
Cox, a 20-year-old senior at the University of Connecticut who
thinks it is possible to beat the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this chat room for a couple of years, and I've
noticed all the nicknames change,'' said Cox, who frequents the
Daytraders chat room. In less than a year, Cox said, he has made
$190,000, sometimes borrowing as much as $100,000 against his
account. ``I'm assuming 80 percent of them fail. But you have to be
smart. If I keep going the way I am, I can make $10,000 a week
easy.''

AFTER CHINESE SPY SCANDAL, NEW SUPPORT FOR TEST BAN TREATY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of the Chinese spy scandal, support is growing in
the United States for ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, a global accord meant to end the development of new kinds
of nuclear arms. The process of treaty deliberation and approval
had been moribund for nearly two years, but is now showing signs of
life.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday nine of the nation's top nuclear scientists and
experts, including architects of the first atom and hydrogen bombs,
wrote the Senate to urge the ratification of the treaty, which is
sponsored by the United Nations. Its enactment, they said, would
help block damage from Chinese atomic espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a House committee, led by Rep. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif., said China had stolen secret data on seven of America's
most advanced warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the test ban see it as a way of blocking any nation
from making new kinds of nuclear weapons and the world from
engaging in new arms races. Such a ban is possible because makers
of nuclear arms in most cases must detonate new designs in fiery
blasts to spot flaws and insure potency. So the absence of
explosive testing acts as a brake on nuclear arms development.
</P>
<P>
   The nine experts, in a letter sponsored by the Union of
Concerned Scientists, a private group based in Cambridge, Mass.,
that strongly backs arms control, said the Senate's ratification of
the treaty ``would greatly help to protect the United States
against the weaponization of stolen nuclear secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We may never know whether Chinese nuclear weapons development
benefited significantly from espionage,'' the signers added. But
the treaty, they said, would help keep any lost secrets from
speeding the development of deadly arms.
</P>
<P>
   The letter quoted Harold Agnew, a former director of the federal
center for the design of nuclear arms at Los Alamos, N.M. ``If
China doesn't resume testing,'' he said, ``no harm will possibly
have been done other than to our egos.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was sent on Friday to all senators by the Washington
office of the Union of Concerned Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The nine experts who signed the letter are Dr. Hans A. Bethe, a
Nobel laureate who helped design the first atom bomb; Dr. Freeman
Dyson, an emeritus physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton; Dr. Richard L. Garwin, a weapons expert who has long
advised the federal government; Dr. Kurt Gottfried, a Cornell
University physicist who is chairman of the Union of Concerned
Scientists; Dr. Marshall N. Rosenbluth, a pioneer of hydrogen
bombs; Dr. Jeremiah D. Sullivan, a physicist at the University of
Illinois; Adm. Stansfield Turner, a past director of Central
Intelligence; Dr. Herbert F. York, a past director of the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory; and Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., a
former Chief of Naval Operations.
</P>
<P>
   Federal experts suspect China may already have used some stolen
American secrets in prototype devices detonated before Beijing
ended its nuclear blasts in 1996 and signed the test ban. If so,
test-ban advocates say, the treaty's ratification and global
strengthening would help limit further damage by making it
difficult for China to resume testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has won the backing of 152
countries, including the United States, which pushed for its
adoption and was the first country to sign. President Clinton
called it ``the longest-sought, hardest-fought prize in the history
of arms control.''

HUMAN GENOME MAY BE LONGER THAN EXPECTED
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Md., Calif.)   (nk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The human genome may be as much as four billion chemical units
in length, one-third larger than previously thought, according to
new calculations by Celera, a company that has undertaken a project
to decode the genome by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The new estimate of genome length suggests that the number of
human genes is likely to lie at the higher end of the range usually
quoted _ 60,000 to 100,000. The new figure also raises questions
whether Celera and its rival, a public consortium that includes the
National Institutes of Health, can finish decoding, or sequencing,
a much larger-than-expected genome under the tight deadlines each
has announced.
</P>
<P>
   Each gene carries one or more instructions, and the genome, the
full DNA tape in which the genes are inscribed, is in effect the
operating manual of the cell. Sequencing the genome _ determining
the order of the units in DNA _ has become a high academic and
commercial priority because knowledge of all human genes should
allow every disease to be treated at the genetic level.
</P>
<P>
   The public consortium had originally planned to complete the
human genome sequence by 2005, but the project became a race when
the Celera Corp., founded last year, announced that it would
sequence the genome by the end of 2001. The consortium has said in
response that it will deliver a 90 percent complete draft,
containing almost all the genes, by the spring of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Guyer, an official at the National Institutes' human
genome project, said that it was hard to evaluate the Celera claim
but that the public consortium had always assumed the genome could
be 10 percent to 20 percent longer than the three billion units
usually assumed.
</P>
<P>
   Because of recent increases in DNA sequencing capacity, Guyer
said, the consortium could still reach its goals even if the genome
proved to be 20 percent larger.
</P>
<P>
   Celera, of Rockville, Md., arrived at its larger estimate in a
pilot test for its human genome sequencing. The company has joined
with Dr. Gerald M. Rubin of the University of California at
Berkeley to sequence the genome of the Drosophila fruit fly, an
important laboratory organism.
</P>
<P>
   Having started in May, Celera has now sequenced 500 million
units of Drosophila DNA, enough to conclude that the organism's
genome is probably 20 percent to 25 percent longer than the 120
million units previously thought. A genome must be sequenced 10
times over to determine its order of units accurately, and Celera
will need to sequence another billion units to complete the
Drosophila genome.
</P>
<P>
   If the underestimate with Drosophila and other species is also
true of the human genome, then its size ``may have to be readjusted
to as much as 4.0 billion base pairs,'' the company said, adding
that the larger estimate had been built into its timetable for
completing work on the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing organisms on the basis of their full genomes, instead
of gene by gene, shows how little biologists know even about
species that have been studied for years. The fruit fly has been a
standard laboratory organism for 80 years, but only 2,000 of its
genes have been well described. The little insect has 9,000 to
17,000 genes in its genome, according to an article being published
in the journal Genetics by Dr. Michael Ashburner of Cambridge
University, Rubin and others.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this number of genes, the fruit fly is a highly
efficient organism compared with yeast, Rubin said. Yeast is a
single-celled mold, without any of the complications of
multicellular organisms, yet it has 6,000 genes in its operating
manual.
</P>
<P>
   If a fruit fly can be designed and operated with a mere 12,000
genes, say, why does it take about 100,000 genes for the human
organism? Humans are known to have four versions of many genes of
which a single version is found in Drosophila, suggesting that a
fruit fly-type genome has been duplicated twice, in two
evolutionary accidents, to form a human-type genome.
</P>
<P>
   The extra copies are free to develop other functions and also to
be put under different control mechanisms, Rubin said. He explained
that an organism with many tissues may need to use a gene in
different ways in each tissue.
</P>
<P>
   As of July 23, the consortium had completely sequenced 12.2
percent of the human genome, and had produced a draft sequence for
a further 7.4 percent, according to its Web site
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq). Celera has not declared its
progress.

PALESTINIANS REBUFF BARAK ON REVISING PULLOUT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Palestinian officials said Saturday that an Israeli
request for changes in the two sides' latest peace agreement was
not acceptable and that the two-week delay agreed on last week for
considering those changes was a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued Saturday following a Friday night meeting of
the cabinet of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, said it is
``impossible to renegotiate such an agreement after it has gained
official status.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief negotiator for the Palestinians, Saeb Erekat, added in
a telephone interview that the Palestinian position has been clear
and consistent _ that the agreement, the Wye River memorandum,
which trades land for security, must be carried out without delay.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, negotiated and signed under Benjamin Netanyahu, the
former Israeli prime minister, calls for three Israeli land
transfers in the West Bank to Palestinian control. Israel carried
out the first phase but then Netanyahu said the Palestinians were
not living up to their commitments under the framework and canceled
any further transfers. Shortly thereafter, new Israeli elections
were called and the agreement was frozen.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Ehud Barak, the new Israeli prime minister, who has
vowed to sign a comprehensive agreement, met with Arafat on the
border between Israel and the Gaza Strip. At that time, Arafat
accepted a two-week deadline to determine whether the Palestinians
would accept a proposal to rewrite the time frame and terms of the
Wye accord, which was concluded last fall in Wye River, Md.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Barak would like to fold the third redeployment
called for under Wye into a final peace agreement between the two
sides rather than carry it out and then negotiate again. This is
partly because, after the third withdrawal, a number of Israeli
settlements in the West Bank would be isolated and he fears that a
heightened risk of terrorism and other tensions could derail the
process again.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak has also said that if, after the two weeks, the
Palestinians insisted on sticking to the Wye formula, he would live
up to his side of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Barak, Meirav Parsi-Zadok, reiterated that on
Saturday but again made clear that the prime minister fears that
the Wye redeployments could lead to trouble before a full accord is
negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, who felt Netanyahu had not acted in good
faith, are suspicious and say they see carrying out the plan as a
test of the new Israeli leader's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if the Palestinian side had asked to reopen the
negotiations,'' Erekat said. ``They would have said of us, `These
people are not honest and not reliable.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Erekat said that last Tuesday at Erez, Arafat showed no interest
in redefining the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Arafat told Barak 17 times that he cannot accept his
proposal and Barak insisted 17 times that he think about it,''
Erekat said. ``We do not want to be seen in a position of rejecting
or refusing anything. The Israelis are the ones who want the
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians also demanded that Barak dismantle hilltop
outposts set up by Jewish settlers in the West Bank since the
signing of the Wye accord last fall. The settlers hope to make it
harder for Barak to give back land.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Parsi-Zadok, the Barak spokeswoman, said the government's
position is that any new outpost set up since Barak took power
would be dismantled _ something which occurred last week _ but
those set up before the new government took office would be subject
to review by an inter-ministerial committee to be set up this week.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was in Egypt Saturday meeting with President Hosni
Mubarak. Barak was to leave Sunday for Moscow to discuss Russia's
role in the peace efforts. The Syrian president, Hafez al-Assad,
who has sent clear signals of his willingness to restart
negotiations with the Israelis, visited Moscow in June.

SPORTS COLUMN: HE WENT THE DISTANCE BEFORE THIS RACE BEGAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong burst out of Cancerland last week, bicycle
wheels buzzing, to win the Tour de France and an immediate place in
several different icon queues; not only is he an inspiration to
patients and another example of American resurgence in the world
sports arena, he is also a role model for celebrities _ he had
actually completed the mythological hero's journey that was once
the qualifying tournament for superstars.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine covers, however, had already been assigned to John
F. Kennedy Jr., whose poignant tragedy is somewhat less threatening
than Armstrong's victory. Like the early deaths of Kennedy's father
and uncle, Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, John John's
passing will be used to feed our imagination with fantasies of what
might have been, even though he never even pretended to play in
their league. The latest organ of celebrifiction, Tina Brown's Talk
magazine, will probably add to all this when the first issue
appears this week.
</P>
<P>
   There's not much to imagine about Armstrong. At 27, he became
only the second American to win one of the most physically
demanding athletic events. Apparently he did it without the
performance-enhancing drugs that most Europeans favor. But then, he
was cranked in ways almost unimaginable; he had just come through
the Tour de Chemo, where you only have to finish to get the
winner's yellow jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the Tour de France three years after a diagnosis of
testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain, Armstrong
became a version of what some activist groups for the disabled
call, in both admiration and denigration, a ``super-crip.''
</P>
<P>
   He is an example of what a determined person can accomplish as
well as an unfair comparison to those who can't quite measure up.
Testicular cancer has far higher cure rates than most cancers, even
in its later stages, although its drug treatment is nasty and
temporarily debilitating. In the cancer patient's struggle to
return to everyday life, Armstrong had the advantage of an
uncomplicated goal _ climbing back on his bike and pedaling like
crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, his accomplishment was astounding. Sportsman of
the Year is not a big enough award for him. His triumph ushered in
a week in which the major league umpires reversed their decision to
resign, the Detroit Lions star Barry Sanders retired (or made a bid
for a trade) because his teammates weren't good enough for him,
General Manager Bill Walsh of the San Francisco 49ers hired the
thug-back Lawrence Phillips without the standard hypocritical
decency of either alibi or apology, Mark McGwire briefly held the
home run lead without benefit of a blood or urine test (is he ahead
or behind last year's Andro pace?) and nine UCLA football players
pleaded guilty to illegally using handicapped parking placards on
campus (they should have pleaded moral handicap).
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Armstrong must be anointed sports' Grown-Up of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   In the world stage queue, Armstrong's victory followed triumphs
by the U.S. women's World Cup soccer team and Pete Sampras, and the
emerging promise of Marion Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Revisionism has already begun to niggle at the soccer champions.
Did they have an unfair advantage, coming from America, ahead of
most of the rest of the world in women's team sports, thanks to the
feminist movement and Title IX? And what about the defining
photo-op, Brandi Chastain's stripping down to her Nike Wonderwoman
bra? Did that make it the World B-Cup? Had she rehearsed the move?
(Did Wade Boggs practice riding before circling Yankee Stadium on a
police horse after the 1996 World Series?) One hopes she did. We
could feel we are with responsible people.
</P>
<P>
   Even the great Sampras, who seems only slightly less extroverted
than the Great Gretzky, has come in for his share of sniping,
despite his amazing statistics. Last month, he won his sixth
Wimbledon singles title, which was also his 12th Grand Slam title.
He is clearly too good, this robojock, his serve too hard, his
strokes too schooled.
</P>
<P>
   I like that about Sampras. His intensity is focused in a
professional way, unlike, say, John McEnroe or Jimmy Connors, who
needed to stay in their zones with the equivalent of tantrums and
trash talk, which is as much about keeping one's demons at bay as
it is about distracting the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Up ahead is a potential champion whose sport goes on hiatus for
years at a time. Marion Jones could win as many as four gold medals
this month at the track and field world championships in Seville,
Spain, perhaps five at the Sydney Olympics. But she better have a
great backstory or some serious attitude if we are to pay attention
much past the Games.
</P>
<P>
   And how long will Lance stay on our radar? In this overheated
time when a golfer's winning putt and a pitcher's third strike are
both described as courageous, here comes this guy riding too fast
on skinny wheels over scary roads. Of course, he had such a
headstart. Desperately riding away from death, he couldn't be
properly intimidated by a bicycle race. &QL;

RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION SEES ITS PERSISTENCE PAY OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BIZ-TAX-BREAKS.) 
(js) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Standing on a ballroom stage in Las Vegas, Nev.,
earlier this year, Herman Cain, president of the National
Restaurant Association, sang to his members, crooning in a rich
baritone: ``If I can see it, I can do it; if I just believe,
there's nothing to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I can fly; I believe I can touch the sky!''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the unusual performance from the industry's
top lobbyist raised a few eyebrows among the restaurateurs in the
audience, who were there for an association convention. But in
truth, Cain had reason to crow because the restaurant industry is
flush.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are eating out more often than ever before. Average
check prices are higher than they have ever been. More than 10.2
million people are employed in restaurants, more than at any time
in the past. And total industry sales are expected to reach a
record high this year, $354 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, association lobbyists managed to convince House
Republicans this summer that restaurants were suffering enduring
harm from the government's decision in 1993 to reduce the tax
deductibility of business meals, to 50 percent from 80 percent. The
tax cut bill passed by the House includes a heavily lobbied
provision that raises it back to 80 percent. The tax bill that
passed the Senate on Friday does not contain the provision, meaning
more lobbying lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1993, when the industry was trying to block the cut in
the tax deduction, the restaurant association ran television
commercials warning of disaster for the industry's most vulnerable
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a waitress, and a good one,'' Jan Bergwall, from a small
town in Maryland, said in one advertisement. ``I'd better be,
because my three sons depend on me. But I might not have a job much
longer. President Clinton's economic plan cuts business-meal
deductibility. That would throw 165,000 people out of work. I need
this job.''
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying effort failed. And as it turned out, the
association's own statistics show that restaurant employment set
records in 1994 and again in 1995, when restaurants added more than
300,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The association is using the same approach now to fight a
proposed increase in the minimum wage. Recently it released the
results of a survey taken of its members, and the restaurant owners
reported cutting ``more than 146,000 jobs from restaurant
payrolls'' after previous minimum-wage increases, in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, Bureau of Labor Statistics figures
show that restaurant employment nationwide increased by 162,400
jobs in 1996 and 119,200 in 1997. Lee Culpepper, a vice president
with the association, acknowledged the overall gain in jobs, but
argued that the rate of increase would have been higher, if not for
the minimum-wage increases.
</P>
<P>
   For other lobbying aims, the association likes to make the point
that its membership is not dominated by minimum-wage workers. ``A
popular misconception about the restaurant industry is that it is a
collection of low-wage jobs, with nominal impact on a region's
economy,'' one association policy paper says. Restaurant employees
at all levels make more money than most people believe, the
association says, and play an important role in regional economies.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its broad range of interests, the trade group expends
copious energy lobbying on issues that do not seem immediately
relevant to the industry. For example, the restaurant association
has lobbied to block the government from taxing airline
frequent-flier miles. Tourists eat out, Culpepper explained. And
frequent-flier miles drive tourism.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even when it works on issues of direct concern to restaurants,
the association sometimes uses arguments that do not bear on its
direct self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it raises constitutional concerns against a
proposal to lower the legal blood-alcohol level for drivers to 0.08
percent. In most states now it is 0.10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying arguments are framed around earnest constitutional
concerns: ``States would be forced to adopt a 0.08 blood-alcohol
level or lose precious federal highway dollars,'' one association
fact sheet warns. That, it adds, is not the way democracy should
work, as ``states should have the flexibility to enact measures
that they feel would work best in their particular state.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact sheet never mentions a more fundamental concern:
restaurants might sell fewer drinks.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant association, founded in 1919, is one of the
oldest trade groups in the city. But for most of its history it was
a sleepy, back-water organization. In recent years, though, it has
climbed into the top level of Washington lobbying groups. ``Last
year, Congress didn't pass anything that hurt us,'' Elaine Z.
Graham, a senior vice president for the association, said with a
smile and a lift of the chin.

TOGETHER BUT SEPARATELY, GWYNN AND BOGGS APPROACH 3,000 CLUB
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The way they talk, Tony Gwynn and Wade Boggs would be delighted
if they could somehow link bats, take simultaneous swings and
stroll into the 3,000-hit club together.
</P>
<P>
   They would probably settle for attaining membership the same
night.
</P>
<P>
   That night should come this week. Entering Saturday's games,
Boggs needed eight hits and Gwynn nine to become Nos. 22 and 23, or
in their thinking perhaps, Nos. 22 and 22a, to reach 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' Boggs said, meaning the proximity in
which they will achieve a plateau they innocently embarked on 17
years ago, both as rookies in 1982. ``Our careers have paralleled
each other for so long, I think it's fitting that we do it in the
same year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn said, ``I do, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The two hitting marvels were on a conference call together last
week and the admiration and respect they have for each other came
through clearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, Wade was the guy who set the standard,'' Gwynn said.
``When I broke in to the big leagues, Wade was there already.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggs, two years older than Gwynn, began the 1982 season with
Boston. Gwynn started the season in the minor leagues and was
promoted by San Diego in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs batted .349 his rookie year, then won the first of his
five batting titles in 1983, hitting .361. Gwynn batted .289 that
first season, then .309 in 1983 after beginning the season late
because of a fractured wrist. He won the first of his eight batting
titles in 1984 with a .351 average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wade came out of the blocks and had seven straight 200-hit
seasons,'' Gwynn said, referring to the seasons 1983 through '89.
``He was just rolling on. He was the type of hitter I wanted to be
like. I was having success in the National League, but not at the
level he was having. He became the hunted. He's the guy you had to
chase. He became the guy I wanted to be like. I wanted to emulate
what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggs said a key to the relationship they have maintained at a
distance is that they have always played in different leagues, with
Boggs in the American and Gwynn in the National.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had to compete against each other,'' Boggs said. ``I
never had to worry about Tony, like is he passing me? I could root
for him to win the batting title. I had to fight Carew and Brett
and all those guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat back and relaxed when I would read about what Tony was
doing. I didn't have to treat him as an adversary. It's like we
were allies. I was pulling for him. It's hard to pull for someone
you're competing against. It helps my stock if Tony does well.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because they have always hit alike. ``My style and Wade's
style were very similar,'' Gwynn said. ``There's nothing wrong with
it. You do it over the course of 162 games. It's not flamboyant.
You grind it out. If you come and watch us play one game, you're
not going to be impressed. If you watch us play 20 games, you say,
`He can play the game.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Gwynn and Boggs get their 3,000th hits, it will mark the
sixth time that two players reached the magic number in the same
season. The last pair to do it were Robin Yount and George Brett,
who became Nos. 17 and 18 three weeks apart in September 1992.
Keeping with the togetherness theme, they were inducted into the
Hall of Fame last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But no season has produced three 3,000 hitters. This one should.
</P>
<P>
   Barring injury, Cal Ripken, who needed 34 before Saturday, will
join Gwynn and Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many try to climb that mountain and very few get up there,''
Boggs said. ``Now Tony and Cal and I are on the verge of sticking
our flag in that mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   The cyclical nature of the achievement has been interesting.
Between 1942 and 1970, Stan Musial (in 1958) was the only player
who made it. Then seven players rushed to 3,000 in the 1970s, the
most in any decade. But between 1979 and 1992, Rod Carew (in 1985)
was the only one. When this year's three players make it, the '90s
will have produced eight players with 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The kindred spirits Gwynn and Boggs will be the first to reach
3,000 since Paul Molitor got there with two weeks left in 1996.
Seven of the last 11 did it in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked Molitor last year what to expect,'' Boggs said. ``He
said just treat it as a roller-coaster ride. That's what it is. Ups
and downs. One day you don't get hits; the next you get two or
three. He said enjoy the ride. That's the perspective I've tried to
keep in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn said he spoke with Molitor just before spring training
this year. ``When you get to this point, you have to have fun,''
Gwynn said Molitor told him. ``You can't get caught up in all the
hype. Do the things you've always done. That's the advice I'm
trying to take.''
</P>
<P>
   On the conference call, Gwynn and Boggs had exhausted their
time, though they could have offered much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wade, go get 'em, man,'' Gwynn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, man, good luck,'' Boggs replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck,'' Gwynn said, and they hung up.

<P>
   MIAMI _ While driving in Miami may be a red-faced,
stress-filled,
curse-under-your-breath-as-you-glare-hatefully-at-other-drivers
nightmare, parking has never been easier here in the nation's
third-most-congested city.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters will park for long minutes in passing lanes on the
hated Route 836 connector between Miami International Airport and
downtown, long enough to have a sandwich, make a few telephone
calls or, some commuters say, grind their teeth until they hurt.
</P>
<P>
   They can park for as long as an hour, with the help of an
accident or some minor road construction, in the commuter lane of
Interstate 95, although they do have to put their car back in
``Drive'' every few minutes or so, to creep forward a few feet.
</P>
<P>
   And on U.S. 1, a main north-to-south road that commuters have
nicknamed ``Useless 1,'' the whole six-lane highway can become a
parking lot at any time of day, though at rush hour it would be
faster to run along the roofs of cars than to actually try to drive
in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's enough time to get to know the person sitting in the
car next to you,'' said Dolly Hernandez, who lives in West Dade and
works for a law firm in downtown Miami. She takes Route 836 to
Interstate 95. ``I dread getting up in the morning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, people tell traffic horror stories the way they used to
tell crime horror stories of the Miami of 10 years ago. Gridlock
has replaced home invasions and drug murders on the front pages of
South Florida newspapers, as Miami chokes on its own traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cuts years from your life,'' said Irene Rodriguez, who
lives in southwest Kendall, south of Miami, and commutes to
downtown Miami and her job as an assistant vice president for CBG
Bank. ``It seems like I spend half my morning in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily commuters, city planners and politicians view it as a
major issue _ if not the major issue _ in deciding this city's
future. Sandwiched by the Atlantic Ocean and the Everglades, with
almost no room left for urban sprawl, Miami-Dade's population of
just over two million can only become more dense and its roads more
jammed, transit experts and city planners agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to enjoy driving,'' said Danny Alvarez, director of the
Miami-Dade Transit Authority. ``Now, I dread the thought. Our
population has grown _ in 10 years by more than 20 percent _ and
our transportation system has not kept up.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, voters in Miami-Dade County went to the polls
on Thursday to decide on a 1-cent sales tax increase intended to
abolish many toll booths and raise an estimated $240 million in
annual tax money for expanding the city's train service _ called
Metrorail _ and its bus service.
</P>
<P>
   But voters turned it down, saying that an improved mass transit
system would not be used enough to justify the tax in a city where
almost everyone seems to have a car. Others said they simply could
not trust officials and local government to effectively use the
money from that sales tax because of a legacy of corruption by
public officials in South Florida. Either way, the sales tax seemed
to offer no guaranteed solutions for the gridlock people here are
forced to live in.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade said, just before the
vote, that it would not bring an end to congestion.
</P>
<P>
   The tax vote was designed to give people a choice, of whether to
drive or ride an expanded mass transit system, Alvarez said, ``and
keep it from getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Braman, a wealthy car dealership owner, arts patron and
the leader of the anti-tax movement, said that people would not
ride mass transit if they could drive, and that the proposed
expanded Metrorail system _ the current system has been called a
failure by many people here _ would waste $100 million a mile. That
is how much it was expected to cost to build it.
</P>
<P>
   He warned, in the last-minute campaign against the tax, that
much of that money, knowing Miami-Dade County's history with such
projects, would ``disappear. It's special interest money,'' Braman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami area residents are so used to corruption and wasted money
that it is almost an accepted form of doing business. They would
trade a little corruption, if it meant an open passing lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is your worst nightmare,'' Ms. Hernandez said of her
commute. ``I wake up at 5 in the morning so I can make it to work
by 9. When I get to work it feels like I have already been awake
all day and like I had just driven down from the Panhandle to get
here.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is no better in more residential areas, like Coral Way, a
banyan-shaded, pretty street that desperate, cursing commuters
swarmed to in failed expectations after giving up on the
glacier-movement of U.S. 1. But at least on Coral Way, one gets to
park in the shade.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic is so bad that some commuters guard their ``secret
routes'' like maps to buried treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Paulino, a process server who works in downtown Miami,
used to commute from Cutler Ridge, in southern Miami-Dade County,
in traffic that backed up ``for miles and miles'' on U.S. 1. ``It
was atrocious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He began to view his commute almost as a military operation.
``It was a mission to get downtown,'' he said. ``I got to the point
that I learned shortcuts, and I would keep them all a secret
because I didn't want everyone else to catch on.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Paulino gave up. He moved in close to downtown. ``I'm a
happy man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But as much as Miamians hate their traffic, they love their
cars. With the possible exception of the cellular phone, the car is
their favorite piece of machinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't use public transportation even if it was free,''
Ms. Hernandez said. ``It's too much of a hassle. People like that
independent feeling of driving to work themselves, in the comfort
of their own car with their own radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Planning experts agree that it is hard to change such attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people,'' said Elizabeth Platter Zyberk, dean of the
school of architecture at the University of Miami, ``are afraid of
change, as soon as someone proposes something new such as a transit
line through their neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   It will only get worse. ``In 20 years, we expect a 35 percent
population increase,'' said Jose Luis Mesa, director of the
county's Metropolitan Planning Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, traffic keeps on, well, not moving.
</P>
<P>
   Vivian de las Cuevas, a summer associate at a downtown law firm,
lives in Coral Gables, which is just seven miles away. ``If I leave
work between 5 and 6,'' she said, ``I won't make it home for two
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   It lends new meaning to the song lyric:
</P>
<P>
   ``They paved paradise
</P>
<P>
   and put up a parking lot.''

<P>
   As cities and states challenge the gun industry to change its
marketing practices, one proposal that keeps coming up is the
creation of a nationwide database of bullets and ammunition shell
casings. Using such a system, police could connect evidence at the
scenes of murders and shootings to the guns used in such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Like a human fingerprint, every gun that is fired leaves a
unique series of marks on a bullet and shell casing. And by
test-firing guns before they were shipped, producers could help
law-enforcement officials quickly link a gun to a crime even if a
weapon was not recovered.
</P>
<P>
   There is just one problem: Over the last decade, the FBI and the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have championed two
competing bullet and shell tracing systems and poured more than $40
million into them. And despite three years of work, government
scientists have failed thus far to make the two systems compatible,
leaving police departments that use different systems unable to
exchange data.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some police departments in cities like Boston have
been forced to use both the FBI- and the ATF-sponsored equipment,
requiring technicians to enter data into both systems. And even if
the systems are made compatible soon, as officials hope, the
prospects of developing a huge national databank of bullets and
shells from new guns is probably years away, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Murch, a deputy assistant director at the FBI, said the
agency and ATF officials were working cooperatively to resolve the
problem. But he said the scramble to promote competing systems had
not been healthy for either law enforcement or the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``You basically had taxpayer dollars going into two systems,''
Murch said. ``You had a lot of competition between the two
agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, police departments seek to match bullets or shells
recovered from crime scenes only with those that have already been
involved in an incident.
</P>
<P>
   But Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York recently asked
producers to submit bullet and shell samples from new guns to the
ATF before the guns are sold as one of several concessions to avoid
a threatened lawsuit by his office. The issue also came up earlier
this year at a White House meeting involving gun manufacturers and
cities suing them, John Coale, a Washington lawyer who represents
several of those cities, said.
</P>
<P>
   The ATF can identify a gun used in a crime by using the weapon's
unique serial number to trace it to a firearms dealer who is
required to keep a record of the person who bought it. But in most
crimes, a gun is never found.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the recovered shells or bullets can provide valuable
clues because minute manufacturing deviations make every firearm
unique. A firing pin leaves signature scratches on the backing of a
shell case, and a bullet, as it travels down a gun's barrel, is
also uniquely marked.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, police forensics experts have linked the same gun
to different crimes by using a comparison microscope to examine the
markings on shells or bullets found at the scene of one crime with
those found at another, a time-consuming and haphazard process. But
in the early 1990s, law-enforcement agencies began to work on
developing a computerized system that could store vast numbers of
digital images of bullets and shell casings and then quickly scan
its memory for possible matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firearms examiners knew that their job could be made much more
effective by computer-aided examination,'' Murch, the FBI official,
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the FBI contracted with a Washington area company
called Nmemonics Systems Inc. to develop a program based on
identifying shell case markings. In 1993, another company, Forensic
Technology Inc. of Montreal, approached ATF officials with a system
it had developed that was based on matching recovered bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Wooten, the ATF's assistant director of firearms,
explosives and arson, said the agency knew at the time that the FBI
was already working on one system but thought that the Forensic
Technology product was better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that the way it gave information was superior,''
Wooten said.
</P>
<P>
   That would become a matter of debate among ballistics examiners,
many of whom think it is far easier to examine the flat,
two-dimensional back of a shell casing than a three-dimensional
bullet that typically deforms on impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, the bullet module is not as
user-friendly as the casing,'' James Carr, the forensic laboratory
supervisor for the Miami-Dade Police Department, said.
</P>
<P>
   Both the FBI and ATF systems would eventually develop the
capacity to look at both bullets and shell casings. But by the
mid-1990s, financial warfare had broken out between the two
agencies, which have clashed over other issues, as each offered
grants to local police departments to take their equipment and
training.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has spent about $18 million on its system, which is used
by about 150 police agencies; the ATF has spent about $23 million
on its system, which is used by about 50 departments, according to
agency spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is that the systems cannot share data.
William Casey, the deputy superintendent of the Boston Police
Department, said Boston decided in 1996 to go with the ATF system
only to discover that the Massachusetts State Police had chosen FBI
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Boston Police Department has also acquired the
FBI system and enters any shell casings and bullets found in Boston
into both networks so it can look for matches in the state police
system. New York also has both systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do double entry and it is not in the best interest of
efficiency,'' Casey said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, lawmakers and others who realized that the FBI and ATF
were spending tens of millions of dollars on duplicate technology
ordered the agencies to start cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   That threw the problem into the hands of the National Institute
of Standards and Technology, a federal research agency in
Gaithersburg, Md. The institute was expected to quickly come up
with technical modifications that would let the two systems
exchange information. Three years later, researchers are still
working.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We discovered that each system imaged the cartridges and
bullets differently and used proprietary software,'' Bruce Field,
an acting associate director at the institute who is in charge of
the reconciliation project, said.
</P>
<P>
   One imaging system, for example, uses a ring-shaped light while
the other system uses a light source on one side. As a result, the
images of the scratches on the back of a shell casing look
different.
</P>
<P>
   The entire government reconciliation effort came to a halt last
year when the Walsh Group, the parent company of Forensic
Technology, sued Nichols Research Corp., an Alabama company that
had purchased Nmemonics, charging Nichols with patent infringement.
Field said there were concerns that if work went forward,
government researchers would be drawn into the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have since settled their dispute and government
researchers are at work again. Field and FBI and ATF officials said
they were hopeful they would soon resolve the problem, though after
three years they were not offering guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to do this,'' Field said. ``It is taking longer
than I like, but we are going to get there.''

century, but in the centuries since they've been flung to the four
corners. But rural Louisiana is still the spiritual heart of Cajun
country, with its funny form of French, its music and food and

small feat in the country's second largest state, which used to
rank near the bottom in most academic indicators. Bush has made
education a top priority, from ending social promotion to
increasing accountability and testing to increasing state funding
of public schools. But he's been unable to deliver on vouchers, and
some critics say he cannot take credit for the recent rise. The
seeds of Texas' success were sown in the mid-1980s, with laws to
create smaller classes, give more money to poor school districts
and increase academic standards. (Brooks, Austin

the U.S. mainland average. One reason is all the tourists who
visit, many making day trips from cruise ships. But the problem is
that the only landfill, Bovoni, can no longer absorb all the
garbage, and there's no money to clean up the mess. Why? Because
apparently the Virgin Islands is nearly broke. As a result of
hurricane damage, declining tourism revenue and mismanagement, the
Virgin Islands is saddled with a $1.2 billion debt, a stupefying
sum for a population of just over 100,000. (Emling, Cox News

HARRISON RICHARDSON, 80, DIES; WENT WITH BYRD TO ANTARCTICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By NICK RAVO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Harrison Holt Richardson, the youngest member of the team
that spent the winter with Adm. Richard E. Byrd on his third
mission to Antarctica, died on July 17 at a son's home in
Claiborne, Md. He was 80 and lived in Beaver, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson carried a 16 mm movie camera with him on the trip and
became the first person to take color movies on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Richardson in the Fosdick Mountains in the Ford Ranges in
Marie Byrd Land in Antarctica was named in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was a teen-ager when he attended a speech by Byrd at
Beaver College, where his father was a trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired, he wrote numerous letters to Byrd and persuaded him to
let him work as a hand for the summer on one of his ships, the
U.S.S. Bear.
</P>
<P>
   Over that summer, Richardson persuaded Byrd to keep him on board
as part of a government-financed expedition to the Antarctic in
1939.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the 59-man team that stayed on the ice over the
winter of 1940-41, Richardson worked as a dog team driver and
meteorological observer.
</P>
<P>
   After the expedition with Byrd to Antarctica, Richardson
graduated from Geneva College and the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   He then joined the Navy and served as a medical officer for
military expeditions to Antarctica and the Arctic. He also helped
open the U.S. Air Force Base in Thule, Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   After his discharge, Richardson returned home to Beaver and
worked as a radiologist for two hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by three sons, Harrison H. Richardson Jr., of
Gross Pointe, Mich., James M. Richardson, of Claiborne, and William
H. Richardson of Annapolis, Md.; a daughter, Jean M. Richardson of
Abiquiu, N.M.; a sister, Jean Hamilton of Beaver, and seven
grandchildren.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A tempering of the extreme heat across the Northeast and Middle
West will occur Sunday as a cool front passes slowly southeast
across the regions. Scattered showers and thunderstorms will form
near the leading edge of the cooler air over the Ohio Valley and
interior Northeast Sunday morning. Meanwhile, hazy and hot
conditions along the Northeast seaboard will yield to clouds and
spotty thunderstorms as the front approaches from the west later
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Breezes from the north and northwest will import noticeably
cooler and less humid air into the Great Lakes region Sunday.
Beneath ample sunshine, afternoon readings will return to
seasonable levels from Chicago to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms will erupt from the
west-central Plains to the northern Middle Atlantic states as a
slow-moving cold front undercuts and lifts very humid air. The rain
may be heavy in western parts of Nebraska and Kansas where winds
from the east ascend the sloping terrain. Farther south, abundant
sunshine will stretch from Texas to Georgia where afternoon
temperatures will approach 100 degrees in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered clouds and isolated thunderstorms will migrate to the
southeastern Rockies on Sunday. The storms will be most numerous
during the afternoon when the uneven heating of the varied terrain
promotes vigorous rising currents of moistened air. Plenty of sun
and warm conditions will cover the western Rockies and West Coast,
though morning clouds will be found along the immediate coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: THE END IS NEAR
</P>
<P>
   While July 1999 was one of the warmest of record in the
Northeast, the upcoming month brings the hope for cooler air. In
August, the lessening daylight will contribute to a slight decline
of temperature. Typically, the nation experiences a degree drop in
average monthly temperature between July and August. An exception
is near the Gulf and southern Atlantic coasts where still rising
water temperatures delay the temperature fall. The warmer waters
provide fertile breeding ground for tropical storms which often
show an increase in frequency during August.

similar doubts have been raised about other so-called `rages,'
namely road rage and air rage. Anecdotes are being christened as
trends, says one expert. By Pam Belluck.

GREAT EXPECTATIONS   
 NOT PERFECT, BUT GOOD 
CLASSIC PINIELLA 
WHO MAKES THE CALL? 
A NOD TO A UNION PIONEER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Knowing how it feels to be in the spotlight, Tony Gwynn said he
felt sorry for Mark McGwire. ``He has to do what he did last year
or he's considered a failure,'' Gwynn said of the 70-home run man.
``But his performance this year has been amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into Saturday's game, McGwire was five home runs from his
own celebrated plateau: 500 home runs. That stratosphere is
populated by 15 players.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was also tied with Sammy Sosa for the season lead with
38. But while Sosa was five games ahead of his 1998 production,
McGwire was well off his. This year he hit his 38th in St. Louis'
103rd game; last season he hit it in the team's 89th game.
</P>
<P>
   In a different home run race, despite a recent flurry, Albert
Belle continues to trail Jay Bell, 27 to 25. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not Perfect, but Good
</P>
<P>
   Javier Vazquez has pitched better since David Cone's perfect
game than Cone has. Vazquez was the Montreal pitcher whose
teammates gave him no help in making 27 consecutive outs against
Cone on July 18. But in his two starts since that 6-0 loss, Vazquez
pitched a complete-game four-hitter in a 5-1 victory over
Pittsburgh and a complete-game three-hitter in an 8-2 decision over
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In Cone's two starts since he was perfect, he has definitely
been imperfect, allowing 14 hits, seven walks and 10 runs (six
earned) in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Classic Piniella
</P>
<P>
   When the Seattle Mariners began a series in Minnesota last
weekend, Lou Piniella, their manager, bragged to the umpires during
the pre-game lineup exchange that he had not been kicked out of a
game all season. The weekend's not over, the umpires reminded him.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Piniella did not survive the Sunday game. As part
of his ejection, he exhibited a classic Piniella performance,
storming out of the dugout, flailing his arms, screaming
demonstrably and trying to yank third base out of the ground. When
he was unable to extricate the base from its slot, Piniella
resorted to an old standby _ kicking dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dirt found its way onto Durwood Merrill's pants. ``I
think,'' Merrill drawled after the game, looking at his pants,
``I'm going to have to get me some new umpire pants. These are kind
of dusty.''
</P>
<P>
   Who Makes the Call?
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner is notorious for his complaints about
umpires, filling the American League's film library for years with
footage of what he feels are bungled calls. But Richie Garcia, one
of the umpires who is losing his job, tells of two incidents in
recent years when the Yankees' owner tried to dictate who umpired
at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia recalled that in the 1995 playoffs, Steinbrenner did not
want Dale Scott behind the plate for the second game and in a
subsequent season did not want a young umpire there because of a
call he had made at first base the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was chaos in that office,'' said Garcia, who was the crew
chief in both instances. ``They called me in my room at 9 o'clock
in the morning and said get up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said he offered to call Steinbrenner and tell him that
he, Garcia, would make that call, but the league declined the
gesture. Nevertheless, as in the Scott incident, the young umpire
worked the plate.
</P>
<P>
   A Nod to a Union Pioneer
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan holds 48 major league records, most noteworthy of
which are his seven no-hitters and 5,714 strikeouts. But last
Sunday, in his speech at his Hall of Fame induction, he achieved
another first. He became the first player, upon entering the hall,
to utter Marvin Miller's name. Of course, he went well beyond just
mentioning Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the former head of the players union had an impact
on him, his family and ``many ballplayers sitting in this audience
today,'' Ryan related how after his first year in the major
leagues, in which he earned a $7,000 salary, he had to pump gas so
that he and his wife, Ruth, ``could live through the winter until
baseball season started.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, Ryan said, ``brought that level up to where the players
weren't put in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller did not attend the induction ceremony but heard about
Ryan's remarks. ``That was very gracious of him,'' the retired
union leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, meanwhile, continues to be the man who has made the
greatest impact on baseball who has not been elected by the
Veterans Committee to the Hall of Fame. Hall officials explain that
the executive category from which the committee can select one
person each year always has been interpreted as including officials
from Major League Baseball or the National Association, the minor
leagues organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame's board of directors is reviewing the rules.
Given Miller's role, like it or not, he had a greater impact on
baseball than any executive this side of Branch Rickey.

ATWATER ARRIVES AS SECRETARY OF THE SECONDARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ After being involved in 1,301 tackles for the
Denver Broncos, 32-year-old Steve Atwater now has the job of
showing the Jets how to make a big play.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Jets were pushovers in that regard last season _
after all, the defense orchestrated by Bill Belichick came within a
point of tying the Dolphins for yielding the fewest points in the
National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   But how much easier life on the Jets would have been if there
had been a free safety to play consistently. In the opening game,
the 49ers' Garrison Hearst huffed and puffed for 96 yards in
overtime at San Francisco, along the way eluding the rookie free
safety Kevin Williams, who had a clean shot at a tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was one of three players the Jets tried at the position
last year, along with Jerome Henderson and Corwin Brown. Brown was
on the field at Indianapolis in Week 11, missing Marshall Faulk in
the open field when he turned in an 18-yard catch and run to set up
the Colts' winning score. Free safety wound up being the only
position in the Jets' secondary in which a starter was benched.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Atwater, a free agent, who was anchoring the defensive
secondary as the Jets went into their first weekend of summer camp
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atwater's main job is to prevent any big plays from
happening,'' Belichick explained. ``If big plays are happening when
the free safety's out on the field, then that's not good. He should
be able to hold any running play from a major gain, and to prevent
big passing plays over which he has control.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwater has done this so well and so often that he has been
elected to the American Football Conference's All-Pro team eight
times, including last season.
</P>
<P>
   If there is anything left in Atwater _ the Broncos felt there
wasn't enough, at least not for $2.6 million this season _ the Jets
will be better off at free safety. But Denver's defensive
coordinator, Greg Robinson, a former Jets assistant, took Atwater
out of third-down passing situations late last season.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater said he was never specifically told he was too slow. But
he understood that was the message. Why else take out the free
safety _ the so-called center fielder _ on obvious passing plays?
</P>
<P>
   He is 6 foot 3, weighs 215 pounds and is one of those ``good
people'' who enhance a team and a city. One of his first acts on
becoming a Jet was to become involved with a Long Island
organization that promotes the use of child safety seats. In Denver
he worked for the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless. He plays in
charity golf tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Broncos' reluctance to keep him in their plans,
Atwater went out in grand style. Against the Jets in the conference
championship game, he knocked the ball loose from Alex Van Dyke,
halting the Jets' final fourth-quarter rally. And in the Super Bowl
victory over Atlanta he was the Broncos' second-leading tackler.
</P>
<P>
   So now, is he trying to show the Jets what it takes?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take anything for granted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the veterans Coach Bill Parcells was talking to
Thursday night, on the eve of the training camp, when he warned
them: ``There are no incumbents. You've got to win your jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwater is one of several off-season free-agent names the Jets
acquired: Roman Phifer of the Rams at linebacker, Tom Tupa (punter)
and Scott Zolak (quarterback) from the Patriots, and Eric Green
(tight end) from the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, the Jets used to bring in players who had seen
better days _ such as Art Monk and Leonard Marshall _ as much to
show off their Super Bowl rings as to display their talent. While
the rings didn't fade, the talent had. But in this case, Atwater is
not joining a Jets team without success, at least in the last two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to show the Jets I can play,'' Atwater said. ``All
they know about me is what I did at Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   An admiring Belichick said: ``He brings in his work ethic and
his ability to hit. He is very intelligent and picks up things very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwater will not brag about the past, and so he sidestepped a
question about what he brings to the table. ``I haven't brought
anything to the table yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atwater is not ready to concede that the Broncos have faded with
the retirement of John Elway. The Jets meet the Broncos again at
Denver in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are still a great team with Bubby Brister at quarterback
and Terrell Davis running,'' Atwater said. ``There still are some
very good players there. When we talk now about how they beat the
Jets, I point out that the Jets had six turnovers and it's
difficult to win with so many.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he isn't showing off his Super Bowl rings, as Ronnie Lott
and Marshall and Monk did when they got here?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the rings with me,'' Atwater said. ``There's
something wrong with the diamonds. I'm getting them fixed.''

THE BUSHES PLAY IT SAFE IN FLORIDA  
 THE CHRISTIAN COALITION'S IOWA PROBLEM  
 DOG IS GONE; OWNER WANTS TO STAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Wash.)  (mk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when Jeb Bush thought a straw poll of
Republican presidential contenders was a great idea. At least that
was the case in 1995, when he was running the poll that is
sponsored every four years by the Republican Party of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to him then that the poll, combined with a series of
speeches by candidates, was a good way to give a big boost to the
party, the candidates and the state _ and, not incidentally, also a
good way to give a big boost to his ambition to someday be governor
of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with straw poll time once again drawing nigh _ the
Republican Party's annual state convention is set for Oct. 8 and 9
_ Bush, who has achieved his goal of becoming governor, seems to
hold a different view of the quadrennial beauty contest.
</P>
<P>
   When Al Cardenas, the man he picked to lead the state's
Republican Party, canceled the 1999 poll the other day, Jeb Bush
did not object, even though his brother, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, sees megastate Florida as one of the keys to success in his
presidential quest.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas said the poll would be more divisive than instructive.
But he left standing the invitation to all candidates to address
the party convention.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush's office said the governor had had nothing to do with
Cardenas' decision and ``didn't really feel strongly either way''
about the cancellation of the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Then brother George sent word from Texas that he had all but
decided to forgo the opportunity to make a speech at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a presence there, someone representing us,'' said
his campaign spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker. ``But as far as I know,
Gov. Bush is not coming.''
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here?
</P>
<P>
   The Bush boys are not saying anything beyond what they already
have said. But political pros in the Sunshine State say it appears
that the brothers have decided that Florida already is in the Bush
bag, given Jeb's powerful influence in the state and George W.'s
runaway standing in the polls, and thus there is no reason to risk
the possible embarrassment of a bad showing in an unscientific
straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the brothers also seem to believe there is no reason
to risk a stage appearance with competitors who need the attention
much more than George W. does.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffling Feathers in the Lord's Name
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of straw polls...
</P>
<P>
   A recent dustup in Iowa between Steve Forbes, the publisher who
is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, and Bobbie
Gobel, the vocal new head of the state's Christian Coalition, has
national leaders of the coalition deeply worried.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gobel, who runs a Des Moines hiring agency when she is not
``doing the work of the Lord,'' as she puts it, said last week that
Forbes had tried to draw a contract with her to round up temporary
workers to vote for him in an Aug. 14 straw poll in Ames that is
shaping up as the first major test of Election 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes flatly denied the accusation and in turn accused Ms.
Gobel of political tampering.
</P>
<P>
   National coalition leaders are feverishly trying to smooth
things over. And they are wondering what, if anything, they can do
about the outspoken Bobbie Gobel.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian right vote is a major factor in Iowa politics, and
Ms. Gobel says she intends to make it an even bigger one. Recently
she began calling on laggards in the Republican field, especially
those over on the hard right, to get out of the race and clear the
way for ``godly'' candidates with a better shot.
</P>
<P>
   She has not named any names thus far, much to the relief of
national coalition leaders, who tend to avoid taking sides publicly
early in presidential contests and urge state leaders to do
likewise. But she came close with her Forbes accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition leaders at the national headquarters in Chesapeake,
Va., some of whom have close ties to Forbes, questioned Ms. Gobel
about her accusation and pressed her to reconsider. Then they
issued a statement saying that ``recent characterizations of events
surrounding the upcoming Iowa straw poll are unfortunate and in our
view inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gobel immediately objected to the statement, saying: ``I was
told to go along with it. I don't go along with it. I'd rather burn
a bridge than burn my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Coalition officials in Chesapeake say the Iowa matter is under
``internal review.'' But in the meantime, unannounced, a team of
political troubleshooters has been dispatched to Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   No More Dog Not to Kick Around
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1994, a campaign ad that featured a telegenic golden
retriever named Chestnut helped George Nethercutt, a Republican,
win Washington state's 5th Congressional District from the
powerful, long-entrenched Democratic incumbent, Speaker Tom Foley.
In the ad, Nethercutt said that Foley, desperate to win, had
accused him of ``everything short of kicking my dog.''
</P>
<P>
   He vowed he would be a more high-minded legislator who, unlike
Foley, would go along with term-limits advocates and serve no more
than six years in the House. Then, casting a loving glance at his
fetching retriever, he also promised, `And I'd never hurt you,
Chestnut.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley, sensing the effectiveness of the ad, turned to Nethercutt
in the final debate of the campaign and said: ``George, I'm not
after the dog. Believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, in his first bid for re-election, Nethercutt returned
to the airwaves with Chestnut, telling voters he had made good on
all of the campaign promises he made back in 1994, then adding,
``And I still don't kick my dog.''
</P>
<P>
   He won a second term. And then a third in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now, halfway through that third term, Nethercutt has had second
thoughts about leaving Washington after just six years. He says he
is scrapping his promise and will run for a fourth term next year.
</P>
<P>
   And Chestnut?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the congressman will not have him not to kick around
anymore. He died last week after a battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   What do term-limit advocates have to say?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogs are special to us, too, and we certainly grieve for the
loss of Chestnut,'' said Paul Jacob, executive director of U.S.
Term Limits. ``But the equally sad fact is that Rep. Nethercutt is
a promise-breaker. We intend to go after him next fall.''

 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Everitt has a soothing way of discussing his 12 uncertain
years of umpiring games in the minor leagues. He remembers driving
843 miles overnight to get to the next game, trying to subsist on
$20 a day and a marriage that could not survive his time-devouring
job. He wondered about the sacrifices. Is this worth it?
</P>
<P>
   So when Everitt received a call from the American League 10 days
ago and was offered a full-time job at $95,000 a year, his hands
trembled. He had worked in the major leagues as a fill-in umpire,
and had been waiting a dozen years to hear he had made it on a
permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
   This was why he devoured the official rule book and why he once
went three months without seeing his second wife while he worked in
Triple-A. Finally, the elusive call came.
</P>
<P>
   But the emotions that should have been blissful were tinged with
sadness. Everitt was one of 25 Triple-A umpires who were offered
jobs after more than 50 major league umpires had tendered their
resignations in a contract negotiating strategy that failed
miserably. Some umps were permitted to rescind their resignations,
but 22 umpires lost their jobs. During the disarray, Everitt was
hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``This call was tough in the way that the job came about,''
Everitt said. ``I would have much rather made it to the big leagues
another way. But I guess this is how it was supposed to be. I would
much rather not have this turmoil because so many guys have treated
me so well. I think for all of us who have fortunately gotten jobs,
I don't think we're celebrating.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an awkward time for some umpires and an awful one for
others because Richie Phillips, the chief negotiator for the Major
League Umpires Association, advised his members to challenge
baseball and it backfired. That is where the 34-year old Everitt,
who umpired his first major league game in 1996 and has filled in
for vacationing or injured umpires 158 times since then, found
himself amid these unprecedented changes.
</P>
<P>
   That may be one reason Everitt is cautious. He does not want to
seem boastful, or unsympathetic toward the umpires who have lost
their jobs. He proudly spoke of being part of the umpiring
fraternity and how he has umpired 159 major league games. No. 160
is Monday night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything that has went on, it's hard to believe I'm a
major league umpire,'' said Everitt, whose appointment becomes
official on Sept. 1. ``It really hasn't sunk in yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As Everitt spoke by telephone from his home in Chandler, Ariz.,
he looked for a baseball from his first major league game: June 20,
1996 at Oakland. Three years and a month after Everitt made his
debut as a part-time major league umpire, the AL, amid the regular
umpires' pending resignations, asked him if he wanted a steady
check for about four times what he earned in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   For Everitt and the 24 other new umpires, it was a delicate
question that was going to be asked only once. Union experts have
said in interviews that since the major league umpires had sent in
letters of resignations, the minor league umps have not defied the
union by accepting positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the position I was in, you know, there was hesitation, yet
I knew what the right thing to do was,'' said Everitt, who did not
belong to a union in the minor leagues. ``I'm very loyal to
umpires, but what I have wrestled with for the past 20 days is this
wasn't a strike issue. As far as crossing a picket line and being a
strike replacement or taking someone's job in that fashion, it's
not anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, I have so much respect for so many
umpires. I realize what they go through. It's not just throw on the
clothes and go to the ballpark and work. There's a lot more to it
than it looks on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hirschbeck, one of the 14 umpires who refused to resign and
a leader of a block of umps who have grown disillusioned with
Phillips' leadership, was in Cleveland with Everitt when an AL
official called. Hirschbeck emphasized that Everitt and the other
newly hired umps ``absolutely did not'' violate the union and
should not be maligned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more difficult to become a major league umpire than
it is to become a major league player,'' Hirschbeck said. ``There's
no turnover. What is happening now is something that hasn't
happened in the history of baseball. The jobs are so few and far
between.''
</P>
<P>
   Everitt politely declined to comment on whether he expected
friction from other umps for his decision. But Hirschbeck, who is
torn between being thrilled for Everitt and sad for those who lost
jobs, firmly said, ``If there is anything against them, it will be
minimal and it will not be tolerated.''

</P>
<P>
   Before this failed move, umpires had some of the most secure
jobs in baseball because they were rarely fired. There are 68
positions that pay from $95,000 to $262,500, and attrition usually
occurred only through retirements. Even though Everitt worked 23
games in 1996, 37 in 1997, 60 in 1998 and 39 so far this year, he
had no assurances that he would ever be hired full time.
</P>
<P>
   Until the July 14 resignations, few umpires would even have
considered leaving a job that calls for them to work only seven
months a year for an average salary of $150,000 to $175,000 and
does not require a college degree. Umpires generally arrive at the
park 90 minutes before a game and work about 3 1/2 hours. What
umpires need is keen eyesight, a thick skin, an acceptance of
traveling to different cities two or three times a week and mental
toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you blow a couple of calls,'' Everitt said, ``you're on
`Sports Center.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Everitt left New Mexico State University 45 credits
short of a degree to attend Harry Wendelstedt's Umpiring School in
1987, he had heard the statistics of how fewer than 1 in 100 minor
league umpires are promoted to the majors. Still, Everitt, who
wanted to be a major leaguer when he pitched at Aztec (N.M.) High
School, persevered through one year in rookie ball, three in
Single-A, two and a half in Double-A and four in Triple-A. Waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinarily, there's very little movement and you're just
getting up here on retirement,'' Everitt said. ``This year is a
little different.''
</P>
<P>
   Umpires are an isolated crew, strolling onto the field, getting
booed if they receive any reaction at all, and knowing that they
are four against the world. Many describe their lives as exciting
and tense during games, but lonely and stale before and afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Because umpires receive a $240 per diem for their hotel, food,
cab or car expenses and tips for clubhouse attendants, they rarely
stay at the hotels ballplayers frequent, and negotiate the best
possible rates on their own. Many umpires share cabs or cars
because a $50-a-day rental rate is much more desirable when divided
by four.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires receive prepaid airline vouchers from the major
leagues for first-class tickets and must make their own
reservations. Since they fly commercially, they are unable to leave
for the next city immediately after games, which teams do. An
umpire works about 130 regular-season games and has four one-week
vacations, so he is away from relatives and friends for long
periods. Despite the incessant travel, however, Hirschbeck called
the job nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work six months a year,'' Hirschbeck said. ``I don't even
count spring training. Plus you get four weeks off. It's easy to
look at the negatives, but I look at the positives. I thank God
every day for my job. Everything I have in my life is from
baseball. How can I not be grateful?''
</P>
<P>
   This lifestyle is a dramatic improvement from the one Everitt
knew in Triple-A, where he was paid $3,400 a month, the best salary
for a minor league umpire, and received a $20 per diem. Since the
Triple-A season runs only until early September and minor league
umpires are not paid in the off-season, Everitt had to find
temporary jobs in the winter. He has driven cars for a rental
company, supervised youths at a juvenile detention center and done
maintenance work at a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major league umps get paid year round,'' Everitt said. ``That
is something I can't really fathom until the day I go to the
mailbox and get the check.''
</P>
<P>
   But like any other umpire, majors or minors, Everitt's travel
schedule will remain hectic. He will be away from his pregnant
wife, Michelle, a juvenile probation officer, for weeks. Everitt
says it takes one month after the season for he and his wife to
regain some normalcy in their relationship, and he has stopped
trying to explain his absences to neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 12 years, Everitt often asked himself why he
continued to be an umpire. Even in the last 10 days, he has asked
the question. The answer is simply that he loves his job and would
be miserable if he was home and not umpiring. Even if leaving home
will become more difficult after Michelle gives birth to their
first child sometime around Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have to fly her to New York and have the baby there at
midnight,'' Everitt said. ``We were told we weren't going to be
able to have kids because of fertility problems and we were close
to adopting. All of a sudden, she just got pregnant. This year has
just been a miracle in a lot of ways.''

ARMS AIDE WHO QUIT ASSAILS U.N. ON IRAQ
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a defense of his troubled tenure as chief of the United
Nations Special Commission responsible for disarming Iraq of
weapons of mass destruction, Richard Butler has accused
Secretary-General Kofi Annan of trying to destroy the commission
because it was ``too independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who resigned as chairman of the commission on July 1,
also savagely criticizes virtually everyone else associated with
the protracted effort to disarm Iraq of unconventional weapons. The
exception is the Clinton administration, which he says, contrary to
allegations by Scott Ritter, a former weapons inspector, was
largely steadfast and alone in its efforts to ``hold Saddam's feet
to the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   He also repeats allegations that Yevgeny Primakov, the former
Russian prime minister who was foreign minister at the time,
received personal payments from Iraq. He provides no evidence for
this charge, which Russian officials have denied, other than citing
what he calls ``intelligence reports from an outstanding source.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler, a former Australian ambassador to the United Nations and
disarmament expert, issues his bitter indictment of many of his
former colleagues, along with Iraqi and Russian officials, in an
article to be published Monday in the first issue of Talk, the
heavily promoted monthly magazine edited by Tina Brown, the former
editor of The New Yorker and Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the ``inside story'' of his efforts to disarm Iraq,
the article is Butler's first detailed account of the decline and
fall of the Special Commission, known as UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   It contains little that is new about Iraq's cheating, the events
that ultimately led to the Special Commission's problems and its
expulsion from Iraq, or the extent to which Butler's personality
and uncompromising style may have compounded the commission's
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   But it does reveal the depth of Butler's fury and frustration
over his failure to win allies among the senior U.N. officials on
whom his mission depended.
</P>
<P>
   The account highlights in particular his contempt for Annan and
other U.N. officials and diplomats who, in Butler's view, have
permitted Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to retain the capability
for mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Annan's behavior ``deeply alarming,'' Butler describes a
succession of incidents, several of which have not been previously
reported, in which he says the secretary general dealt with Iraq's
political challenges and cheating by ``papering them over with
diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Annan and his immediate staff sought to hand Saddam the
greatest possible prize: the destruction of UNSCOM,'' Butler
asserts, because ``UNSCOM was too independent to work within the
mainstream of the U.N.''
</P>
<P>
   Shashi Tharoor, Annan's spokesman, called Butler's assertion
that the secretary general had tried to destroy the Special
Commission ``bizarre'' and ``errant nonsense.'' He noted that Annan
had involved himself in UNSCOM affairs only ``at critical moments
to resolve specific crises.'' Saying that Annan had not read the
article, Tharoor deferred further comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to Butler's account, the U.N. ``cave-in'' to Hussein
began in 1996 when Rolf Ekeus, the highly regarded Swedish diplomat
who was Butler's predecessor, agreed to Iraqi restrictions on the
access of weapons inspectors to sites that Baghdad deemed
``sensitive'' for national security reasons. Butler calls the move
a ``direct violation'' of Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   After Butler took over in 1997, Russia, China and France refused
to block Iraqi efforts to bar the inspectors from ``presidential
sites,'' which, as Butler states, were eight areas covering 30
square miles that included 1,100 buildings, many of which were
ideal for weapons storage.
</P>
<P>
   Butler charges that Annan was not only soft on Hussein and
enamored of diplomacy for its own sake, but tried to undermine
UNSCOM's work.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Butler asserts that Annan pressed him to accept
Iraq's exclusion of American citizens from inspection teams. ``I
was incredulous,'' Butler writes. He said he prevailed only after
explaining to Annan that giving Iraq veto power over the
composition of teams would undermine their quality and set an
``unacceptable precedent.'' He called the incident his ``first
glimpse'' of Annan's ``tendency to sacrifice substance to his
notion of diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he asserts that Annan failed to grasp essential
distinctions involving the commission's disagreements with Iraq on
the eve of the secretary general's much-publicized trip to Baghdad
in February 1998. The trip produced an agreement that led
temporarily to resumed inspections _ and to Annan's description of
Hussein as ``a man I can do business with.'' Annan has subsequently
expressed regret about having been so optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   When Butler wanted to test the agreement quickly by sending out
inspectors, Annan is quoted as asking him to wait. As Butler
anticipated, his inspectors were eventually taken to sites that he
and other inspectors agree were ``sanitized'' before their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Butler is also strongly critical of Russia, recounting that
Primakov told him in Moscow that sanctions against Baghdad should
be lifted and Iraq free to sell oil for profit so that Russia could
collect the $7 billion it was owed by Iraq for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Butler praises President Clinton, who he says urged
him at an impromptu meeting at a New York party in March 1998 to
``do your job down the line'' and ``go get their armaments.''
</P>
<P>
   While noting that he knew that American and British support
would not suffice for rigorous weapons inspection ``in the face of
weakening resolve'' in the Security Council, Butler only obliquely
refers to America's role in the spying scandal that more than
anything else undermined international confidence in the Special
Commission and his stewardship of it.
</P>
<P>
   Butler accuses Ritter of making ``misleading and misguided''
statements about America's alleged use of the Special Commission to
spy on Iraq. Butler does say that he rejected proposals, not solely
from the United States, that ``might have served or been construed
to have served'' purposes other than disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But, specifically mentioning allegations that Washington sought,
as he puts it, ``to piggy-back on UNSCOM for its own national
intelligence purposes,'' Butler writes only: ``I would lament
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Several inspectors who were read portions of the article said
that Butler's version seemed accurate. But some added that the
account did not reflect the extent to which Butler's abrasive style
and perceived closeness to Washington adversely affected his
credibility within the Security Council, to which the Special
Commission reports. ``Richard Butler was part of our problem,'' one
official said. ``And so was the Clinton administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler is now diplomat in residence at the Council on Foreign
Relations.

LIFE WITHOUT SANDERS BECOMES A GAME PLAN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAGINAW, Mich. _ Footballs were indeed being run, passed and
kicked in the Detroit Lions' training camp when the team grunted
through its first days of practice.
</P>
<P>
   Mystery and intrigue, however, swirled among them as their No.
20 remained retired, in Europe, after his unexpected and thunderous
decision last Wednesday to leave the Lions after 10 seasons. Former
teammates and coaches of Barry Sanders here were attempting to
recover from the jolt and make sense of what to some of them seemed
senseless.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bailey, a nine-year pro cornerback in his third season
with the Lions, said: ``When I heard about it, I thought, `This is
crazy.' We heard about it like everyone else did on TV. After it
was over, we all discussed the timing of it. Just before training
camp? Some guys thought that was bad. For the entire team, this was
a stunning deal. It was like your 15-year-old daughter coming home
and telling you she's pregnant. What can you do? You sit there,
numb. Barry obviously had a lot on his mind, more than we thought
he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a month or two ago, he was up with us near Detroit
playing basketball. Shoot, guard, dribble _ Barry's an athlete and
he can do it all. He's Barry. There was no hint he would quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey continues: ``But here's the thing _ we won with Barry and
we lost with Barry. He's not here and we are going to go on and win
or lose without him. We've got to go out and play and realize that
we have a whole new world now with a lot of new opportunities for
the entire team now. We've just got to go out and see it. And
embrace it.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the challenge for the Lions now _ embracing change, not
wilting under it.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are Sanders and his long, thrilling spins and runs. Absent
is the wheel from which the Lions offense had flowed. Removed is
his ability to force defenses to focus foremost on him. Gone, too,
is a quiet, reserved player not really known by many of his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Now, other Lions have an opportunity to lead on the field in
ways that they never have. Coaches must design schemes for the team
to play in a way that it never has, without Sanders. This could
mean a more methodical and more physical ball-control offense, with
a passing game that can become more of a focal point, and with a
defense that can now firmly lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Moeller, the Lions' linebackers coach, said: ``Who wants to
lose great players? You lose them all the time with injury and
through free agency, but not quite like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone else is going to have to surface now as a star of this
team. This should bring us closer together. Now we can't hit the
home run as readily in the running game, but we can do steady
damage. This is where you need good leadership among your veteran
players. That's going to help decide how this all shakes down. Who
is going to lead now?''
</P>
<P>
   Not only on the field, but also on the sideline. Bobby Ross, the
Lions' head coach, is where it must start, and Ross knows it. He
appears under siege. The darts are flying. The man who ran Barry
Sanders out of town, the regimented coach who is too tough on his
players in his words and in his practices. Too inflexible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where does all of this stuff come from?'' Ross asked. ``I'm a
little befuddled. I am a demanding coach who wants my players to
hustle and work hard, and how is that different from any head coach
in the National Football League? I spend a lot of time with our
football players working on relationships. I want full and complete
effort, and that does not mean measuring everyone's contribution as
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will ever know how much I tried to work with Barry. The
last seven months have provided a lot of distractions. Everyone
wants to see Barry come back, and I do, too. We'll just have to
wait and see. We don't have a clear indication what running backs
are going to become available just before the season, so we'll have
to wait and see on that. But it is my job to challenge the players
and I'm going to do that and they can't be so fragile that there
becomes finger-pointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross and the Lions believe they can be a contending team this
season. The defense is greatly improved, and the offense can still
produce under the second-year quarterback Charlie Batch and a
bushel of impact receivers led by Herman Moore. Ron Rivers,
Sanders' longtime backup, is listed as starter now at running back
and just behind him is the rookie Sedrick Irvin from Michigan
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as an opportunity,'' Rivers said. ``If it's my time,
so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lions players say they believe Ross, in his third season as the
Detroit head coach, is adapting to them as the players are adapting
to Ross. Last year, during Detroit's troublesome 5-11 season, Ross
criticized his team and separated the level of effort from the
coaching (good) and the playing (poor).
</P>
<P>
   Players noted that their playbooks include fines for criticizing
teammates and coaches publicly, then asked why Ross could do it.
They said Ross has apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody does not always agree with the leader,'' Bailey
said. ``There is going to be opposition, but the key is to get most
along for the ride. Coach is doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Porcher, Detroit's robust defensive end in his eighth
season, does not see gloom with the loss of Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry is retired and I'm respecting that,'' Porcher said.
``We've got to approach training camp differently. I am. I used to
come to camp and just try to get through it to get to the regular
season. Now my approach is to work hard every day in camp to get
better. People say we won five games last year with Barry and this
year without Barry we can't possibly win even another five. If I
wasn't playing, maybe I'd feel the same way. You've got to play the
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we avoid injury, let's see what happens. We've lost
something great, but all we need is a chance to do something great
and shock people even more. It's here. We have it.''

<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is eager to have voters notice that he is
being specific about the issues. ``Our democracy is ill-served by
an over-reliance on generalities and fuzzy rhetoric,'' he told The
Times' Katharine Q. Seelye last week, in an interview where he
proudly pointed to his detailed proposals on things like gun
control, classroom computerization, tax cuts and cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a man who dares to speak out on the fuzzy rhetoric
controversy! Since Gore is going to be held responsible for seven
years' worth of Clinton administration initiatives, not to mention
16 years of congressional votes, his positions on the issues have
never been much of a mystery. But for the vice president's
purposes, the point right now is not so much specific talk but to
talk about how specific he is being.
</P>
<P>
   There are three things a presidential candidate can do in the
peak summer vacation period 15 months before an election: position,
inoculate or change the subject. Gore is working on two. By calling
attention to all his issues, he positions himself nicely against
George W. Bush, the most likely Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was still looking for a permanent career when Gore
first ran for president, does not have much of a paper trail when
it comes to policy. The public has been hearing for weeks now that
Bush is a natural, charismatic politician while Gore is stiff and a
boring speaker. Now, the vice president would be very happy to hear
talking heads noting that Bush lags far, far behind Gore in the
specificity race.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is also very eager to change the subject from all the
recent talk about disarray in his campaign organization. If
reporters start counting his position papers, perhaps they will
stop pointing out that the Gore campaign employs two communications
consultants who refuse to talk to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's mission, meanwhile, is inoculation. Politicians have
learned that they can protect themselves against negative stories
about their personal histories by discussing the trouble spots
early. That is why Hillary Clinton is spending her summer answering
the same carpetbagger question over and over, and why Bush has been
reliving his semi-reckless youth and spotty job history for
reporters' campaign biographies, most recently a long and detailed
series in The Washington Post. By responding to allegations about
substance abuse and his military service in the Texas National
Guard, Bush is trying to get them out of the way so he can handle
future queries by saying he has already talked about that.
</P>
<P>
   Inoculation is a tricky business, particularly since Bush's
response to questions about drug use is that he is not going to
answer such questions. There is also the danger that revisiting old
controversies will inadvertently raise new questions. For instance,
after having gone to great lengths to depict his college drinking
habits as normal youthful carousing, Bush told The Post that he
does not remember any protests against the war in Vietnam when he
was at Yale in the late 1960s, a degree of unconsciousness that
suggests he was in something close to a four-year coma.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush are not the only candidates hard at work in the
heat. Bill Bradley, who has been enjoying a quiet but lucrative
summer listening tour, says he is ready to start some heavy-duty
positioning himself. That would give the country two Democratic
candidates delivering big issues addresses while nearly a dozen
Republicans struggle with the mysteries of the Iowa straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll bears more than a passing resemblance to one of
those old TV game shows. The candidates vie to get the most people
stuffed into buses and carry them across the plains to a crowded
auditorium in the middle of August. It is a political version of
``The Blair Witch Project'' _ a low-budget production that
terrifies people despite the fact that it only pretends to be real.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, the only Republican who is not taking part in the
straw poll, is trying to draw attention to his campaign against
Bush, and bolster his own credentials as a bold truth-teller, by
attacking the ethanol subsidy program so dear to the hearts of corn
growers. It is a smart bit of positioning, particularly since
Bush's very first bit of presidential pandering was done on behalf
of ethanol. It would, however, have looked a little bolder if
McCain had not long since written off Iowa himself.

IN GERMANY, BASEBALL TAKES FIRST MAJOR STEP

<P>
   BERLIN _ No inner voices guided Georg Bull, nor were any lush
cornfields in sight. Nevertheless, Bull set out to build a baseball
stadium in a strange place. The year was 1994 in the eastern German
town of Strausberg, or more specifically, a tract of land once used
to train soldiers in the East German army.
</P>
<P>
   Enduring the stares of perplexed locals for the whole summer,
Bull built it. And, sure enough, they came from as far as the
Dominican Republic and the United States and as near as
Strausberg's block housing complexes. Baseball in eastern Germany
took its first major step.
</P>
<P>
   Bull, a native of the western German city of Mannheim and a
former catcher on the German National Team, then created the
Strausberg Sun Warriors. Five years after taking the risk of
building a stadium before having players to fill it, he now coaches
the only team in eastern Germany to play in the country's top
semipro league. The Sun Warriors have clawed their way to the
premier German league with merit-based promotions each of its five
seasons and have picked up sponsors like BMW along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georg is a baseball pioneer in eastern Germany,'' said Frank
Fulton, a native of Virginia and coach of the German National Team
since last year. ``Baseball is a real sleeping giant that he has
helped to awaken.''
</P>
<P>
   Weekend doubleheaders this season in Strausberg have drawn
capacity crowds of 700 to the house that Bull built. In the absence
of a popular local soccer team, the Sun Warriors have become
Strausberg's No. 1 sports attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Germans learned baseball from American soldiers and play
in million-dollar stadiums,'' Bull said. ``Our fans love the fact
that we're the only team representing eastern Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the American presence, German baseball lags far
behind the top teams in Europe, especially Italy and the
Netherlands. While western Germany had teams, Americans dominated
the rosters and natives rarely got playing time. Still, to compete
in Germany's first division, Bull has been forced to supplement
local talent with players from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Olms, 22, played at Principia College, a Division III
school in Illinois, before coming to Germany to continue his
baseball career. Olms supports himself by playing in the league,
earning between $8,000 and $10,000, and lives in a former army
barracks behind the stadium, which is a dormitory for foreign
players.
</P>
<P>
   Wilgen (Willie) Reyes, a 30-year-old native of the Dominican
Republic, is the Sun Warriors' oldest player. A naturalized German
citizen, he is also a member of the national team that is in Italy
for the European Baseball Championships this week.
</P>
<P>
   It is the native Strausbergers on the team, however, who provide
a glimpse into eastern Germany's baseball future.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Franke, 17, had never picked up a baseball bat before
attending a free demonstration held by Bull in 1994. Franke tried
his luck against a pitching machine and connected on eight of 10
balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played tennis up until that time,'' Franke said. ``When my
dad saw me hit the baseballs, he smiled and said that tennis might
not be the right game for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Franke plays second base on the German Junior National Team,
which was fourth in the European Championships in 1997. And his
father is president of the team in Strausberg.
</P>
<P>
   Bull's organizational talent has made Strausberg a role model
for other eastern German cities struggling to build a baseball
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Magdeburg, a city in eastern Germany plagued by staggering
unemployment and right-wing extremism, fields a team in Germany's
eastern regional league. The team is self-deprecatingly nicknamed
Arme Schweine, literally the Poor Pigs but closer in meaning to the
Poor Saps. It plays in an athletic complex whose name reveals East
German roots, Stadion der Bauarbeiter (Stadium of the Construction
Worker).
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, a soccer game in the stadium forced the Poor Pigs
to improvise a new diamond on a gravel lot behind the city's
university.
</P>
<P>
   Odd situations are nothing new to the team in Magdeburg. When
the Poor Pigs arrived in the city's train station after a road game
in Leipzig last month, Thomas Rochel, the team's coach, had to
explain to suspicious police officers that the equipment bag full
of bats were for hitting baseballs and not people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know where we stand around here,'' Rochel said. ``Most
people don't understand baseball here. Our goal is to get people
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the teams in Germany's 5-year-old eastern league,
Magdeburg fields a team composed of young locals alongside
experienced Latin Americans who have lived in the city since
socialist times.
</P>
<P>
   After last weekend's sparsely attended doubleheader, in which
the Poor Pigs lost both games, the mood was still good. The team
ate German bratwurst and listened to Cuban music as a handful of
Nicaraguan players celebrated the 20th anniversary of the country's
Sandinista revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Bull views teams like Magdeburg's as essential for the further
development of baseball in eastern Germany. ``We started at the
bottom in Strausberg,'' he said. ``If we can make it to the top, so
can they.''

LEYRITZ RETURNING TO YANKS; PETTITTE MAY STILL BE GOING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The New York Yankees reacquired Jim Leyritz Saturday to
augment their bench, and even though the trade dominoes remained in
place for a possible swap of Andy Pettitte before the midnight
deadline, manager Joe Torre talked Saturday afternoon as if
Pettitte would remain a Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just not the type of deal we want,'' said Torre,
referring to the talks with the Phillies. ``I don't think it's
totally dead. There's mouth-to-mouth on this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one trip wire in place would lead to a Pettitte trade:
if the Yankees can acquire Roberto Hernandez from the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays in the hours leading up to the deadline, then they would
most likely deal Pettitte to the Phillies for three prospects.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Devil Rays' front office does not always move with
alacrity, and for the Yankees and the Devil Rays to agree to a deal
Saturday, Tampa Bay would have to quickly settle on players.
Another general manager who considers himself to be in the running
for Hernandez's services said that earlier this week, he contacted
the Devil Rays about a possible deal for Hernandez and was told he
would have to surrender four players. The general manager asked the
Devil Rays to forward a proposal _ and as of this morning, he was
waiting for the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees continued to speak to the Orioles Saturday about a
possible deal for Arthur Rhodes, and if completed, the acquisition
of Rhodes could lead to a Pettitte trade. Rhodes, a hard-throwing
left-hander, would be inserted into their bullpen, joining Mike
Stanton, Jeff Nelson (currently coming back from an injury), Jason
Grimsley, Allen Watson and Dan Naulty in middle relief.
</P>
<P>
   With Rhodes in the fold, Yankee officials would then meet and
discuss whether the staff is strong enough to trade Pettitte. (If
Pettitte is traded, then Triple-A pitcher Ed Yarnall would be
shifted into the fifth spot in the Yankees' rotation).
</P>
<P>
   In return for Rhodes, the Orioles have asked for the Triple-A
infielder D'Angelo Jiminez and Luis De Los Santos, a right-handed
pitcher. The Yankees balked at this, offering De Los Santos and
another undetermined player; the two sides continued to trade
proposals early Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees agreed to the trade for Leyritz on Friday evening,
in exchange for Single-A pitcher Geraldo Padua. As Yankees players
learned of the deal Saturday, the reaction was universal: they
shook their heads and smiled and laughed about the character that
is the king, as Leyritz called himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps the clubhouse loose,'' Pettitte said. ``He's
definitely unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, 35, was batting .239 for the San Diego Padres this
season; he has not played much, accumulating only 134 at-bats,
because of a broken hand. But Leyritz has a great track record as a
power hitter in the post-season, with seven home runs in 59
at-bats, including the game-tying home run in the pivotal fourth
game of the 1996 World Series, which Torre called the biggest homer
of his managerial career.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz used to be Pettitte's personal catcher, but Torre made
it clear that would not be the case this time around. Leyritz will
be used as a role player, sometimes filling in as a first baseman,
sometimes a pinch-hitter, and perhaps developing into a
right-handed designated hitter. This year, designated hitter Chili
Davis is batting .297 with 12 homers against right-handed pitchers,
but his power numbers against left-handers aren't as good _ two
home runs in 91 at-bats, with a .286 average.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz will take the place of veteran infielder Jeff Manto, who
has one hit in eight at-bats since joining Torre's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good hitter and he loves that spotlight,'' Torre said
of Leyritz. ``That's half the battle. He's an improvement on what
we have.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pettitte heard Saturday morning that it's possible _ perhaps
likely _ that he would remain with the team, but he still seemed a
bit melancholy. He heard about the published comments attributed to
George Steinbrenner: the Yankees' principal owner said he was
deferring to Torre's wishes, and that the manager could get a
chance to straighten out the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want your owner to want you around,'' Pettitte said
quietly, believing that Steinbrenner's comments were not exactly an
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte looked tired, as if he was weary of the prospect of
being traded. ``What's tiring is just not pitching well,'' said
Pettitte, who threw in the bullpen Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees do keep Pettitte, the pressure will remain for
him to do well; before the off-season, he must make Yankee
officials believe he is worthy of the $7 million-to-$7.5 million
salary he will earn next year, and right now, Pettitte is in
perhaps the deepest funk of his career, with a 7-8 record and a
5.65 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts who have seen Pettitte recently are sure his problems are
related to his confidence. ``He's just got to learn to trust his
fastball again,'' one scout said, ``and think about keeping it down
in the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Pettitte remains with the Yankees, Torre thinks that
the left-hander will rebound once the trade deadline passes, once
that stress is relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the fact Andy will get a chance to stay,'' said
Torre, again adding that there is the chance Pettitte will be
traded before midnight. ``We'll see how he pitches after this.''

SPORTS COLUMN: UMPIRES' ACTS LEAVE BLACK MARK ON UNIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Phillips says he will ``fight to the death,'' but unless
the courts bail him out, his umpires' union is already gone, shot
dead with Phillips' own gun, mostly to the cheers of the audience
watching this theater of the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sad story, almost pathetic. But be it the work of
arrogance or gross tactical miscalculation or both, Phillips has
apparently wrecked his own union and killed off, at last count, 22
careers, not counting his own.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, though, the greater damage may be to the
American labor movement, at a time when it is trying to reverse a
decades-long decline and can least afford the public relations
fallout from Phillips' horrendous call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, a story like this one reinforces a very old and
inaccurate stereotype of big labor, from the 1930s and 1940s, of
Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters,'' said Tom Juravich, the director of
the Labor Center at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
``It creates the notion that it all hinges on the personality of
the larger-than-life leader, when the reality is that trade unions
should come down to organization, to the day-to-day rank and
file.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just Phillips, not just the few dozen umpires who
bought into the cockamamie tactic of negotiation by resignation.
When the pro basketball players were locked out last fall, they
organized a charity game for themselves and wanted to charge $1,000
for a courtside seat. Brother, they seemed to be asking, can you
spare a grand?
</P>
<P>
   As anthems go, that one most likely didn't inspire all those
young high-tech sector workers, the ones organized labor is
desperate to recruit, to bolt from their work stations and make a
run for the nearest union hall.
</P>
<P>
   People always want to talk about how effective sports can be in
at least elevating the debate, educating the masses, on hot-button
issues. Magic Johnson's infection with the virus that causes AIDS
turned up the volume on safe-sex talk. Cancer scares for athletes
like Darryl Strawberry supposedly motivate others to get examined.
Lance Armstrong gives cancer victims hope. Mark McGwire speaks out
against child abuse, and suddenly the cause has been furthered by
his 500-foot clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that sports has a tremendous impact on the
society, and in many cases, the first taste the youth of this
country will get on an issue is through when they read or hear
through sports,'' said Charles Kernaghan, director of the National
Labor Committee, a New York-based human rights watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, the notion of this umpires' debacle shaping
anyone's union sensibility has to be as scary a proposition for
organized labor as Ronald Reagan, a marketing disaster along the
lines of the air traffic controllers. And what about all this
coverage for 68 umpires who make from $75,000 to $400,000 _ is it
proportionately in line with the amount of attention 10,000
striking hospital workers would get? Of course it isn't, but sports
unions, which once fought valiantly for benefits that the
blue-collar worker could at least relate to, have for the most part
evolved to represent the celebritization of organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   Their message, however distorted, has tremendous market reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that popular athletes think unions are good may be a
counterbalance, but clearly, sports unions reinforce the notion
that unions take a self-serving approach and tend to be primarily
about money,'' said Richard Hurd, a professor in labor studies at
Cornell University. ``In that sense, it's not great for the labor
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The umpires' story is not about money, but then, Phillips did
not allow the dispute to reach the point where his membership could
at least be viewed sympathetically. Phillips has won many battles
through the years, many I applauded, but, sorry, baseball's
mandated enforcement of the strike zone does not qualify as
workplace abuse. The umpires have in the last few years come off as
power-drunk, out of touch with their relative importance to the
game. The decision by Phillips to have his membership stick its
collective head under the guillotine will be remembered as a
landmark act of self-destruction that even Michael Moore can't
defend.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the knowledge that sports owners rip off taxpayers and
hide profits under the pillow, it has become increasingly difficult
to support sports unions as the 1990s have wound down. As Richard
Hurd suggested, they have failed to articulate a relevant social
message, anything beyond greed. When people like Charles Kernaghan
have asked popular athletes to speak out against the companies
engaged in sweatshop abuses abroad, they are met with deafening
silence, individually and collectively. The opportunity to balance
the inevitable resentment of their millions, to get the news media
back in their camp, is lost.
</P>
<P>
   The union-bashing, unfair in how it ultimately affects real
union workers, goes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to make choices about union membership based on
their own workplace conditions,'' Hurd said. ``But the sports
unions, mainly because of the amount of attention they get, do have
an impact on public perception.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, is the public's perception of Richard Phillips: His
blind arrogance has led one-third of his membership to the cusp of
unemployment. What Phillips is calling a ``fight to the death,''
most people see as group suicide. &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE CITY OVERHEATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Aug. 1:
</P>
<P>
   July in New York this year was like living in the hot breath of
a big dog _ a subjective measure, true, but just as precise in its
own way as any of the indices that try to put a number on how hot
it really feels. It hasn't yet been as scorching as it was on July
9, 1936, when the temperature reached 106 degrees in Central Park.
There haven't been three consecutive days over 100, as there were
in July 1993 and August 1948, nor have there even been as many July
days over 90 as there were in 1993, when there were 20. What makes
this the hottest July on record isn't the extremes of temperature.
It's the average, which has been more than 4 degrees higher than
normal, nearly 82 degrees, the highest since the previous record in
1955.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the heat of previous summers seems a little academic if you
are caught in a heat wave at the moment. When wind whips through
Times Square, it is a hot wind. If rain falls, it is a hot rain.
Every day brings a kind of annealing. Blasts of superheated air
rising from subway grates meet superchilled air spilling outward
through open doorways. The body heat of strangers crowding a
crosswalk is stirred by the hot exhaust of a bus caught in traffic,
by the engine heat rising from trucks and automobiles gridlocked on
softening asphalt. Sunlight caroms off skyscrapers, doubling and
redoubling the sun overhead. The nominal outdoor temperature _ the
actual high as predicted by the forecasters _ is something most of
us come across only fleetingly, a reasonably tolerable mean between
the extremes of incubation on the city streets and refrigeration
indoors.
</P>
<P>
   In more temperate seasons, the city quiets down enough at night
to create the illusion of silence, like the illusion of starlight
among so many urban street lamps. But those who try to sleep
without air-conditioning, their windows flung wide, know that
silence, like slumber, has been banished by the heat. A million
air-conditioners rumble and hiss all night long, compressors
cycling on and off, fans whirring, washing the city clean of lesser
noises. It would be tempting to lie in bed and imagine what that
collective, monotonous roar sounds like _ a distant waterfall, a
nearby freeway, a plague of low-frequency locusts _ except that if
you sleep without air-conditioning you try not to think at all.
Thinking, on hot nights, is the same as sweating.
</P>
<P>
   For now, all the cool air is in Canada, where the jet stream is
being held hostage. A cold front lies above the international
border like a swag of fresh air, waiting until who knows when to
push southward and eastward and blow July's used-up air out to sea.
The push will come sooner or later, as it does every year, perhaps
as early as this week. Cool air will sweep over the city and only
the subways will remember what July was like. Small consolation,
isn't it? &QL;

   When the Detroit running back Barry Sanders announced his
retirement Wednesday, the sports talk programs and studio shows
were filled with arguments about where Sanders ranked among running
backs in the history of the National Football League. It was one of
those maddening, fascinating and sometimes exhilarating debates.
</P>
<P>
   So it is fitting that a new book, which ranks the top 100
professional players of all time, comes along, and it is, of
course, maddening, fascinating and exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sporting News Selects Football's 100 Greatest Players''
gets a lot right, and a lot wrong, but arguing over who ranks where
is always the best part of these kinds of lists. The book spans the
entire history of professional football, from Jim Thorpe to
Sanders, who, by the way, ranks No. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve editors from the weekly newspaper took six weeks to
whittle a list of 300 candidates __ all Hall of Fame players or
near Hall of Fame level _ down to the top 100. Some rankings boggle
the mind. Others are exactly on target. Overall it is a top-notch
list.
</P>
<P>
   One source of continuous debate will be the book's comparisons
of modern players with those from earlier generations. The former
Washington quarterback Sammy Baugh, for example, is ranked the 11th
best player while the Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman is 95th. To
one who never saw Baugh play, it makes no sense that Aikman is
ranked so far behind Baugh. To one who watched Baugh win five
division titles, two NFL championships and set 16 passing records
in 16 seasons, Baugh was indeed the better player.
</P>
<P>
   The book is like a time machine, taking you across the history
of the league, and it inevitably raises the question of how players
from the 1920s, say, would do today. Would Red Grange, ranked 80th
best, have enough speed for today's game? Would the Giants' Mel
Hein, who played center in the 1930s at 225 pounds, stand up
against Warren Sapp?
</P>
<P>
   Although the editors made few misses, the list is sure to
generate more arguments when the book is published next month.
Charlie Joiner is No. 100, despite an amazing 750 career catches.
Joe Namath is 96th, one spot after Aikman, and probably deserves to
be higher. Mike Ditka is 90th and could easily have been 15 spots
higher. Brett Favre, who has two 4,000-yard passing seasons, is
82nd. Kellen Winslow, who played in five Pro Bowl games, is 73rd.
Steve Young, who is a sure Hall of Famer, is 63rd, four spots
behind Fran Tarkenton and 22 behind Bart Starr. The Buffalo
defensive lineman Bruce Smith is 58th, running back Tony Dorsett
53rd, and Baltimore tight end John Mackey 48th, although he should
probably be in the top 40.
</P>
<P>
   One of the stranger rankings is that of running back Eric
Dickerson, 38th on the list. He never played on a championship team
and was at times a selfish player, but his not being among the top
30 is a mystery. So is the positioning of O.J. Simpson, No. 26, so
far behind Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 are mostly excellent choices. They are:
</P>
<P>
   10. The Dallas defensive lineman Bob Lilly, called a
once-in-a-lifetime player by coach Tom Landry. 9. The Chicago
linebacker Dick Butkus, one of the meanest players in league
history. 8. Walter Payton, who missed one game his entire career.
7. Quarterback Otto Graham, who led the Cleveland Browns to a
47-4-3 record from 1946 to 1949. 6. Wide receiver Don Hutson, who
could have played in any era. 5. Johnny Unitas, the most accurate
quarterback ever. 4. Lawrence Taylor, who to many should be ranked
first. 3. Joe Montana: No one was better in a big game than he. 2.
Jerry Rice, who has both Hall of Fame hands and work ethic. 1. Jim
Brown, who retired at 29. He could have played at least five more
years and owned every rushing record.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the Reeves Vesuvius
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Redskins last week called the Atlanta Falcons to
see if they were interested in trading the Pro Bowl running back
Jamal Anderson. It was more than just an exploratory call since the
Redskins offered a No. 1 pick. The Falcons declined the offer.
</P>
<P>
   But the discussions may be far from over. Washington is expected
to make another offer soon that could include several draft picks,
possibly two No. 1s.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has been putting on a show of bravura, saying in
interviews last week that he might begin speaking out against the
Falcons and coach Dan Reeves. It is Anderson, however, who needs to
be careful.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves has little tolerance for holdouts and has told some in
the Falcons organization that he believes the team can win without
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves also does not mind playing games with a holdout. When he
coached the Giants, there were several occasions when his
assistants would talk to their friends about a holdout, telling
them that if the player did not soon report he might not be asked
back at all. This of course would get back to the player and
terrify him. It happened once to the former Giants linebacker Corey
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   If Anderson is not careful, this could get ugly. Not for the
Falcons, necessarily, but for him.
</P>
<P>
   A Cowboy Long Shot
</P>
<P>
   The award for most unreal signing of the year thus far goes to
the Cowboys, who added the troubled defensive lineman Alonzo
Spellman last week. He signed a one-year contract for $400,000 _
there was no signing bonus _ though he can make an additional
$400,000 in incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Spellman suffers from bipolar disorder, a condition that can be
treated by medication. If he does not take his medicine, he is
prone to strange, manic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Spellman has been involved in a series of
disturbing acts, the most bizarre of which occurred last year when
Spellman barricaded himself inside the home of his publicist for
eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas owner Jerry Jones pledged last year that he would
stay away from troubled players like Spellman. In the April draft,
Dallas could have drafted wide receiver Randy Moss but refused to
do so because of his troubled past. But Dallas was desperate for
Spellman. The Cowboys expect defensive lineman Leon Lett to be
suspended for at least the first four games of the season. If
Spellman is in shape, he could easily start in Lett's place.
</P>
<P>
   Around the League
</P>
<P>
   _ The accident that left the son of the former Giants
quarterback Jeff Hostetler paralyzed has recently taken two happy
twists. First, Hostetler's son, Tyler, who was injured while riding
a sport recreation vehicle, continues to make dramatic improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the actor Christopher Reeves, himself paralyzed,
contacted Jeff Hostetler, and the two plan on working together to
help with charitable causes involving paralysis victims.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Giants' contract negotiations with defensive end Michael
Strahan plod along. Look for a deal to be done by the end of camp.
</P>
<P>
   _ As of Friday, Barry Sanders had still not turned in the
required paperwork to the league office to officially retire from
the NFL. The Lions remain hopeful he will change his mind.

EDITORIAL: PROTECTING COMPUTERS, AND PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Aug. 1:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is right to concern itself with
protecting America's computer networks against cyber attacks by
terrorists or foreign governments. But a draft plan now being
considered by the White House could lead to federal monitoring of
much of the nation's governmental and commercial computer
communications. Such broad governmental surveillance is not a
reliable way of assuring computer security and intrudes too deeply
into the privacy of law-abiding Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The White House proposal follows a review President Clinton
ordered last year of the vulnerability of the federal government's
computer networks to intrusion and damage by terrorists. It
recommends expanding the monitoring system now used by the Defense
Department throughout the federal government. This means automated
software would be used to scan the messages and files of millions
of civilian government employees to spot suspicious patterns. The
results would then be turned over to a special task force overseen
by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Computer network security is a real and growing problem. The
federal government needs to protect not just sensitive defense
secrets, but also the computers that manage air traffic control,
Social Security, Medicare and a host of other civilian programs.
</P>
<P>
   But systematic monitoring of all federal employees is a clumsy
and inefficient way to protect government networks. Software that
can reliably detect patterns of computer manipulation does not now
exist. Broad surveillance of all government computer users would
still permit some illicit tampering to go undetected. Meanwhile,
innocent federal employees are likely to be subjected to electronic
snooping and investigative surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Even more troubling than the monitoring of all federal computers
is the plan's proposal for extending the automated surveillance
program to private-sector networks. Although this would only be
done with the agreement of the relevant corporate executives,
unwary employees or e-mail correspondents could find their messages
and files scrutinized by the government's software as well. The
results of this monitoring would also be reviewed by federal
agencies, although separately from the FBI-run system for
government employees. Sophisticated computer users could escape
surveillance with readily available encryption programs, allowing
serious cyber terrorists to elude detection while the software
snooped on ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The administration needs to come up with new approaches to the
problem of computer security that depend less on the wholesale
monitoring of private communications. Its current proposal would
create more problems than it would solve.  &QL;

 &HT;    Bush must share glory of Texas education success
 &HT;    (Eds: Part of a continuing series on how Gov. George W. Bush's
stands on the issues have played out in Texas.)
 &HT;    (With BUSH-EDUCATION-RIVALS.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Several years ago, 1,200 Austin schoolchildren
would not have spent their summer breaks reading and writing. But
that's exactly what they did this summer in hopes of improving
their reading skills before they enter third grade this month.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, the students, considered ``at-risk'' mostly
because their families are poor, easily could have slipped through
the cracks. They might have been absent the day all students take
the state skills exam. They might have been exempted from the test
as special education or bilingual students. If they took the Texas
Assessment of Academic Skills exam, a majority would have flunked.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, students like these _ minority and low-income _ are
making the greatest gains on the TAAS and showing up their peers
nationally. And reading programs, such as the Summer Opportunity to
Accelerate Reading (SOAR) program, are helping to turn around a
stubborn trend of poor test scores for low-income Hispanic and
African American students.
</P>
<P>
   Rising test scores and a shrinking achievement gap between white
and minority students during the past five years have drawn
national attention to Texas public schools. But the focus on the
so-called Texas miracle in education has intensified with Gov.
George W. Bush becoming the front-runner for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas leads the nation when it comes to improving public
schools,'' Bush said last month in signing a new education bill.
``We are raising standards, strengthening accountability and
funding early intervention so that every child learns to read, and
no child is left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush doesn't specifically claim credit for the gains, but he
doesn't give credit to others, either. Education experts say Texas'
gains are more the result of reforms initiated 15 years ago _
reduced class sizes and equalized funding for rich and poor school
districts _ than the state's testing and accountability system that
has matured since Bush took office in 1995. What Bush does get
credit for is not retreating from those reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the basic pieces of educational reforms
were put in place by Governor Mark White and others,'' said Gary
Orfield, professor of education at Harvard University, who has
researched student gains in Texas. ``For George Bush to take credit
for academic achievement in Texas is like Bill Clinton taking
credit for bringing down the Berlin Wall. It happened before him.''
</P>
<P>
   Debate over improvement in Texas public schools goes to the
heart of one presidential issue: which candidate is best suited to
lead a nation at a time when education is a top domestic priority?
</P>
<P>
   Although education was a big part of Bush's Texas re-election
campaign _ he touted his plan to end social promotions and enact
reading readiness programs, as well as his support for private
school vouchers _ he has yet to reveal any specifics about how he
would improve the nation's schools. That has caused Democrats to
repeat their charge that Bush is style over substance, but Bush
says he will announce specific policies later. The leading
Democrat, Vice President Al Gore, and several other candidates
already have released specifics about their plans.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Texas public schools have given Bush plenty to
brag about.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has set high standards and focused on reading in early
grades, moved the agenda forward on social promotion and conveyed
he is very conscious of Hispanic, African American as well as
majority children,'' said Lowell J. Bethel, professor of curriculum
and instruction at the University of Texas. ``Texas has given him a
platform on which to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards says improved student performance
shows the governor's policies are working.
</P>
<P>
   ``In January 1996, he launched the profound goal of every child
reading by the end of third grade,'' she said. ``When you raise the
bar, people rise to the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Early reforms
</P>
<P>
   Earlier reformers, including former Democratic Gov. White and
Dallas billionaire Ross Perot, who headed White's special committee
on education in 1984, deserve the bulk of the credit for improved
test scores. They established smaller classes (22 students in
grades kindergarten through four), competency testing for teachers
and no-pass, no-play rules, which sidelined students from athletics
or other extracurricular activities when they failed to score 70
(of a possible 100) on their courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1984, we had a reduction in class sizes, and that has
been one of the greatest reforms that has brought student
achievement up to the level it is,'' said Doug Rogers, executive
director of the Association for Texas Professional Educators, the
state's largest educators' organization.
</P>
<P>
   Al Kauffman, the lead attorney for the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund, which successfully sued the state in
1984 to equalize state funding between poor and wealthy districts,
says the financing reforms and smaller class sizes have had the
most impact on raising student performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When poor districts have closer to the same revenue as other
districts, then they can compete better for teachers, build better
libraries, improve the curriculum and create better learning
environments,'' Kauffman said.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Orfield, the Harvard researcher, sees it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who knows school reform knows it takes a number of
years to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Accountability is key
</P>
<P>
   Texas' accountability system is one of the nation's toughest,
according to Education Weekly, a national trade magazine. The
program began under Bush's predecessor, Gov. Ann Richards. Every
year, each of Texas' 7,053 public schools and 1,042 districts are
ranked from ``exemplary'' to ``low-performing,'' based largely on
students' TAAS scores. But the system goes further, holding
individual schools and districts accountable for the performance of
each student subgroup _ black, Hispanic and economically
disadvantaged, as measured by children receiving free and
reduced-price lunches. If any one of those subgroups fails to make
the grade, the entire school or district is ranked low-performing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has strongly backed the system, and his education
commissioner, Mike Moses, has continued to raise TAAS passing
standards. This year, for the first time, schools also were
accountable for the performance of special education students who
took the TAAS and students with limited English who took a Spanish
version.
</P>
<P>
   Those accomplishments stand out even more, researchers say,
because Texas has turned around its schools in the face of
demographic shifts that have created a public school enrollment
that is mostly Hispanic and African American. A quarter of the 4
million students are poor. Minority and low-income students'
performance, overall, has tended to lag behind whites'.
</P>
<P>
   Several states, including Georgia and California, which also
have a lot of minority and poor students, are looking to replicate
Texas' accountability provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the reforms predate Bush, he is bound to get
much of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could he not glide in on those achievements?'' Rogers
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's initiatives
</P>
<P>
   That aside, Bush has accomplishments _ and failures _ of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he pushed for legislation in 1995 that overhauled
academic standards for all grade levels, a process begun under
Richards. The new standards require students to take more and
tougher math, English, science, geography and technology courses to
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Bush used his bully pulpit to emphasize reading and
pass legislation sending an additional $32 million to schools to
improve reading instruction. More third-graders passed the reading
TAAS this year _ 88 percent of students not in special education,
up from 77 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, in three straight legislative sessions, failed to pass
a pilot voucher program that would allow parents to use public tax
dollars to pay tuition at private schools. His home-rule school
district initiative, to free districts from state mandates, fell by
the wayside when no districts adopted it. The data are still out on
the performance of charter schools _ an enterprise pushed by Bush _
and a few of the schools have folded under scandal.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush took office, he proposed increasing the state share of
funding for public education to 60 percent. But the state share has
hovered around 45 percent during his tenure. It is uncertain how
that compares to other states this year. But in 1996, Texas lagged
behind California, which financed 57 percent of public education,
and Florida, with 49 percent. Texas' was ahead of New York, which
funded 37 percent of public education that year, according to
figures provided by the Education Commission of the States.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, high school dropout rates _ particularly among
Hispanics _ still are a problem. The Texas Education Agency says
dropout rates have fallen. About 9 percent of students who started
ninth grade dropped out by 12th grade, according to Texas Education
Agency figures for the period between 1993-94 and 1996-97. That is
lower than the 10 percent reported the previous period that ended
in 1995-96. That was higher than other large states: California and
New York both had drop out rates below 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But San Antonio-based Intercultural Development Research
Association, which studies education and equity issues affecting
Hispanics, says the dropout rate is four times higher than TEA
reports: 43 percent of students during the four-year period,
1993-94 to 1995-96, did not graduate, according to an IDRA study.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, this session was a good one for Bush. He
signed legislation that sent schools their largest state funding
increase ever, giving all teachers, school librarians and
counselors a $3,000 pay raise. More state dollars could help school
districts hold the line on local property tax increases. The bill
expands prekindergarten and kindergarten programs and provides
extra money to help schools offer more advanced placement and
honors courses.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush passed a controversial bill to halt so-called social
promotions _ the practice of passing failing students to keep them
with their age group. Under the law, third-graders starting in the
2002-03 school year will not be promoted if they fail the TAAS
reading test.
</P>
<P>
   Bethel credits Bush for ending automatic promotion and backing
it with $200 million for intervention, tutorial and remedial
programs to diagnose learning deficiencies early and get students
back on track fast. But he, like many other researchers, worries
about using the TAAS to flunk students who otherwise make passing
grades and get high acclaim from teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testing is a useful device especially as a diagnostic tool,
but it can be misused,'' Bethel said. ``Tests ... can separate
children, being a badge of attainment for some and (a badge of)
failure for others.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensified focus on passing the TAAS and reading on grade
level prompted Austin Independent School District officials to
create the SOAR reading program at several campuses. Schools across
Texas are doing similar things to keep up with tougher standards
and accountability, educators say. The Del Valle district has
extended the school year into the summer to catch up some kids and
advance others. Other districts, including Austin, run TAAS camps
on weekends or during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are serious about teaching our kids to read,'' says Linda
D. Clark, principal of SOAR, which meets four hours a day for four
weeks during the summer. ``When the kids come here, we focus on
reading. We don't do recess.''

 &HT;    What do the other candidates say?
 &HT;    (With BUSH-EDUCATION.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a sampling of other candidates' education policies,
gathered from their official Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley: Believes education should be addressed from a
kindergarten through college perspective (''K-16'') rather than
kindergarten through 12th grade. He also advocates national
educational standards, stronger accountability and ``good
technology in our classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore: Wants preschool available for every child. Wants to end
social promotions and end the use of ``unqualified teachers, some
of whom are teaching in areas they did not study.'' Gore also wants
schools to teach ``character education.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Alexander: Pushing for vouchers via ``$1,500 Hope
Scholarships for low- and middle-income children to be used at any
school they want and the schools decide how to spend the money.''
Wants to pay good teachers more, replace bilingual education with
``English immersion'' programs and cut federal regulations to give
all schools the same flexibility and freedoms as charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer: Wants to decentralize major education policy
decisions, giving power to states and communities. Supports
Education Savings Accounts (ESA) and ``other measures to restore
parental choice and parental rights in education.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Buchanan: Wants to abolish the Department of Education
and shift its responsibilities to the states. Advocates more
charter and magnet schools and would push for a constitutional
amendment allowing voluntary school prayer to ``take back our
public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole: Pushing to restore discipline to the classroom
and encourage greater participation of parents in their children's
educations. Wants to ``elevate the position of teachers in society
by rewarding excellence and by giving teachers flexibility to be
intellectually creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes: Supports ``public school choice, charter schools,
educational savings accounts, vouchers, private opportunity
scholarships, tuition tax credits, home schooling, English
immersion programs and block granting federal education funds
states so parents, teachers and local officials can use to improve
their public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Orrin Hatch: Advocates helping school districts finance building
and construction, but does not support doing it through ``another
big federal direct spending program.'' He says there is a federal
role, but ``we are walking a fine line between tax incentive and
federal subsidy, between leveraging resources and establishing a
new form of financial dependence.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes: Favors school choice, allowing parents to use tax
dollars to send their children to ``schools that reflect the
parents' faith and values.'' Says prayer should be allowed in
schools.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain: Wants to provide ``educational opportunities'' for
disadvantaged children through a three-year nationwide voucher
program. It would authorize $1.8 billion each year be allocated to
states for that purpose. It would be financed by eliminating
ethanol, sugar, gas and oil subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle: Pushing for vouchers, allowing ``parents to choose
the best schools for their children, particularly children in
low-income families.'' Wants to expand the charter schools program,
strengthen local control of schools and decrease the ``bureaucratic
control from Washington, D.C.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Several years ago, 1,200 Austin schoolchildren
would not have spent their summer breaks reading and writing. But
that's exactly what they did this summer in hopes of improving
their reading skills before they enter third grade this month.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, the students, considered ``at-risk'' mostly
because their families are poor, easily could have slipped through
the cracks. They might have been absent the day all students take
the state skills exam. They might have been exempted from the test
as special education or bilingual students. If they took the Texas
Assessment of Academic Skills exam, a majority would have flunked.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, students like these _ minority and low-income _ are
making the greatest gains on the TAAS and showing up their peers
nationally. And reading programs, such as the Summer Opportunity to
Accelerate Reading (SOAR) program, are helping to turn around a
stubborn trend of poor test scores for low-income Hispanic and
African American students.
</P>
<P>
   Rising test scores and a shrinking achievement gap between white
and minority students during the past five years have drawn
national attention to Texas public schools. But the focus on the
so-called Texas miracle in education has intensified with Gov.
George W. Bush becoming the front-runner for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas leads the nation when it comes to improving public
schools,'' Bush said last month in signing a new education bill.
``We are raising standards, strengthening accountability and
funding early intervention so that every child learns to read, and
no child is left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush doesn't specifically claim credit for the gains, but he
doesn't give credit to others, either. Education experts say Texas'
gains are more the result of reforms initiated 15 years ago _
reduced class sizes and equalized funding for rich and poor school
districts _ than the state's testing and accountability system that
has matured since Bush took office in 1995. What Bush does get
credit for is not retreating from those reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the basic pieces of educational reforms
were put in place by Governor Mark White and others,'' said Gary
Orfield, professor of education at Harvard University, who has
researched student gains in Texas. ``For George Bush to take credit
for academic achievement in Texas is like Bill Clinton taking
credit for bringing down the Berlin Wall. It happened before him.''
</P>
<P>
   Debate over improvement in Texas public schools goes to the
heart of one presidential issue: which candidate is best suited to
lead a nation at a time when education is a top domestic priority?
</P>
<P>
   Although education was a big part of Bush's Texas re-election
campaign _ he touted his plan to end social promotions and enact
reading readiness programs, as well as his support for private
school vouchers _ he has yet to reveal any specifics about how he
would improve the nation's schools. That has caused Democrats to
repeat their charge that Bush is style over substance, but Bush
says he will announce specific policies later. The leading
Democrat, Vice President Al Gore, and several other candidates
already have released specifics about their plans.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Texas public schools have given Bush plenty to
brag about.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has set high standards and focused on reading in early
grades, moved the agenda forward on social promotion and conveyed
he is very conscious of Hispanic, African American as well as
majority children,'' said Lowell J. Bethel, professor of curriculum
and instruction at the University of Texas. ``Texas has given him a
platform on which to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards says improved student performance
shows the governor's policies are working.
</P>
<P>
   ``In January 1996, he launched the profound goal of every child
reading by the end of third grade,'' she said. ``When you raise the
bar, people rise to the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Early reforms
</P>
<P>
   Earlier reformers, including former Democratic Gov. White and
Dallas billionaire Ross Perot, who headed White's special committee
on education in 1984, deserve the bulk of the credit for improved
test scores. They established smaller classes (22 students in
grades kindergarten through four), competency testing for teachers
and no-pass, no-play rules, which sidelined students from athletics
or other extracurricular activities when they failed to score 70
(of a possible 100) on their courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1984, we had a reduction in class sizes, and that has
been one of the greatest reforms that has brought student
achievement up to the level it is,'' said Doug Rogers, executive
director of the Association for Texas Professional Educators, the
state's largest educators' organization.
</P>
<P>
   Al Kauffman, the lead attorney for the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund, which successfully sued the state in
1984 to equalize state funding between poor and wealthy districts,
says the financing reforms and smaller class sizes have had the
most impact on raising student performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When poor districts have closer to the same revenue as other
districts, then they can compete better for teachers, build better
libraries, improve the curriculum and create better learning
environments,'' Kauffman said.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Orfield, the Harvard researcher, sees it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who knows school reform knows it takes a number of
years to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Accountability is key
</P>
<P>
   Texas' accountability system is one of the nation's toughest,
according to Education Weekly, a national trade magazine. The
program began under Bush's predecessor, Gov. Ann Richards. Every
year, each of Texas' 7,053 public schools and 1,042 districts are
ranked from ``exemplary'' to ``low-performing,'' based largely on
students' TAAS scores. But the system goes further, holding
individual schools and districts accountable for the performance of
each student subgroup _ black, Hispanic and economically
disadvantaged, as measured by children receiving free and
reduced-price lunches. If any one of those subgroups fails to make
the grade, the entire school or district is ranked low-performing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has strongly backed the system, and his education
commissioner, Mike Moses, has continued to raise TAAS passing
standards. This year, for the first time, schools also were
accountable for the performance of special education students who
took the TAAS and students with limited English who took a Spanish
version.
</P>
<P>
   Those accomplishments stand out even more, researchers say,
because Texas has turned around its schools in the face of
demographic shifts that have created a public school enrollment
that is mostly Hispanic and African American. A quarter of the 4
million students are poor. Minority and low-income students'
performance, overall, has tended to lag behind whites'.
</P>
<P>
   Several states, including Georgia and California, which also
have a lot of minority and poor students, are looking to replicate
Texas' accountability provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the reforms predate Bush, he is bound to get
much of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could he not glide in on those achievements?'' Rogers
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's initiatives
</P>
<P>
   That aside, Bush has accomplishments _ and failures _ of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he pushed for legislation in 1995 that overhauled
academic standards for all grade levels, a process begun under
Richards. The new standards require students to take more and
tougher math, English, science, geography and technology courses to
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Bush used his bully pulpit to emphasize reading and
pass legislation sending an additional $32 million to schools to
improve reading instruction. More third-graders passed the reading
TAAS this year _ 88 percent of students not in special education,
up from 77 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, in three straight legislative sessions, failed to pass
a pilot voucher program that would allow parents to use public tax
dollars to pay tuition at private schools. His home-rule school
district initiative, to free districts from state mandates, fell by
the wayside when no districts adopted it. The data are still out on
the performance of charter schools _ an enterprise pushed by Bush _
and a few of the schools have folded under scandal.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush took office, he proposed increasing the state share of
funding for public education to 60 percent. But the state share has
hovered around 45 percent during his tenure. It is uncertain how
that compares to other states this year. But in 1996, Texas lagged
behind California, which financed 57 percent of public education,
and Florida, with 49 percent. Texas' was ahead of New York, which
funded 37 percent of public education that year, according to
figures provided by the Education Commission of the States.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, high school dropout rates _ particularly among
Hispanics _ still are a problem. The Texas Education Agency says
dropout rates have fallen. About 9 percent of students who started
ninth grade dropped out by 12th grade, according to Texas Education
Agency figures for the period between 1993-94 and 1996-97. That is
lower than the 10 percent reported the previous period that ended
in 1995-96. That was higher than other large states: California and
New York both had drop out rates below 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But San Antonio-based Intercultural Development Research
Association, which studies education and equity issues affecting
Hispanics, says the dropout rate is four times higher than TEA
reports: 43 percent of students during the four-year period,
1993-94 to 1995-96, did not graduate, according to an IDRA study.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, this session was a good one for Bush. He
signed legislation that sent schools their largest state funding
increase ever, giving all teachers, school librarians and
counselors a $3,000 pay raise. More state dollars could help school
districts hold the line on local property tax increases. The bill
expands prekindergarten and kindergarten programs and provides
extra money to help schools offer more advanced placement and
honors courses.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush passed a controversial bill to halt so-called social
promotions _ the practice of passing failing students to keep them
with their age group. Under the law, third-graders starting in the
2002-03 school year will not be promoted if they fail the TAAS
reading test.
</P>
<P>
   Bethel credits Bush for ending automatic promotion and backing
it with $200 million for intervention, tutorial and remedial
programs to diagnose learning deficiencies early and get students
back on track fast. But he, like many other researchers, worries
about using the TAAS to flunk students who otherwise make passing
grades and get high acclaim from teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testing is a useful device especially as a diagnostic tool,
but it can be misused,'' Bethel said. ``Tests ... can separate
children, being a badge of attainment for some and (a badge of)
failure for others.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensified focus on passing the TAAS and reading on grade
level prompted Austin Independent School District officials to
create the SOAR reading program at several campuses. Schools across
Texas are doing similar things to keep up with tougher standards
and accountability, educators say. The Del Valle district has
extended the school year into the summer to catch up some kids and
advance others. Other districts, including Austin, run TAAS camps
on weekends or during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are serious about teaching our kids to read,'' says Linda
D. Clark, principal of SOAR, which meets four hours a day for four
weeks during the summer. ``When the kids come here, we focus on
reading. We don't do recess.''
</P>

 &HT;    What do the other candidates say?
 &HT;    (With BUSH-EDUCATION.)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a sampling of other candidates' education policies,
gathered from their official Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley: Believes education should be addressed from a
kindergarten through college perspective (''K-16'') rather than
kindergarten through 12th grade. He also advocates national
educational standards, stronger accountability and ``good
technology in our classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore: Wants preschool available for every child. Wants to end
social promotions and end the use of ``unqualified teachers, some
of whom are teaching in areas they did not study.'' Gore also wants
schools to teach ``character education.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Alexander: Pushing for vouchers via ``$1,500 Hope
Scholarships for low- and middle-income children to be used at any
school they want and the schools decide how to spend the money.''
Wants to pay good teachers more, replace bilingual education with
``English immersion'' programs and cut federal regulations to give
all schools the same flexibility and freedoms as charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer: Wants to decentralize major education policy
decisions, giving power to states and communities. Supports
Education Savings Accounts (ESA) and ``other measures to restore
parental choice and parental rights in education.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Buchanan: Wants to abolish the Department of Education
and shift its responsibilities to the states. Advocates more
charter and magnet schools and would push for a constitutional
amendment allowing voluntary school prayer to ``take back our
public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole: Pushing to restore discipline to the classroom
and encourage greater participation of parents in their children's
educations. Wants to ``elevate the position of teachers in society
by rewarding excellence and by giving teachers flexibility to be
intellectually creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes: Supports ``public school choice, charter schools,
educational savings accounts, vouchers, private opportunity
scholarships, tuition tax credits, home schooling, English
immersion programs and block granting federal education funds
states so parents, teachers and local officials can use to improve
their public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Orrin Hatch: Advocates helping school districts finance building
and construction, but does not support doing it through ``another
big federal direct spending program.'' He says there is a federal
role, but ``we are walking a fine line between tax incentive and
federal subsidy, between leveraging resources and establishing a
new form of financial dependence.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes: Favors school choice, allowing parents to use tax
dollars to send their children to ``schools that reflect the
parents' faith and values.'' Says prayer should be allowed in
schools.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain: Wants to provide ``educational opportunities'' for
disadvantaged children through a three-year nationwide voucher
program. It would authorize $1.8 billion each year be allocated to
states for that purpose. It would be financed by eliminating
ethanol, sugar, gas and oil subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle: Pushing for vouchers, allowing ``parents to choose
the best schools for their children, particularly children in
low-income families.'' Wants to expand the charter schools program,
strengthen local control of schools and decrease the ``bureaucratic
control from Washington, D.C.''

FREE AGENCY COULD REUNITE HARDAWAY AND O'NEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   He could be headed to Toronto for Charles Oakley and Tracy
McGrady. Or to Washington for Mitch Richmond. Jerry West met with
him last week in Los Angeles, and even though the Lakers now appear
to be out of the sweepstakes, who knows how sentimental Shaquille
O'Neal is for his long-lost teammate?
</P>
<P>
   At 12:01 a.m. Sunday, National Basketball Association teams
could officially begin signing free agents to contracts. In
Orlando, that means Anfernee Hardaway's days are numbered. While no
deal appeared imminent, Magic general manager John Gabriel sounded
almost resigned to parting with the All-Star guard, who has caused
the franchise more than its share of headaches over the last two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In regards to Penny, we just don't have anything yet,''
Gabriel said Friday. ``And I would be surprised on Sunday if we
did, though things can change awfully quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on which teams have room under the salary cap, Hardaway
would seem to be headed for Chicago, Toronto or the Los Angeles
Clippers _ the three teams with the most money to accommodate a
contract that could approach $70 million. Indiana and Atlanta also
have trade exceptions worth more than $4 million apiece, which they
could use to try to acquire a player of his caliber.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers seemed interested, especially after they picked up
Glen Rice's option year instead of signing him to an exorbitant new
deal _ a move that apparently caused a rift between Rice and the
team's management. O'Neal, who begrudgingly co-existed with
Hardaway in Orlando, said recently that he had a change of heart
about playing with his former teammate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Magic, the Hawks are apparently ready to deal
this week. Atlanta is on the cusp of sending Steve Smith to
Portland for Isaiah Rider and either Jim Jackson or Kelvin Cato. In
need of an athletic upgrade with a new arena to fill, the Hawks are
also said to be interested in acquiring the Los Angeles Clippers
free agent Lorenzen Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, a free agent, wants to make $8 million a season for
three years _ the last three years of his career, most likely. The
Raptors think that's too much, countering with $5.5 million a
season. After Orlando lost Horace Grant, it might take a chance on
Oakley in a sign-and-trade deal with Toronto. And Atlanta is not
out of the picture, either.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a shaky season with the Rockets and interest from other
teams, Scottie Pippen sounded like he was staying put in Houston
after early trade talk. Charles Barkley is making a lot of noise
about other teams contacting his agent, which means he will
probably remain with the Rockets too.
</P>
<P>
   With Sean Elliott most likely out for the season as he awaits a
kidney transplant, the Spurs have turned their attention to George
McCloud and Shandon Anderson to fill the void. But the Utah Jazz
are intent on keeping Anderson, along with all of their old guard.
Karl Malone has already agreed to an extension, while John Stockton
and Jeff Hornacek are just waiting to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were certainly devastated by our loss in the playoffs
because the expectations were very high,'' said Scott Layden, the
Jazz's vice president of basketball operations. ``But at the same
time, I don't think we can lose sight of what a good regular season
we had. One of the things that has helped us over the last several
years is that we've had a unique blend of veterans and young guys
come in, who have been very good slashers, namely Bryon Russell and
Shandon Anderson.''
</P>
<P>
   The league's lawyers will be in the NBA offices Sunday to help
with and approve transactions. But do not expect them to
rubber-stamp the contract that Corliss Williamson is about to sign
with Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, who played for $500,000 last season, may sign a deal
for nearly $60 million with the club. The Kings hired William B.
Gould IV, a Stanford law professor and former chairman of the
National Labor Relations Board, to handle the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise did not want the NBA to get the idea that it
already had a deal in place with Williamson last season when he
agreed to sign for a pittance. But with knowledge of many
under-the-table deals being reached over the last few years, it
would not be shocking to see the league's lawyers investigate
Williamson's new contract. Eventually, they will need to set an
example.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn Near Pact
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn is expected to sign a six-year extension worth
nearly $73 million with the New Jersey Nets as early as Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets apparently took to heart Van Horn's words in July, when
he gave the club one week to work out a new contract after the
signing period began. If the Nets failed to come to terms with him,
Van Horn said, he was prepared to play the last year under his
current deal and become a free agent next summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the extension, all but signed, not only gives Van Horn
long-term security but also insures the franchise's young nucleus
will remain intact for the next few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury signed a six-year, $70.9 million deal at the
trading deadline in March, and Kerry Kittles was given a six-year,
$50 million extension. Not coincidentally, all three players are
represented by the agent David Falk. By helping negotiate a deal
with the Timberwolves to move Marbury to the Meadowlands last
season, Falk helped insure that all his clients would be handsomely
compensated. His company's 4 percent take for nearly $195 million
worth of contracts? About $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, the Nets' starting power forward, who is currently
doing promotional work in Switzerland for Nike, will probably not
be in the United States for the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets also want to keep the role-playing forward Jamie Feick,
and have offered him $11 million over five years. But Utah is also
in the running. The Jazz has apparently offered Feick its $2
million exception _ and a chance to play in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Brandon is expected to sign an extension similar to Van
Horn's with the Timberwolves, a deal that could make Brandon one of
the five highest-paid point guards in the game. At an average of
close to $10 million a season, he would join the exclusive company
of Marbury, Rod Strickland, Allen Iverson and Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints About Rules
</P>
<P>
   From the Rocky Mountain Revue in Denver to the Boston Shootout,
there was one constant at the NBA-sponsored summer leagues the last
week of July: players complaining about the new and allegedly
improved rules.
</P>
<P>
   Since a special committee convened at the finals in June to come
up with a plan to reinvigorate offenses, officials have taken a
by-the-book approach to enforcing the experimental rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it make a difference if they call it like this during the
regular season?'' Antonio Daniels of the San Antonio Spurs asked in
Denver last week. ``Without question. I think you'll see a lot of
guys in foul trouble. A lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the changes:
</P>
<P>
   A defender who uses a hand or forearm check is immediately
whistled for a foul. An offensive player who moves while setting a
screen is tagged with a foul. Another experimental rule forbids
defenders from impeding offensive players cutting through the lane.
One rule seeks to make illegal defense guidelines more
understandable. Another sets the shot clock at 14 seconds after
fouls or out-of-bounds plays in the frontcourt, rather than the
usual 24 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Thorn, the league's senior vice president of operations,
argued in June that experimenting with the rules was necessary if
for no other reason than the fact that only Sacramento averaged
more than 100 points during the past season. But it appears the
changes make take a while to get used to.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it appears the league's general managers are already
preparing for a more free-flowing game.
</P>
<P>
   At the NBA draft in June, only two actual half-court power
players were taken in the first round, Elton Brand of Duke and
Kenny Thomas of New Mexico. Some analysts surmised this was a
result of the rules changes. Why bring in a plodding forward when
all he will do is get into foul trouble?

NEW YORK'S OZONE LEVELS ARE WORST IN A DECADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-HEAT.) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As New Yorkers endure one of the hottest summers
on record, they are also suffering a curse that compounds their
lethargy and sense of ill-being: the worst smog in more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Levels of ozone, a toxic chemical that burns the lungs, stings
the eyes and can dim vistas with a brown haze, are the highest
since the late 1980s, records kept by the state Department of
Environmental Conservation show, and as usual, the worst of it has
blanketed New York City and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The state has already exceeded the federal standard for ozone
pollution more times this year than it did in each of the last
seven years, and there are still two months to go in the
May-to-September smog season. Even upstate areas that are used to
relatively clean air have had a few days this year that were smoggy
enough to violate the federal clean-air standard.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone levels in New York State have generally declined over the
last two decades. The main culprit for this year's upward spike is
the oppressive heat. Ozone is created when other chemicals cook in
sunlight on hot days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a combination of things, starting with the
heat, but including power plants working harder to keep up with
record demand, and people doing more driving,'' said Peter M.
Iwanowicz, director of environmental health at the American Lung
Association of New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, ozone makes it hard to breathe, particularly for the
elderly, small children, people who are exerting themselves and
those with lung diseases. It burns the lungs much like sun burns
the skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years of exposure can do serious damage,'' Iwanowicz said.
``It impairs the ability to fight off infection, in kids
especially, and it can aggravate the trouble that heart and lung
patients already have breathing, which can be fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozone, commonly known as smog, can trigger asthma attacks, and
experts say it contributes to New York City having the highest
level of asthma in the country. A study released last week showed
that hospitalizations for asthma attacks in the city's low-income
neighborhoods were far more frequent than was previously known.
</P>
<P>
   The New York metropolitan area is one of several around the
country classified by the federal government as being in ``severe
nonattainment'' of ozone standards, the second-worst category. Only
Los Angeles and its near suburbs are in the worst category,
``extreme nonattainment.'' Those grouped with New York include the
Chicago, Houston, Milwaukee, Baltimore and Sacramento metropolitan
areas, and two areas on the outskirts of Los Angeles.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ozone is not the only form of air pollution _ the Environmental
Protection Agency monitors and sets standards for six lung
irritants _ but in many urban areas it is the most severe.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of atmospheric nitrogen oxides, the main
chemicals that contribute to ozone, come from electric power
plants. Environmentalists say this summer's ozone problem provides
more evidence that New York state and the federal government should
make old power plants meet the same emissions standards as new
ones. Coal-burning plants built in the 1940s and '50s emit 15 to 20
times as many nitrogen oxides as new gas-burning plants, while
generating the same amount of power.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration plans to achieve much of what
environmental groups are asking for on nitrogen oxides, requiring
that power producers reduce emissions of the chemicals by 10
percent this year over last. By 2003, they must have cut the
emissions by 70 percent over 1990 levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``No state is doing more,'' said John Cahill, the state's
Environmental Conservation Commissioner. ``We require more
stringent controls on those facilities than are used in any other
state.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed to a law the state enacted last year requiring
heavy trucks to go through the same periodic inspections that cars
are subject to, including meeting the standards for tailpipe
emissions. But as state officials are quick to note, many of New
York's air pollutants, including those that contribute to ozone and
acid rain, blow in from states to the west. No one knows quite how
many arrive that way, but Cahill said, ``New York state could shut
down every facility and still have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles, another major source of nitrogen oxides, have also
contributed to rising ozone levels, as people drive more each year
and more of them drive sport utility vehicles and trucks that are
not subject to the same emissions standards as cars.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA plans to close that loophole, which Cahill called ``a
very, very important, a critical component'' of cutting smog.
</P>
<P>
   The state measures ozone levels continuously at 31 sites around
the state. By last Sunday, those sites had recorded 25 violations
of the federal ozone standard, the most in any year since 1991,
when there were 26 for the entire year. Department of Environmental
Conservation officials said there might have been a few more
readings that exceeded the limit in the last week, but the data
were still being collected.
</P>
<P>
   Under a more stringent standard the EPA adopted last year that
is being challenged in court, there were 169 violations by last
Sunday, compared with 162 for all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials said that if the new standard had been in
place, there would have been 156 violations in 1997, and just 84 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone molecules are composed of three oxygen atoms, rather than
the two atoms oxygen molecules usually contain. Ozone is created
near ground level when the sun acts on nitrogen oxides emitted by
smokestacks and tailpipes, combined with various hydrocarbons.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the more severe the heat wave, the worse the ozone. But
it is an unstable chemical that breaks down easily, so it
dissipates quickly when the weather turns cool or when the
chemicals needed to create it are not present.
</P>
<P>
   Ground-level ozone is not to be confused with the ozone layer in
the upper atmosphere, which protects the earth from the sun's
ultraviolet radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Ground-level ozone confers no such benefit, and does not reach
the upper atmosphere before breaking down, while upper-level ozone
is too distant to harm people.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ This is how good a teacher New York Giants coach
Jim Fassel is: He has not only worked out the kinks in the throwing
arm of Kerry Collins, but he is also ironing out the creases in the
quarterback's head. When Collins was with the Carolina Panthers he
was known more for his drinking and his sloppy play than anything
else. Today his former teammates might not recognize him; Collins
looks like a completely different person.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel began working with Collins only days after he signed his
four-year, $16.9 million contract with the Giants, and it was not
difficult for a skilled eye like Fassel's to immediately notice
Collins' bad mechanics. During his drop back he raised his left
forearm near his eyes while cocking his throwing hand. Fassel has
erased the move from Collins' memory banks.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel corrected something else. Collins had a hitch in his
throwing motion because he started his passes holding the ball near
his hip. Fassel taught Collins to hold the ball higher, near
shoulder level, before he delivered the pass.
</P>
<P>
   The result of Fassel's work with Collins is impressive. In a
matter of months, Fassel has helped Collins erase years of bad
habits. Collins looks like a professional quarterback now, not a
beaten-down man. Kent Graham is still the better player, but
because of Fassel's work Collins has a fighting chance to succeed
again in the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, 49, is one of the top young coaches in the game right
now. He is creative, he is excellent with quarterbacks, and for the
most part he communicates well with his players.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this season Fassel has to do more than talk about how good
his team can become. He has to win, and not seven games or eight,
but at least nine or 10. Another mediocre season like last year's
8-8, and the organization-wide doubts come creeping in, like a bad
infection. If the Giants win 11, or even 10 games, it would be
proof that Fassel's plan is working. Either way, this is the most
important season of Fassel's career.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Fassel's growing process must include his winning over
two key people within the organization: his general manager, Ernie
Accorsi, and one of the best defensive players in the league,
Michael Strahan.
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi likes Fassel _ the two get along fine. But Accorsi is
not passionate about Fassel, who was hired by George Young, the
former general manager. If the Giants were to win five games this
season, rather than 10 or 11, Accorsi would probably give some
thought to hiring Marty Schottenheimer, the former Kansas City
coach who remains out of football. The two are close friends.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel and the Giants flirted with a contract extension in
January, but the talks never went beyond that. It was a sign that
each side is sizing up the other. Fassel is making sure this is the
place he wants to stay, and the Giants are watching Fassel to make
certain he is right for them.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel and Accorsi will be fine. There is less certainty
concerning the relationship between Fassel and Strahan. If Fassel
is going to capture the minds of all of his players, which he has
not yet done, he must forge a closer relationship with Strahan.
</P>
<P>
   Strahan, a defensive end, has developed one of the best work
ethics in the league. He is respected because of what he does on
the field and how he conducts himself in the locker room. Strahan
is the most popular player on the team now and the important player
the Giants have had since Lawrence Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   But so far Strahan is, at best, lukewarm in his feelings toward
Fassel. Right now the relationship is a precarious one, and
Fassel's mission for the rest of training camp should be to get
inside Strahan's head. Fassel need not worry about a bruised ego.
That is irrelevant. He simply needs to get Strahan completely on
his side.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel's qualities are many. He is loyal to his coaches and
gives them latitude without losing control. He is demanding of his
players. He is smart and has been able to work within the Giants'
rigid system without selling his soul or trying to embarrass the
organization into doing things his way, as Dan Reeves once did.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches hate to hear things like this, but the Giants should win
the National Conference East, which is at its lowest point in
years. Washington is a five-victory team, as is Philadelphia, and
Dallas is an aging, has-been franchise. No other team in the
division possesses the kind of battering defense that New York
does, and the Giants can win the East on the likes of Strahan,
linebacker Jessie Armstead and cornerback Jason Sehorn alone.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel is no longer a rookie head coach, and he is ready to
elevate his game. This is the year to do it and Fassel probably
will. Along the way, if he can make Accorsi and Strahan happy, all
the better.

 &HT;    Exclusive 3,000 club to get a trio of newcomers in the same
month
 &HT;    (With chart material at end.)
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the rarest convergence of time, place and educated wood,
baseball's most exclusive hitting society is about to be overrun.
</P>
<P>
   As the weekend opened, Tampa Bay's Wade Boggs needed eight hits,
San Diego's Tony Gwynn needed nine and Baltimore's Cal Ripken
needed 34 for all three to reach the 3,000-hit club, a collection
of the game's 20 most accurate and enduring swings. Hitting might
be all about patience, but this triumvirate nevertheless is getting
itchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the excitement level is overflowing,'' Boggs said
after going 3-for-4 Wednesday night. ``I'm enjoying the ride. ...
This is what you play your entire career for, to get to a spot
where something you do means something.''
</P>
<P>
   Four times before, two players have reached 3,000 hits in the
same season. Tris Speaker and Eddie Collins did it 21 days apart in
1925. Hank Aaron and Willie Mays got there 4 1/2 weeks apart in
1970. Carl Yastrzemski and Lou Brock arrived in 1979. Fresh Hall of
Fame playmates George Brett and Robin Yount hit No. 3,000 three
weeks apart in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But no season has seen three players reach in the same season.
The game once went 44 seasons, 1926-69, with just two hitters _
Paul Waner and Stan Musial _ getting there. Boggs and Gwynn,
depending on how their plate appearances might be juggled during
early August road trips, should reach within the same week, with
Ripken following by Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   They will bring to eight the number of players to reach 3,000 in
the 1990s. In the '80s, only one, Rod Carew, made it. No one did it
during the '60s. Why three players within one month? Credit
expansion. Credit expansion pitching. Credit the booming offense of
the 1990s. But foremost, credit the players' longevity and three
sweet swings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret of hitting,'' Musial once said, ``is physical
relaxation, mental concentration _ and don't hit the fly ball to
center.''
</P>
<P>
   Each man approaches the landmark by separate paths.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Boggs
</P>
<P>
   The question had become, would he ever get there? Mired in a
4-for-30 slump, Boggs asked his 12-year-old son Brett to select a
bat for him and then singled three times against Anaheim at
mid-week in the 220th three-hit game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   At 41, Boggs still knows his way around the strike zone as well
as anyone. Last season was the first in Boggs' 17 years in the
majors that he finished with more strikeouts than walks.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he found more significance in his first hit, which
came at old Comiskey Park on April 26, 1982, against Pat Dobson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I eventually got the hit and came back to the dugout and was
sitting next to Jerry Remy,'' Boggs said. ``And he said, `Hey, kid.
You only (have) 2,999 more to go.' That sort of stuck in the back
of my mind. Wow. That's coming from a seasoned veteran, to say
something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it was kind of a humorous remark, but it's sort of come
to fruition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays just left on six-game road trip, which could
interfere with Boggs hitting No. 3,000 at home. Boggs grew up in
Tampa and went to Plant High School, where he had 26 hits in his
last 32 at-bats as a senior. Reaching the milestone in his hometown
would be significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without saying it's going to happen at home, there's a hell of
a good chance it going to happen at home,'' Tampa Bay manager Larry
Rothschild said. ``And the reason I know that is because I fill out
the lineup card.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays next game at Tropicana Field is Friday, against
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn would have reached 3,000 in June, if not for the sore left
calf that twice forced him onto the disabled list and cost him 48
games.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he has been preparing for the moment, retiring his bats
after every hit by sending them to charities, friends, even one
each to his wife Alicia and to Padres owner John Moores. But he
stopped that practice once he reached 2,985.
</P>
<P>
   ``From here to 3,000, I'm keeping everything,'' said Gwynn, not
only holding on to bats but uniforms and other accoutrements.
``I've got a pretty good idea what I want to do with the stuff.
There's a lot of people along the way I want to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of his good work came courtesy of the Braves. He recorded
151 hits at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, second among all NL
parks only to Cincinnati's (165).
</P>
<P>
   Of the five pitchers he has pounded most frequently, four are,
or were, Braves: Greg Maddux (35, at the top of the hit list), Rick
Mahler (33, No. 2) and Tom Glavine and John Smoltz (tied for fourth
with 28 each). Gywnn's .452 career average (28 for 62) against
Smoltz is his highest against any pitcher, on a minimum of 50
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn will become the first National League player in 20 years
to reach 3,000, since Brock. He and Ripken will join a group of six
players to have recorded all 3,000 with one team -- Musial of St.
Louis, Pittsburgh's Roberto Clemente, Detroit's Al Kaline, Boston's
Yastrzemski, Milwaukee's Yount and Kansas City's Brett).
</P>
<P>
   But it is looking as if No. 3,000 will come not in San Diego but
in either St. Louis or Montreal this week: The Padres leave Monday
on a 11-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's 3,000 will be footnoted by his longevity, which is
hardly fair. His passle of records already broken, beyond the 2,632
consecutive-game streak, include home runs by a shortstop (345) and
12 fielding marks. But his 3,000th hit should come around his
2,810th game, fewer than either Kaline or Yastrzemski needed.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, Ripken is not overwhelmed as the date
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time you think about it is when you're asked,'' he
said. ``I can read the big board, and I can read a newspaper on
occasion. But that doesn't help you when you're at the plate. The
best thing you can do is try to have a successful at-bat. You try
to put a good swing on the ball. You can't control what happens
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken entered the weekend within reach of another milestone:
his 400th homer. Only 28 players have reached 400, and only six of
them also reached 3,000 hits -- Aaron, Mays, Eddie Murray, Musial,
Dave Winfield and Yaz. And while Ripken's average (.277) will be
the lowest among those players to reach 3,000-400, he will be the
only man to do so having spent his primary playing time as a middle
infielder.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of Ripken's hits (1,009) have gone for extra
bases, far surpassing both Boggs (752) and Gwynn (717).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm someone who doesn't like to sit down and dwell on how well
you're doing and someone who doesn't like to sit down and dwell on
how poor you're doing,'' Ripken said. ``I just want to go work it
out, then ride it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as all three have.

 &HT;    Coaches taking steps to avoid the agent trap
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last August, a somber Al Wilson stood up at a meeting of the
Tennesee football team. As the All-America senior linebacker spoke,
his voice began to quaver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' Wilson said, almost in tears. ``I've let you
down. I got caught having contact with an agent. I'm ineligible
this year, and I'm not going to be able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   After the stunned players sat in silence for several moments,
head coach Phillip Fulmer told them that, because of Wilson's
mistake, they would have to return their SEC championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at (cornerback) Dwayne Goodrich, and I thought he was
getting ready to bawl,'' Fulmer recalled. ``It was incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Wilson started laughing. The scenario had been staged.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the point was made,'' Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The point was to show the team what could happen if any player
violated NCAA rules by accepting money or other benefits from an
agent before his eligibility expired. The exercise is an example of
how coaches are becoming more aggressive in discussing with their
players an issue that has risen to the top of their list of
greatest fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a call about agents has become one of our worst
nightmares,'' LSU coach Gerry DiNardo said. ``And the scary thing
is knowing that there is only so much you can do. If a player
really wants to take the money, he's going to do it. You can't stop
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest episode to make that point abunduntly clear involves
four players from the University of Florida. The four _ Jevon
Kearse, Johnny Rutledge, Reggie McGrew and Mike Peterson _ are
accused of accepting money from agent Tank Black before their
college eligibility ended. Rutledge has admitted accepting $500
monthly payments from Black, while Kearse and McGrew also have
accepted money, although they did not reveal an amount.
</P>
<P>
   The university is investigating Black under a state law that
prohibits agents from giving cash or other benefits to a college
athlete before his eligibility ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known a lot of guys, in my five years, from across the
nation who have gotten away with a lot, and nobody knows about
it,'' Georgia Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton said. ``There are guys
not even in the NFL now, and they're not playing football. But
nobody knows how they got away with $500,000 or a nice car. We try
not to do that at Tech, but it's hard. It's out there for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has three components _ the coaches, agents and
players.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches, who fear losing games and championships, preach
that a player should not put his wants above those of the team by
accepting favors from an agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very up front with our guys about this,'' Fulmer said.
``After the season, if they want to deal with an agent, fine. But
before that, if you're selfish enough to hurt this whole football
team, I don't want you, and I don't need you. If that's still what
you want, I'll lead the parade out of town so you can go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a bottom-line deal with me,'' said Florida coach
Steve Spurrier, who has banned from the school's football complex
his four former players in question. ``We have rules, and if you
break them, there are consequences. If you break the rules, you
can't be a Gator.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of agents play by the rules, but the competition to
sign the top athletes is cutthroat because the rewards can be
great. To gain an advantage, some agents often use other students
as runners to get money or other benefits to players, to entice the
players to sign with them.
</P>
<P>
   Not every agent can afford to play by the rules, Black's
attorney, Leonard Mungo, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic issue is you have kids who are being exploited by
the schools,'' Mungo told the Associated Press. ``These players
know what they are worth, and they know the school is taking
advantage. Then you have 900 agents out there looking to sign the
240 players who get drafted.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Warrick, a senior wide receiver at Florida State, should
be one of the top players chosen in next year's NFL Draft. Warrick
said he has changed his phone number three times over the past six
months in an effort to get away from agents and their runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my last year, and I don't want to do anything to
jeopardize my career or my team,'' Warrick said. ``But it's kind of
hard, if somebody offers you something, not to take it. You've got
to be a real man. I know the athletes bring a lot to the table, and
we don't get anything. But that's why you play in college _ to work
yourself up to the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State has plenty of reasons to be concerned about
agents. The school's rules-compliance officials estimate that 20
players on the current team could be drafted. One of them, senior
wide receiver Laveranues Coles, is the subject of a school inquiry
to determine if he attended a party hosted by an agent in Texas.
Several years ago, the school was mired in scandal when an agent's
runner took several players on a shopping spree at a local
sporting-goods store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agents and gambling are the biggest problems that face college
football right now,'' said Dave Hart, Florida State's athletics
director.
</P>
<P>
   Some players, however, say it is not fair to judge those who
take money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the burden should be on the agent, but I can't blame a
guy who takes the money,'' said Cornelius Griffin, a defensive
tackle from Alabama. ``If you're poor and you've never had
anything, how can you tell a guy not to take it? You don't know his
situation or what kind of shape his mama and daddy are in.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's Hamilton said he has his roommates screen
telephone calls, but it's not unusual for a runner to show up at
his dormitory with a pizza in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to find out what you like to do in your free time,
like play video games and stuff,'' Hamilton said. ``That's how they
try to get close to you and act like your friend. But sooner or
later, they are going to want to talk business.''
</P>
<P>
   And when a player starts talking business, that's when an
episode like the one Al Wilson fabricated last summer could become
real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, it comes down to the guys and what they think is
important,'' Fulmer said. ``You try to educate them as much as you
can, and I think we've done that. I trust my guys, but I can't
afford to stick my head in the sand. Every damn one of them could
be sitting with an agent right now.''

 &HT;    Deals slowed by voidable years
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Entering this weekend, only 18 of the 31 first-round picks in
April's NFL draft had signed.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the first 12 choices had not yet reached agreement,
including quarterbacks Akili Smith of Cincinnati and Cade McNown of
Chicago. McNown is expected to start this season; Smith probably
would back up Jeff Blake.
</P>
<P>
   The hangup in negotiations is the teams' reluctance to include
``voidable years'' in the contracts. Voidable years allow a player
to buy back the contract after three or four years. By doing so,
the players would receive a second signing bonus from their current
teams or raise their market price when they become restricted free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   The voidable years concept was introduced by agents Leigh
Steinberg, representing Kerry Collins and Ryan Leaf, and Tom
Condon, for Peyton Manning and Tim Couch.
</P>
<P>
   Couch, the No. 1 pick from Kentucky, signed a seven-year, $48
million contract with Cleveland before this year's draft that
included voidable years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the other top picks, as well as such lower choices as
defensive back Fernando Bryant of Alabama, taken 26th by
Jacksonville, are demanding similar deals.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb's negotiations with the Eagles got nasty before he agreed
Friday to a seven-year, $50 million deal. His agent, Greg Smith,
told a Philadelphia cable TV station this week that the Eagles were
reluctant to include voidable years because his client is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why pull the plug now when, for the past couple of years,
you've been consistently doing it for the white quarterbacks?''
Smith asked.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Smith backtracked and said he does not think race is a
factor, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to drafting Donovan, voidable years was an issue they
did not care to deal with,'' he said. ``I just think that they
truly feel it's not in the best interests of the player.''
</P>
<P>
   Rough start for Ricky
</P>
<P>
   Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams got off to a tough start at
New Orleans' training camp. In his first practice in full pads,
Williams fumbled a handoff, bumped into the fullback and dropped
the ball, and dropped a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not used to going full speed right away,'' he said. ``In
college, you'd have a couple of days in which to gauge the tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams told the media this week he would be available for
interviews only every other day.
</P>
<P>
   Local guys
</P>
<P>
   Danny Kight, 26, of Decatur, is bidding to become the first
African-American kicker in NFL history. Cut by four teams in as
many years, Kight, a former soccer player at Augusta State, is
battling former Texas kicker Phil Dawson in the Cleveland Browns'
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Kight, who came close to making rosters in Dallas and, more
recently, Tampa Bay, spent last year playing for the NFL Europe's
Rhein Fire.
</P>
<P>
   Both players struggled in camp this week, but Kight might have
gotten a break when Dawson, who spent last year on New England's
practice squad, sprained his ankle in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kicking situation is not settled. It's up in the air,''
Browns coach Chris Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   A breath of fresh air
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Angoy, a Spanish kicker, ended his three-day career with
the Broncos to return to his home in Barcelona for his son's fifth
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   With Jason Elam handling the kicking in Denver, Angoy knew his
chances of making the team were slim. Angoy also said he felt bad
that the Broncos were going to spend money to fly him to Australia
on Sunday to play in the American Bowl next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed like a nice guy,'' coach Mike Shanahan said. ``I'm
just not sure if he was really into American football.''
</P>
<P>
   Angoy is widely known in Spain as the longtime goalkeeper of
F.C. Barcelona, a first-division soccer team. He retired in 1996
and has been playing football for the NFL Europe's Barcelona
Dragons.
</P>
<P>
   Two-minute drill
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' offensive line already has taken some hits. Reserve
guard Tony Hutson suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament in
his right knee and is expected to miss two to four weeks. Hutson
was supposed to replace right guard Everett McIver, who's
recovering from a torn anterior cruciate ligament that cut short
his 1998 season. McIver is not expected back until late August. ...
Arizona wideout Rob Moore and defensive tackle Mark Smith are
holdouts at the Cardinals' camp in Flagstaff, Ariz. Moore, miffed
at being declared the team's franchise player, wants a long-term
contract. Smith reportedly is demanding $1.2 million to $1.3
million for the coming season; the Cardinals have offered about
one-third that amount. The Cards also are without defensive tackle
Eric Swann, who failed a physical and won't practice for several
weeks because of knee surgery. ... Unless Pro Bowl cornerback Ty
Law agrees to have his contract restructured, wideout Shawn
Jefferson could be cut by the Patriots, who don't have the cap room
to sign first-round choices Damien Woody and Andy Katzenmoyer. ...
San Francisco is taking a closer look at the right leg of
first-round pick Reggie McGrew of Florida, who is coming off knee
surgery. McGrew had an MRI this week after experiencing pain in his
right quadriceps. ... One-sixth of the 49ers' salary cap is devoted
to paying wideouts Terrell Owens, Jerry Rice and J.J. Stokes. ...
Former running back Roger Craig is attending the 49ers' camp two or
three days a week to keep am eye on newly acquired back Lawrence
Phillips, the troubled former star at Nebraska. Craig has no formal
arrangement with the team. ... When Denver and San Diego meet in
next week's preseason opener in Australia, both teams will have
native punters. Jon Ballantyne, an Australian, has agreed to sign
with the Broncos and join the team when it arrives in Sydney on
Tuesday. Darren Bennett, of Sydney, is in his fifth season with the
Chargers. ... Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe missed practice this
week after learning that his 23-year-old nephew, Dedrick Sharpe,
had died in Glennville. Sharpe said his nephew had been born
prematurely and required 24-hour care. ... Shanahan ripped starting
weak-side linebacker John Mobley after he pulled a hamstring in the
first practice. Shanahan wasn't happy with Mobley's offseason
conditioning. ... Jacksonville linebacker Bryce Paup will miss at
least the first two preseason games with a torn right pectoral
muscle. ... The Dolphins are considering signing safety Willie
Clay, the former Georgia Tech star released by New England this
week because of salary-cap problems. ... Rookie free agent Robert
Baker, the former Auburn star who spent time in an Alabama prison
on a cocaine-trafficking conviction, could have a tough time making
the Dolphins as a receiver, but coach Jimmy Johnson might keep him
as a special-teams player. ... Tampa Bay tailback Warrick Dunn has
tendinitis in his right knee and will be slowed in training camp.

 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In this season of heat and drought, with New York
sweltering through the hottest July on record, the Middle Atlantic
states turning brown and scores of people dying across the country,
the question arises once again:
</P>
<P>
   Is something new and different going on with the weather?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, experts say, the heat wave and drought of 1999 do not
yet rival some of the great bake-offs of the past, most recently
that of 1988, which seared most of the country for weeks and nearly
dried up the Mississippi River. That one made global warming a
byword, even though it was brought about by a case of natural
atmospheric gridlock that held the heat and dryness in place.
</P>
<P>
   A similarly intractable natural pattern has locked into place
this time, and although it has not yet reproduced the vast scale
and long duration of 1988's heat and drought, it has nonetheless
made a mark on climatic history. In parts of the mid-Atlantic
region, the drought is of a severity occurring only about twice in
a hundred years, on average.
</P>
<P>
   And in July, there have been 11 days when the temperature
reached 95 degrees or more in New York's Central Park. Never has it
been so hot so often in any one month since records were first kept
in 1869, and the city is closing in on the record of 16 95-degree
days for an entire summer, set in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's incredible,'' said Lee Grenci, a meteorologist at
Pennsylvania State University.
</P>
<P>
   High temperatures like those in New York and elsewhere this
summer appear to extend what federal scientists say is a national
trend toward more extreme summer temperatures since World War II.
That trend, in turn, accompanies a warming of the American climate
that in some places, including the nation's northern tier and parts
of the Middle Atlantic region and the Northeast, has amounted to 2
to 5 degrees over the last century, on an annual average, according
to scientists at the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally and globally, the warming trend is smaller, as some
areas of both the country and the rest of the world have cooled.
The average annual surface temperature of the earth has risen by
about 1 degree Fahrenheit or a little more in the 20th century, and
that of the contiguous 48 states by a little less, according to the
climatic data center.
</P>
<P>
   The warming is greater at night and in the winter. By
comparison, the earth is 5 to 9 degrees warmer now than in the
depths of the last ice age some 18,000 to 20,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream scientists project that the average surface
temperature of the globe will rise 2 to 6 more degrees in the 21st
century if emissions of heat-trapping waste of industrial gases
like carbon dioxide are not reduced. If that happens, the
scientists say, summer heat waves will probably become more
frequent, with nights becoming especially hot and naturally
occurring droughts becoming worse.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, few if any experts go so far as to attribute any
individual heat waves like the recent one _ or even the observed
trend toward more extreme summer heat _ directly to global warming.
The most they say is that the heat records are in line with what is
to be expected in a warming atmosphere. Much clearer, they say, are
the immediate meteorological causes of the 1999 heat and drought.
</P>
<P>
   Though heat and drought often go together, they are in some
sense separate phenomena. Large-scale patterns of atmospheric
circulation determine where it rains and does not, and these are
what have decreed crop destruction and brown lawns from northern
Virginia through eastern Pennsylvania. The drought began a year ago
and intensified over the winter, thanks to a circulation pattern
associated with La Nina, a natural occurrence of abnormally cool
water in the tropical Pacific that sets off a characteristic
pattern of atmospheric chain reactions.
</P>
<P>
   One consequence of La Nina was that winter storm tracks in North
America shifted westward, making the Middle Atlantic region already
relatively dry before summer arrived. When it did, the jet stream,
the high-altitude, west-to-east river of air that carries storms
and precipitation across the landscape, moved unusually far to the
north, said Mark Svoboda, a research climatologist at the National
Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln.
Its path missed most of the country, further depriving it of
moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a semipermanent atmospheric feature over the Atlantic
Ocean, called the Bermuda High, has settled in this summer in such
a position that it has directed unusually hot tropical air into the
Middle Atlantic states and the Northeast, said Fred Gadomski,
another Penn State meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of drought and heat in the region has made both
worse. Heat intensifies drought by increasing evaporation from the
soil. Where there is no water left, the heat that would be spent in
evaporation instead goes into warming the surface. Completing a
destructive feedback loop, the warmer surface heats the air even
more.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Until about mid-July, most of the superheat was confined to the
Northeast and Middle Atlantic states. But then the Bermuda High
expanded greatly, moving well into the country's midsection and
even the north-central United States. Yet another high-pressure
area, in the Pacific, created what Grenci called an immovable
``phalanx'' of linked weather systems. The result was to pump
tropical air into the Northeast, Midwest and upper Plains, sending
temperatures into triple digits in city after city and causing more
than 90 deaths in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1988, a similar continent-sized mass of hot
air, also coupled with a jet stream displaced unusually far to the
north, cast the eastern two-thirds of the nation into drought and
extreme heat. Then, 35 percent of the country was in extreme
drought, said Svoboda, compared with around 15 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the present drought ``pales in comparison to the
great droughts'' of the past, said Gadomski. But Svoboda said the
Middle Atlantic drought is now rivaling a major drought experienced
by the region in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   A notable aspect of the current heat wave, said Gadomski, is
that nights have been especially warm, giving little relief from
the heat for people without air-conditioning. The frequency of
nights in which extreme heat combines with high humidity appears to
have increased substantially since the 1940s, according to a 1998
study by Dian J. Gaffen and Rebecca J. Ross, research
meteorologists for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's Air Resources Laboratory in Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   This combination of extreme nighttime heat and humidity is a
heat wave's most serious threat to health and life, many experts
say, and the Gaffen-Ross study found that in some places, the
frequency with which this combination exceeded a lethal threshold
had doubled.
</P>
<P>
   What caused the increasing trend toward extreme heat? Some of it
may be accounted for by increasing urbanization, said Gaffen;
concrete absorbs more heat than foliage. But global warming may
also be part of the explanation, she said, adding that while the
trend cannot be attributed directly to that cause, it is consistent
with what scientists expect in a warming atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service has forecast a return to normal
temperatures this week for much of the country, including New York
City and the Northeast, as the gridlock in the skies, at least
temporarily, eases enough to allow the jet stream and a trailing
cold front to dip well down into the country.
</P>
<P>
   One red flag for the future: La Nina is now expected to persist
through next winter, and could throw much of the country into a
moisture deficit once more.
</P>
<P>
   What would kill the present drought is one of two eventualities:
the inevitable readvance southward of the moisture-bearing jet
stream as fall approaches, or tropical storms that drench the East
Coast. The latter could come at a high price: Tropical storms can
become hurricanes, and the 1999 hurricane season, which will enter
its peak period in two weeks or so, is expected to be an active
one.

MITCHELL WALKS OUT ON JETS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ At 6 a.m. Saturday morning, while his Jets
teammates were trying to wring the last ounce of needed sleep in
their dormitory rooms, Johnny Mitchell packed his gear, toted it to
the locker room and piled it there. Then he walked out of the
team's life for the second time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   This time there will apparently be no return for Mitchell, who
was the Jets' top draft choice in 1992 and had been out of football
for two seasons. One day of training camp may have convinced him
this was no longer what he was meant to do.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell was a multitalented tight end. But his career has taken
a series of bizarre twists and turns since that day in 1995 when,
despondent over a 3-13 club, he opted for free agency. He
eventually quit in 1996 and wound up living in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's unexpected departure Saturday seemed to surprise the
unflappable Bill Parcells, who began his news conference by saying:
``We've got a roster move. Guess?''
</P>
<P>
   When no one guessed, he then asked, ``Who would be
unpredictable?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there was a second roster move, too. Erik Norgard, a
backup center acquired as a free agent from Tennessee, also quit.
Norgard was considered insurance if Parcells had been unable to
find a starter at guard among the pool of untested prospects now in
camp.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Brooklyn rapper known as O.D.B. was arrested
Saturday after police stopped him for running a red light and found
what they believed to be crack cocaine and a bag of marijuana in
his 1994 Mercedes-Benz convertible, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper, whose real name is Russell P. Jones, 30, was stopped
in Queens and could not produce a driver's license, registration or
other proof of ownership of the car, said Sgt. Brian Burke, a
police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said the officers arrested Jones for driving without a
license, and during a search of his vehicle found what they
believed to be a bag of marijuana and 20 bags of crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was charged with criminal possession of a controlled
substance and driving on a suspended license. Jones is a member of
the Wu-Tang Clan, the Staten Island rap group that he helped start
seven years ago.

SWEATY JULY IN NEW YORK CITY GOES DOWN AS THE HOTTEST EVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-SMOG, HEAT-DROUGHT-TREND) 
(js) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ July was the hottest month ever recorded in New York
City, meteorologists said Saturday. And barring a late-night storm,
it was also the driest.
</P>
<P>
   Never since 1869, when observers began logging the city's daily
temperature and rainfall, have such heat and drought plagued city
residents, said Todd Miner, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Through Friday, July's average daily temperature, including
nights, was 81.4 degrees, half a degree hotter than July 1955 and
almost five degrees above normal, said Fred Gadomski, another Penn
State meteorologist. Saturday's high was expected to be in the
mid-90s, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Through Friday, only 0.44 inches of rain had fallen on New York
City, breaking another record going back to 1869, Miner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thousand, five hundred and sixty months have transpired
since records have been kept, and this was the warmest of them
all,'' Miner said. ``But it's useful to keep things in perspective.
A single statistic can be misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Though New York broke many records, maybe even the record for
breaking the most weather records, the heat did not reach historic
levels in other cities nearby, like Newark, N.J., or Bridgeport,
Conn. Newark's average daily temperature through Friday, for
instance, was 81.1 degrees, compared with a record 82.6 degrees in
1983; Bridgeport's July average of 77.5 degrees was also below its
record of 78.4 degrees, set in 1994, Miner said.
</P>
<P>
   But in New York City, July broke the record for the most days of
95-degree heat, with 11 through Saturday. The previous record was
10 in August 1944, Gadomski said.
</P>
<P>
   Five days last month broke or tied single-day heat records: July
5 and 6, which both hit 101 degrees; July 24 and 25, each at 97
degrees, and July 28, which tied the same date in 1949 with a high
of 97, Miner said.
</P>
<P>
   All this has taken a toll on residents, who went to hospital
emergency rooms and beaches in numbers far greater than normal for
July.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Nelson, an attending physician in emergency medicine
at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, said that in the last week
alone he treated dozens of people struck down by the heat,
including one woman who arrived with a 108-degree temperature and
required emergency treatment to prevent irreversible brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   And about 6.5 million people have visited city beaches so far
this summer, a 25 percent increase over last year, said a City
Parks Department spokesman, Robert Lawson. ``I think you can thank
the weather for that,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Relief won't arrive until Monday, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   The front edge of a cold front, seeded with scattered
thunderstorms, will roll into the region Sunday afternoon, Gadomski
said, but temperatures in the mid-90s were expected to persist.
Sunday night will be a little cooler than other recent nights, he
added. Temperatures should fall to the mid-80s by midday Monday and
reach the low 70s by Sunday night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By Monday day this heat wave will be over,'' Gadomski said
Saturday.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Last year, LeShon Johnson spent the end of July
in a hospital bed awaiting the third of seven chemotherapy
treatments. He had lost 20 pounds in 10 days and all the hair on
his head.
</P>
<P>
   His left arm had swollen to twice its usual size, the result of
an infection that developed where the tube bearing his chemotherapy
had been inserted.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier, he had awoken in the middle of the night at
home delirious with a fever. His wife, Nalani, rushed him to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The infection was right where they would pump that poison in
me,'' said Johnson, a Giants running back who was diagnosed with
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in May 1998. ``I don't wish that pain on
anyone. I never realized how much pain a man can stand. And that
was just for the infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Nalani Johnson, who married LeShon eight days before a routine
X-ray had discovered the cancerous tumor in her husband's chest,
was shaken by how fast LeShon had deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was lying in that bed almost like a child,'' Nalani said
Friday. ``I couldn't believe how fast things had gone downhill. It
made me really nervous. I remembered what my mom had said to me,
trying to prepare me for the worst: `People die of this disease,
Nalani.'''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, LeShon and Nalani Johnson recount the story of
that heart-wrenching summer with easy smiles, even laughter. They
talk as if describing something that happened years ago, and they
talk of how quickly their story has changed.
</P>
<P>
   This July, LeShon is at the Giants' training camp, running with
an unbridled enthusiasm that is evident to all. Because of an
injury to Giants running back Gary Brown, Johnson is currently the
team's No. 1 running back, the player featured on dozens of plays
as the Giants go through their two-a-day workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him at camp and I feel like bawling,'' Nalani said.
``I'm so proud of him. He never whined or cried or complained. And
look at him now.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson, 28, has never played a down for the Giants _
he signed as a free agent early last year and missed all of the
1998 season because of the cancer _ he has become one of the team's
most popular players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a guy who always has a smile on his face,''
quarterback Kent Graham said. ``We all saw what happened to him.
And we all saw how he reacted. He fought it and then he worked
tremendously hard to get back in shape. That inspires guys. How can
you not root for someone like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Cleared to play in the spring, Johnson said his doctors have
told him he is cancer-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day they told me that, now that was a good day,'' said
Johnson, who had surgery to remove the tumor. ``I never doubted I
would get better. I believed that this was something I could
handle, but I know I'm blessed to be here. It's like they say, you
appreciate everything so much more. Having to work out in the hot
sun is nothing compared to what I went through.''
</P>
<P>
   He now weighs 212 pounds, which is a few pounds more than he
weighed in his four previous NFL seasons with Green Bay and
Arizona. Getting his weight up was the final hurdle in his
recovery. A year ago, he was down to 180 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, I had the hardest time getting the weight on and
keeping it on,'' Johnson said. ``I was drinking milk shakes and
weight-gaining supplements. But it just didn't stick to my bones. I
think my body was still recovering, and later, as my strength came
back, so did the weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Noted for an explosive, fearless running style, Johnson doesn't
appear to have lost any of his quickness. The Giants signed him
because they believe he can add a dimension they've lacked for
several seasons: breakaway speed in the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be an every-down back, though Johnson has done that
briefly in his career, but he could rattle defenses, giving them
another threat to worry about, and he will probably return
kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``LeShon is a rodeo cowboy and he plays football with the same
all-or-nothing style,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said, aware of
Johnson's background as a bull rider in the junior rodeo circuit.
``He hits that hole at 150 miles an hour and that suddenness can
lead to long runs. I remember one game when he had back-to-back,
breakaway touchdowns runs.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when Fassel was the offensive coordinator of the
Arizona Cardinals, Johnson followed a 56-yard touchdown run with a
70-yard touchdown run in a rout of New Orleans. Johnson finished
with 214 rushing yards on 21 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not changing my style, not now,'' Johnson said. ``How many
chances do you get?''
</P>
<P>
   Nalani Johnson enjoys hearing that kind of talk from her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been asking me, `Aren't you afraid that he's going
back to football?''' she said. ``I tell them if it wasn't football
he'd just be jumping on some bull. I see it as an accomplishment.
And it's thrilling to see him back out there.''

FROSTY AIR CREEPS INTO CAMARADERIE IN LOTTERY DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The workers at the Pratt Car Service in Brooklyn were
singing a sad ballad about money and obsession on Thursday night.
Accompanying them on guitar was a fellow worker, Emilio Leyva, the
man they blame for a sudden rise _ and a disastrous fall _ in their
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   The workers, many of them immigrants from South and Central
America who came to New York with dreams of streets paved with
gold, say that Leyva is trying to make off with their $25 million
lottery jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers say they pooled their money for tickets and that
after the May 26 drawing Leyva announced that they had won. They
all celebrated together at the car service, and individually they
made plans: for trips back to their home countries, new houses and
businesses, and college educations for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Then, they say, Leyva vanished. Several days later he returned,
telling them he had only been kidding about the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Leyva vanished once more, this time for several weeks. He came
back with a videotape of his vacation in Florida, but the drivers
say the tape also showed Leyva making a champagne toast about all
the millions he would soon have.
</P>
<P>
   When a lawyer representing someone else, a retired longshoreman
named Eugenio Bertolo, presented the winning ticket for the May 26
drawing to lottery officials, the drivers decided that it was a
fraud: They claim that Bertolo is a fictional character standing in
for Leyva, or is perhaps a friend of his who turned in the ticket
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Six drivers and the owner of the car service have filed a
lawsuit seeking to claim the prize. The state is withholding
payment until the dispute is resolved. A hearing is scheduled for
Sept. 16 in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Bertolo, John Hayes, says the drivers' suit rests
on inadmissible hearsay about events and words that can never be
proved and that his client, who is not Leyva or anyone who knows
Leyva, should get the money.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the drivers, Arnold Koenig, says that Leyva
showed off the winning ticket before he vanished, and points out
that the mysterious Bertolo has not been seen.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has made for odd times at the Pratt Car Service,
where Leyva has returned to work despite the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   While the drivers will sometimes share a beer with Leyva,
shouting often breaks out when he passes his fellow workers, and
sometimes it leads to shoving as he makes his way into the
recreation room behind the dispatcher's office.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the car service who did not join the lottery pool say
they doubt the dispute will ever be settled. They have grown tired
of listening as their friends rehash what they will do once they
become wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   It has all gone too far, and important friendships have been
broken, said Susonte Aracao, 64.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson is that when money is in the middle, there are no
friends,'' Aracao said. ``That's why I always play the Lotto
alone.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For his part, Leyva refuses to talk about the videotape or the
claim that he also tried to make side deals to split the money with
one or two workers at the car service, though he did offer to sell
the videotape to a reporter for $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he was not going to spend any money on a lawyer to
fight his co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a lawyer, but I don't,'' he said, before leveling
his eyes at an employee with whom he had brawled earlier in the
afternoon. ``God is my lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulling a pillow from the trunk of his livery car on Thursday
night, Leyva said the dispute had left him poorer than before. With
work slowing at the car service, he cannot afford an apartment and,
suddenly, he has no friends to offer up a bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I sleep,'' he said in disgust, pointing to the
back of his aging Lincoln Town Car. ``I wish I'd never even played
the Lotto; it was nothing but trouble.''

UMPIRES TOLD NOT TO HARASS COLLEAGUES
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BBO-UMPIRES) 
(nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As the split between two factions of umpires grows more
heated, the league presidents have warned umpires not to threaten
or harass their colleagues. If they do, the presidents said, they
will face immediate discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The division in the Major League Umpires Association is also
growing uglier and more personal. The wife of John Hirschbeck, an
American League umpire who is one of the leaders of the dissident
faction, received a letter Saturday bearing the signature of the
wife of another umpire, in which her husband was accused of being a
traitor who has undermined ``20 years of work from an association
that reaped him so many benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   In the memo the umpires received Friday, National League
President Leonard Coleman and American League President Gene Budig
said they had received reports suggesting that umpires might have
been involved in ``illegal threats, intimidation or harassment'' of
other umpires who may have different views of the issues raised by
the union's ``illegal mass resignation plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not tolerate any threats, intimidation or harassment
against any umpire,'' the presidents wrote. ``Anyone who is found
to have engaged in such conduct will be disciplined immediately.
Every umpire is entitled to have his own view on these issues, but
we will not allow any umpire to be threatened, intimidated or
harassed because of his point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   League officials may look into the letter to Denise Hirschbeck
from Marcia Montague, wife of Ed Montague, a National League umpire
for 24 years. The letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New
York Times, indicated that copies went to the wives of umpires in
both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say my wife got harassed today,'' Hirschbeck said from
his home in Ohio. ``We'll see what Kevin Hallinan has to say about
it.'' Hallinan is baseball's security chief.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Montague wrote: ``Where did John go wrong, he shamed us
all.'' Accusing Hirschbeck of having a vendetta against Richie
Phillips, head of the umpires union, Marcia Montague said
Hirschbeck ``didn't have enough nerve'' to attend the umpires' July
14 meeting, where the umpires embarked on their strategy of mass
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead,'' she wrote, ``like a traitor and a coward he kept
quiet 'til the vote was done, then went behind people's backs to
gather support.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' the letter went on, ``because it would have
been a good fight against what's wrong in baseball. Maybe we all
could have made a difference in the fight to restore real
leadership to the game. I would have liked to see us take on MLB,
the commissioner and the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Hirschbeck of being a ``Judas in our midst,'' Marcia
Montague continued, ``we will be looking John in the face, every
time he walks on the field, and you never know, someday we may
knock on your door _ just to ask `why?'''
</P>
<P>
   The two-page letter was accompanied by a cartoon that depicted
an umpire about to be stabbed in the back by two evil-looking
figures depicted as Hirschbeck and Commissioner Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck was one of 14 umpires who voted against Phillips last
February when the lawyer received a five-year contract extension.
He also was one of the umpires who did not resign and urged umpires
who did to rescind their resignations. Some did, and 22 umpires who
did not have lost their jobs, effective Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think there's a definite need for new union
leadership,'' Hirschbeck said in a telephone interview. ``The
present leadership has led us down a path that is going nowhere. I
think new leadership is needed to work with baseball. They've given
us every indication that they want to work with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between the union and leagues expires Dec. 31. The
mass resignation was aimed at inducing Major League Baseball to
begin negotiations for a new agreement. The union plans to file
unfair labor practice charges against baseball with the National
Labor Relations Board next week.

POLICE WELCOME PLAN TO RESTORE PLAIN CLOTHES FOR SOME OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A tentative plan to put some Street Crime Unit
officers back in plain clothes is being greeted by many New York
City police officers as an important first step in restoring the
unit's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   But they added that the unit's real problem was sagging morale
and fear of controversy, which has grown worse since the shooting
of Amadou Diallo by four officers in February and the large
demonstrations that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir disclosed the plan on Friday,
saying that statistics had shown that productivity in the unit had
dropped precipitously in the four months since he ordered its
officers to wear uniforms. He said he was asking his staff to
consider a plan under which officers whose tasks require stealth
might dress in street clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Scotto, the president of the Detectives' Endowment
Association, a union that represents many Street Crime Unit
officers, said the uniforms had made the officers more recognizable
while conducting investigations. But he added that the Police
Department still needed to deal with the disapproval the officers
have felt since the fatal shooting of Diallo, an unarmed immigrant,
in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   That shooting led Safir to order in March that all of the unit's
307 officers wear uniforms to minimize confusion in such
potentially lethal confrontations. All four of the officers who
shot Diallo were dressed in street clothes, although their lawyers
have said they identified themselves before the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   Arrests for illegal gun possession by the unit are down 45
percent this year, according to police statistics. They have
dropped as shootings and homicides are beginning to climb from
30-year-lows in some precincts. Police officials have theorized
that the decline in gun seizures may partly be the reason for the
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Under Safir's plan, two officers in each six-member team would
wear street clothes. After plainclothes officers had finished their
surveillance, the uniformed officers would make arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover officers who deal with narcotics, street crime and
vice said that working in uniform could be a liability. They said
they sometimes follow a suspect for several blocks before he does
anything that might lead to a search. Since the change in policy,
Street Crime Unit officers said they had been forced to do much of
their surveillance from the front seat of their unmarked cars,
unable to blend in on the street because of their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm out on the street and I see a guy acting suspiciously,
who maybe has a bulge in his waistband that could be a gun or is
looking in car windows, I want to be able to get out of my car and
follow him for a while,'' said one officer. ``But when you're in
uniform you can't jump out, and if you are tailing him in an
unmarked car, they will see you.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers said that the problems within the Street Crime Unit
go far beyond the dispute over uniforms. After the Diallo shooting,
the Police Department transferred many of the unit's veteran
officers into other jobs and filled their vacancies with less
experienced officers in an attempt to broaden the racial makeup of
the force.
</P>
<P>
   The officers also said that since Safir announced that members
of the unit were being promoted to detective-specialists and given
a raise, the unit has gone from one that attracted aggressive
officers to one seen as more of a tenure track, where officers
would get a detective's shield.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These changes, some officers said, could create a unit that
would not be as aggressive in getting guns off the street, even if
the officers were returned to plain clothes and felt that the
department was behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Street crimes used to attract a certain type of officer,
someone who liked to be on the street and make arrests and didn't
care if he ever got promoted out,'' said another veteran of the
department. ``It was like the Marine Corps attracted Marines. But
the magnet is no longer there, and people are joining just for the
promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Eric Adams, the co-founder of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement
Who Care, said that a less aggressive Street Crime Unit was what
New Yorkers wanted. And if the high rate of gun seizures was the
result of illegal searches and the harassment of young minority
youths on the street, he said, the department should accept a
decline in seizures.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Safir not to give in to the unit's demands to be put
back in plain clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can stop 100 people for no reason and come up with one
or two guns per one hundred,'' he said. ``But they have to play by
the rule book that everyone in law enforcement has to play by and
that is the Constitution. If that means they are no longer the
shining star in the police force, so be it. New Yorkers don't want
them turned loose again.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Johnnie Footman turns 80 on Sunday, he won't be
celebrating at home with his friends and family. He'll be right
where he has been most of his life: behind the wheel of a yellow
cab somewhere in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Footman has swerved in and out of the unruly traffic for 53
years, delivering beleaguered tourists to the airport, rushing
harried commuters to work, honking at careless drivers and all the
while surviving countless near collisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing else for me to do,'' said Footman, who lives
on East 119th Street in Manhattan. ``The driving _ it's like some
people go dancing. It's part of me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Footman may be the city's oldest taxi driver, although that is
difficult to prove because records are not kept by a driver's age,
according to the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the drivers are clearly not in their 80s, so God bless
him,'' said Diane McGrath-McKechnie, the commission's chairwoman,
``We've been encouraging long-term drivers, so apparently we really
have one here.''
</P>
<P>
   Footman has a nearly spotless driving record. He got his first
speeding ticket in May for driving 43 miles per hour in a 30 mph
zone on First Avenue. ``I was just following the traffic,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the streets that worry him these days. In his five
decades behind a taxi wheel, Footman said, the passengers have
become ``bossy'' about telling him how to get someplace, and they
expect a lot more service, all without tipping any more than
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a doorman puts two people in this cab, I see them give him
a $5 bill,'' he said. ``But if I've got $3.50 on the meter, they
give me 50 cents or they don't give me anything. You know why?
Because they'll see that doorman again. A cab _ they ain't going to
see me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Footman said his best tip came when a man handed him $20 for a
$9 ride. But he said the average tip is 50 to 80 cents. Sometimes,
when he has helped someone with luggage, he'll ask, ``Is that all
I'm worth?'' That may get him another 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Since he started drawing Social Security benefits and a union
pension in 1984, he has cut his taxi shifts to four a week, from
six. He usually makes 25 trips in each 12-hour shift, and if all
the passengers tip, he takes home about $60.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m. Saturday, Footman chatted easily with other drivers in
the parking lot at the 55 STAN taxi company on Vernon Boulevard in
Queens. His regular cab, No. 608, is the oldest in the fleet. He
pays $100 a day to lease it.
</P>
<P>
   Ioan Stoia, a company dispatcher, said he met Footman 11 years
ago when he too was a cab driver just starting out. Footman's
advice, he said, was to ``just keep it rolling'' during the whole
shift and not wait idly for passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy like him, you put him off the job and take his cab away,
I think you kill him,'' Stoia said. ``He's not hungry for the
money. He likes to interact with people, every day is excitement.
He really loves to drive.''
</P>
<P>
   With a cigar in one hand, Footman unpacked his supplies. A water
bottle went underneath his seat, as did a cellular phone. Coffee
cups and well-thumbed maps were stored in the trunk for
emergencies. He snapped plastic shades on top of his thick brown
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Then he placed a one-inch stack of folded cardboard and foam on
the driver's seat to raise his slight 5-foot-6 frame for a better
view over the dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   Footman, who was born in Lakeland, Fla., moved to New York in
1941. He started out washing cabs for a taxi company before earning
his own license. ``Something told me that's what I wanted to do,''
he said. ``It was the driving that I enjoyed, picking up people and
going different places.''
</P>
<P>
   When he is not driving a taxi, Footman climbs into his black
Chevrolet Blazer and heads for other places. He used to ride a
motorcycle, but he gave that up for his wife _ only to have her
move out several years later, in 1968. He lives alone and has one
son.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Footman said, he plans to cruise the Interstate down
to Disney World in Florida, and then to his hometown of Lakeland.
But he said he'd always return to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a New Yorker, when I die, I want to be buried here,'' he
said.

ON NEW YORK STREETS, IT'S NOW A DRUGSTORE WAR 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When a 24-hour CVS store recently opened on Columbus
Avenue directly opposite an even larger 24-hour Duane Reade store,
some neighborhood residents wondered if the escalating drugstore
wars were getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got nothing against big chains,'' said Thomas Calagna,
the president of the co-op board at Turin House, the building
between 89th and 90th streets where the new Duane Reade is located.
``But the concept of having two giant drugstores across the street
from each other _ I don't know why either one would want to do
that. Who is going to all these places?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a question many people are asking as new chain drugstores
keep multiplying across New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In just three years, Duane Reade, a regional chain that has
become New York's largest drug retailer, has made a big push to
expand beyond downtown and midtown business districts into
residential areas, particularly the Upper West Side. The chain has
grown to 145 stores from 59, 130 of them in the city. The company,
with 84 outlets in Manhattan, has a four-year plan to add at least
20 stores throughout the city each year.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Reade is not alone. The national chains are also zeroing
in on the New York market. CVS, the largest chain in the nation
with 4,122 stores, has 47 stores in New York City, 16 of them in
Manhattan. The company says it will add 200 stores in the city over
the next three years, 75 of them in Manhattan. During the same
period, Rite Aid, CVS's closest competitor, with 3,821 stores,
plans to add 78 stores to its 147 New York stores. The number of
Rite Aid stores in Manhattan is projected to grow to 56 from 32,
company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're drowning in drugstores,'' said Irene Prince, who works
in retail sales and lives on West 96th Street, in a neighborhood
where the blue-and-red Duane Reade sign can be spotted every few
blocks. ``This is insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just in New York, but all across the country, drugstore
chains are expanding, often swallowing up independent pharmacies or
tiny chains. The population is aging, new prescription drugs are
being developed at a dizzying rate and drug manufacturers are more
aggressively marketing their products directly to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Chain stores _ which have styled themselves as convenience
stores as well as purveyors of medication _ are considered better
than an independent drugstore in coping with the pressure of
managed care, which has slashed the profits that a pharmacist can
make on a prescription to a razor-thin margin.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the recent influx of chain stores, the industry
views New York as a largely untapped market because half the
drugstores here remain independently operated, compared with only
25 percent nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Many city residents say they are already weary of drugstore
proliferation. But some shoppers said they are happy to have easy
access to a drugstore with lower prices than some of the
independents.
</P>
<P>
   Placing stores close to one another may seem like overkill, but
Duane Reade chairman and chief executive Anthony Cuti calls his
company's strategy ``planned cannibalization.''
</P>
<P>
   In the suburbs, he explained, it is easy for a successful store
to accommodate a growing number of customers by building an
addition. That option usually does not exist in New York, so adding
a store a couple of blocks away is a means of handling the overflow
when the original store becomes too crowded, Cuti said. The new
stores then become the equivalent of annexes.
</P>
<P>
   Time-pressed New Yorkers are seen as ideal customers now that a
drugstore is no longer just a place to stock up on aspirin or
shampoo. These days, they are one-stop convenience stores where
harried apartment dwellers can pick up several small items in one
transaction, including notions they used to buy at variety stores
or defunct chains like Woolworth's.
</P>
<P>
   In residential areas, people are increasingly popping into
drugstores to buy milk, ice cream, cereal, cat food or even a bingo
marker for that impromptu game.
</P>
<P>
   No chain operating in the city has more aggressively sought the
convenience market than Duane Reade. In contrast to most other
drugstore chains, where sales are evenly split between
prescriptions and more profitable nonprescription merchandise, only
about 30 percent of what Duane Reade sells comes from behind the
counter.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Reade officials say that their well-honed knowledge of New
Yorkers' habits _ from how they throw a meal together at the last
minute to which routes they are likely to take on the way home _
gives them a decisive edge.

RULING LETS BLACK EMPLOYEES SUE RAIL LINE IN CLASS ACTION
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal appeals court has cleared the way for a
class-action suit by minority employees of the Metro-North Railroad
who accuse the agency of racial discrimination, particularly in
disciplining and promoting employees.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves sweeping charges of discrimination by
Metro-North from 1985 to 1996 in the way it disciplined engineers,
mechanics, conductors and other unionized employees, as well as in
its job promotion policies.
</P>
<P>
   Alan L. Fuchsberg, a Manhattan lawyer serving as lead counsel
for the employees, said Saturday that the case involved charges of
unfair policies in disciplining black workers for infractions
ranging from tardiness to violations of safety rules when operating
Metro-North trains.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a statistical analysis of Metro-North records, which
have been subpoenaed as part of the lawsuit, Fuchsberg said the
railroad's supervisors had disciplined black workers in numbers far
greater proportionally than white workers. He said the records
showed a similar pattern in promotions, in which white workers were
three times more likely to receive promotions than their black
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,300 present and former workers named as plaintiffs include
all black employees of Metro-North from 1985 to 1996, including
many who worked for the railroad during only part of that period.
During a typical year, Fuchsberg said, Metro-North employed 1,000
black employees, about one-sixth of its total work force.
</P>
<P>
   A Metro-North spokesman, Dan Brucker, said Saturday that the
railroad's lawyers had not yet reviewed the appeals court decision
and declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-1 ruling late Friday by a three-judge panel of the 2nd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a May 1998 ruling by Judge
Jed S. Rakoff of U.S. District Court in Manhattan. That ruling
found that lawyers for the 1,300 workers had failed to establish
common patterns of treatment which would allow them to file suit as
a class, instead of as individuals. The case will now be returned
to Rakoff's court.
</P>
<P>
   Although the appeals court ruling did not reach any conclusion
on the charges of discrimination, Fuchsberg said it was an
important victory for his clients because of the legal leverage
involved in class action lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is it expensive for people to try to pursue these
things in court as individuals,'' Fuchsberg said, ``it requires
them to stand out by themselves against a company with all the
personal risk that entails.''

GILBERT MUSTIN, 78, FLEER PRESIDENT WHO CHALLENGED TOPPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Mass.)   (bl)  
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gilbert Barclay Mustin, who led Fleer Corp., creators of Dubble
Bubble gum, in successfully challenging the dominance of Topps
Chewing Gum Inc. in the multimillion dollar baseball card business,
died July 28 at a hospital in Bryn Mawr, Pa. He was 78 years old
and lived in Haverford, Pa., and Westport Point, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia, his wife, Rachel, said.
</P>
<P>
   Mustin was the grandson of Frank Fleer, who founded Fleer in
Philadelphia in the 1880s. It produced a variety of flavorings and
confections, including Chiclets.
</P>
<P>
   Fleer is also widely believed to have invented bubble gum in
1928, when the company produced what it named Dubble Bubble; a
company accountant, Walter Diemer, is often credited with having
made it accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   Dubble Bubble became a household name, not only because chewers
could blow bubbles with it but also because it had cartoons,
featuring the adventures of a pudgy youth named Pud, folded inside
the wax paper wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   Mustin started at Fleer in 1949 and became its president in
1959. By then, the company was in tough competition with Topps,
which made Bazooka bubble gum. Topps had a lock on the lucrative
baseball trading card business, because the Federal Trade
Commission had upheld its exclusive contracts with major league
baseball players for the use of their pictures on cards included
with the gum.
</P>
<P>
   Fleer had long sold trading cards of movie stars and other
personalities with its gum, and it occasionally attempted to enter
the baseball card business, too, but with little success. In 1975,
however, Fleer began a long antitrust case against Topps. Fleer won
in U.S. District Court in 1980 and began offering the player cards
with its bubble gum in 1981. But Topps appealed successfully that
same year.
</P>
<P>
   Fleer then contended that the exclusive Topps contracts covered
only cards packaged with gum or candy, not cards sold with other
items, like stickers carrying the logos of major-league ball teams.
More lawsuits ensued.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, Fleer and Topps settled out of court; Fleer could
continue to sell cards, but not with gum. The settlement opened the
door to several other companies, including Donruss Co. of Memphis,
to enter the business. Today, Topps and Fleer are among the largest
baseball card companies in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mustin retired in 1989, the year Fleer was sold to Marvel
Entertainment. It was sold again earlier this year to a group of
private investors and renamed Fleer Skybox of Mount Laurel, N.J.
The company no longer sells Dubble Bubble gum; Marvel sold the gum
division off separately.
</P>
<P>
   Mustin was born on July 17, 1921, in Lansdowne, Pa., , and
graduated from Swarthmore College in 1942. During World War II, he
led a team at the DeLavall Corp. in Trenton, N.J., that built and
tested a turbo supercharger for Navy fighter planes. He later
taught engineering for several years at Swarthmore.
</P>
<P>
   He was also active in numerous Quaker and community
organizations and was a member of the board of the American Civil
Liberties Union of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Mustin is survived by five children,
Henry Mustin of Seattle; Barclay Mustin of Chimacum, Wash.; Walter
Mustin of Grand Cayman, British West Indies; Margery M. Howe of
West Chester, Pa.; and Laura M. Burn of Port Townsend, Wash.; four
stepchildren, Sharon Hare of Los Angeles; Diana Hare of
Philadelphia; Mally Hare of Amherst, Mass.; and Christopher Hare of
Albuquerque, N.M.; a brother, Frank Mustin of Lansdowne; a sister,
Alice M. Carll of Hopkins, S.C.; and seven grandchildren.

IN WASHINGTON, A TAX BREAK FOR HOMEBUYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SHAWN G. KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Debbie Chewning started searching for her
first home last year, she often drove from her rental apartment
here to the bucolic streets of Takoma Park in Maryland, just across
the border from northwest Washington, where she hoped to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked it there,'' said Ms. Chewning, who has lived in
the Washington area since 1981. ``It was one of the first places I
looked when I decided I needed to stop renting.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Ms. Chewning heard that the federal government would
pay her to buy a residence in the nation's capital, she turned her
back on Takoma Park. The incentive: a one-time $5,000 credit
against her federal income tax. ``I started concentrating on the
areas of the district where I could get more space and a yard that
were in my price range,'' said Ms. Chewning, an office manager for
a consulting company that specializes in environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   In March, she moved into a two-bedroom, Victorian-style home in
the Capitol Hill area of Washington. Her $170,000 home includes a
dining room, full basement and garden.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chewning's gift from the government is an unusual income-tax
credit, available to income-eligible people who buy a primary
residence in the District of Columbia. It was designed to increase
homeownership in a city that has not only seen a steep decline in
population in the last few years but also holds the dubious record
of having the lowest rate of homeownership in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'90s, when the district's debt climbed to more than
$700 million, residents could not always count on basic services
like garbage collection and street cleaning. In 1995, Congress put
the district's financial management in the hands of a financial
control board. The city's health has steadily improved since then.
</P>
<P>
   Eligibility for the short-term tax credit, which is available
only in Washington, is limited to single buyers whose income is no
more than $90,000 and married couples who together earn no more
than $130,000. Buyers coming from outside the district may have
owned homes immediately before moving there, but for district
residents to qualify for the tax credit they may not have owned
homes there for one year before they buy. Buyers must close on
principal residences between Aug. 5, 1997, and Dec. 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes this tax-credit program from other
homeownership incentives is that it provides relief on income tax
rather than property tax, which is a common provision of government
programs.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service said the agency had
not tracked the number of taxpayers who received the credit. But a
survey by the not-for-profit Greater Washington Research Center
said its research suggested that up to 3,495 buyers claimed all or
part of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   (For single people with incomes of $70,000 to $90,000, the
credit is reduced by 25 cents for each dollar of income that
exceeds $70,000, and for couples the same phase-out in value
applies for joint incomes over $110,000. For taxpayers who owe less
than $5,000, the remaining credit can be applied in following years
until it is used up.)
</P>
<P>
   The center's figures were based on a sample survey mailed to
about one-third of residential properties that had transferred
ownership in the district last year.
</P>
<P>
   Using the results of the survey, the center concluded that 62
percent of those claiming the credit already lived in the district,
about 18 percent had previous addresses outside the district and
the rest said they previously lived outside the Washington
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate professionals, housing experts and local officials
say the tax credit has contributed to the best housing market in
the district that they have ever seen. A strong economy, lower
interest rates and an apparent renewed faith in the district as a
place to live have also encouraged people to buy homes.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Association of Realtors, sales of
existing homes and apartments in the district jumped by 50 percent
last year, the second-biggest increase in the country after
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 13,000 homes and apartments were sold in Washington,
according to the organization. Sales totaled 8,700 in 1997 and
6,700 in 1996. The NAR figures are rounded off to the nearest 100
and do not include new homes.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   James Assey, a lawyer who returned to Washington after working
in South Carolina for nearly two years, said the tax credit helped
him make his decision to buy a home rather than rent again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back fully expecting to rent a place,'' said Assey, who
started his rental search in the district as well as in Alexandria
and Arlington in Virginia. ``But I discovered that when I crunched
the numbers and took into consideration the tax credit and the cost
of renting, it made no sense to rent.'' Late last year, Assey paid
$250,000 for a town house on Capitol Hill that includes his
two-bedroom residence and a small rental unit.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Citrin, who bought a $110,000, one-bedroom condominium in a
prewar building in the Adams Morgan neighborhood, said that the tax
credit made it possible for him to buy the apartment he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started looking in 1997 and then stopped to save money and
pay off bills,'' Citrin said. ``When I came back to the market
about Christmas late last year, prices were higher and there were
not as many apartments in my price range. The tax credit definitely
helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker and Susan Greer said the $5,000 tax credit helped them
justify making a commitment to the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are both government workers and we love being in
Washington,'' said Greer, who works for the government Printing
Office. ``When it was time for us to buy, I was really open to any
option. When they dangled the $5,000 in front of us, it made the
decision to stay in Washington easier.'' The Greers, who rented an
apartment in Dupont Circle, paid $230,000 for their three-bedroom,
1890 row house in a nearby neighborhood, Logan Circle.
</P>
<P>
   The tax credit was the idea of Eleanor Holmes Norton, who
represents the district in the House of Representatives, as she
searched for ways to use tax policy to revive the city. The program
was part of the Federal Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already lost three times the population in this decade
as we lost in the last,'' said Ms. Norton, who expects the tax
credit to increase the base of taxpayers, stabilize neighborhoods
and stem population loss. ``This tax credit was the fastest way to
stimulate homeownership.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Census Bureau's estimated population
statistics, the district has had a 13 percent drop in population
since 1990. The census put the estimated population at 606,900 in
1990 and 523,100 as of July 1, 1998. According to the census, in
1998 the rate of homeownership across the country was 66.3 percent,
while in the district about 40 percent of residents owned their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is a city of homes,'' said Ms. Norton, a native
Washingtonian, ``but the majority of residents are tenants. We need
more homeowners. When you own your own home, you are less likely to
flee.''
</P>
<P>
   Eligible buyers claim the credit when they file federal income
tax returns for the year they bought their homes. Fannie Mae, the
nation's largest provider of home mortgage funds, which is based in
Washington, and the district's Housing Finance Agency are working
on a strategy to allow buyers to use the money up front for down
payments or closing costs. The most likely plan will be loans from
employers.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lavigne, who with his wife, Lari, bought a three-bedroom
house in the Capitol Hill area, said they were motivated as much by
the city's atmosphere of rejuvenation as by the tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the $5,000 make us decide to buy in the city; probably
not,'' Lavigne said. ``It certainly didn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the political situation in the past, living in the
district has been trying,'' Lavigne said. ``This was a community
that for a time was not able to sweep the streets. But recently
some of our concerns have been offset by improvements. We are more
comfortable with our investment now.''(BBOX)

GENERATING IRE IN A PLACE FOND OF PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Conn. _ Maybe it was because he used his Fifth
Avenue address when he wrote to town hall. Maybe it was because he
sent a lawyer to a crucial town meeting, instead of showing up
himself. Or maybe it was because he tore down a Cape Cod, within
sight of the village green, to make way for a pool and cabana.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, G. Kelly Martin, 39, had no good will to
draw on when he decided to finish off his weekend retreat with a
power generator big enough to light up much of the town. Instead,
Martin, the head of global debt markets for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
quickly accomplished what no one else had been able to: He united
the town's natives with the many newcomers who have begun using
Washington as a hideout from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups hate his generator.
</P>
<P>
   For now, it sits silently on a concrete pad, ready to protect
Martin, his wife, Elizabeth, and their four young children from
blackouts after they begin spending weekends here in the Litchfield
Hills of northwestern Connecticut. But complaints about the
generator have prompted a review by town authorities of all the
changes Martin has been making, and the improvements have been
found to be more ambitious than the permission he has obtained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something new every day,'' said Lois Gould, a novelist
who lives next door and who was dismayed last week to find that in
addition to everything else, workers were putting in a new fence.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Solley, the chairman of the town's Zoning Board of
Appeals, witnessed a test of the generator and found the noise
level to be ``louder than an idling backhoe,'' but ``consistent
with a commercial lawn mower.'' That was little consolation to Ms.
Gould. ``If there's a power problem and it goes for a day or two or
three, it'll be a real menace,'' she said. ``It'll be like a
continuous car alarm.''
</P>
<P>
   From his vacation home on Nantucket in Massachusetts, Martin
scoffed at speculation here that he was building a shelter against
Year 2000 computer problems. He said he wanted the generator only
because he was concerned that his pipes could freeze during power
failures, which often occur around here because of ice on power
lines. ``We hope the latest misunderstandings can get quickly
behind all of us so we can just enjoy the town,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, R. William Fairbairn, who has lived in town 37
years, said Martin was the victim of out-of-control gossip.
</P>
<P>
   This town of 4,100, named for a famous general who ate breakfast
here in 1781, was once a hub for ironworks but now is known for its
private schools. It has become a retreat for notables from the
worlds of fashion, entertainment and publishing, so tavern fare now
includes ``pan-seared salmon cakes with curried mango chutney.''
Homey touches do remain: The town's annual report lists the year's
births, deaths and marriages (two pages total).
</P>
<P>
   Washington officials have found that Martin has installed
improvements that cover 214 square feet more than had been approved
in 1997. He has offered to tear up one of his sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   But zoning appeals officials will meet Thursday to determine
whether his changes to the original plan are permissible. At a
recent meeting his lawyer, Fairbairn, contended that the total
number of square feet is what counts, not how they are used. That
rankled appeals board members, who told him there was no point in
approving plans a homeowner did not have to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're saying probably we could do these things by mail,''
said Edmund White, a 12-year member of the board.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Kaplan, who works at a bank in New York and has a weekend
place across Kirby Road from the Martins, said they would have
received a warmer welcome if they had shown ``a sense of humility
and a sense of appropriateness.''
</P>
<P>
   So much resentment has been focused on the estate that Martin
has been blamed even for developments that were not his doing. When
a tree was cut down at the front of his property, locals lamented
what they swore was the oldest horse chestnut tree in Connecticut.
It turned out that a utility company had done the deed, but many
here still consider it one more black mark for the neighbor they
have never met.

THE GARMENT DISTRICT TRIES ON SOME NEW TOGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is a battle under way for the soul of the
garment district, that famously congested segment of Manhattan
between Times Square and Penn Station, Fifth and Eighth avenues.
</P>
<P>
   With office space scarce and expensive elsewhere and with
garment manufacturing having largely moved to low-wage countries,
buildings in the area are looking attractive to developers eager to
refurbish them and rent at much higher rates to office tenants.
</P>
<P>
   The Bates USA advertising agency created a stir in 1997 when it
decided to abandon the Chrysler Building to take 200,000 square
feet at 498 Seventh Ave., between 36th and 37th streets. And while
the Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &AMP; Flom law firm will occupy about
half of the new Conde Nast building at 42nd Street and Broadway,
much of the firm's back-office operations will be in a former
garment building at 1460 Broadway, about a block to the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midtown South is full, so there is tremendous demand in the
garment district to convert to office,'' said Bernard Weitzman, a
director of Insignia/ESG, a real estate service company. ``There
are a few buildings in the area that will not entertain any
nongarment tenants, but from Fifth to Eighth Avenue in the 30s,
it's changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives note the convenience of transportation in
the district, with rail and subway stations nearby and the newly
burnished image of Times Square, once considered a headquarters of
grime and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are calling the garment district Times Square
South these days,'' Weitzman said.
</P>
<P>
   But others say that even if the garment district is shrinking
and changing somewhat in character, its essential nature survives.
There is an efficiency in grouping designers and their showrooms in
one geographic area, they say, to make it easier for buyers to
sample the next season's offerings without having to travel all
over the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense to have the designers clustered together,''
said Barbara Randall, executive director of the Fashion Center
Business Improvement District `A buyer can shop trade shows, but
they only see a fraction of a designer's line. People always want
to shop the showrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   And the designers like showrooms, because it gives them the
ability to display their goods the way they want them presented.
``The showroom is a stage,'' Ms. Randall said. ``It is their
opportunity to present their products the way they want them to be
perceived.''
</P>
<P>
   To assist out-of-town buyers, Ms. Randall noted, the BID
maintains an information center at Seventh Avenue and 39th Street.
``Buyers can go in there and say they are interested in career ware
in a moderate-price range and we can hand them a list of people
with those products,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The shrinkage of the district, which once sprawled south of Penn
Station into the teens, is something of an advantage, said Stan
Herman, who operates his own apparel design company and is
president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America.
``Europeans love coming here because everything is concentrated on
one area,'' he said. ``In Europe, everything is spread out all over
the place.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to maintain manufacturing employment, the city has
enacted zoning rules for the garment district that require an owner
who rents a certain amount of space to an office tenant to allocate
an equal amount to garment tenants.
</P>
<P>
   However, because the assembly of clothing has stubbornly
resisted automation and is still a labor-intensive operation,
manufacturing has steadily moved to areas in Asia and Central
America where labor is cheap. Ms. Randall said the number of
garment industry jobs is down from 200,000 a decade ago to about
80,000 now, with many of them in Chinatown and the boroughs outside
of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Many real estate executives say the only real effect of the
special zoning rules has been to hold down property values in the
garment district due to the inability of owners to convert their
buildings to office use.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturing will remain in the garment district, Ms.
Randall said, if only to serve the designers. ``Designers want
access to pattern makers and the ability to select things like
buttons,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But some real estate executives say office tenants are pushing
rents on Broadway and Seventh avenues from the mid-$20s per square
foot annually to the high $30s in some locations. That, they said,
is driving some designers to side streets, where rents are still in
the mid-teens to low $20s, depending on the condition of the
building.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>

</P>
<P>
   A good example, said David Winoker, the executive vice president
of Winoker Realty, is the building at 141 W. 36th St., which is
being renovated to attract designers who need showrooms, office
space and only minimal sewing capability.
</P>
<P>
   Like most buildings in the garment district which were formerly
highly specialized in one type of clothing, 141 W. 36th St. was
once occupied by showrooms displaying women's blouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1970s all of these buildings were oriented toward one
part of the market,'' Winoker said. But in the last 25 years the
American market for apparel has changed and such specialization no
longer makes sense. In addition, he said, many of the older
showrooms can only be reached from blank, featureless corridors
that do little to encourage impulse shopping.
</P>
<P>
   So the building is being upgraded, so that showrooms have glass
facades, which let buyers see the goods being offered as soon as
the elevator doors open. ``This way, if a buyer is headed to a
floor high up in the building and the door opens at a lower floor,
he might see something that will make him come back and make a
visit,'' said Ira Fishman, a senior vice president of Winoker
Realty.
</P>
<P>
   A sample floor has been built in the building, which has
6,000-square-foot floorplates. In addition to the use of glass, the
showrooms have wooden floors and spotlights nestled among the
sprinkler pipes near the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   One designer, Iliana Wolf, who specializes in evening wear, has
taken 3,000 square feet for a showroom and offices. ``Iliana Wolf
extended the wood floor to make a reception area, with the offices
in the back,'' Winoker said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as some building owners are willing to finish space for
shaky new media companies because a new tenant can be fitted in
with almost no new work, showrooms in the garment district are
almost ``generic space,'' Winoker said. ``If a tenant moves out,
you can replace him with a minimum of work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike the Internet-based companies, with their
requirements for high electrical and telecommunications capacity,
clothing designers can fit into existing infrastructures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The garment district is shrinking because many of the textile
companies have gone away,'' said Marc Kritzer, the president of
Fashion Realty Group. But, he said, design talent flourishes in a
concentrated geographic area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fruit of the Loom is back in New York after about a year and a
half away,'' he said of the company that recently leased 22,000
square feet of showroom and office space at 525 Seventh Ave. at
38th Street. ``They found that there was not enough talent in
Bowling Green, Ky.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that companies such as Danskin, Ocean Pacific, Jordache
and Monarch Luggage had recently signed leases for space in the
garment district. ``Key buildings, like 1407 and 1411 Broadway will
not take any nonapparel tenants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herman said the work of the business improvement district had
helped deal with security and sanitation problems in the area and
said the renewal of Bryant Park on the district's northern edge had
permitted fashion shows, presented in elaborate tents in the park,
that helped re-establish the area as a design center. ``Those shows
put the stamp of approval on the area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the improvement at both the northern and southern ends
of the district and the growth of tourism in the city were helping
retailers in the district as well as improving the general
ambiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not rushing from Times Square to Penn Station
anymore,'' he said. ``They are taking time to walk through the
garment district and shop at the stores here.''(BBOX)

AMERICA'S CUP CHALLENGER YACHTS ARRIVING IN NEW ZEALAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's Cup fans eager for a glimpse of new yachts preparing
for challenger races this fall in New Zealand will most likely be
disappointed. The 75-foot sailboats are shrouded in secrecy even as
they are being unloaded in Auckland from ports around the world.
But some trends are becoming apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen, the new boats are very, very narrow,''
said Dyer Jones, president of the America's Cup Challenge
Association in Auckland. ``I suspect we're going to see fast boats
out there and slow boats, good boats and snoozers.''
</P>
<P>
   The new sailboats are trickling in for the Oct. 18 start of the
four-month Louis Vuitton Cup challenger trials. Team New Zealand,
the defender of the America's Cup, is scheduled to race against the
winning challenger beginning Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary deadline of Sunday requires each challenger to
present its official entry _ a bona fide sail number _ to race
organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen international teams are expected to comply out of the
original 18 that were interested. The lineup includes five
syndicates from the United States, two from France, and one each
from Australia, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The overall challengers' outlook is sketchy. But from what is
known, the following is an early ranking of eight of the top
contenders:
</P>
<P>
   1. Prada Challenge, Italy: Financial wherewithal from the Prada
fashion house has given this team a head start. It has drawn key
players from American teams, as well as luring Doug Petersen, a key
designer on New Zealand's winning 1995 team. The Italians also had
the foresight to buy assets from Bill Koch's unsuccessful America's
Cup defense for the United States in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   2. America One, San Francisco: The tenacity and leadership
potential of this group's skipper, Paul Cayard, cannot be ignored.
Although Cayard has been diverted by fund-raising efforts, his
skill in match racing and last year's toughening in an impressive
Whitbread Round the World Race victory make him a vigorous
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   3. Young America, New York: Seemingly a winner by its
association with the New York Yacht Club, the group has formed a
solid team of cup veterans. Bruce Farr's yacht design expertise has
deprived the Kiwis of a source they might have tapped _ Farr is a
native New Zealander. But the same political strife that ensnared
the New York Yacht Club for the 132 years it held the America's Cup
has entangled it again. A deal that went awry last March over
television sponsorship cost the syndicate more than $2.5 million in
cash and an indeterminate amount of good will.
</P>
<P>
   4. Team Dennis Conner, San Diego: The master of America's Cup
yacht racing has the ability to win again, if only through pluck.
Just when his opponents think he is over the hill at 56, he comes
back and strings them along. Still, a one-boat program and
exhaustive fund raising do not bode well for the veteran. Having
hired Ken Read as helmsman improves Conner's chances.
</P>
<P>
   5. Nippon Challenge, Japan: Failed efforts in 1992 and 1995 have
made this team hungry for victory. In a wise ploy, this time the
Japanese have hired Peter Gilmour of Australia as helmsman. Gilmour
is ranked No. 1 on the world match-racing circuit. The syndicate's
two new boats have already been launched but not yet shipped to New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   6. Aloha Racing, Honolulu: John Kolius, a seasoned cup sailor
with a top gun attitude, has been more secretive than most. Having
been stomped on in an ill-fated cup attempt in 1986-87 as skipper
for the New York Yacht Club, he has come back with zeal. He is
building two boats, a signal that winning is his only option.
</P>
<P>
   7. America True, San Francisco: As founder of the cup's first
coed team this year, Dawn Riley has revised the all-women approach
to racing that was part of her participation in the 1995 cup
campaign. Determined not to be left behind this time, Riley's group
is the only U.S. team already sailing in Auckland _ albeit with
only one new boat in the works.
</P>
<P>
   8. Spanish Challenge, Spain: Helmsman Pedro Campos came to the
America's Cup races in 1992 and 1995 with more style than
substance. But an effort now that includes rebuilding the old boat
and designing a new one has strengthened his chances for a decent
performance in Auckland.

A BANK'S ART DECO SIGNATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHRISTOPHER GRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A decade ago, the Bank of New York took over Irving
Trust Co., in a move that gave it not just another bank but, last
year, a new headquarters address: Irving Trust's 1931 skyscraper, 1
Wall Street. Now the Bank of New York is spending $1.9 million to
repair the outside of the Art Deco limestone structure, which also
has a striking set of little-known Art Deco interiors.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1920s, Irving Trust, established in 1851, had its
headquarters in the Woolworth Building, but other offices were
spread over the downtown area. In 1928, the bank began assembling a
site for the financial district's most prestigious address, 1 Wall
Street, and construction on its 50-story building began the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The bank hired the architectural firm of Voorhees, Gmelin &AMP;
Walker, which had developed a specialty of industrial and corporate
buildings for electric, telegraph and telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Walker, a designer with the firm, wrote in Architectural
Forum that ``the exterior of a building has to be viewed by
thousands, and we have got to give them mental relief and
pleasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker and his partner, Perry Coke Smith, developed a faceted
wall surface of limestone blocks that picked up on the slightly
angled frontage on Wall Street. Walker was not keen on the
aggressive new European modernism that people were talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a little old-fashioned in our belief that one would
rather have some solid spaces in the walls than to have them all
glass'' he wrote in Architectural Forum, obliquely indicating that
an all-glass skyscraper must have at least crossed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Irving Trust's new headquarters opened in early 1931, after $3
billion in deposits had been shuttled to the new building's
three-story high vault, at all times ``in direct machine-gun
range,'' The New York Times said. The vault was given a protective
chemical coating that would give off paralyzing gas if attacked by
a safecracker's torch.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine Architecture said the goal for Irving Trust had
been different from traditional bank design: Irving Trust's
interior was to be made ``inviting and friendly, rather than
austerely monumental.''
</P>
<P>
   This meant a series of Art Deco interiors that remain among the
most unusual spaces in New York. Facing Wall Street is the bank's
original reception room, with a high, vaulted space in glass mosaic
tile, ranging from dark oxblood, Chinese red and other shades to
near-orange at the top, all interspersed with a spider web of gold
and bronze lines. These were executed by Ravenna Mosaics at a
factory in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance to the upper floors is centered on a lobby at a
second entrance on Broadway, with faceted walls of black and white
marble from the Pyrenees, and a split-level entry in back on New
Street _ the architects provided for double-deck elevators that
were never installed. On the ceiling of this space, Hildreth Meiere
executed a mural variously titled ``Power of Wealth to Create
Beauty'' or ``The Only Reason for Wealth Is the Attainment of
Beauty.'' Photographs of the mural show a striking cubist-style
swirl of forms with no obvious narrative or form.
</P>
<P>
   The bank leased out the 11th through 45th floors, but built out
the upper five levels in various striking designs. One was a
``shell room'' dining area on the 46th floor, with faceted walls
and shell-shaped glass forms on the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Another, at the absolute top, was an observation lounge _
apparently not public _ a gaspingly high space with a vaulted
ceiling faced with luminous Philippine shells and wall coverings
modeled after an American Indian headdress. Period photographs show
this room furnished with Art Deco furniture and light fixtures.
Other rooms were finished in Moderne-style oak, Yuba wood, teak and
pigskin.
</P>
<P>
   Opening in the shadow of a deepening Depression, and the greater
reputation of buildings like 40 Wall Street, the Chrysler Building
and the Empire State Building, the new Irving Trust Building _ with
its comparatively mild exterior _ never acquired architectural
superstar status.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Mumford, in one of his earliest architecture reviews for
The New Yorker in late 1931, called it ``mere swank, and
unconvincing swank at that,'' much preferring the same architect's
more modest Institute for the Crippled and Disabled at the
northeast corner of 23rd Street and First Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Irving Trust was the standing receiver in bankruptcy for the
Southern District of New York, and by 1933, 150 people were working
in the receivership department at 1 Wall Street, managing failed
businesses from shoe manufacturers to restaurants. In 1933, New
Outlook magazine called it a ``Central Repair Shop for Broken
Business,'' including the Shubert Theater, Radio-Keith-Orpheum and
the Savoy Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, the successor firm to Voorhees, Gmelin &AMP; Walker _ by
then Voorhees, Walker, Smith, Smith &AMP; Haines _ returned to 1 Wall
Street to design an annex directly to the south in a compatible but
simplified modern style. On the interior, it appears the modern
travertine flooring of the main floor of the annex was extended
into the 1931 building at this time, eliminating the deep red
marble of the reception room. Perhaps this was also when the
ceiling in the 1931 lobby was dropped, covering or perhaps even
destroying the Meiere mural.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, there is little trace of Irving Trust's original
high-style interiors, except for the angular, shell-faced ceiling
in the observation room.
</P>
<P>
   One change that Bank of New York, which was established in 1784,
has made since making 1 Wall Street its headquarters last year is
installing a museum on the 10th floor with exhibits on the history
of both banks, including Alexander Hamilton's banking records, a
1790s vault key, and a note for what Christine McKay, the Bank of
New York's archivist, says is the first loan ever made to the
United States, in 1789.
</P>
<P>
   There are also photographs of some of the lost Irving Trust Art
Deco furnishings, like a sumptuous ice-water dispenser and Art Deco
ashtrays. To see the exhibit, write to Ms. McKay at the Bank of New
York, 1 Wall Street, New York, N.Y. 10286 for an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Bank of New York is beginning a complete repointing,
stone repair and cleaning project to address persistent leaks. Left
unexplored will be the area above the dropped ceiling in the lobby
_ the bank is not even sure the Meiere ceiling survives. While the
alterations to the Art Deco interiors are so profound as to seem
irreversible and the observation lounge at the top is for bank use
only, the reception room off Wall Street is open to the public and
still astonishing despite its changes.(BBOX) &QL;

TOOMER REAPS HIS REWARD
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY _ In his first two seasons with the Giants, wide receiver
Amani Toomer mystified his coaches. Although he missed time because
of injuries, there was talk of missed assignments and improperly
run pass routes. Toomer, a second-round draft pick in 1996, slipped
to fifth on the Giants' five-man depth chart at receiver.
</P>
<P>
   But, last season, in the words of Giants coach Jim Fassel,
``Amani was a totally changed man.''
</P>
<P>
   With 27 catches, including the game-winning touchdown to beat
the previously unbeaten Denver Broncos, Toomer had his best pro
season. And Saturday, that turnaround led to a new four-year
contract. Toomer would have become a free agent after this season;
instead, he agreed to a deal that Toomer said was worth $11.2
million with a $3.2 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Giants cut Chris Calloway so they could
elevate Toomer, 24, to a starting role.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Ernie Accorsi of the Giants said signing Toomer
would have no effect on the team's efforts to sign defensive end
Michael Strahan to a contract extension.

PLAN FOR ELITE SCHOOL IN WESTCHESTER DIVIDES HAVES AND HAVE-MORES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LISA W. FODERARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.Y. _ On the surface it seems like the kind of
straightforward development that most towns would welcome. An elite
private day school here, Rippowam Cisqua, wants to build a new high
school on more than 100 acres, with a dozen athletic fields and two
rambling structures designed to fit in with this town's New
Englandy temperament.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Bedford, one of the wealthiest towns in Westchester
County, where Ralph Lauren, Glenn Close and Chevy Chase have homes,
where residents are almost as protective of the town's semirural
character as they are of their own children _ and where nothing is
straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has turned what would, in most places, be a standard
not-in-my-backyard tiff into a battle royal, with the school's
tremendous financial resources arrayed against the technical
expertise of the opponents, whose resumes include environmental
science, law, public relations and political organizing.
</P>
<P>
   It has also pitted the school's upper-class supporters against
its merely upper-middle-class opponents, who fear increased
traffic, noise and water pollution. And it has divided
conservationists and open-space advocates, many of whom are alumni
of ``Rip,'' a school that for decades has occupied a hallowed spot
in Bedford's so-called Holy Trinity, along with the local Episcopal
church and the golf and tennis club.
</P>
<P>
   If built as proposed, the $25 million high school will resemble
a small college, offering the 400 students two ice rinks and four
basketball courts in a giant field house, 12 athletic fields and
six tennis courts outdoors, and a 500-seat auditorium. The property
itself is a little Eden, with thickly wooded hills and vales, rocky
outcroppings and five clear ponds that shimmer in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   For some 20 years, parents of Rippowam Cisqua students have
dreamed of having an independent high school nearby. That desire
intensified in recent years as more and more parents shied away
from the boarding-school option and found it hard to place their
children in private high schools in nearby Greenwich, Conn., or
elsewhere in Westchester because of the increased competition for
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my kids home with me,'' said Nancy Joyce, a Bedford
resident with two children at Rippowam.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the idea of a Rippowam Cisqua High School suddenly
became feasible. That was when the president of the school's board
of trustees, Dort A. Cameron, who sent four children to Rippowam,
bought the 113-acre property on Route 22 for $6 million. He bought
the site, a former gravel quarry, with the intention of giving it
to the school if the town approved the high school plan.
</P>
<P>
   The school thought its new high school would open this fall, but
it is still in the midst of an approvals process involving the
town's wetlands control commission, planning board and zoning board
of appeals. In May, the town signed off on the draft environmental
impact statement, a compendium of maps, traffic studies, hydrology
reports and appendices weighing 39 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Now the school, which needs a special permit to build in a
residential zone, is answering questions raised by town officials
and residents. A verdict is not expected until early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say we were naive about the time it would take to
move through the permitting process,'' said David D. Blanchard, who
was brought in 2 1/2 years ago to be headmaster and to oversee the
high school project. He gave up his duties as headmaster in July to
devote all his time to the high school.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford officials are always meticulous about analyzing and
approving projects. But in this case, the school has had the added
burden of a vociferous and savvy opposition.
</P>
<P>
   One of the foes is Donna De Bernardo Marino, a lawyer and former
ombudsman for Gov. Mario Cuomo. (Her husband is John A. Marino, the
former chairman of the New York state Democratic Party and now the
managing partner of Dan Klores Associates, a powerful public
relations firm in Manhattan.) Another opponent is Lee Wordsman, a
scientist who writes environmental impact statements for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the opponents, who call themselves Concerned Citizens of
Bedford, live in a section of town near the proposed school called
the Farms. By Bedford standards, it is a modest neighborhood, where
houses sell for $350,000 to $450,000 and Toyotas and Hondas fill
the driveways. Children typically attend the well-regarded public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But many families whose children attend Rippowam live in the
``estate area,'' where mansions sell in the millions, Jaguars and
Range Rovers punctuate long driveways, and properties (not yards)
are measured in multiple acres. The school's current student body
includes the children of Chevy Chase, author Michael Crichton and
financier George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   A byproduct of the fight is class friction. ``The opposition
lives on one acre in the Farms, whereas the students attending the
school live on four acres-plus,'' said one alumnus of the school.
``So clearly there is an `us-them,' `town-gown,'
`hilltopper-flatlander' issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Wordsman put it more simply: ``The doctors and lawyers are
feeling threatened by the brokers and bankers.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have embarked on slick publicity campaigns to win
over residents and town officials.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, opponents commissioned a random survey of 200 of
the town's 18,000 residents by a Washington-based polling firm, and
Dan Klores Associates, working pro bono, pitched the results to
reporters. ``Bedford Residents Overwhelmingly Oppose Rippowam
Cisqua's Proposed Development (60 percent vs. 31 percent),''
shouted the headline on the press release. (The school decried the
poll as a marketing device, calling the 32 questions slanted.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can argue with another school?'' Mrs. Marino said in an
interview. ``It's very hard to oppose something that on paper is a
good thing for the town. But it's too big a project in a location
where it doesn't belong.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll revealed that traffic is the top concern of residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic is already awful,'' Mrs. Marino said. ``The additional
cars will all let out at once. It's just going to be a nightmare.''

ON BASEBALL: AN ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE RETURNS TO FENWAY PARK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mike Stanley recalled that when Wade Boggs returned to
Fenway Park for the first time in a New York Yankees uniform, the
Fenway Park faithful first saluted their former hero with an
ovation, then booed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's that adoration and appreciation for what he did,''
said Stanley, now a member of the Red Sox, ``but then it gets back
to you're the enemy, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens had appeared at Fenway as the enemy before
Saturday. He pitched here for the first time and the second time in
1997 as a member of the Toronto Blue Jays. But compared with the
Yankees, the Blue Jays are allies in Red Sox land.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing the road gray uniform of the Yankees _ never mind that
it has no pinstripes _ he was the enemy Saturday. He was actually
standing on the Fenway Park mound and pitching for the Yankees
against the Red Sox. Some things are just never meant to happen.
</P>
<P>
   For 13 seasons, Clemens stood on that same mound and pitched for
the Red Sox, sometimes against the Yankees. The thought of
reversing that scenario was unthinkable. But baseball, especially
as it is practiced by the Red Sox, is a different business. Some
teams try to keep their star players; the Red Sox seem to encourage
them to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Mo Vaughn last winter, it was a case of not
wanting to pay him the going market price, or anywhere near it, for
that matter. After the 1996 season, the Red Sox decided that
Clemens had a foot in baseball's graveyard of used-up players.
</P>
<P>
   Except they watched him work for the Blue Jays the next two
seasons and win 41 games and two Cy Young awards.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens could have defected to the enemy when he was a free
agent. He even said he wanted to go to a team that had a chance to
play in the World Series. Perhaps it was his brain that had a
problem that winter, not his arm, because he shunned the Yankees,
who would play in the World Series in 1998, and the Cleveland
Indians, who would play in the World Series in 1997, and signed on
with the Blue Jays, who last played in the World Series in 1993. He
finally asked out of Toronto last winter, again saying he wanted to
play for a contender, but his move was a thinly veiled play for
money.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown and Randy Johnson were signing free-agent contracts
far more lucrative than he had received, and he wanted his. So he
was on the mound at Fenway Saturday pitching for the team that will
very likely take him to his World Series, and the Fenway fans were
waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the All-Star Game, they gave him a nice round of boos,''
Willie Randolph, a Yankees coach, said before the game, ``so I'm
sure they'll be out in force today.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was introduced at Fenway 2 1/2 weeks ago as one of the
100 players whom baseball has designated as the best players of the
century. He was not a member of the American League All-Star team,
so he didn't pitch in the game, and he did not pitch when the
Yankees played here in May. In 1997, in his first post-Red Sox
appearance here, the dominating right-hander struck out 16 in eight
innings and allowed one hit and four walks in eight innings of a
3-1 Toronto victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we played him with Toronto, it was a pretty exciting
game,'' John Valentin, the Red Sox third baseman, said Saturday.
``He was really juiced and he pitched well.'' Stanley said that
game with the Blue Jays was ``the one that was most hyped, that was
most anticipated.'' But, Stanley added: ``He's in pinstripes now.
He's the enemy. That whole aura. It's still special for him to come
back and pitch here.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, who has traveled and changed teams even more
extensively than his teammate, was looking forward to seeing how
the fans would treat Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those unique days at Fenway,'' Cone said. ``It's
going to be tough for a lot of Red Sox fans to see this day, more
so than when he came back with Toronto, I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the fans felt, Valentin looked forward to facing
Clemens again. Valentin drove in the lone run in Boston's 4-1 loss
to Clemens at Yankee Stadium in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty much the same,'' Valentin said of the pitcher
who has not dominated teams this season. ``I really haven't seen
any decline.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a theory that Clemens becomes too intense, especially
early in games, and tries to do too much, succeeding only in
getting himself in trouble. Valentin didn't buy that theory
generally but said: ``There are times when the adrenaline does flow
and it may affect him. Just like a hitter who goes up and tries to
do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Valentin set about preparing to go against Clemens. ``You
hope now that we're facing him he's not the Roger that Roger is,''
he said. Then he added, ``It was a pleasure playing with him. Now
it's a pleasure playing against him.''
</P>
<P>
   A pleasure? A challenge maybe, but a pleasure? ``Yeah, you're
right,'' Valentin said. ``It's a difficult challenge. If you're an
athlete, a competitor, you enjoy the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you're a Red Sox fan sitting in Fenway Park, you boo,
which is what the fans did when Clemens' name came across the
public-address system. Oh sure, they booed all of the Yankees when
the lineup was read, but they saved their boisterous best for
Clemens.

 &HT;    Littleton community's advice for Atlanta
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Forgiveness is not a word in Brian Rohrbough's
vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   At least not when it comes to the killers of his son, Daniel,
the boy in the green shirt shown crumpled outside Columbine High
School on live television April 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen-year-old Daniel, Rohrbough's only child, died with 11
other classmates and a teacher during the shooting rampage of two
students who then killed themselves. Parents of those killed in
Littleton, Colo., and those left with severely wounded children say
they were horrified to hear that yet another mass shooting/suicide
had occurred in Atlanta on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ages of the victims varied and the site of Mark
Barton's murderous spree was offices and a home, not a school,
Littleton families say Atlanta's families are bound tohave emotions
and reactions similar to those they experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell the families in Atlanta to keep their eyes open
for people who want you to forgive and forget the murderer,''
Rohrbough, 40, said Saturday in a telephone interview. ``There are
people who will want to make excuses for the murderer. ... But he
is a vicious killer and nothing else. No one should make up any
excuse for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rohrbough said many well-meaning people have advised him in
letters and to his face to forgive the Columbine killers, teenagers
Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris. Quoting the Bible's Book of Luke,
Chapter 17, Verse 3, Rohrbough says he cannot forgive because the
murderers were too cowardly to face their sins and repent.
</P>
<P>
   Barton's rampage, which included beating his wife and two
children to death before aiming his fury at two Buckhead stock
firms, ended when he turned the gun on himself in his van as police
caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Mauser, whose son Daniel also died at Columbine High, had
this advice for the Atlanta families now attending or planning
funerals for their child, parent or spouse. ``Be gentle on
yourselves. Allow time for grieving, and try and support each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to feel isolated because so very few of your peers
will know what you are going through,'' she said. The Littleton
families get together informally about once a month in one
anothers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   Mauser and her husband, Tom, are planning to buy a cedar chest
to store many mementoes of their son. They also erected a park
bench in Daniel's name. He would have turned 16 on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   The Mausers, who have taken up the cause of stricter gun-control
laws, say they've received tremendous help from mental-health
therapists and by reading books on the stages of grief.
</P>
<P>
   What isn't helpful, they say, is complete strangers' coming
around to express their condolences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had people call us from around the country who were
coming through Denver and wanted to stop and visit us because they
know us from the media,'' Linda Mauser said. ``That's intrusive.
... Don't be afraid to say, `No.' And don't think you have to
return every phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Littleton families said Barton's crime seemed a copy-cat of
Columbine that perhaps could have been avoided with stricter
gun-control laws. Others said taking away all of the firearms in
the world won't prevent madmen from carrying out their fury.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the the two firearms used by Barton were legally
purchased and that his lack of a criminal record meant he could
possess them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Oklahoma City. That wasn't guns. That was diesel fuel
and fertilizer,'' said Rick Castaldo, whose son, Richard, was left
with eight bullet holes and paralyzed from the chest down in the
Columbine tragedy. He is in a wheelchair and still hospitalized at
a Denver rehabilitation center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's individual behavior,'' Castaldo said, ``and how are we
going to change that?''

Barton went on to commit the worst slaughter in Georgia history.

   CAJUNS _ ABBEVILLE, La. _ In case you thought all Cajuns lived
in south Louisiana, you were wrong. Cajuns are the descendants of
the French who were expelled to Louisiana from Canada in the 18th
century, but in the centuries since they've been flung to the four
corners. But rural Louisiana is still the spiritual heart of Cajun
country, with its funny form of French, its music and food and
laissez les bon temps roulez approach to life. And beginning this
weekend (July 31), as many as half a million Cajuns from around the
world will gather here for the second-ever World Acadian Congress.
The first one was in Canada four years ago. We visit Abbeville, the
most Cajun spot on earth and talk to organizers of the Hebert
family reunion, which will take place Aug. 5-7. Included in their
program is a French mass, a street dance, and the cooking of a

   BUSH-EDUCATION _ AUSTIN _ (Fourth in an occasional series.) As
Gov. George W. Bush begins to educate Americans on who he is and
what he would do as president, education will be on the top of the
list. Texas is being touted as a shining example of improvement, no
small feat in the country's second largest state, which used to
rank near the bottom in most academic indicators. Bush has made
education a top priority, from ending social promotion to
increasing accountability and testing to increasing state funding
of public schools. But he's been unable to deliver on vouchers, and
some critics say he cannot take credit for the recent rise. The
seeds of Texas' success were sown in the mid-1980s, with laws to
create smaller classes, give more money to poor school districts

   VIRGIN-TRASH _ ST. THOMAS, Virgin Islands _ Here's one picture
you won't see on any postcard: trash, and mounds of it. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the Virgin Islands
produce 9.2 pounds of garbage per person per day, more than double
the U.S. mainland average. One reason is all the tourists who
visit, many making day trips from cruise ships. But the problem is
that the only landfill, Bovoni, can no longer absorb all the
garbage, and there's no money to clean up the mess. Why? Because
apparently the Virgin Islands is nearly broke. As a result of
hurricane damage, declining tourism revenue and mismanagement, the
Virgin Islands is saddled with a $1.2 billion debt, a stupefying
sum for a population of just over 100,000. (Emling, Cox News
Service). 20. WITH PHOTO. MOVED Wednesday.

   ISRAEL-BEDOUIN _ UM BATEEN, Israel _ The Bedouin in the Abu Kaf
family raise camels and goats, grow their own food and value the
self-sufficiency they have on their desert hillside. ``We are
satisfied with our lives. We just want to stay on our land,'' said
52-year-old Talal Abu Kaf, seated on carpets on the land where his
family has lived for hundreds of years. About 3,500 Bedouin live in

 &HT;    Praise for Atlanta police
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was the kind of crime scene where if anything could
have gone wrong, it would have.
</P>
<P>
   Police in riot gear fanned out in search of a killer. People
bolted from their workplaces wondering if a sniper was perched on
an office building roof waiting to take out his next victim. Nine
people were shot dead; at least 13 were injured. Emotions ran high.
</P>
<P>
   But office workers who were evacuated from 13 buildings in the
heart of the Buckhead business district Thursday when a man opened
fire on 22 people, killing nine, said the sudden retreat from their
desks ran smoothly because Atlanta police officers kept their cool.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who fled their offices at 3500 and 3525 Piedmont
Road _ the buildings where Mark O. Barton shot and killed his
victims _ in the middle of the workday under a harsh sun and
oppressive temperatures said officers were composed, kind and
sensitive even under the tough circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``They calmed us down,'' said Martha Pendergrast, who had gone
to visit a friend in one of the offices at Two Securities Centre,
the building at 3500 Piedmont where the killings started just after
2:30 p.m. ``I was in there dropping my friend off and all of a
sudden the police come running in and told us to get out because of
a shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   At least three APD officers escorted Pendergrast and a queue of
15 to 20 people from the office building where Barton unleashed his
frustration Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The officers talked to their charges as they walked them through
the throng of reporters and onlookers who had gathered along the
intersection of Piedmont Road and the Buckhead Loop to gawk at the
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 Atlanta police officers, as well as members of the
GBI and FBI SWAT units, agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms and Fulton County sheriff's deputies flooded the area
within minutes of the first frantic telephone call to a 911
dispatcher at 2:56 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The call was from a woman at Momentum Securities at 3500
Piedmont who said a man had shot and killed several people in her
office.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 minutes after police assessed the situation at both
buildings, a call went out over the police radio asking all
available Atlanta cops to report to the scene so they could assist
in the search for Barton, as well as help route office workers and
direct traffic, said Police Chief Beverly Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coordination between our own officers, as well as APD with
the other agencies that helped out, was excellent,'' Harvard said
Saturday. ``We also asked the other agencies to help us with
specific duties, and the turnaround was fantastic. Everything
worked extremely well, given the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the challenges facing investigators was conflicting
information from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers were told Barton was on the roof,'' said Atlanta
Deputy Chief Carter Jackson. ``We were also told he was holding
hostages. The main concern was finding Barton and keeping people
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officers are to be commended. They took great care with
people who were terrified. They acted with sensitivity and
caution,'' Jackson added.
</P>
<P>
   Displaced office workers also heaped praise on Fulton sheriff's
deputies who directed traffic along the Buckhead Loop: ``Those guys
were great,'' said Josie Parrish, who works at 3500 Piedmont.
``Directing traffic under these conditions and in this weather
would make anyone nasty. These guys were nice. They answered all
our annoying questions.''
</P>
<P>
   After police had evacuated both buildings, Scott Belazi, a sales
manager at Allegiance Telecom, a local telephone service at 3500
Piedmont, was trying to cool off and regain his composure as he
sipped a beer at a nearby Mexican restaurant just outside the
police perimeter. Belazi, surrounded by dozens of sweaty people
calling their loved ones on cell phones, was still thinking about
the trail of blood left behind by one of Barton's victims in the
hallway of the building where he works.
</P>
<P>
   He also remembered the police officer who noticed his angst and
gently told him to leave the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing was surreal,'' Belazi said. ``I'll tell you,
the Atlanta police really kept us all together.''

 TOKYO: nine teachers. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the subsidies help reproduce mainland life even on the
remotest islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody left here, but I like it,'' said Tama Shiowaki,
a 74-year-old woman who was bustling down the path on Akashima.
``Feel this fresh air! I get up at 5 a.m. to feed my chickens and
ducks, and I'm so healthy here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope young people come back,'' she said. ``When I was a
kid, there was a store over there,'' she said, pointing to a
collapsed building peeking from the thick brush. ``And over there.
And there. And down by the cemetery as well. And now they're all
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   In another world, the bustle of downtown Tokyo, Kaoru Yosano is
minister of international trade and industry and is thus charged
with maintaining Japan's future international competitiveness.
Sitting at a conference table in his vast office, the size of a
typical Japanese apartment for a family of five, Yosano sips his
tea and admits that he is struggling for solutions to the
population problem _ in vain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no easy answer,'' Yosano said bleakly. ``My mother
was one of eight children. My father was one of 11. My wife and I
were each one of five children, and we ourselves have two children.
When we look further ahead at the next generation, well, I don't
hear much from my sons about having babies.''
</P>
<P>
   (Yosano's two sons, both married, one with one child and the
other without any, both declined to be interviewed.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Former Primer Minister Takeshita once told me that in the year
2500, Japan's population will be down to one person,'' Yosano said
with a glum smile. ``When that happens, I suppose Japan's global
influence inevitably will have declined.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan is not, of course, the only country facing low birth
rates. Japanese women give birth to an average of 1.4 children,
while World Bank figures show Spain, Bulgaria and Latvia tied for
the lowest ``total fertility rate'' in the world, at 1.1. Even the
United States will grow primarily because of immigration because
its total fertility rate, of 2.0, is slightly below the level
needed for a self-sustaining population (which is 2.1 to account
for such factors as babies who die before adulthood).
</P>
<P>
   So what sets Japan apart is not so much that its women are
having fewer babies, but rather the combination it represents: The
world's second-largest economy is now one of the world's least
fertile and fastest-aging societies. Latvia's fertility crisis will
affect Lithuania; Japan's will shape the entire global economy.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the challenge is a shrinking work force. The
government predicts that the working-age population of Japan will
drop by about 650,000 a year over the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   If those projections hold up, then even assuming that more women
and old people hold jobs and that productivity continues to grow
steadily at the same rate as in the 1990s, then Japan's gross
national product in 2050 will be 5 percent smaller than it is
today. Assuming that the rest of the world continues to grow
economically at about the same pace as it has in recent decades,
that would leave Japan with less than one-third the share of global
output that it now enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, each Japanese worker will have to support more
non-workers, as the aged rise from one-sixth of the population now
to one-third by the middle of the next century. This means that
simply for Japan to retain its present per capita income, each
worker will have to increase output to make up for the growing
numbers who are idle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Japanese living standards are going to
improve,'' said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Morgan
Stanley in Tokyo and one of the first Japan specialists to focus on
demographic constraints. ``Japan's GNP is going to shrink, and on a
per capita level it may also be a little bit lower.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this is fixed, of course. If Japan could boost
productivity dramatically, then fewer workers could still produce
as much as today's work force or even more.
</P>
<P>
   But the pattern of subsidies to Akashima _ repeated in small
islands and hamlets around Japan _ helps explain why Japanese taxes
and utility charges are so high, and why Japan has steadily seen
its productivity growth slow down. Because it lays down undersea
cables for people like Mrs. Shiowaki, NTT charges unified telephone
rates across the country that are so high that they have stifled
Japan's growth of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has some dazzling technologies, and these could perhaps be
the basis for boosting productivity and allowing Japan to hold its
own economically for a time. But Japan's strongest sectors, such as
technology, are hobbled by regulation and by the burden of having
to support the weakest industries.
</P>
<P>
   High per-minute telephone connection charges mean that most
Japanese do not spend much time surfing the World Wide Web, for
instance. National law forbids discounting books, to protect small
shops and consumers in remote areas, so there is no incentive to
buy books on the Internet. The upshot is that Mrs. Shiowaki has her
inexpensive telephone, and Japan has no Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, high electrical charges, postal rates and taxes have
made it increasingly difficult even for efficient Japanese
businesses to compete internationally. It is, for example, more
expensive to mail a letter within Tokyo than to mail it from
America to Tokyo. Japanese companies began to do their mass
mailings from America, to save on postage, so the Japanese
government banned the mailing of domestic advertising from abroad.

 TOKYO: from abroad. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why does Japan so obstinately subsidize its past at the expense
of its future?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is a political system in which small towns and rural
areas wield disproportionate influence, such that an upper house
member of Parliament from rural Tottori prefecture has only
one-fifth as many constituents as a member from Tokyo. The late
economist Mancur Olson, in examining why great economies lose their
dynamism, emphasized the rise of special interests that win
protections and clog up the gears of a market economy; although
Olson was writing primarily about the experience of the West, the
same analysis applies to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what is just as important as special-interest politics is a
profound Japanese commitment to equality across the country, and a
revulsion for ``jaku niku, kyo shoku'' society _ one where the
strong eat the weak. Most Japanese accept that businesses may be
predatory abroad, but there is some yearning for them to be
vegetarians at home. There is a genuine and broad-ranging sympathy
for the weakest elements of the economy, and there are virtually no
calls for cutting off the spigots of cash for rural areas or
declining industries.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, Japan has fostered a gentle, merciful brand of
capitalism, one that keeps dying businesses on artificial life
support. The effort to run a country as if it were a Disney movie
strikes Americans as deeply admirable and hopelessly naive, and
Japan has indeed found it increasingly difficult to nurture an
economy drawn entirely in cheerful pastels.
</P>
<P>
   In a system too squeamish to let industries or islands die,
taxes increasingly go to rescue the feeblest competitors, those
that in a more ruthless system would have gone the way of
blacksmiths and buggy-whip factories. Take Japan's ubiquitous
sento, or public baths, for although they are a tiny industry they
are symptomatic of Japan's difficulties letting go of its past.
</P>
<P>
   These sento are glorious nooks of steam and history, privately
owned, where people can go and scrub and then relax together in an
oversize, overheated tub. After adjusting to the sensation of being
boiled alive, it is difficult to think of anything more pleasant
than a Japanese bath, or anything less essential.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, of course, the sento were necessary
institutions, because many families had no bath or shower at home.
Now nearly all homes have baths, and young people almost never use
the sento, but Japan cannot muster the courage to let them go
bankrupt. So, even though their time is past and they have no hope
of competing in the market place, many sento are kept alive with
government loans and subsidies that each year total almost $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   The result is not only higher taxes but capital and labor that,
in the public bath industry, are at Indonesian levels of
productivity and dropping. Everybody knows one way to raise
productivity here _ let the sento go bankrupt _but Japan is not
prepared to pay that price.
</P>
<P>
   The same kinds of sentimental subsidies keep islands like
Akashima alive. There has not even been any discussion of cutting
back the ferry service to once daily, and islanders seem stunned
when they are asked whether the government should continue to
provide expensive services to a tiny, aging population.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never talked about cutting off services,'' said
Mankichi Kokou, 73, an Akashima resident. ``Even if this becomes a
ghost town, the services will continue. They have to.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a good deal of talk about how Japan may be beginning a
``third revolution'' of social and economic transformation as great
as the Meiji period beginning in 1868 and the post-World War II
era. Increasing mergers and the breakdown of the lifetime
employment system give some evidence of this, and officials are
talking a good game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is essential that we radically transform this nation's
system and character in order to promote further prosperity,''
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as Obuchi suggested, the key changes are yet to
come. Japan's steps have been tentative, and South Korea has more
obviously embraced markets in just the last 18 months than Japan
has in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Another way that Japan could stave off the demographic
projections is by encouraging large-scale immigration.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, in particular, has shown that a country need
not worry too much about low birth rates so long as immigrants fill
the ranks of workers. And America has brought in not only low-wage
laborers, working as nannies or farm workers, but also computer
technicians and software engineers who have contributed enormously
to the dynamism of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great strength of America is that it draws in continually
the best of everywhere,'' said Jagdish Bhagwati, a Columbia
University professor of international economics who is from India.
``Japan cannot really match that openness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan has the bottleneck,'' he said, ``of not being really
open to foreign cultures.''

 TOKYO: foreign cultures.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been 145 years since Japan abandoned its ``sakoku''
policy, which meant barring almost all foreigners. Yet even now
Japan is more hostile to immigration than any other industrialized
country: It is, for example, exceptionally difficult for foreigners
to acquire Japanese nationality without marrying a Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Chinese are sneaking into Japan to take
dirty or dangerous jobs, and they are beginning to leave an imprint
on the country. But because some of the Chinese immigrants are
gangsters who are handy with cleavers, many Japanese are more
frightened than ever of large-scale immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the government would try to find any other means of
solving the labor shortage rather than mass immigration,'' said
Charles Horioka, an American economist at Osaka University. ``Japan
is so concerned about maintaining cultural and racial
homogeneity.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tokyo made an all-out effort, it could recruit many of the
best young scholars and engineers from India, Taiwan, Vietnam and
China to study and work in Japan. That could revitalize the economy
and create a boom of entrepreneurship, but few in Japan seem
enthusiastic about that idea, and many seem fatalistic about the
waves of Asian migration that bypass Japan and continue on to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``English has become a common language, so it's natural for the
best and brightest to go to America to study,'' said Yosano, the
international trade minister. ``If they come to Japan, then they
face the language barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I envy America for attracting them, but that's just the way it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is for Japan to try to boost its own
fertility rates, by persuading women like Miki Fujii to have
babies. Mrs. Fujii, 32, has a good office job in Tokyo and the last
thing she wants is a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a matter of whether having a child is worth all
the stress and pressure,'' Mrs. Fujii said. ``Besides, I'd get no
help from my husband. He has this traditional idea that women
should raise children and that they enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard men say they're staying at work late because going
home early means having to take care of children, and they'd rather
work than do that,'' Mrs. Fujii continued. ``I totally understand
that. I think it's quite natural to feel that way. I know I would
feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan is a difficult place for a woman to raise a child, partly
because in practice this is a nation of single mothers. Husbands
stagger home late from the office or a bar, and a government poll
found that fathers spend an average of just six minutes a day
looking after their children.
</P>
<P>
   Profound social changes _ such as the emergence of husbands who
changed diapers _ might help fertility rates. But the Japanese
government's bleak population projections already assume some
recovery in fertility. If the total fertility rate stays where it
is, then the population will plummet even faster: to 92 million in
2050 and 50 million in 2100.
</P>
<P>
   Some Scandinavian countries have raised fertility a bit by
offering improved child care and various other incentives, and some
Japanese localities are even offering cash rewards for extra
children. Still, in countries like Sweden that have tried this
approach, the cost has been considerable and the long-term increase
in fertility very slight.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, an increase in birth rates would take a long time to
work through the system, for nearly all of Japan's labor force in
the year 2025 has already been born.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot evade the phenomenal change in population structure
and phenomenal change in population size,'' said Makoto Atoh, one
of Japan's leading demographers. ``It's an inevitability derived
from the current level of fertility and longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   Atoh said that Japan could partly compensate for the decline in
the labor force by having the elderly hold their jobs longer and by
encouraging more women to work. Fewer Japanese women hold jobs than
in most Western countries, so there may be room to expand the rate,
he noted, but he said that Japan's population will shrink so
quickly that adjusting to it will be very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem of the aging of Japan's population will be how
to pay for it. The social security system is underfinanced by a
huge sum about equivalent to Japan's entire annual gross domestic
product, and corporate pension funds are underfinanced by hundreds
of billions of dollars, leaving them with a burden equivalent in
scale to the banking crisis that has dogged Japan's economy for the
last half-dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   As for Akashima, the island remains a gorgeous but depressing
reminder of what can happen to a place when its population ages.
Most of the remaining people on Akashima say they believe that
there will still be at least one person living on the island for
the next decade, but there is the sobering example of another
nearby island, Himejima, which has been entirely abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of my young days, I remember how my friend lived
over there, and another friend's house was over there,'' said
Yoshie Kokou, the fisherman, pointing sadly at clumps of bushes.
``And I long for the past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear young people aren't having kids now,'' he said. ``I
guess it's just the changing times.''

 &HT;    Barton visited lawyer to update will on day of shootings
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With his slain wife stuffed into a closet at home and
the battered bodies of his children tucked into their beds, Mark
Barton paid a cordial visit to his lawyer Thursday morning to
update his will.
</P>
<P>
   Some four hours later, Barton went on to commit the worst
slaughter in Georgia history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not have beady eyes or a stubbly beard or anything like
that,'' said Joe Fowler, a prominent attorney in Douglas County
with deep roots in the community. ``He just seemed real normal,
just talking. I guess he easily could have had a weapon with him.
The people in the office (looking back on the then-innocuous
meeting) are just freaking out.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a surreal episode in the spiraling end of a deranged man,
who, while struggling with internal demons that drove him to kill
himself and others, was also tying up loose ends _ just finishing
some errands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's odd that someone who has done this would be able to act
with such deliberateness, such coldness,'' Fowler said of the
15-minute, otherwise forgetTable encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Barton had also come to Fowler's office Monday to make
``routine'' changes to his will. He returned for the short visit
Thursday to again tinker with the document. It was concerning
simple matters that Barton did not even have to come in person to
do, Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney said Georgia State Bar Association guidelines
prohibit him from talking about the will until it is sent to court
to be probated. That will occur after a death certificate is signed
in a week or so.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, Fowler was contacted by Henry County
police, who were concerned about his safety. Fowler's name was cc'd
on a note that Barton left in his apartment with the bodies. Fowler
and his staff were given police protection until Barton later
killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fowler does not believe that Barton meant him any harm.
</P>
<P>
   Barton first approached Fowler not long after the 1993 slaying
of Barton's wife, Debra, and his mother-in-law, Eloise Spivey, for
help with some legal matters, including estate planning. Part of
that work later included a $450,000 settlement in 1997 from an
insurance company on a $600,000 policy Barton took out on his wife
two months before her slaying. About $150,000 went to Barton's two
children, Matthew, then 9, and Mychelle, then 6. The insurance
company initially fought the payment, accusing him of the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Police also strongly suspected Barton of the savage bludgeoning
slayings, as did the Spivey family and others in Douglas County.
Fowler, a deeply Christian man, was ambivalent about his own
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I heard the talk and Mark did, too,'' said Fowler. ``As
a lawyer, you can't separate it. You cautiously presume the best
until shown otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him as a man in grief and my job was to help him with
the details to carry on living.''

 &HT;    `Open season on kids'
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The 11-year-old sat on a couch in his grandmother's
living room Thursday night, staring blankly at the television that
was firing out news of the carnage in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   He could not turn away, even though maybe he should have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to watch it,'' Santonio Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   At 11, he already knows first-hand about unthinkable violence.
Just last month, he was dragged by the neck around his Atlanta
apartment and forced to watch as his mother's boyfriend shot six
members of Santonio's family to death _ and then shot Santonio. The
sixth-grader feigned death and was the sole survivor.
</P>
<P>
   And now, three weeks later, Santonio could not pull himself away
from news reports of Atlanta's latest spasm of deadly violence,
courtesy of Mark O. Barton, whose two children were among the 13
people he killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to watch it even though it made me sad,'' said
Santonio, who still is undergoing physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Both nationally and in metro Atlanta, the past four months have
been marked by violence _ especially violence toward children. And
make no mistake, the experts say: The kids are reeling from it,
even if they appear to be detached as they watch it and read about
it in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being bombarded with violence,'' said Dr. Nadine Kaslow,
chief psychologist at Grady Health System and an Emory University
professor. ``Kids are less protected _ and they feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been open season on kids,'' said Cassandra Collins, 43, a
Smyrna mother of three, as she watched her children play outside
last week. ``And I think everyone, especially children, are having
a hard time comprehending it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since April, children have been hurt or killed with frightening
callousness and frequency:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Littleton, Colo., a dozen students were killed at Columbine
High School. The shooters, teenagers Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris,
killed themselves after firing on the students in the library and
cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Franklin, Ind., Ronald Lee Shanabarger killed his
7-month-son by suffocating him with plastic wrap. Shanabarger told
authorities he planned the murder even before his son was
conceived, saying he wanted his wife to pay for not coming home
from a vacation when his father died.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Conyers, six students were shot at Heritage High School by
a fellow student who was disgruntled over a breakup with his
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   _ In southwest Atlanta, Santonio's mother, Deleane Briskey, her
sister Essie Jo Huguley, and four of Briskey's six children: David
Antonio Lucas, 13, Craig DeCarlo Briskey, 15, Antione DeAndre
Lucas, 9, and Torsha Briskey, 16, were killed by Briskey's
boyfriend, Cyrano Marks. Santonio was forced to watch each killing
before Marks put a pillow over Santonio and tried to shoot him in
the head. The gun jammed on the first try; Marks fired again,
wounding Santonio in the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   And now this.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Before killing nine strangers and injuring a dozen more in two
office buildings, Barton, 44, killed his wife, Leigh Ann, on
Tuesday, and his son, Matthew, 11, and daughter, Mychelle, 8, on
Wednesday, in their Stockbridge apartment. He later took his own
life. He left notes on his children's bodies after striking them
with a hammer and drowning them in a tub.
</P>
<P>
   For Matthew, he wrote: ``My son, my buddy.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mychelle: ``My daughter, my sweetheart.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a violent end for two kids who had gone to summer camp,
learned to swim and played soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the month, Matthew, a Tenderfoot Scout in Troop 297,
was proud to have received his swimming merit badge while at a
weeklong Boy Scout camp, said Jerry Martin, director of the Boy
Scouts at The Rock Baptist Church in Rex, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The day before Mychelle was murdered, she was at a Girl Scout
day camp called Starlight Adventure working on costumes for a play,
said Barbie Grammel, a Girl Scout leader who was good friends with
Leigh Ann, also a troop leader.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew was mature for his age, according to family and friends,
and he was protective of his younger sister, especially after their
mother and grandmother were found hacked to death at an Alabama
campground in 1993. Their father was a suspect in those slayings,
but was never indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Mychelle became the family jokester, a happy child who loved to
swim in a neighbor's pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't comprehend it,'' said Grammel, whose 7-year-old
daughter, Natasha, played with Mychelle. ``Tuesday night was the
last night we saw them alive. The girls were chasing fireflies in
the parking lot. Just being little girls on a summer night.''
</P>
<P>
   Grammel told her daughter that Mychelle was dead when she picked
Natasha up from the Starlight Adventure, which ended a day early
because of the shootings. ``She cried, she was very upset,''
Grammel said. ``She needed to be held.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part for Grammel is when her daughter started asking
why. Why did Barton do this? Why did they have to die?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her sometimes we don't know,'' Grammel said.
``Sometimes there are reasons we don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to help Matthew's friends, Martin's troop plans to
meet Tuesday to talk to counselors and with each other. ``We're
going to be like a family and cry on each other's shoulders,''
Martin said. ``When we hurt, we all hurt together.''
</P>
<P>
   The main message, Martin said, will be that the world is not a
bad place, even if there are bad people.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is that homicide is the No. 4 reason for death
among children ages 1 to 4; No. 3 for kids 5 and 14; and No. 2 for
teens and young adults, ages 15 to 24, according to national vital
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths among children, which includes homicides, are declining
nationwide, dropping to 26 per 100,000 in 1996 from 34 per 100,000
in 1985, according to Kids Count, an annual survey conducted by the
Annie E. Casey Foundation. The rate in Georgia continues to be
higher than the national average, with 31 per 100,000 in 1996,
although that is down from 37 per 100,000 in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia also lags badly when it comes to teen deaths due to
accidents, homicide and suicide. The U.S. rate was 62 per 100,000
in 1996; Georgia's rate was 83 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 children die each year in this country at the hands
of their parents, according to a U.S. Justice Department study.
</P>
<P>
   When children are killed by their parents, the most common
reason is a combination of frustration and anger..
</P>
<P>
   But in some cases, the parents _ usually deeply depressed _
don't want to leave their children behind with uncertain futures.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, South Carolinian Susan Smith let her car roll into a
lake with her two sons strapped in their car seats. She said she
did it because she had planned to commit suicide and simply could
not face letting her sons, ages 3 and 14 months, be raised by
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as in Barton's case, some parents do not want their children
to suffer the throes of life that they themselves have suffered. In
a suicide note, Barton wrote: ``I killed the children to exchange
them for five minutes of pain for a lifetime of pain. I forced
myself to do it to keep them from suffering so much later. No
mother, no father, no relatives. The fears of the father are
transferred to the son. It was from my father to me and from me to
my son. He already had it and now to be left alone. I had to take
him with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But the loved ones and a shaken community must deal with the
aftermath _ and kids are the most vulnerable, especially those
whose parents or grandparents were killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dean Delawalla, 52, leaves behind his 15-year-old
son, Faisal, and his daughter, Shayla, who turned 4 on Wednesday.
He loved to watch his son play sports, from soccer to hockey.
</P>
<P>
   And Allen Charles Tenenbaum, buried Friday, leaves behind three
children, 3-year-old Scott, 11-year-old Megan and 13-year-old
Brittany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the closer violence gets to the home, the more
frightening it is,'' said Emory's Kaslow. ``You want to tell your
children the world is a safe place with unsafe people, but with
what they're seeing, it's getting harder to make a convincing
case.''
</P>
<P>
   And the violence doesn't have to be agonizingly personal to have
that impact, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the saddest thing I'm witnessing is children do not
seem surprised by all these murders,'' said Martha Christison, a
social worker for almost three decades at the Grady Health System
Outpatient Child Psychiatry Clinic. ``It's like they've been
exposed to it, they can't control it and they don't really
understand it. There's a solemn resignation about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But an innocence is forever lost.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Holmes, a 14-year-old Boy Scout who lived near the
Bartons in Stockbridge, said he had struck up a conversation in
their apartment's parking lot with Matthew and his father after
noticing they were wearing Scout uniforms. It was the night Barton
apparently killed his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's freaking me out,'' Holmes said. ``I'm not going to talk
to any more strangers, even if they're Scouts.''
</P>
<P>
   And Collins, the parent in Smyrna who was merely an observer
like most area residents, said she sees the shock slowly fading
from her children's reactions _ especially with her 10-year-old,
Nikolaus. ``I think he's seen so much, and yet he still doesn't
really understand what's happening,'' she said. ``He doesn't really
understand the permanence of death. ... That all these poor little
kids are gone forever.''

AS TEMPERATURES CLIMB, A NEIGHBORHOOD GETAWAY IN BROOKLYN BECKONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to DELETE photo note)  (mk) 
 By JOE SEXTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was 11:13 in the morning on Wednesday, and the
temperature was 88 degrees and climbing. Samuel Marrow, 74, had
risen with the sun, but now he wanted out of it. And so, as he had
over the course of the last 51 summers, he walked down Quincy
Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and over to
the former Tompkins Park, now known as Herbert Von King Park.
</P>
<P>
   A seat in the shade, a moment of mercy after a month of historic
heat, was all Marrow was looking for, and he found it where he
always had _ on the bench six strides inside the Greene Avenue
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   There, in the simple cool, he could see everything, looking back
in time as well as straight in front of him. On his right was the
tree from which several young boys were hanged in the gang wars of
the 1950s. To his left was a line of young children, the children
of the neighborhood's poor and working class, running sprints in
the sun, the temperature draining from them everything but their
smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to Brooklyn from North Carolina after the war,'' said
Marrow, who back then worked in a shipyard in Kearny, N.J. ``I'd
get home hot and dirty, but gather my kids and come here. Back
then, you could spend the night out in this park. It's always been
the coolest park in Brooklyn. There's a lot of history here.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the history, in many ways, of a certain kind of summer in
New York City, the summers lived out by children for whom a fancy
day camp is a pipe dream, summers lived out by fathers and
grandmothers for whom vacation is an absolutely local experience.
Across the city, there are parks and playgrounds, schoolyards and
street corners that have always served as improvised summer
retreats, unglamorous, but rich and fully used.
</P>
<P>
   They are found at the backs of falling-apart schools and
squeezed between housing projects, or, like Von King Park, standing
squarely at the center of a storied neighborhood of culture and
strife. And at midsummer, people are driven to them before
daybreak, and many don't leave until well past midnight, early
bedtimes seeming a needless cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   In those parks and schoolyards, people taste the modest, sweet
freedoms and comforts of shade and laughter, invented games, the
little dramas of romance and athletics. Of course, they are not
places of complete summer sanctity: There is commerce in drugs,
sometimes in revenge; people bring their dinner to the park, and
others roll dice; anger can rise like the heat, quickly and with
menace.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, when the temperature rose to 97 degrees, teen-agers
flirted openly, the strength of their hormones undefeated by the
heat. And on a center bench, the resident storytellers and wise
guys were in full voice, their tales driven by pride and nostalgia,
boredom, hope and the brown bags between their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it is smoldering everywhere else, there are places in
this park that can feel refrigerated,'' said Lemuel Mial, a Parks
Department official who has worked at the park since 1967. ``Of
course, it's not totally innocent, either. But this, I think, is
the bright green spot of the neighborhood. And summer here is going
day and night.''
</P>
<P>
   To spend 24 hot and unpredictable hours in Von King Park, then,
is to appreciate what that kind of summer of constraint and
creativity can feel like.
</P>
<P>
   6:17 a.m., 78 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Bill Crowder, 54, sat in a quadrangle of the day's first
sunlight and opened his flute case. It would be the sixth straight
day of temperatures over 90, the 28th day of a month that would
become the hottest ever recorded in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of like the gypsy of Bed-Stuy,'' he said. ``Actually,
I can play this flute in the house now. My new roommate doesn't
mind. But I have to come back to my roots to play. This park is my
roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Just after daybreak, Von King Park _ its name was changed in
1985 to honor the neighborhood advocate who had earned the
unofficial title of ``mayor of Bed-Stuy'' _ is populated by the
elderly, the unemployed and the ambitious, Tracy Moore's ambition
amounting to doing pull-ups on the playground bars before it got
too hot and before he had to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:49 a.m., John Stevens, 73, a former porter, began the
park's first game of checkers. ``It's too hot and too early to
think clearly,'' he said, laughing, ``but it ain't too hot or too
early to cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   The working people from the streets around the park _ it is
bordered by Greene, Lafayette, Marcy and Tompkins Avenues _ also
walk through, wearing the uniforms of hospital orderlies and
Sanitation Department workers. And they each steal a second or two
of breezy relief.
</P>
<P>
   Hard luck can bring people to the park, too. Ruben Gonzalez, 47,
played in the park as a child, and he remembered how he used to
come dressed in a suit and shoes with his father. Gonzalez had been
away for years, but returned to Von King Park when he was sent
there to work for his welfare check.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have improved the park a lot, created more things for
kids,'' he said. ``I brought my daughter here the other day. I told
her it wasn't like this when I was here. But I told her to sit
where I had sat. It felt good for me to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m., the sun had climbed up off Tompkins Avenue, a hot
coin rising in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Laurine Harrison, a grandmother and former bookkeeper, sat in a
swing, her pleasure nothing more lavish than to stretch her arms
and legs. And Eddie Vick, 66, a former boxer, walked with his
grandson, his shirt soaked across his broad shoulders, his
grandson's hand lost in his aging boxer's fist.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Bryant, 11, had waited in his Greene Avenue apartment for
hours before getting the final OK to go to the park with his
brother, Kaheem, to play their invented game of Black Mat Tag.
``This park is enough for us,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   12:49 p.m., 92 degrees
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Jolly, 15, walked onto the basketball court at the
southeast corner of Von King Park. There, with five others, the
day's first game started. It was a game of dubious shot selections
and endless talk, with the chief conversational constant being the
total failure to mention the word ``job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Work? I'm working on my jump shot,'' said Aaron, his laugh as
soft as his shot floating through the netless hoop. Aaron is one of
eight siblings, and he said he had worked earlier in the summer at
a nursing home. He was waiting to be called back.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, he listened only for the call of ``next.''
</P>
<P>
   A generational shift had taken place at the park as the
afternoon arrived. It is largely the young who are out in the
midday heat, and even they treated the sunlight as a flame to
dodge.
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters come from the row houses along the park's
borders, and from the Louis Armstrong projects on Quincy Street, a
set of buildings that function as squat, remorseless ovens. The
children turn the park's asphalt paths into racing strips, and the
two sprinklers empty a reservoir's worth of water into the air.
</P>
<P>
   It is not Cape Cod, but it is more than all right, something
deeper than simply a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two options,'' said Stacey Tyler, the mother of six
children, four of whom were with her in the sprinkler. ``I can stay
at home and run the hose on them, or I can use the city's water. I
just got my water bill, and so that settled that.''
</P>
<P>
   The park has a rich history. In 1857, it became the first park
formally established by the city of Brooklyn, and it was originally
named for Daniel Tompkins, the abolitionist and four-term governor
of New York. Its final design was by Calvert Vaux and Frederick Law
Olmstead, the designers of Central Park. A library once stood at
its center, and it was often used for military reviews. It is full
of oak and maple trees.
</P>
<P>
   The multiple uses of the park are organized, accidental, and
occasionally urgent. There are nighttime concerts, and a handful of
dance and arts programs are run out of the park building. A local
church that had been damaged by fire now conducts its Sunday
services in the park's outdoor auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   And it gets used, too, as a place for people to come and hold
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came because of the heat,'' Luisa Matos said.
</P>
<P>
   Next to her, Shawn Blake smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came for love,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two, both 19, had just discovered Von King Park, and shortly
after 2 p.m., with the temperature at 95 degrees, they sat side by
side and talked of their future. They had dated for two and a half
years, and had moved to Brooklyn only months before from St. Thomas
in the Virgin Islands. They had taken an apartment together and
were looking for work. Von King Park offered a place for their
hearts to calm down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it will work out,'' Ms. Matos said. ``I want
to go to school as well as work. But it's going to be hard, I
think.'' She put her head on her boyfriend's shoulder and closed
her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   6:10 p.m., 96 degrees
</P>
<P>
   The sun's slow, almost exhausted decline over Marcy Avenue at
the west end of Von King Park had done nothing to thwart the
temperature's ascent. Through that heat and the first hints of
twilight, Homer Stewart walked with his 6-year-old son, Kwame.
Stewart, who works for a bank in Flatbush, had changed his suit for
shorts and was about to have his first game of catch with his son,
an exercise in sweat and tenderness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the baseball lover,'' Stewart said of his son. ``And we
are here to register for the park's baseball program.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the two moved to the ballfield at the northwest corner of
the park, where the baseball games begin after dusk.
</P>
<P>
   The park in the early evening is more full than ever, its
characters including the near-permanent residents who have, during
the day, moved from one bench to another, their courses charted by
their own private maps of quiet desires and distractions.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is Queen Curry, 69. She was born in Camden, S.C.,
but moved to Bedford-Stuyvesant 30 years ago and raised four
children. The park was always there, full of pleasures and perils.
She said one of her children had been ensnared by the drug scene
that prevailed at the park years ago. ``I've made a whole circle
around this park,'' she said, listing the houses she had lived in
on the four surrounding streets. ``But I always walked through
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some choose to march through it, and shortly after 8 p.m., the
sounds of a drum and bugle corps rise. There, gathering for
practice, are the Toppers, who say they make up the oldest active
African-American drum corps in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In sunglasses and baseball caps, Victor English and Daniel
Wright, bugles in their white-gloved hands, work their way through
a medley as night falls. ``We're doing this as a hook for kids in
the park,'' said English. ``I started in 1961, and the drum corps
taught me discipline, self-respect. And it gave me the chance to
get out of this city.''
</P>
<P>
   9:11 p.m., 89 degrees
</P>
<P>
   With the darkness, the degrees of separation in the park had
grown more stark. Certain corners of the park had grown slightly
sinister, taken over by teen-agers and other young men and women,
the language often loud and hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say this park is nice, that it has grass and whatnot,''
said a 16-year-old who identified himself as Little G. ``But young
people get hurt in this place, too. And the police precinct is
right on the corner. But they don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, almost everyone, including police officers at the 79th
Precinct at the southeast corner of the park, agrees that Von King
Park has come a long way during the last decade on the question of
safety. There were years, Officer Jeannette Morales said, when
almost all the pursuits of criminal suspects either started, ran
through or wound up in the park.

   ``I don't think we even track the number of incidents in the
park these days, the number is so low,'' said Morales, who has been
the precinct's community affairs officer for six years. ``Cops even
play handball in there.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of security is hardly universal, though. A girl was
raped in the park on July 22.
</P>
<P>
   But, as late night approached, there still were mothers in the
park with their children, gamely hanging on and hanging out by the
sprinklers, the spray of water looking in the dark air like a kind
of fine smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Figueroa was there with her daughter Angelica, 3. The
night hours in the park are what Ms. Figueroa can manage, for she
does not get off work until 6. They would stay until Angelica fell
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place where you feel like you can break away,'' Ms.
Figueroa said. ``Break away from the heat. And, you know, break
away from the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   With midnight coming, and the forecast calling for four more
days of 90-degree heat, a breeze still ran through Von King Park, a
breeze that felt freighted with something _ rain, mischief, peace,
the scent of summer.

   Toronto is hailing the trade for David Segui as one of the most
consequential the franchise has made in the '90s. Manager Jim
Fregosi will play him at first base, in left field and as a DH. The
switch-hitter bringing a veteran's edge to a young team just
beginning to taste success.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a front office point of view, this sends the message down
to the
</P>
<P>
   clubhouse that they are committed to winning and that's great,''
first baseman Carlos Delgado said. The Jays opened the weekend atop
the wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   Fregosi has some experience with working a veteran into a lineup
in three positions. He did it with Don Baylor in California in 1979
and Baylor, the Braves' hitting coach, responded by winning the
league MVP award. . . .
</P>
<P>
   It took Baltimore second baseman Delino DeShields five weeks to
come back from a hamstring injury and the interim might have cost
him his future as an Oriole. Jerry Hairston Jr. hit .277 with two
homers, seven RBIs and six steals in 25 games as DeShields'
replacement. The O's sent him back to Class AAA, but next year is a
different story.

</P>
<P>
   Now that the Tigers are poised to move into a new park, it is
only fitting one final adjustment be made as Detroit enters the new
millennium: the owner is getting more involved. Mike Ilitch, the
Little Ceasar pizza baron, has put all his business enterprises
into a holding company so that he can personally oversee his club's
transfer into Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   GM Randy Smith denies Ilitch barred the trade of any front-line
player leading up to the trading deadline but the owner has begun
issuing more control. Whereas former manager Buddy Bell picked his
staff, Ilitch has since subtly affected staff changes. Ilitch put
up $150 million of his money to build Comerica. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox not only don't regard the Indians as a dynasty
they expect to contend for the division next season. Said GM Ron
Scheuler, ``That All-Star lineup they have, they found out with an
injury here or there and that pitching that they're still looking
for, that a lot of things can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   AL WEST
</P>
<P>
   If Juan Gonzalez's image took a knock for his refusal to take
part in the All-Star Game, his act at the Cooperstown Hall of Fame
game should knock him off the chart. The Texas right fielder
declined to play because his uniform pants _ 1993 replicas from
inductee Nolan Ryan's last season _ were too baggy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he begged out of the lineup, claiming a wrist hurt.
Then he neglected to inform manager Johnny Oates, who didn't learn
of the injury until 15 minutes before first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan can make it difficult at times,'' Mark McLemore said.
``At times, it becomes harder for some of us to keep focused on
what we're out there to do every day. Every day. Not five out of
every seven or six out of every seven but every day.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's dealing away of Segui and Butch Huskey had both Ken
Griffey Jr. and Jay Buhner holding closed-door meetings with
manager Lou Piniella over the Mariners' intentions. ``These deals
give you the sense we are looking for next year,'' Edgar Martinez
said.

   With Livan Hernandez's departure, the next Florida object of
trading desire becomes right-hander Alex Fernandez, who is still
working with a 100-pitch limit but has shown he has overcome
rotator cuff surgery. Do not expect him to leave Florida anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez is halfway through his four-year $35 million contract
that was specifically negotiated with trade stipulations. The
Marlins can only deal him to Cleveland, Texas, St. Louis, Atlanta,
Baltimore, Tampa Bay or the Chicago Cubs _ note the paucity of New
York clubs _ and bear in mind Fernandez accepted an offer worth $7
million less to go back to Miami, his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much consideration (of leaving),'' said Scott
Boras, his agent. ``This is Alex's home.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Rick Reed, at 9-3 the New York Mets' most solid starter,
petitioned again for admittance to the Players Association. Reed,
like Atlanta's Kerry Ligtenberg, was a replacement player during
the 1994-95 strike and has been excluded from the union and all
licensing income.
</P>
<P>
   NL CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   The Astros look back this weekend at the Randy Johnson deal,
consummated at the trading deadline a year ago, and see it netted
them nothing. Johnson is in first place in Arizona. Freddy Garcia
and John Halama, who the Astros sent to Seattle, have won a
combined 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, general manager Gerry Hunsicker, saying, ``I would
do it again 100 times out of 100,'' will not second guess the
decision. Then he gave a telling sermonette on the nature of the
trading deadline: ``This is a great example of why you have to be
careful when making trades in the middle of the season, because in
reality, there's only one team in the National League that gets to
the World Series, and the odds aren't great regardless of what
moves you make.'' . . . St. Louis third base coach Rene Lachemann
did his best to keep Mark McGwire away from umpire Sam Holbrook
Wednesday when McGwire disputed a strike call.
</P>
<P>
   ``(He) threw me around like a helicopter,'' said Lachemann. ``He
said, ``Don't come close to me. I want to go ahead and say what I
want to go ahead and say, so leave me alone.'.''
</P>
<P>
   NL WEST
</P>
<P>
   The flop to last place has done nothing to clarify the bad
situation of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Quite the opposite. Second
baseman Eric Young, finally on the DL with an ankle that has
bothered him all year, feels manager Davey Johnson has made him a
scapegoat for the club's bad mix. ``I've gone out there and played
hurt all year,'' said Young, whom the club had tried unsuccessfully
to deal, ``but I guess that doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Eric Karros has also had it with being included in
every trade rumor to emanate from the organization. Then there is
Raul Mondesi, who declined to return to the dugout during the fifth
inning changeover in Arizona last Friday night, sitting in the
Dodgers bullpen while the team batted. When confronted, Mondesi
said he did it in San Diego earlier in the year and no one cared,
adding, ``I got better things to worry about.''

 &HT;    Last-place Cubs feeling unloved
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Incredibly, the fun already has expired in Chicago. Not even a
full season removed from one of their most enjoyable summers, the
Cubs are the Cubs once again: in last place and disbelieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play with more passion and pride, come ready to
beat the other club,'' manager Jim Riggleman said. ``You can't just
go out there. There are no games on the schedule that say you are
going to win. Theoretically, you can go 0-162.''
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, you should also be able to cough up a
championship once every 90 years. But these remain the Cubs. After
running in second place of the NL Central much of the first two
months, the Cubs entered the week with a 20-33 record since June 1,
delivering them to last place and 13 1/2 games back as the weekend
opened.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Sammy Sosa was king of the north side, the NL MVP
who elevated his team to its first postseason appearance in eight
years. This summer, the pitching evaporated the moment the scalpel
touched Kerry Wood's elbow. With 16 players 30 or older, the Cubs
look old and play older. And for the third time in three years, the
populace is calling for Riggleman's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stuck in the middle of trying to save some respect for
ourselves,'' reliever Rod Beck said, ``but we now live in the land
of misfit toys.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the weekend series with the New York Mets, the Cubs just
returned from a 1-5 trip through Montreal and New York that saw
them score only 13 runs. They opened their current 13-game
homestand by blowing a 7-2 lead in Friday's loss to the Mets and
things are only going to get tougher. Houston and Arizona close out
the homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers Kevin Tapani and Steve Trachsel, a combined 34-18 last
season, are 9-22. Imported closer Rick Aguilera has been a disaster
with a 6.08 ERA and four blown saves since arriving in May.
</P>
<P>
   The offense has consisted of Sosa, Henry Rodriguez and Glenallen
Hill, who entered the weekend with 72 home runs combined. When one
of them leaves the park, Chicago is 34-18. When none of them homer,
the Cubs are 13-35.
</P>
<P>
   The lightning rod is the low-key Riggleman, who finished third
to San Diego's Bruce Bochy and Houston's Larry Dierker in manager
of the year voting last season. His contract runs through 2000 and
he has received blessings from general manager Ed Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   But with a 6-9 start in the second half and losing series to
Montreal and Kansas City, the crowds are turning against Riggleman
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell plumbers how to fix a sink or electricians how to
get power going in their homes,'' Riggleman said. But (fans and
media) can criticize me because we are in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what we are as a ballclub and where I stand as a
manager. To ever have the security that Tony La Russa, Jim Leyland
and Bobby Cox have, you have to have a track record of winning. I
don't have it, so I completely understand my vulnerability.''

 &HT;    Injured Falcons adjusting
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Every pro football player fears it. Many have
endured some form of it. A few never make it back once it happens.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons running back Gary Downs was relatively upbeat Saturday,
however, a day after injuring his right knee and likely scuttling
his season.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie reserve center Todd McClure, who almost certainly will
miss the season after tearing his right anterior cruciate knee
ligament in the same practice, seemed to still be in shock.
</P>
<P>
   As Downs carried the ball through the line Friday morning in the
second practice of training camp, a falling defensive lineman
leg-whipped the sixth-year pro.
</P>
<P>
   Downs planted his right leg, and then screamed while his knee
hyperextended the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could kind of see it coming, but I couldn't do anything,''
he said Saturday. ``My leg was going to plant. I knew it was bad,
but I was hoping it wasn't too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Downs will have surgery Monday or Tuesday to repair a torn
lateral collateral ligament. It's a rare injury that team
orthopedist Andrew Bishop said normally requires a four-month
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   If surgery reveals less of a tear than Bishop anticipates, Downs
could come back sooner.
</P>
<P>
   He has just one carry for two yards in two seasons for the
Falcons, but has been an immensely valuable special teams player.
</P>
<P>
   A Columbus native, he also figured that while Jamal Anderson
continued to hold out, he could could show his stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a chance to showcase my ability,'' he said.
``I've been a special teams leader, but I... just kind of thought,
`I'm going to go for it.' That's just the breaks. It was my turn to
go in.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the injury, defensive end Lester Archambeau
screamed across the field, ``Hang in there, Downsy.''
</P>
<P>
   Running back Byron Hanspard, who is trying to return from a
serious knee injury that caused him to miss all of last season,
hovered briefly nearby.
</P>
<P>
   As he got in a cart, fullback Bob Christian, who injured a knee
last Dec. 13 that kept him out of the final two games and the
postseason, offered Downs consolation.
</P>
<P>
   Not much later, practice resumed, and Downs was in the locker
room, sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   McClure was injured in almost exactly the same spot on the field
when a defensive linemen crashed into the side of his leg. He
returned briefly, but later hobbled off for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strained the medial collateral at LSU, and (Dr. Bishop)
thinks maybe I damaged the ACL at that time,'' McClure said. ``It's
not etched in stone yet. They'll do surgery in a couple weeks, and
see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves is ready to count McClure out for the season,
and the eam probably won't sign another offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Deep snapper Adam Schreiber, starting left guard Calvin Collins,
who started 13 games at center in '97, and perhaps reserve right
guard Bob Hallen will share backup center duties.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the team signed former Falcons running back Harold
Green. He was waived after last season, when the nine-year
veteran's role dwindled almost to nothing as Anderson took over
most of what had been Green's third-down duties in '97.
</P>
<P>
   The move saved $825,000 against the Falcons' salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Green's one-year deal with signing bonus and incentives might be
worth more than $500,000. The Falcons are about $250,000 under the
salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   The team won't put Downs on injured reserve until knowing how
long he'll be out.

 &HT;    Killer's, victims' families left to wonder
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford and Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While relatives of Mark O. Barton's victims continued
making funeral and memorial arrangements Saturday and wondered why
tragedy had struck so close to home, family members of the victim
closest to Barton _ his wife, Leigh Ann _ struggled with questions
and doubts of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Ann Barton's grandmother, Pauline Vandiver, 78, sat with
family in the antique-packed living room of her home in Macon, Ga.,
remembering the soft-spoken woman who was killed by a man they
never quite trusted.
</P>
<P>
   As family and friends delivered foil-wrapped banana bread and a
fruit basket tied with a yellow ribbon, the Vandivers struggled
with whether they should have foreseen the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Lewis, Leigh Ann Barton's cousin, said the whole family
was aware that Mark Barton was a suspect in the 1993 slaying of his
first wife, Debra Barton, and her mother, Eloise Powell Spivey.
Several family members, including Lewis, thought he must have done
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to ride in the car with him all the way back to Macon,''
Lewis said, recalling her trip from the Atlanta wedding to Macon
for a reception while Mark Barton's children rode with Leigh Ann.
``I was so scared, you know, if he killed his wife. He didn't talk
the whole time. Not one word.''
</P>
<P>
   According to family members, Joe Vandiver told his daughter
outright that he believed Mark Barton was guilty of the crimes.
Leigh Ann insisted he wasn't, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, they laughed as they told stories about Leigh Ann
sucking her thumb as a little girl, and they fought back tears as
Vandiver remembered a gift basket of lavender goodies Leigh Ann
brought for what turned out to be her last visit home _ Mother's
Day. They described her as lady-like with a Christian school
background. And she never forgot a family event.
</P>
<P>
   But they also remembered a woman torn between a husband she
wanted to leave and the children she wanted to stay with. Leigh Ann
didn't want to have children, but she came to love Mark Barton's
son and daughter like they were her own, her grandmother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kids thought more of her than they did him,''
great-uncle Larry Vandiver said of Leigh Ann, 27, and Mark Barton,
44. ``They called her Momma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `If I ever leave Mark I'm going to take these
kids,''' Pauline Vandiver recalled her granddaughter saying during
the Mothers' Day trip.
</P>
<P>
   In a note left for authorities, Barton said he killed Leigh Ann
on Tuesday and placed her body in a closet of her Stockbridge
apartment. Barton said he killed his two children, Matthew, 11, and
Mychelle, 8, the next evening. One day later, he went on a shooting
spree through two Buckhead office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Ann Barton's family learned with television viewers that
she and the children were dead. They will bury her at 1 p.m. today
in Macon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality's setting in since they got the body home,'' said
Vandiver.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with metro Atlantans trying to cope with the latest
blast of violence, the sad parade of funerals and memorials
continued. Pastors and rabbis were trying to draw some sense from
these tragic events. And many people were gathering for comfort,
healing and reflection on one man's bizarre behavior.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the friends and family of Dean Delawalla, 52,
gathered for his funeral services at the National Cremation Society
Memorial Center in Lilburn. The former attorney and businessman, a
devout Muslim, had been preparing for his daughter Shahala's
birthday when he was killed in the storm of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service is set for today for Allen Charles Tenenbaum,
a 48-year-old father of three. More than 1,000 people attended his
funeral Friday. The memorial service will be at noon today at
Congregation Or VeShalom, where Tenenbaum served as president. His
chair at the pulpit will be covered for at least a month in his
memory, said Jack Arogeti, vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodness was his nature,'' Arogeti said.
</P>
<P>
   The immense outpouring of sympathy for the nine people shot to
death prompted the scheduling of a memorial service Saturday at the
Grand Hyatt Hotel in Buckhead. Afterward, a walk was planned down
Piedmont Road to the two office buildings _ Securities Centre and
the Piedmont Center _ where the killings occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements for Barton himself have been kept secret by
the family.
</P>
<P>
   At the Henry County apartment where Barton killed his wife and
two children, mourners placed a half-dozen small flower bouquets at
the front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rest in Peace, Leigh Ann, Matthew and Michelle,'' read a note
left in a hanging basket outside. ``May God be with You,'' was the
inscription on a torn peace of paper in a potted plant.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, the only activity inside the apartment was
cleanup by a crime scene crew. Three employees of Metro Crime Scene
Disposal spent three hours removing pillows and blankets. They also
cut out sections of mattresses and carpet for transportation to
medical incinerators.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was very little bloodshed'' at the apartment, said
company representative Gordy Powell. He said the scene was
consistent with Barton's note describing how he beat the children
unconscious, then drowned them.
</P>
<P>
   He described the apartment as a neat, ``middle-income family
setting'' that reflected a woman's taste in ``country decor.''
Among the possessions left behind, to be claimed by family members,
were some Happy Meals toys.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said things are returning to normal at the apartment
complex, as the numbers of sightseers and camera crews dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   At a gas station a mile from the Stockbridge apartment, a clerk
who recognized Barton from news photos said he would frequently buy
$1 or $2 worth of gas and complain in a serious tone that the
station's prices were too high.
</P>
<P>
   Some metro Atlanta religious leaders said they would discuss the
slayings in services today. The Rev. Randy Stamper, considering
what he may tell his assembly at Faith Free Full Gospel Church in
Buford, commented on Barton: ``Some people seem to lose all hope,
and they don't have any major foundation in life but money. When he
lost that, he lost it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Atlanta's grief reached to Littleton, Colo., where
four months earlier 13 people were killed at Columbine High School.
The two gun-crazed students, like Barton, also committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one sickening tragedy after another,'' said Rick
Castaldo, who moved with his second wife across the country to be
with his 17-year-old son, Richard, left paralyzed from the
Columbine attack.
</P>
<P>
   Even some people in the Denver area whose families were not
directly affected by the Columbine shootings said a familiar wave
of disbelief washed over them Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happening all over again in Atlanta and we still have no
answers in Littleton,'' said Katryn Stienmark, who works for St.
Frances Cabrini Catholic Church, the Littleton church where many
families and students sought solace and several of the slain were
eulogized. ``We're thinking, `My God!'''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, 10 people injured in the shootings remain
hospitalized, some in critical condition in intensive care units.
One wounded victim was released from the hospital Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Schimming, a branch manager for All-Tech, said the four
All-Tech employees still in the hospital are ``progressing. They're
still not out of the woods, but they're doing better.''

only his garden plot since he gave up his dream of farming to drive
a taxi. Defeated by an economy that has given little support to
enterprising farmers, Kitayev stuck it out for two seasons. Would

METS BEAT CUBS, 10-9  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Even though the Mets found themselves alone in first
place Saturday morning for the first time this late in a season in
nearly nine years, some of the players had other thoughts on their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Like Saturday night's midnight trading deadline, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Mike Piazza, tried not to think about the slumping
Atlanta Braves at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot of time left,'' Piazza said, hours after
he had hit his 21st home run to help the Mets come back from a
five-run deficit for a 10-9 victory over the Cubs on the hottest
day (103 degrees) of the year here.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Masato Yoshii, whose spot in the starting
rotation has become increasingly tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's asked me about anything,'' Yoshii said Friday,
sounding genuinely surprised when asked if he was worried that he
was headed for the bullpen. ``What's that all about?''
</P>
<P>
   He expressed no concern about the possibility of losing his job
as a starter. ``Even if I was told to go to the bullpen, why should
I be worried about it?'' Yoshii said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after allowing seven runs in one and a third innings, the
shortest outing by a Mets starter in nearly two years, Yoshii
seemed likely to lose his spot in the rotation, unless Kenny
Rogers' tight right hamstring prevents him from making his start
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny's leg has a lot of bearing on my decision right now,''
Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``That's my first priority.
Yoshii might come back on the fifth day.''
</P>
<P>
   That would happen only if Rogers needs Yoshii to substitute for
him, Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii, who was nearly demoted to the minor leagues after the
first month of the season only to pitch like the Mets' ace in May,
is on the downswing again.
</P>
<P>
   From June 11 to June 27, he allowed only 7 earned runs in 271/3
innings, a stingy 2.30 earned run average. Since then, he has had a
July to forget: 25 earned runs in 22 innings covering five starts.
That is a 10.23 e.r.a., lifting his season e.r.a. to 5.67, the
highest of anyone on the staff other than Bobby Jones, who has been
on the disabled list with shoulder soreness since May 23.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii's problem on Friday was with his control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left too many balls up,'' Piazza said. ``He didn't have
much movement. They were hitting a lot of his off-speed stuff. He
had no snap on his cut fastball. And his split-finger was
hanging.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, Yoshii was fine.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last season, however, Yoshii has benefited from some run
support. The Mets have actually won three of his five July starts.
And they won at Wrigley Field, on the hottest day most of them
could remember, by coming back after being down by 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the Braves lost to the Phillies in Atlanta and the
Mets were alone in first for the first time since September 1990.
Not only that, the Mets were also in first place at the same time
as the Yankees for the first time since July 27, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine has never finished a season in first place as a player
or a coach. With two months left in the season, he is tantalizingly
close.

AN INCOMPLETE SEASON LEAVES BROWN DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Just get me to Pedro Borbon'' was not the legacy
the Dodgers envisioned for Kevin Brown when they signed him last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Brown came here to give the bullpen the night off, to give the
fans a lift and to give the Dodgers a reason to strut. Instead, he
has given them something very incomplete, and it just isn't the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the money. If his contract upsets you, blame the team,
not him. It's not what he takes to the bank, it's what he takes to
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   That's why fans were booing Friday night when Davey Johnson came
to get him with two outs and one on in the eighth inning. They came
to see Brown give them a reason to care about the final two months
of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they got to watch Borbon and especially Jeff Shaw lead
an eighth-inning meltdown that turned the crowd of 45,839 into an
angry mob.
</P>
<P>
   All they ask is that Brown be Brown, as dominant a right-hander
as the there has been in baseball the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   When he pitches the way he did last Sunday in beating Randy
Johnson 2-1 in Arizona, the reasons for giving him the moon seem
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the June 4 game against the Angels with Mo Vaughn
walking to the plate with the game on the line, there weren't as
many boos as Friday, but there should have been. It might have been
the only Kodak moment the Dodgers had this year.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers needed to open the second half with conviction,
Brown lasted just 51/3 innings against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose 2.33 ERA the past three seasons is the best in
baseball, has not pitched into the ninth inning this season. He has
61 complete games in his career, but the only one this year was an
eight-inning 3-2 loss in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   No one is asking him to go the distance every fifth day. That
isn't realistic. He has pitched superbly much of the time but has
never made the statement that you can't mess with his team.
</P>
<P>
   If this was a health issue, that would be one thing. Injuries
seem to have gotten Eric Young off the hook for an unproductive
season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said earlier this season that Brown was feeling the
weight of expectations after signing the seven-year, $105 million
contract. All year, Johnson has said he gets a little concerned
when Brown gets to 105 pitches. Friday, he also said there have
been a few games where he left Brown in too long.
</P>
<P>
   Brown clearly is disappointed with the dysfunctional family he
joined. He couldn't be blamed for thinking he made a mistake
joining a team that needs yet another overhaul. But he doesn't let
out those kinds of thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   That's his right, but he has remained aloof from teammates. With
this bunch, that is not OK.
</P>
<P>
   He has never connected with his teammates, who were desperate
for guidance. He has never made the Dodgers his team the way Pedro
Martinez has done in Boston and Curt Schilling has done in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson elected to skip Friday's start to give his arm an
extra day's rest, some thought he was ducking Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The truth was Johnson had thrown 138 and 143 pitches in his last
two starts. Earlier this season, he was the victim of four
consecutive shutouts. If anybody had a right to be upset with
teammates, it was Johnson, who just shrugged and helped put the
Diamondbacks back in first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he pitches, it gives us a lift physically and emotionally
for days,'' said Luis Gonzalez, who helped Johnson on Saturday with
a two-run homer. ``When he is out there, there is an electricity.
We haven't always been there for him this season, but he is there
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been nice to hear the Dodgers say something like
that about Brown. Gary Sheffield, who played with him in Florida
when the Marlins won the World Series in 1997, sounded more like an
accountant than a teammate when talking about Brown's game on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has made the tremendous investment with him,''
Sheffield said, ``and you don't want to jeopardize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. &QL;

METS GAMBLE WITH ROGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kenny Rogers began his second tour in New York on
Tuesday with a 9-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates, but the New
York Mets also know he brought some baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Although Oakland is very much in the AL wild-card hunt, Rogers
told GM Billy Beane it was time to go. Rogers reportedly cleaned
out his locker before the A's recent road trip and returned to
Tampa, not Oakland, after the trade to get his family. Veteran
players told Beane they wanted Rogers out.
</P>
<P>
   Mets GM Steve Phillips said he was aware of Rogers' differences
with players in Oakland. Rogers punched one teammate with his
pitching hand in a card-game dispute and destroyed a bank of phones
in 3Com Park over poor defense that cost him a four-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fights all time,'' said Phillips, who has seen manager
Bobby Valentine and Bobby Bonilla exchange words and nearly punches
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' playoff chances are far better than the A's. But when
Rogers played for the Yankees, he was overwhelmed by the big city.
He also has never pitched in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny never really wanted to be here,'' Beane said. ``At
times, this became a distraction. I had hoped the continued
improvement of the team would help rope him into the momentum, but
that didn't happen.'' &QL; 
On the mark
</P>
<P>
   Cubs first baseman Mark Grace knew long before Saturday's trade
deadline that he wasn't going anywhere. He is a free agent at the
end of the year and any new team would have wanted to negotiate a
new deal rather than risk losing him after the season. That never
happened. But even if Grace remains in a Cubs uniform to collect
his 2,000th hit early next month, there is no guarantee he will be
back next season. His agent, Barry Axelrod, is aware that the
Giants' J.T. Snow signed a four-year, $24 million contract Friday.
The Cubs haven't talked contract since Grace rejected an offer
three months ago. ``Hopefully something will get done,'' said
Grace, who is earning $4.1 million this year. ``If you know
anything about the Cubs' history, it's usually down to the last
minute. It's been that way with me. It was that way with Greg
Maddux, Rick Sutcliffe, Ryne Sandberg, Andre Dawson. The only guy
they've gotten taken care of early was Sammy (Sosa).'' &QL; 
Something in return
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Diamondbacks are ecstatic with new closer Matt
Mantei, who had seven saves in his first three weeks with the club.
But Florida, which received top pitching prospect Brad Penny for
Mantei, also is pleased with the other pitcher it got in the deal,
Vladimir Nunez. A reliever with the Diamondbacks, Nunez was
impressive Monday against Philadelphia and pitched Saturday vs.
Pittsburgh. Nunez is on a strict pitch count to strengthen his arm
for starting. He was limited to 65 pitches Monday and 80 on
Saturday. He has taken the place of Livan Hernandez, a good friend
since the two pitched together on the Cuban junior national team.
He now has a locker next to the two lockers Hernandez had before he
was traded to San Francisco. ``They have to close off those lockers
now,'' Nunez said. ``Those are history.'' &QL; 
Getting a chance
</P>
<P>
   Steve Schrenk, a 30-year-old rookie and father of five, made his
first major-league start Wednesday for Philadelphia in place of
Curt Schilling (strained right bicep) and pitched six scoreless
innings in a 9-4 victory over Florida. Schrenk was a 24-year-old
right-hander on the fast track to the Chicago White Sox starting
rotation when Phillies manager Terry Francona last managed him.
Schrenk had gone 5-1 with a 1.17 ERA in eight starts for Francona's
Double-A Birmingham club. But after undergoing two shoulder
operations, he quickly went from big-league prospect to
minor-league journeyman, passing through four organizations in
three seasons before signing as a minor-league free agent with the
Phillies last October. &QL;

BRACING FOR A WILD FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Reaching the wild card means finishing with the
league's fourth-best record, not necessarily doing well in your own
division. So it really doesn't matter that the Toronto Blue Jays
are 1-8 against their wild card-rival Boston Red Sox or 0-6 against
the East-leading New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   They entered Saturday's game against Detroit a half-game ahead
the Red Sox for the wild card and have become serious contenders
due to an 18-7 July, which tied a club record for victories in the
month.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they have added first baseman David Segui in a trade from
Seattle, but there is a chance the move could do more harm than
good. Switch-hitting Carlos Delgado, who has 26 homers and 89 RBI,
had played every inning of every game at first before the trade and
wants to stay.
</P>
<P>
   He and Shawn Green (30 HR, 86 RBI) have anchored the offense.
Green extended his hitting streak Friday to 27 games with a home
run and is batting .329. But Segui's .996 lifetime fielding
percentage is second only to Steve Garvey. Team chemistry could
play a factor in this race. &QL; 
Shutting down
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by a right elbow injury that has ended his season,
Red Sox closer Tom Gordon has joined a growing list of Boston
players to question the medical treatment he has received from team
doctor Arthur Pappas, who also is a limited partner with the club.
Recently, Gordon said he spoke with renowned specialist James
Andrews by phone and that Andrews believes a slight ligament tear
in the pitcher's elbow has not healed. Gordon pointed out that the
news was inconsistent was an assessment Pappas made earlier this
month, when Gordon underwent a MRI to monitor the progress of his
injury. In any case, Gordon will need surgery to correct the
problem and will be out for the remainder of this season and,
perhaps, part or all of next year. ``I think it's a conflict of
interest,'' Gordon's agent, Rick Thurman, said of Pappas' dual
roles. ``I think it's ridiculous.'' &QL; 
Juan gone?
</P>
<P>
   AL MVP Juan Gonzalez is an angry young man. After refusing to
play in the All-Star Game, Gonzalez has done some strange stuff,
like beat up a water cooler after a frustrating at-bat. He also
flung away his batting gloves in disgust one night after Ivan
Rodriguez failed to score from second with one out on a bloop
single to right. Rodriguez had to hold to see if it would be
caught. Last Monday, the Rangers decided to wear their old 1989-93
uniforms for the Hall of Fame Game in honor of Nolan Ryan. But
Gonzalez said his pants didn't fit so he refused to dress, even
though he wasn't going to play anyway because of a jammed wrist.
There are rumors he has marital problems with Latin singing star
Olga Tanon. There is also speculation he is unhappy the Rangers
have yet to offer him a contract beyond 2000. &QL; 
Not Taylor made
</P>
<P>
   Closer Billy Taylor was one of the reasons the A's have hung
around in the West. He had 22 saves and a 2.41 ERA in the first
half. Since the break, however, Taylor's game is a mess _ 0-1 with
three blown saves and a 17.36 ERA in six games. ``I feel good
physically,'' Taylor said. ``I'm just in a slump. I had a great
half-season, but now every bad pitch I make I get burned on. I'm
not going to get my head down, though. I'm going to work through
it.'' Oakland also is a little worried about slumping shortstop
Miguel Tejada, who was batting .278 on June 23. Before hitting a
home run Friday night, Tejada had just eight hits in his last 57
at-bats (.140) and three hits in 33 at-bats (.091) on the
just-completed road trip. &QL;

RED SOX BEAT YANKEES, 6-5  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Most of the Yankees did not see what happened in left
field on the last play of Saturday's 6-5 loss to the Red Sox. Under
the low ceiling of the Yankees' dugout, they could see Shane
Spencer chasing a lazy fly ball toward the left-field corner, until
both were hidden from view by the stands.
</P>
<P>
   And then they heard Fenway Park explode in joy, saw Jose
Offerman sprinting home with the winning run, and the Yankees in
the dugout were turning and asking each other: what happened?
</P>
<P>
   The whole tedious game, played under the last July sun of the
hottest summer in memory, seemed like this to the Yankees: they
battered the Red Sox in the early innings _ pounding them with
hits. Roger Clemens, pitching in a Yankees cap in Fenway for the
first time, had appeared to overcome his usual big-game adrenaline
rush. And then the Yankees blew a couple of leads and just lost
sight of victory. The Yankees (62-40), who beat Boston on Friday,
will play the third and final game of the series Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen Roger with 2-0 leads, and then 5-2 leads,'' said
George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, who watched and
grinned and grimaced from the seats next to his team's dugout. ``I
was ready to say the ball game is over. But it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it didn't, and the Yankees blamed themselves as Derek Jeter
and Tino Martinez and others sat around a table afterward,
recalling some of the afternoon's low points _ and for the Yankees,
most of them occurred when big innings fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't put the game away,'' said Scott Brosius, the
Yankees' third baseman. ``They kind of bent all day but didn't
break, and it was just enough for them to creep back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, who led off Friday's victory with a home run,
started Saturday's game the same way; two batters later, Paul
O'Neill homered as well. Thereafter, their rallies were stunted:
Brosius singled opening the second and was thrown out stealing.
Knoblauch slammed a ball off the left-field wall to lead off the
third and was thrown out trying to stretch his hit into a double.
Two runners reached base subsequently, before Martinez took a
called third strike to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The crossroads in this game came in the fourth. The Yankees had
four straight hits to start the inning _ they would collect 13 hits
in the first six innings. The Yankees led by 4-2, there were two
runs in, two on base, nobody out and Boston's Brian Rose was
getting shelled, every hit a missile.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch turned and tried bunting toward third, a surprise and
a nice idea; either he would get an infield hit or advance the
runners into scoring position for Jeter. Knoblauch popped up his
bunt, however, for the first out, and on the very next pitch, Jeter
grounded into a double play. The Red Sox had bent, and had not
broken.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens, the former Boston pitcher, was bending in the heat.
Sweat poured off his face, down his arms, onto his wrists and
hands, and he could not grip his split-fingered fastball, a pitch
he usually uses to finish off opposing hitters with two strikes.
``It just took the splitter away from me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His pitch count mounted quickly, he was having trouble throwing
strikes, and the Fenway crowd booed him at every opportunity. (Joe
Torre, the Yankees' manager, noted before the game that Clemens'
portrait on the facing of the second deck here, added because he
was named one of baseball's 100 greatest players, pictures Clemens
in a Yankees cap.) They derisively chanted his name when he fell
into trouble in the fifth inning, the cry of ``Roger'' mournfully
sarcastic. ``We had a lot of Yankees' fans here,'' Clemens said
with a straight face, when asked about the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra singled to lead off the sixth, and Clemens was
relieved by Jason Grimsley; Boston scored a run in that inning,
then tied the score at 5-5 in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman was first to hit for the Red Sox in the ninth, against
Ramiro Mendoza. He slammed a line drive to center, the ball
bounding into wide open space in center field, for a triple. The
Yankees' infield moved in, with John Valentin at the plate, trying
to cut off the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin pulled a high fly down the third-base line. Brosius was
playing close to the line and when it passed him, he would say
later, it was headed far into foul territory. Valentin thought so,
too. ``As soon as I hit it,'' Valentin said later, ``I thought it
was foul. When it didn't hook, I knew it was going to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans in the stands along the left-field line stood and
watched Spencer charge toward the line. All along the way, he was
assessing the situation. The runner at third base, Offerman, is
fast, and if Spencer caught the ball in the left-field corner, then
Offerman would tag up and score easily.
</P>
<P>
   So Spencer went to the spot where he thought the ball might come
down, and hoped. He hoped the ball would go foul. He hoped an
anxious fan would reach out and touch the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The left-field corner cannot be seen from the Yankees' dugout,
because of the way the stands jut out, nearly meeting the
left-field foul line. David Cone watched Valentin, who stood at the
plate, waited, then began to move toward first and then run hard,
and then the Yankees knew. Spencer had let the ball drop in fair
territory _ the right play, the Yankees all agreed. The wrong
result. &QL;

BIRTHPLACE OF GOLF MUST DECIDE ON PLANS FOR EXPLOITATION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland _ In the 15th century, there were so many
golf balls flying around the open, windswept fields here that King
James II briefly banned the game on Sundays because his archers
couldn't practice.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, it would have been heresy to suggest, as
the king did in 1457, that there were too many golf courses and too
many golfers in the town that is the birthplace of golf.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just what some of the 14,500 residents here believe,
and they have mounted what may be a quixotic attempt to prevent
their quaint, medieval university town from being turned into what
they see as a tacky golf theme park with perpetual gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the town's community council will decide whether to
launch a legal challenge to block the construction of a hotel, two
courses, and a conference center on what used to be Kingask farm, a
500-acre tract that runs along St. Andrews Bay with breathtaking
views of the town and the Firth of Tay.
</P>
<P>
   There are already six golf courses in St. Andrews, including the
proudly public Old Course, arguably the world's most famous, and
the snooty private Royal &AMP; Ancient Golf Club, headquarters of the
game's governing body. About 300,000 visitors come here every year,
many of them to enter the daily lottery for the privilege of
playing the Old Course. About one in five gets picked.
</P>
<P>
   As the popularity of golf continues to soar internationally,
there is no shortage of developers who believe that the demand to
play here will only increase. Besides the Kingask development,
there are two other proposals in the pipeline that would add three
more courses near the town.
</P>
<P>
   For Frank Riddell, the mild-mannered chemistry professor who has
emerged as the unlikely leader of those trying to stop the Kingask
project, the implications are stark.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't stop this one, we can't stop any,'' he said. ``The
town as we know it will cease to exist. The goose that lays the
golden golf egg will be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   For Iain MacKinnon, the local representative of St. Andrews Bay
Development Co., the American-based company that is behind the $80
million Kingask project, the 300 jobs and what he called ``a
first-class facility'' far outweigh claims about the streets and
the Old Course being clogged with more golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Riddell and MacKinnon live four doors away from each other. They
are not on speaking terms.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this is just a variation on the NIMBY argument,
altered slightly to NOMBN, Not On My Back Nine. But on closer
inspection, this is not just a battle over a few new golf courses
but a war over who owns St. Andrews, and it is a war of epic
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   It has split families, made neighbors enemies, and reignited the
smoldering class warfare epitomized by the schism between
university types and townies. It has, says Craig Nisbet, who runs
the weekly newspaper, the St. Andrews Citizen, ``divided this town
like never before.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a small, friendly place, where everybody knows everybody
else's business, or thinks they do. There are two levels of
conversation: public and private. Private ones reveal the extent of
the split here. People's English accents are commented on, as is
the length of time they have lived here. Class distinctions are
held up as either an indictment or validation of character.
</P>
<P>
   Those most opposed to or most in favor of the Kingask
development say they do not want to cast aspersions on the motives
of others, but they invariably do.
</P>
<P>
   Those opposed to the development are derided as hypocritical
snobs who are biting that hand that has long fed St. Andrews. They
are accused of wearing rose-colored glasses, of extolling the
town's university and medieval architecture while ignoring the
empty shops and shabby apartments where students are crammed in to
maximize profits for university-connected landlords.
</P>
<P>
   Those who support the Kingask project are dismissed as shallow,
money-hungry Judases, willing to sell the town's character for a
few pieces of silver.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the stereotypes, however, are strongly held beliefs on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his modest university office, somewhere between a
driver and a three-wood from the Old Course, Riddell talks
passionately about preserving the character of the town, one that
is as much if not more rooted in its medieval heritage as in its
place in golf history. As chairman of the community council, he has
molded a grass-roots movement that looks at something other than
the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   St. Andrews was once the ecclesiastical capital of Scotland, and
its university was founded in 1410, the first in Scotland and the
third in Britain, after Oxford and Cambridge. Like Oxford and
Cambridge, the St. Andrews campus dominates the town, its buildings
extending everywhere. Those buildings and other examples of
medieval architecture are already crumbling under the weight of
tourist traffic, Riddell says.
</P>
<P>
   The Fife Council, which represents the region, overrode local
opposition to the Kingask project, pointing to the 300 jobs that
will be created. But Riddell and others accuse the council of
ignoring its own standards on controlling development in the rush
to create jobs. They point bitterly to the fact that none of the
Fife Council members who approved the plan come from St. Andrews.
And they say that because there are only about 650 people in the
St. Andrews area unemployed, the jobs aren't needed here.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should put it in another part of Fife that really needs
the jobs,'' said Riddell.
</P>
<P>
   Riddell bristles at suggestions the opponents are snobs. If
anything, he says, they are looking out for the little guy. He says
the new hotel and conference center will attract mainly rich
Americans whose presence will make it even harder for locals to get
on the Old Course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scotland is a very egalitarian country,'' he said. ``They're
going to come in here and push locals aside. It's going to create
resentment. The only reason the people behind Kingask are coming
here is to cash in on St. Andrews' name. All this is about is
money. There are things more important than money, such as quality
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his Jeep wagon, dragging on a Camel and looking out
over the 18th fairway of the Old Course, MacKinnon is candid in
reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the accusation is we're trying to make money, we stand
guilty as charged,'' he said. ``What's wrong with that? This town
exists on tourism and inward investment. There is nothing for the
young people here except the hospitality industry. I know because
my two daughters have had to move away to find work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is not a little enclave, sheltered from the rest of
the world. It has to deal with the real world, real economics. It
has marketed itself as the home of golf, and it has been
successful. This is a project of the highest quality. There's no
public funding. It can only be good for the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the shops and restaurants here cater to golfers, and it
is hard to find people in them who oppose the Kingask project, or
think St. Andrews is on the verge of turning into a tacky golf
theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Myles, 38, sells sweaters and other clothing at the
Johnstons Woolen Mills, just around the corner from the Old Course.
Most of her customers are golfers. She thinks the opposition is
small but loud, limited to those who can afford to live with the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think 300 more people will hurt the town, but I think
they will help the town,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Taylor, 18, who works at Aikman's Bistro, says he does not
oppose the project in principle, but thinks the process has been
flawed. He sees a generational gap in the dispute, with older
people opposed and his generation ``generally supportive or
indifferent.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I don't think the public has been informed
about the process as it should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   That process is the last hope of the opponents. If they can show
the approval was legally flawed, they could put the Kingask project
on hold.
</P>
<P>
   It may be too late, however, to stop the development, or repair
the rifts in familial relations. When Ted Brocklebank used the
local paper's letters page to vent his opposition to the project,
his cousin, Dave Seeley, used the same forum to denounce him as a
hypocrite. At the time, Brocklebank was a candidate for the
Scottish Parliament. He lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``His own cousin attacking him didn't help,'' said Nisbet.
``They haven't spoken to each other for months.''
</P>
<P>
   As Nisbet sees it, ``The arguments will go on for years, even
after the place is up and running.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all golf war stories, this one has legs.

SANTA ANITA CEO WAS RAISED ON HORSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ The Sylmar earthquake of 1971 forever changed
the course of Lonny Powell's life.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a jockey who rode the Southern California circuit,
Powell, 39, recently took over as Santa Anita Park's president and
chief executive officer. He was born in Newhall and raised in San
Fernando, but Powell is a relative newcomer to the local racing
scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved after the 1971 earthquake.... It had everything to do
with the move,'' Powell said. ``My parents had become so gun shy
and the earthquake did damage our home in San Fernando really bad.
So we ended up in Idaho.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the area didn't mean the Powell family lost touch with
local developments, and Lonny has spent the better part of his
adult life on a path back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of my dad's work was here in California. He was
at that time the manager of the Jockey's Guild,'' Powell said.
``The only reason we ended up in Idaho was that he liked to hunt
and he had the type of job that as long as he could get to an
airport he could live basically wherever he wanted....
</P>
<P>
   ``We still kept the strong ties with the racing industry. It
kept me well-wired.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this month, Powell was president and CEO at Turf Paradise
in Phoenix. His Santa Anita hiring came on the heels of the
resignations of Santa Anita president William C. Baker and
executive vice president and general manager Cliff Goodrich.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's duties at Santa Anita will encompass the
responsibilities of both Goodrich and Baker. Powell also will be
vice president of Ventures, a corporation formed by Santa Anita
owner Frank Stronach that will be involved in real estate
development and gambling activities in Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
   Stronach said he hired Powell because of his youth and
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt maybe I need somebody young with a new, innovative
approach,'' Stronach said. ``I'm very optimistic that Lonny will do
a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   Stronach said Powell impressed him with his open mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's open to new ideas,'' Stronach said. ``So I want
to have somebody (who) is open _ no preconceived ideas to say what
can we do to make this place exciting and get people here.''
</P>
<P>
   Glad to be home, Powell just might have the formula for success.
His credentials certainly are unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a jockey, my uncle was a trainer,'' Powell said.
``My father-in-law was a trainer, my wife galloped and was a
trainer. Every job I've had since high school has been at the
racetrack _ going from cleaning the jocks' room to mowing the
paddock lawns to working as an assistant starter in the starting
gate.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell also has the educational background. He attended the
University of Arizona and studied in its prestigious racetrack
program.
</P>
<P>
   Before his five-year stint at Turf Paradise, Powell served as
president of Multnomah Greyhound Park, executive vice president and
chief operating officer of Longacres, general manager of the
Woodlands and director of the University of Arizona's racetrack
industry program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very fortunate and blessed that every job I've had
in the business I've exceeded my expectations and my employers'
(expectations),'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita might pose some special problems for Powell. There
is grumbling among old-timers in the racing community about
Powell's perceived lack of experience. Stronach has encountered
some resistance over his sweeping plans for change at the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Powell isn't worried. He's optimistic about his future and the
future of horse racing at Santa Anita Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old saying that the pioneers take all the arrows,''
Powell said. ``I'm definitely up to the task. I use the word
`jacked' a lot.... I truly am. I mean, I'm jacked about the whole
thing _ geared up, fired up, however you want to put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be here at the pinnacle of racing. I'm excited
about the future that lies ahead for this facility.''

INKSTER FALLS BEHIND DAVIES IN BID FOR YEAR'S THIRD MAJOR  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRIDDIS, Alberta _ If Juli Inkster is to win her third major of
the year, she will have to catch Laura Davies.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster fell four strokes back Saturday as Davies shot a
three-under-par 69. Davies used her length to overpower most of the
par 5's and held a two-stroke lead over Dawn Coe-Jones of Canada
after the third round of the du Maurier Classic Saturday. Davies is
nine under par for the tournament (207), two strokes ahead of
Coe-Jones, who shot a 72 Saturday, and three strokes ahead of
Catriona Matthew of Scotland, who also shot a 72.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster struggled to a 74 Saturday, leaving her at five under
par for the tournament, tied with Karrie Webb, who shot a 66 to
roar into contention.
</P>
<P>
   The final round at Priddis Greens Golf and Country Club will be
pressure-packed for Inkster, who would clinch a spot in the LPGA
Hall of Fame with a victory. And Inkster is also trying to become
only the second player to win three of the four LPGA modern majors
in the same year, joining Pat Bradley, who won three majors in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   While Inkster was not thrilled with her performance Saturday,
she hardly saw her four-shot deficit as insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to shoot a real good score tomorrow, because
I don't see Laura backing up,'' said Inkster, who suffered her
first over-par round since April, ending a streak of 27 rounds. ``I
know I'm capable of shooting some good scores and getting that
putter going.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange round for Inkster, who struggled
uncharacteristically with her putter, even missing a two-footer on
No.12 for a costly bogey. Meanwhile, Davies was solid during a
round that included five birdies and just two bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Davies has won four career majors, including the 1996 du
Maurier, and she is usually a strong front-runner. Asked about her
strategy for Sunday, Davies planned to remain aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I shoot the best round tomorrow, then obviously I win,''
said Davies, who is from England. ``That is my plan tomorrow, get
out, make some birdies and not too many mistakes. Any of the names
on that leader board can go out and shoot the 66, 65. You can't sit
back, because the minute you sit back, somebody is going to go
straight past you.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies started the day at six under par, one stroke behind
Inkster and Coe-Jones, but she took the lead on the back nine with
a birdie on the par 5, 517-yard 12th hole. Capable of driving the
ball almost 300 yards in the 4,000-foot altitude, Davies can reach
all of the par 5 greens in two shots, while many of her competitors
need three shots. Davies birdied three of the five par 5 holes
Saturday, and she is eight under par on the par 5's for the
tournament. Meanwhile, Davies has played her short game smartly as
well, using irons off the tee for accuracy and avoiding the deep
rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The others stand up there with drivers, and they still have a
narrow target,'' Davies said. ``They can afford to miss the
fairways even less than I can.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Davies falters, a handful of players are waiting to take
advantage, including Webb, the tour's leading money-winner, who has
won five times this year but has yet to win a major. Webb played
aggressively off the tee, then made putts once she reached the
green.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my position, I had to do what I did or I didn't have a
chance of winning,'' said Webb, who started the day at one over
par, eight strokes off the lead. ``Today, I rolled the first putt
in, then took it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Coe-Jones will have the gallery's support Sunday as a
Canadian, and she hoped to use that as inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope there are a lot of people out there,'' said Coe-Jones.
``Hopefully I will make lots of putts and make them scream really
loud.''
</P>
<P>
   But Inkster will remain the focal point of the tournament, still
hoping to add another victory to an already remarkable year.
Saturday, Inkster was not at her best. But she hoped that he was
saving her best for last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been the leader, I've been in the hunt, and now I'm
coming from behind,'' Inkster said. ``If you can win three, you
might as well do it a little different each time.''

SLATER CHASES RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. _ Kelly Slater's surfing scene wasn't
unique to him. The six-time world champion repeatedly slashed
across waves, rode them to shore and relished the raucous support
from the Huntington Beach crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Slater scored 24.10, the highest of any surfer in Saturday's
Gotcha Pro, to beat Australian Todd Prestage and advance to today's
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   But while the scene wasn't unique to Slater, the scenario is.
Slater, who's endured a high-profile lifestyle that included dating
Baywatch's Pamela Anderson and starting a rock band, is off
surfing's World Championship Tour. The Floridian has planned to
compete in just two WCT events this year the Gotcha Pro and Pipe
Masters Championship in Banzai Pipeline, Hawaii. Slater is
considered ``semi-retired,'' but he may have shown he still could
be the world's top ranked surfer if he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a goal,'' Slater said. ``I've won at least one event on
the tour for the past seven years, and I'd like to keep that going.
But now, I only have two chances to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Slater is chasing Tom Curren's record of winning a WCT event for
10 consecutive years. Winning off the tour could be more impressive
than on tour because it shows the surfer can periodically bring out
his surfing skills when needed. Slater has done that at Huntington,
while implementing old strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found being on tour, that it is best to build momentum
throughout the contest,'' Slater said. ``Sometimes you can psyche
out your opponent if you keep getting better scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Prestage wasn't necessarily psyched out, but the Australian had
an uncharacteristic two wipe outs in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Slater competes against Brazilian Fabio Gouveia today in the
quarterfinals, which start at 9 a.m. The semifinals and finals
follow today.
</P>
<P>
   Gouveia is one of three Brazilians in the quarterfinals. So is
Neco Padaratz, who has become the talk of the competition after
knocking out Mark Occhilupo, Mick Campbell and Renan Rocha.
</P>
<P>
   Padaratz, 22, has not granted interviews throughout the
tournament. He is a wild-card entry who was ranked as high as 10th
last year on the WCT. This year, he is trying to rejoin the tour
after leaving it last season to spent time with his wife and
newborn. With dyed blond hair and a piercing of a blue spike under
his lip, Padaratz rode the best wave for the second successive day
and scored a 9.0.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a quickie, but he's still pretty young,'' Slater said of
Padaratz. ``The main thing he has to focus on is smoothing out his
surfing.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Ribas is another Brazilian who is surfing strongly. He
knocked out Curren Saturday. Ribas, a small-wave specialist, said
he is accustomed to Huntington's conditions, sans the cold water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot from Tom Curren,'' Ribas said. ``He's one
of my favorite surfers. I still have all of his videos at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Curren, who was admitted to the Gotcha Pro as a legend, said he
was disappointed with being knocked out, but didn't feel he had a
bad performance. If he made mistake, it was taking a wave early
that wasn't big enough, which gave Ribas the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not really a difference,'' the 35-year-old Curren said
about his surfing now compared with 10 years ago. ``The boards are
different. That's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   How Padaratz fares against Australian Michael Lowe and how Ribas
does against Aussie Nathan Webster are of interest. Another curious
heat could be Hawaiian Sunny Garcia against San Clemente's Shea
Lopez, who won last week's U.S. Open of Surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Andy Irons won both competitions, so Lopez could
replicate that. ``It's still there in the memory,'' Lopez said
about last week. ``Trying to win each heat, I'm hoping to have the
necessary patience and calm to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garcia, who says that luck and catching the best wave are
the keys to victory, stands in Lopez's way. ``I'm not the fastest
paddler, but I 'm the most aggressive on the tour,'' Garcia said.
``If there is a wave and a battle between me and you, I'm going to
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   (Women's final set subhed)
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to past years, the women's final, which normally
would have been Saturday, is scheduled today at 12:10 p.m., right
before the 12:40 men's final. Australian Trudy Todd will face
Hawaiian Rochelle Ballard. Todd knocked out fellow countrywoman
Pauline Menczer, and Ballard beat Brazilian Tita Tavares.

BULLDOG STILL HAS BITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Some guys just won't take the hint. They won't go
away, won't fade into that good night.
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser has been given up on more than fad diets. He's a
40-year-old right-hander with a rebuilt shoulder. People see him
hanging on, seemingly a shadow of his Cy Young past, and suspect
each season will be his last.
</P>
<P>
   And then he goes out and surprises again. Hooks up with another
pitching-desperate club, and wins. Wins like he is this year with
the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser is 10-8 for the surprising Mets, and even if he does
seem somewhat embarrassed by that 4.92 ERA, he could win 15 games
this season. Fifteen-game winners are difficult to find these days,
even if they come with a young arm and 95-mph fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here is Hershiser, now actually having won more games since
Dr. Frank Jobe's historic 1990 surgery than he did before, when he
came equipped with some of the nastiest stuff in baseball. He's not
planning on exiting anytime soon, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most advice I'm getting from the people I respect is,
`Make them tear the uniform off you, because you're not going to
find anything like it,''' Hershiser said. ``That you're always
going to be hungry for something like that. You're going to be
comparing everything else to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser won 99 games before undergoing Jobe's scalpel and has
won an amazing 101 since. None have approached the magic of his '88
season, when he helped lead the Dodgers to the World Series title
and captured his only Cy Young Award, but Hershiser keeps finding
new teams, new ways to win, new reasons to appreciate it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love pitching, I love being in the locker room, I love
teaching baseball,'' he said. ``I love the smell of the game. I
just love what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Wallace, the former Dodgers pitching coach who was the
Mets' senior executive adviser of player personnel before being
asked to take over as the team's pitching coach during the season,
recommended the Mets take a chance on Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   And Wallace knew this was another year when most were ready to
write Hershiser off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had a chance to get him, I was all for it,'' Wallace
said. ``He's got so much pride and so much competitiveness. So I
have to take a chance on a guy like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, not even Wallace could have predicted Hershiser would
already have 10 victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who'd of thunk it?,'' he said. ``But he comes prepared,
physically and mentally. He knows his limits. He knows himself.
Everybody knows his work ethic. He knows the game so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally he doesn't have the sinker and curveball he had in
his prime years, but at times his sinker is still really good. He
really knows how to pitch; throws a little slider. He's savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser still looks the same. Still has the long, lanky frame,
the gee-whiz boyish look, the wire-rimmed glasses, a head of full
brown hair.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``Bulldog'' outwardly has fought the reach of time, he
said there has been concessions to his advancing years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's different about being older and playing this game is,
when you get your aches and pains you're not sure if it's going to
grow into a major injury or if it's just going to go away,''
Hershiser said. ``That can weigh on you. I've learned about a lot
about my body since that time in '95.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to start learning about rest. Because as an athlete, to
me, the harder you worked, the better you got. Well, you get to an
age where that equation doesn't work anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser said he nearly retired after '95 in Cleveland, his
first with the Indians after not being re-signed by the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a crisis in our lives,'' Hershiser said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife and two boys remained in Pasadena. Spring training
didn't mean six weeks in Vero Beach, where his parents lived.
Suddenly he was three time zones away, and then when summer
arrived, his family had to move. All things he and his family had
never experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had won the World Series, I don't know... I probably
would have still come back, but we had to make some adjustments,''
he said. `The first adjustment I thought of was, `I'm just done.'
Because that's the easiest. You're causing so much pain and turmoil
to everyone else's life, you start to say the easiest thing is for
me to change my lifestyle. Then slowly as we thought about baseball
not being part of our lives, everyone started to tell me that it
wasn't as bad as they thought. They were saying it is tough, but we
can still do it. Now that we've been doing that kind of lifestyle
for so long, every year has gotten easier.''
</P>
<P>
   That offseason he moved to Orlando. He signed a two-year
extension with the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that would be it for sure,'' Hershiser said. ``I
thought maybe even '95 might end up being it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he kept rolling, kept defying the odds and the years.
This year he became the 95th pitcher in baseball to win 200 games.
He may no longer be the game's most consistent pitcher, but he has
more career victories than any active pitcher except Roger Clemens
and Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having fun, on a great team, in a fun city, my family is
healthy, and my boys are growing quickly and enjoying my career
more and more because they're old enough to remember it and
enjoy,'' he said. ``I'm doing great.'' &UR; !dlim! &LR; !end! &QL;

FISH STORIES SWIRL ABOUT MYTHIC TABLE ROCK CATFISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRANSON, Mo. -- Loch Ness has its Nessie.
</P>
<P>
   Table Rock Lake, its Bubba.
</P>
<P>
   For years, scuba divers and fishermen have heard fables of a
6-foot, 200-pound catfish, affectionately dubbed ``Bubba,''
swishing in the shadows of the 25-story Table Rock Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Bubba supposedly swaggers through the lake's shallower depths,
living near currents that suck bait fish down to the dam's
turbines. Flapping their jaws, the big cats hang out to ambush a
meal, almost like a home delivery of a fish-food smorgasbord.
</P>
<P>
   Or so they say.
</P>
<P>
   Diver Dick Dalager, a diving instructor and harbor master at
Table Rock Lake State Park Marina, said he saw Bubba last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Dalager was in 30 feet of water, enjoying the combination of
rare visibility and bright sunshine, when the waters suddenly
turned dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up, thinking the sun had passed behind a cloud,'' he
said, ``except it wasn't the sun. I watched a fish's belly slide
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't touch him. ... He looked like he didn't want to
be touched.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Leonard, a Branson diver since 1978, said he met Bubba once
on a dive in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``And once was enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, I heard the stories from other divers about the
fish big enough to `swaller' a man whole,'' Leonard said. ``I
laughed, too, until I saw him. That fish had a mouth that was a
foot across and was as long as me from head to flipper. I stayed
real still and he ambled on by. ... Yeah, it scared me.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people chortle when they hear about Bubba.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics point out that the watery world of divers is magnified
25 percent because the air bubble in front of a diver's face mask
acts like a lens underwater. And whopper fish stories have been
spawned throughout Missouri from the Lake of the Ozarks all the way
to the Mississippi River since the days of Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   After all, no one has ever actually caught a 6-foot-long
freshwater catfish. The largest on record was only 5 feet 3.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Noyes, editor for the Fisheries Division of the Missouri
Department of Conservation in Jefferson City, says he's heard the
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard everything from the size of a Volkswagen to 6 feet
long,'' he said. ``Do I think a 6-footer could be scooting through
the mud there? Sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when a fish gets up to 5 feet, it seems huge, monstrous.
I've seen one that large. And if you're drifting in the water
anywhere near a fish that big, it would probably feel like it could
swallow you up.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Missouri Department of Conservation, the
largest catfish on record weighed 117 pounds and measured 5 feet 3
inches long. Caught in 1964 in the Osage River, it was a blue
catfish snagged on a trotline -- a fishing line strung across a
river with baited hooks.
</P>
<P>
   But to some fishermen, trotlines don't count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catfish are a worthy foe,'' said Virgil Agee, of Chamois, Mo.,
who chases catfish with his rod and reel. ``Let's put it this way
-- you don't catch a catfish. It catches you.''
</P>
<P>
   Agee has been fishing for 50 years, and he has landed a couple
of records in the National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame and the
International Game Fishing Association. His record catfish pressed
the scales at 100 and 104 pounds. After weighing them, he released
the fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had cats actually beat me,'' he said. ``A good fight can
leave me totally physically and mentally exhausted. That's part of
the game. It gets your blood pumping.''
</P>
<P>
   Fish stories -- told and retold -- often grow a little larger.
And in the fishing world, there are accounts of catfish weighing up
to 250 pounds caught as far back as the Civil War. Agee heard about
a big cat weighing between 300 and 325 pounds caught in 1890 near
Morrison -- eight miles from his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I moved here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Landing a fish over 100 pounds is something you never forget,
Agee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an eerie, almost mystical experience,'' he said. ``You
see all sorts of things before the catfish comes up. You see huge
bubbles, not round ones, but bubbles in strange formations. The
water's churning... .
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got my first one, it seemed like it took hours. Then it
was another five or 10 seconds before I recognized it as a fish.
Your mind can't comprehend that something that big is real. You
almost think you've caught a monster, like Loch Ness.''
</P>
<P>
   Agee has heard the stories about catfish big enough to
``swaller'' a man whole. They could indeed exist, he said,
especially since commercial fishing netting was banned, allowing
the larger fish to make their way into smaller tributaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big catfish don't school because they'd be fighting over the
same food. They eat just about anything. Clams. Turtles. Frogs.''
</P>
<P>
   A man?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they might,'' Agee said. ``You could lose a finger from
a big cat. They'd definitely tear up your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Agee says he's a catfish chaser, looking for one at least the
size of Bubba. He almost caught the cat a few years ago, one he
estimates at weighing about 150 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But the fish got away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will get him, though,'' he said. ``It's my life's mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The last Agee saw of Bubba was a trail of strange bubbles headed
up the Osage River.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in the direction of Table Rock Lake.

PARADE PAYS ADDITIONAL TRIBUTE TO GEORGE BRETT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDWARD M. EVELD and STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Royals fan Ed Follis has a George Brett
story. Doesn't everyone?
</P>
<P>
   Follis' tale takes place in the bleachers at Yankee Stadium in
1990. The Yankee fans are booing every Royals player who comes to
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   But when Brett steps up, a self-appointed leader of the bleacher
fans raises his arms for silence. ``This man is George Brett,'' he
shouts to the Yankee faithful. ``He's earned our respect.''
</P>
<P>
   All jeering stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the last place I expected to see that,'' said Follis of
Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, in a light rain that didn't last, Follis
and hundreds of other Brett believers made their way to the Brett
parade in Kansas City and congregated for a celebration in Mill
Creek Park near the Country Club Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to glimpse their baseball hero and to show their
gratitude for his extraordinary efforts on the field, which landed
him in Baseball's Hall of Fame at Cooperstown, N.Y., last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On the main stage at the park, Buck O'Neil, Negro Leagues
baseball great and Saturday's parade grand marshal, put it this
way: ``I'd rather be right here right now honoring this man than
anyplace I've ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Brett wanted to turn the thanks around. He
recalled his earliest days with the Royals, which go back to 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a no-brainer,'' Brett said. ``I fell in love with the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Several former Royals players -- including Mark Gubicza, Willie
Wilson and Jim Eisenreich -- rode in the parade and came on stage
to show their support for Brett. Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes and
several radio personalities shared their thanks.
</P>
<P>
   And the crowd joined in a musical chorus about Brett: ``No. 5 is
No. 1, the best you'll ever see. Hurray for our great No. 5, a hero
in ol' KC.''
</P>
<P>
   After Brett urged the fans to support the current version of the
Royals -- ``We've got a lot of youngsters out there busting their
rear ends'' -- he expressed his gratitude to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't thank you people enough for what you've done over the
past 25 years,'' he said. ``I am so proud to call Kansas City my
home -- thanks for coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier along the parade route, Sue and Brian Nelson and their
10-year-old son, Matt, himself a third baseman, waited in
anticipation as the Ararat Shriners' minicars motored by and the
Kansas City Monarchs float slowed in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   The float sported a giant No. 5 and a big cube with Brett
photos, including the June 21, 1976, cover of Sports Illustrated
calling Brett the ``Hot bat at the hot corner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nelsons moved to Shawnee from Des Moines, Iowa, about a year
ago, but Brian Nelson lived here until the sixth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always my hero,'' said Nelson about Brett. ``So we just
had to come. And you don't get this in Des Moines, a Hall-of-Famer
parading by.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd yelled ``Whitey'' as former Royals manager Whitey
Herzog rode by in a baby-blue 1952 Chevy. They waved at Wilson,
sitting tall and lanky in a tiny convertible. Former Royals player
Greg Pryor swung his head backward and joked, ``Has anybody seen
George yet? I think he's back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Brett arrived in a Hummer stretch limousine, first
resting his chin on his hand but soon enough responding to the
crowd. A little girl of about 3 waved at Brett and he blew her a
kiss. Brett spotted a person who attended the Hall of Fame
induction and called out, ``Have a good time up there?''
</P>
<P>
   Fans waved and displayed homemade signs. One read:
``Congratulations, George Brett, KC's MVP forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade began at 10 a.m. at Volker Boulevard and Rockhill
Road and ended at the park almost an hour later. The early
sprinkles and the 80-degree weather were the area's first respite
from a prolonged heat wave, which had pushed temperatures to 100
and above.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody asked me, `What if it rains?' '' said Bubbles the
Clown, a parade participant also known as Louise Ohap of
Independence. ``At this point I'd say, `Thank you, God.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At the park, families waited in lines for a ride on a Kansas
City Power &AMP; Light Co. bucket truck, for a face-painting session,
for a turn in a plastic-ball pit or for a ride down a giant,
blow-up slide. A petting zoo featured goats, pigs, sheep and
llamas.
</P>
<P>
   Fans could learn about Lou Gehrig's disease and donate to the
ALS Association, an important cause for Brett. They could buy
commemorative envelopes from the U.S. Postal Service for $10. The
envelopes recounted Brett's career and featured a Cooperstown
postmark.
</P>
<P>
   All of it was wonderful to John Luciani, who arrived in town
from Denver just weeks ago to start a job with HOK Sports, a firm
that designs stadiums. Luciani arrived at 8:30 a.m. -- ``I think I
was the first one here'' -- to watch the setup. He was gleeful
about the autographs he got from O'Neil and Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   A self-professed baseball nut, Luciani was honored to pay
tribute to Brett. Not long ago, he and a buddy, another hard-core
fan, were making separate lists of baseball greats. The question
came up: Who was the greatest player of the 1980s?
</P>
<P>
   ``We both wrote down `George Brett.' ''

   GREEN RIDGE STATE FOREST, Md. -- Even as a belated summer rain
pelted the canopy of oak and hickory trees that cloaks the
Allegheny Mountains last week, ranger Francis Zumbrun scratched his
toe into a parched forest floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dry as paper. It could burn in a second,'' he said. ``The
rain is nice, but they say we need the equivalent of a couple of
tropical hurricanes to make things right.''
</P>
<P>
   Zumbrun has never seen this forest so dry or anticipated such a
frightful fall fire season. To the north in Pennsylvania, the
ground hasn't been so dry since the mid-1960s. Stretches of the
Potomac River are running lower than they have since the early
1930s, while the Susquehanna River has fallen to a 100-year low.
</P>
<P>
   The water shortage in northern Virginia has made a sin of car
washing, while threatening fruit orchards and forcing ranchers to
unload cattle at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   With Maryland's key reservoirs more than half empty, the
governor last week declared the state's first-ever drought
emergency and said he might impose mandatory conservation measures.
Pennsylvania, Delaware and New York have already issued similar
alarms.
</P>
<P>
   Overlooked in the death and misery of July's stifling heat wave,
drought has struck some regions of the country. It's been building
for more than a year, and its damage may more profoundly devastate
sections of the country in the months and years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a severe problem and a very real drought in those
mid-Atlantic states,'' said Douglas LeComte, a senior meteorologist
for the federal Climate Prediction Center. ``It doesn't look like
there will be any significant relief any time soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, if hot and dry weather continues to bake parts of Oklahoma
and northern Texas, that region will endure its second consecutive
year of drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our farmers who planted corn and the like are just hoping to
cash in the insurance on a lost crop,'' said JoAnn Rollins, the
manager of Farmers Co-op Gin in Grandfield, Okla. ``There's been no
rain, so there's no crop to speak of.''
</P>
<P>
   The drought prompts people to use more water for their crops,
yards and flower beds. That, in turn, has water treatment systems
running full tilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fire department can't flush its hydrants as often and
we're not flushing our sewer lines as much because you've got to
start saving water somewhere,'' said Dave Lehfeldt, the utility
operations manager in Wichita Falls, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northwest, forest and brush fires rage across parts of
eastern Washington and Oregon and northern Idaho. Ironically, a wet
spring is partly responsible. Brush that grew thick during the thaw
has dried into tinder for wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   The soggy-spring/dry-summer phenomenon also has made a
pronounced difference between those farmers who irrigate and those
who don't. Dry-land farmers see their crops wither in the field,
while the irrigators can draw from the waterways.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it comes down the river, we've got it and we're doing
great,'' said Dale Lovejoy, who grows strawberries, flowers and
herbs near Eltopia, Wash. ``But our neighbors who don't irrigate
are in big trouble. It just isn't raining this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Weather experts attribute the Northwest drought to La Nina, the
weather system that usually follows the bigger El Nino with drier
times. The lack of rain in the East generally stems from a
high-pressure system loitering over the north Atlantic and blocking
a jet stream of moisture from reaching the Eastern seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   In Stephens City, Va., Dudley Rinker can't explain precipitation
rates or pressure systems. He just knows his apples and his plums
are too small this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be sweeter and tastier,'' Rinker said, ``but I get
paid for size.''
</P>
<P>
   Trees that usually produce apples upward of 3 inches in diameter
that would bring him about 10 cents a pound this year will produce
fruit smaller than 2.5 inches across that often bring in less than
4 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs me just as much to grow and pick it,'' he said, ``but
I get less money.''
</P>
<P>
   Cattle ranchers in the region see their pastures grow more
barren with each rainless day. Without grass for their cattle to
graze on, many have been forced to buy feed, cutting sharply into
any hopes for profits. Others have sold off their cattle early --
at a loss -- rather than take on more expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running out of pasture,'' said Philip Shenk of
Berryville, Va. ``We don't have much choice but to unload the
cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour drive away, the effect can be felt in towns as well.
Frank Sanders, director of public utilities in Winchester, Va.,
keeps a careful eye on the Shenandoah River.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not its lowest ever yet,'' Sanders said. ``But our driest
time is in the fall, and we're headed for dangerous territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Delta, Pa., Elwood Krick tends to a herd of newly skinny
cows. The hot weather that has come with the drought meant his 100
dairy cows lost an average of 15 pounds. The trimmer Holsteins, in
turn, produce only two-thirds their normal output of milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been at this here for 25 years and I've never seen it
even close to this dry before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His well, competing for water with development that has crept
into the countryside in recent years, has run dangerously low this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to make sure I'm not trying to use water at two
places -- say to clean out the milking equipment and run something
in the home -- or we'll run out,'' he said. ``It seems like we're
on the verge of disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cramer's Posie Patch near Elizabethtown, Pa., most of the
flowers are shorter and stumpier than usual -- often half their
normal size, and an unusually large number of plants never poke
through the parched ground. Farm manager Keith Cramer said it was
as if almost a month of the six-month season had been entirely lost
to drought. And the water shortage has made production for the rest
of the season far below normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were positioned to have a really big year,'' he said,
walking among ankle-high flowers that should stand higher than his
waist. ``Instead, it's been real disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the tinderbox that is the Green Ridge State Forest, Zumbrun
can walk across a dry stream that would be teeming with stocked
trout in most years. Rainfall here for 1999 is 10 inches below, or
less than half of, normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't see a lot of the effect until next spring,'' Zumbrun
said. ``Then the trees won't have the starches and carbohydrates
stored up in the roots to put out leaves.'' He expect 10 to 20
percent of the trees in the western Maryland forest to die.
</P>
<P>
   The toasting of the drought has set the forest ablaze. In a
typical year, there are no significant forest fires here in the
summer. They come far more often in the fall, after the leaves have
fallen and the sun has dried the forest floor.
</P>
<P>
   But this year there have already been at least 10 fires,
including one 10-acre blaze that smoldered for almost two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not been good,'' Zumbrun said. ``I don't even want to
think about the fall.''

MONDESI WEARING DODGER BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Raul Mondesi wasn't going to be traded Saturday
even though his bags have been packed for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally, the Dodgers right fielder has been so angered and
drained by speculation that he was leaving the organization that
signed him at age 17 that he asked to sit out the Dodgers' 4-2 loss
to the Arizona Diamondbacks at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It might have looked like Mondesi was ducking left-hander Randy
Johnson, who struck out 12 and pitched a complete game. But that
would have been easy.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is easy with Mondesi these days.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, he was deeply hurt when his name surfaced in trade
talks with the Cincinnati Reds. After a hot start this season, he
went 112 at-bats without a homer. His .245 batting average was
raised only after an eighth-inning pinch single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind if they trade me. What am I going to do, cry?''
he said, hours before the 9 p.m. trading deadline. ``It may have a
different name on the front of the shirt, but it is the same bats
and balls.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little reason for Mondesi's foul mood. The Dodgers,
certain to gut their disappointing team during the winter, had few
takers for a slumping slugger who still has three years and $29
million left on his contract. He also has two years for $11 million
each at the club's option.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers (45-59), who fell 13{ games behind Arizona in
the National League West, elected to pass on several deals that
would have altered their starting rotation, including at least one
for Saturday's starter, Ismael Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   Although they now have dropped back into last place by losing 10
of 12, the Dodgers claim they will use the final two months to
answer questions about the team's character.
</P>
<P>
   They know the team does not work in its present form and could
try to move five of the eight regulars, including Eric Karros, Eric
Young, Devon White and Gary Sheffield, this winter if they can get
someone to take the players' multiyear contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of discussions, we've been open-minded to what
other clubs say,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``But
there were some situations that were presented to us that were not
in our best interest in the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Malone got to watch Johnson, whom he tried to sign
last winter as a free agent. The Dodgers offered Johnson a
three-year contract worth $39 million, but he signed with the
Diamondbacks for four years and $52 million.
</P>
<P>
   As he has all season, Johnson looked like a bargain, limiting
the Dodgers to six hits, including a two-run homer by Karros that
cut Arizona's lead to 3-2 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Johnson (11-8) limited the Dodgers to four hits and
a walk to record his major-league leading ninth complete game and
raise his record to 11-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the best pitcher I've ever faced,'' said Trenidad
Hubbard, who started in place of Mondesi in right. ``This was the
first time for me today. I think I'm a pretty good fastball hitter.
But that thing was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi entered the game as a pinch hitter for Valdes (8-9), who
allowed seven hits and three runs in eight innings and tied a
season high with 10 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi singled to left, putting the tying run at first with one
out. But Johnson struck out Mark Grudzielanek and got Hubbard on a
fly ball to left.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson walked Gary Sheffield to open the ninth but struck out
Karros, White and Adrian Beltre to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Mondesi tried to be playful about the trade deadline
but turned serious when talking about how much he would miss the
fans and his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, his name hasn't been mentioned since last month when a
whopper hit the Internet that had Mondesi heading to Detroit as
part of deal involving the Tigers' Tony Clark and Bobby Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Cincinnati rumor last winter, Mondesi was upset
with the public's perception about his drunk driving arrest last
season. Charges were later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearing your name mentioned all the time can be really hard on
your concentration,'' said Grudzielanek, who came over from
Montreal last year at the July 31 deadline. ``I think it would be
particularly tough for Mondy since he grew up in the organization
and has been such a big part of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's career includes a National League Rookie of the Year
award in 1994 and back-to-back 30 home run seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of that matters now,'' Mondesi said. ``They traded (Mike)
Piazza. They traded (Hideo) Nomo. They were rookies of the year.
Maybe I'm next.''

VALDES SHAKES OFF TRADE TALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ismael Valdes knows a lot about the major-league
trading deadline and Randy Johnson. Saturday, he claimed he wasn't
concerned with either.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes (8-9), one of the Dodgers' most tradeable commodities,
lost to Johnson 4-2 in front of 37,114 at Dodger Stadium but
continued his most impressive stretch of the season. He pitched
eight innings and tied a season high with 10 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never worry about the other pitcher no matter who he is,''
said Valdes, who has a 2.35 ERA in his last five starts. ``We
didn't win today, but what else is new? I was concentrating on
keeping us in the game and I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who nearly was traded to Seattle for Johnson in December
1998 and again last summer, was more concerned with his lower back,
which stiffened up in the seventh inning. Valdes, bothered by
blisters and a bruised pitching hand earlier this season, remained
in the game and will make his next start.
</P>
<P>
   The first time the Mariners called, the Dodgers turned down the
deal. The second time, Valdes' stock had dropped after a second
straight mediocre season and Seattle wanted Darren Dreifort
instead.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lack of grit that scared away the Mariners. Now, Valdes
seems to have plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go through things like that, it toughens you up,'' he
said. ``You realize some things are out of your control and there
is nothing you can do. I just want to pitch well for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Spin doctor: Dodgers manager Davey Johnson had some interesting
answers for a couple of issues that came up in Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   About the decision to bench Raul Mondesi, who was upset over
mild trade rumors: ``I guess he saw something in the paper about
him going some place and it left him a little mentally confused. So
I gave him the day off.''
</P>
<P>
   About center fielder Devon White, who drew boos for not reaching
Jay Bell's bloop single in the fifth: ``He has been good for us. He
plays day and night.'' White remains hot at the plate, finishing
July with a .382 (34 for 89) average but has not started 26 games
this season despite staying off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: With a home run and two RBI on Saturday, Eric Karros
finished July with 12 homers and 26 RBI. Karros, who has 25 homers
and 67 RBI overall, finished three homers short of Pedro Guerrero's
club record of 15 homers in June 1985. Karros, who beat Johnson
last Sunday with a home run, now has 202 for his career, nine
behind Steve Garvey for second on the Dodgers' all-time list. Ron
Cey is first with 228. Karros' name came up in trade talks with
several clubs, including Atlanta, but the Braves were unwilling to
give up left-hander Bruce Chen.

AGASSI ATTACKS USTA AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If the ATP tour is in Los Angeles, it must be time
for Andre Agassi to launch a verbal assault on the U.S. Tennis
Association and explain why he won't play Davis Cup matches in the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an ATP official recalled, Agassi criticized the USTA
for choosing Milwaukee as a Davis Cup site.
</P>
<P>
   He revisited those themes Friday night after his quarterfinal
victory over Lleyton Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an example of how players don't have a say-so in the most
important issues,'' Agassi said.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, who played in the Davis Cup last year, also knocked the
USTA over its dismissal of George Fareed as Davis Cup team doctor.
Agassi believes Fareed would be able to keep players better
hydrated than other doctors on the professional tennis circuit.
</P>
<P>
   So while Pete Sampras has expressed a desire to play more Davis
Cup matches in the future, Agassi reiterated his refusal to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Not) till they reconsider George,'' Agassi said. ``George
will never let that (dehydration) happen to us. Once you're
dehydrated, it's too late. George would've had the fluids and the
minerals all week.''
</P>
<P>
   Day vs. night: Agassi has yet to play a day match. Sampras has
yet to play at night, although he participated in a celebrity
fund-raiser Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Today's final is at 2 p.m. Perhaps Sampras has an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed playing at night,'' Agassi said. ``The sun plays
an element. The heat plays an element. The ball plays quicker. The
court plays quicker. Your toss changes on serve. I would've loved
to play during the day.''
</P>
<P>
   All is forgiven: Earlier this week, Patrick Rafter ascended to
the world's No.1 ranking and blasted Sampras for what he perceives
as a lack of respect for other players. Rafter beat Sampras in
their last three meetings, including the U.S. Open semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The rift began after a match last year in Cincinnati. Sampras,
beaten by Rafter, was upset at the chair umpire's reversing a call
that gave Rafter the match. Sampras refused to shake the umpire's
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has said he has no problem with Rafter. The two spoke
this week by telephone, and Sampras is convinced there is no rift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to Pat, and we smoothed it over,'' he said. ``I was
surprised to hear the things he said. He's not that kind of guy. I
respect Pat. There's not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubles faulted: While Nos.1 and 2 play in today's singles
final, there is no such situation in the doubles final, which
follows Agassi-Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   No seeds reached the final. Only one seeded team reached
Saturday's semifinals: No. 2 Wayne Black of Zimbabwe and Sandon
Stolle of Australia, and they lost in straight sets to Byron
Black/Wayne Ferreira.
</P>
<P>
   Black and Ferreira have been the seed killers, having also
knocked off third-seeded John-Laffnie de Jager/Jim Grabb in
straight sets on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, top-seeded Leander Paes of India/Jonas Bjorkman
of Sweden lost to Martin Damm/Adam Peterson. Unseeded Goran
Ivanisevic/Brian MacPhie beat No. 4 Justin Gimelstob/Scott
Humphries. Those two matches went three sets.

CHANGES AT PLAZA REFLECT MOVEMENT TOWARD MAINSTREAM ENTERTAINMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Call it the Plaza reformation.
</P>
<P>
   The managers of the Country Club Plaza didn't tack a list of
grievances on tenants' doors to announce a break with tradition.
</P>
<P>
   But recent changes in the venerable district are tilting the
tony shops of the Plaza more heavily toward the hottest trend in
retailing: entertainment for the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the year, the Plaza has made several
changes that push the shopping center closer to the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes:
</P>
<P>
   - The 14 movie screens in Cinemark's Palace on the Plaza embrace
the new era of the multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   - A host of national merchants are moving into stores once
reserved for local boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   - Chain restaurants, from Chicago-style deep-dish pizza to a
Chinese bistro, are adding flavors to the Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   - And, perhaps the ultimate sign that a mainstream trend has
trickled to the Plaza: Starbucks will open a cafe on the Plaza in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the Plaza adapts to contemporary tastes and adds
tenants with deeper pockets and broader appeal, the Plaza's public
face is adopting some features that resemble the long-planned Power
&AMP; Light District.
</P>
<P>
   That $454 million project still sits on the drawing board, but
its key features include a complex of at least 20 movie screens,
trendy retailers and some chain restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   No one would confuse the stately Plaza with the neon dreams for
downtown of the late movie-theater magnate Stan Durwood. After all,
the 14-screen Plaza on the Palace has a marble lobby rather than
the splashes of neon Cinemark has at other venues.
</P>
<P>
   But neither district is a pure play. The Power &AMP; Light District
would be an entertainment district featuring shopping. The Plaza
has become a shopping district featuring more entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   David Fenley, lawyer for J.C. Nichols, said the Plaza's managers
didn't set out to conquer the same territory scouted by the
voter-approved Power &AMP; Light District.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Plaza folks put the pedal to the metal and said,
`Let's get this place moving forward,' they said, `What do people
want to do in 1996?' '' Fenley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not say, `What did people want to do in 1928?' They
did not say, `What did people want to do in 1962?' They did not
say, `What did people want to do in 1975?' They were saying, `In
the context of the world we're living in right now, what do people
want to do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The answers are fairly simple: They go to movies. They eat at
nice restaurants. They shop for convenience and style.
</P>
<P>
   The Plaza and the proposed Power &AMP; Light District might overlap
in some respects, but that's only because the retail elite across
the country are asking the same question and coming to similar
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   From San Francisco, where Sony Corp. recently opened an $85
million retail and entertainment complex called Metreon, to the
Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., to Times Square in New York,
developers are chasing the Holy Grail mix of shopping, food and
fun.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, backers of the Power &AMP; Light District and
managers of the Plaza pooh-pooh comparisons of their projects.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Bashkiroff, managing director of Power &AMP; Light District
LLC, said he didn't think the projects were similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are suburban,'' Bashkiroff said of the Plaza. ``It's a
suburban shopping center. Ours is the Midwest's version of Times
Square.''
</P>
<P>
   The Power &AMP; Light District would offer a 12-block mix of stores,
movie theaters, offices, apartments, hotels, live-performance
stages and parking garages north of Truman Road between Wyandotte
and McGee streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have an entertainment orientation that will be
regionally exclusive,'' Bashkiroff said. ``The Plaza is much more
retail-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett Brady, vice president of Highwoods Properties Inc.,
owner of J.C. Nichols, said the Plaza wouldn't become as glitzy as
the Power &AMP; Light District or other urban entertainment districts
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``That name doesn't fit for what we're doing,'' Brady said.
``We're not neon-oriented. We're more conservative entertainment,
and maybe they're more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brady contends the ever-evolving Plaza and the emerging
Power &AMP; Light District are compatible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people will still visit the Plaza, and I think they
will tack on a trip to the Power &AMP; Light District because that will
be a unique experience,'' Brady said. ``They are not mutually
exclusive. It's not a market where if they succeed, then we will
fail. We can all succeed.'' -- MORE --
</P>
<P>
   But before the projects can succeed in tandem, Brady's primary
job is to guarantee that the Plaza succeeds on its own.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, J.C. Nichols unveiled its $240 million plan for
building improvements and additional parking structures. The
company received $50 million in tax breaks to implement its plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Plaza area is facing pressure that downtowns have been
facing for the last 35 or 40 years,'' Brady said in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, the Plaza could be called suburban because it
was on the edge of town. By 1997, the Plaza's problems had become
much more urban than suburban as the edge of new development swept
toward the far horizon.
</P>
<P>
   The Plaza needed to update aging buildings, squeeze more parking
into an increasingly crowded area and create a setting that would
draw people from the fringes of town.
</P>
<P>
   The redevelopment plan also emphasized pedestrian living with
more housing and offices, confirming the Plaza's status as one of
the few areas of the city where people can live without a car.
</P>
<P>
   While the company addressed its building needs, J.C. Nichols was
also shaking up the tenants in the Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Stephenson, J.C. Nichols' director of asset management and
leasing, said the company needed a mix of mainstay shops like the
Gap and one-of-a-kind stores like Pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company has accelerated tenant changes in the past
three years, J.C. Nichols is constantly reviewing its tenant base.
More than 100 tenants have left the Plaza since 1991, Stephenson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some tenants were ready to go, but sometimes those tenants left
with a Plaza manager's hand on their back.
</P>
<P>
   Some tenants complained that J.C. Nichols raised their rent by
changing the formula to calculate charges for operating costs.
Kelly Taylor, spokeswoman for Nichols, said the changes were fair.
</P>
<P>
   Several tenants, including Overland Sheep Skin Co. and Russell
Stover Candies, said J.C. Nichols wouldn't renew their leases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nichols didn't want us to stay,'' said Tom Ward, president of
Russell Stover Candies, which closed its Plaza store a few years
ago. ``We had been on the Plaza since 1947. They told us, `We don't
want national chains,' and then they turn around and bring in the
Gap and they bring in Banana Republic. What's that all about?''
</P>
<P>
   It's about money.
</P>
<P>
   Some national stores haul in cash faster than other stores, and
Plaza officials concluded they wanted to attract more of those
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Plaza, which gets more than 40 percent of sales
from out-of-town visitors, is hurting for revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson said the Plaza merchants, including restaurants, had
annual average sales of $375 per square foot. The 1998 national
average was $301, according to the International Council of
Shopping Centers, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Nichols is constantly evaluating the Plaza's tenants. That
means the Plaza must retire bowling alleys, faded retailers and
chili kitchens when they lose their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Plaza certainly has changed from the days when it had gas
stations and a bowling alley,'' said Kansas City architect E.
Crichton Singleton.
</P>
<P>
   It also means the Plaza will pass on some prospects if they
don't fit management's goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked long and hard at Hard Rock Cafe, and we thought we
wanted them and they thought they wanted us,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   That deal didn't happen, but the Plaza has nabbed tenants such
as Pizzeria Uno, a chain that makes Chicago-style deep-dish pizza.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will continue as long as the Plaza endures, said
Jonathan Barnett, a University of Pennsylvania professor of city
and regional planning who has worked as a consultant for the city.
</P>
<P>
   The latest changes might appear as if the Plaza is bowing to
current fads in the retail industry, but the area won't become a
fashion victim as long as it retains its original character,
Barnett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the Plaza has attributes of an urban entertainment
district, but I consider it much more of a `real' place,'' Barnett
said. ``An urban entertainment district is almost like a casino
without the casino.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6 million visitors who trek to the Plaza every year should
find that the Plaza's incremental changes are in step with their
tastes, said Glen LeRoy, principal with Gould Evans Goodman
Associates in Kansas City. In some ways, the Plaza was an
entertainment district before the term became trendy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Plaza has always been an entertainment district,'' LeRoy
said. ``But it has been entertainment in a mixed-use development.
It's just that the nature of the entertainment has changed.''

FORGET THE REST, SAMPRAS IS BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pete Sampras' semifinal victory Saturday in the
Mercedes-Benz Cup earned him 43 ranking points and a return to No.
1, confirming that he's the best in the world at the fine art of
belting a fuzzy yellow ball with a paddle of synthetic cat gut.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, a courtside thermometer indicated the sun was
shining, the march of the shadows proved the earth was spinning and
a $7.75 cheeseburger suggested this is no game for the
poverty-stricken.
</P>
<P>
   That is to say, if you watched Sampras sweep the cocky James
Sekulov off the UCLA pavement in less than an hour, or if you've
paid much attention over the past six years, you hardly need a
mathematical formula to know there's no better tennis player on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   As if we might otherwise think the distinction belongs to Jens
Knippschild, Gaston Gaudio or Attila Savolt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's playing like that, nobody in the world can beat him,
I think,'' young Sekulov said of Sampras following the 6-0, 6-2
humbling.
</P>
<P>
   I think, too.
</P>
<P>
   So must any of the four other players who have borrowed the No.
1 ranking from Sampras for short spells this year _ Patrick Rafter,
Carlos Moya, Yevgeny Kafelnikov and this afternoon's finals
opponent, Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   The whole notion of the ATP Tour rankings, introduced in 1973,
might seem unnecessary nowadays, in the Sampras Era.
</P>
<P>
   But without the rankings, the tour publicists couldn't roll out
such statistical niceties as the fact that Sampras now is No. 1
among the No. 1s, having sat in the top spot for 271 weeks in his
career, one more than Ivan Lendl and three more than Jimmy Connors.
</P>
<P>
   Does that matter?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it matters to Pete, who just reclaimed the lead from
Rafter. That it seems superfluous to you and me might explain why
he's No. 1 and we're not.
</P>
<P>
   And it might also explain why he's held onto the title for
nearly half his professional career while the Moyas, Marcelo Rioses
and Thomas Musters make No. 1 and promptly look for a place to sit
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life would be easier if I was (No.) 5 or 10,'' admitted
Sampras, who went to the top of the Monday-morning rankings for the
first time in April 1993, the year of his first Wimbledon title.
</P>
<P>
   Life would feature more vacations if he were No. 5 or 10. Life
would include fewer stretches of work like the seven consecutive
tournaments he played at the end of 1998 in a successful bid to
finish at No. 1 for a record sixth straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything kind of explodes when you're No. 1. You're the man
to beat. Instead of five people in your press conference, there's
12 or 20. Some guys run away from it. Some guys love it. There is
no recipe (for handling it).
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' he said, ``it's strictly ego.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, now 27 and on the job for 11 years, traces his drive to
a four-set loss to Stefan Edberg in the 1992 U.S. Open final.
</P>
<P>
   He'd already won an Open (in 1991) and been ranked as high as
No.6. He was, though, still dogged by the mixed reputation of his
junior days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was considered a kid with a lot of talent and not much heart
and not much mind,'' Sampras said Saturday. ``I guess I've been out
to prove myself ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   In the loss to Edberg, he felt he ``gave in,'' confirming his
fears about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that, I didn't really hate to lose,'' Sampras said. ``I
was good enough to get to the final but not good enough to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't anything a coach could do. It was up to me, a
matter of looking in the mirror and deciding what I wanted to do
with my career.''
</P>
<P>
   What he wanted, it turned out, was to be No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But how much longer is he determined to stay there?
</P>
<P>
   The system for identifying the world's best player will undergo
its first major changes in 2000, and although Sampras said he likes
the new math, believing it will be more exciting for tennis fans,
it will force him to work even harder.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of basing the weekly rankings on points earned in the
past 12 months, the ATP will begin counting on Jan. 1 and name a
champion Dec. 31, after which the process will begin again. Also,
point rewards will increase for the so-called Mercedes Super 9
tournaments, of which the Newsweek Champions Cup in Indian Wells in
March is one but this week's event at UCLA is not.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has entered only three of the five Super 9 tournaments
played so far in 1999 and isn't thrilled about stepping up his
schedule next season. Maybe after 271 weeks on top, it's time to
smell the roses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've cherished every year I've been No. 1,'' he said. ``We'll
see what happens in the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as we're concerned, any way of picking a champion will
do, as long as it picks Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Just as long as they don't ask sportswriters to vote, in which
case Anna Kournikova would be No. 1 on both tours. &QL;

A FRIENDLY BARRIER TO SAFER ROADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The claims she was going to fix the deadly problem anyway _ soon
_ but the fact is, Gov. Jane Hull didn't finally decide to install
cable barriers on local freeway medians until the day after a
friend nearly got killed in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, former legislator Polly Getzwiller and her husband
were critically injured on the Squaw Peak Freeway when their car
was crushed by &UR; a BMW that had crossed the unfenced median.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Hull committed the state to building 138 miles of
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't a new idea. People have been dying on barrier-free
highways around here for years.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Department of Transportation has been looking into
the idea of stringing cable barriers for quite some time, but
hasn't released a report yet.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, speaking in fluent politician, said, ``Although
the report is not yet complete, we now have enough information to
see what ADOT's recommendation will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Roughly translated, this means, ``I'm not waiting around for
another buddy of mine to get wasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has a problem with the result. Whatever it takes to get
crews out there installing barriers is fine by us.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but Getzwiller is a wonderful woman.
</P>
<P>
   She was loved at the state Capitol, where she put in more time
than just about any politician this century, conducting herself
with such grace that, attached to her name, the term ``public
servant'' doesn't seem like a joke.
</P>
<P>
   I can understand why the friend of such a fine woman would want
to take action immediately. &QL; 
ANOTHER GOOD PERSON
</P>
<P>
   Then again, by all the accounts I've read, Tim Landers was a
pretty good person, too.
</P>
<P>
   He was a former football star at Arizona State University who
went on to become a Phoenix police officer. After working the late
shift one day in April, 1997, a driver crossed an open median on
the Squaw Peak and plowed head-on into Landers' vehicle, killing
him.
</P>
<P>
   The barriers could have _ and should have _ been put up right
then.
</P>
<P>
   But they weren't.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a little over a year later, Landers' wife and two young
children won a $4.5 million settlement from Phoenix and the state
of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Landers' lawyers collected reports on 27 accidents
resulting in five deaths that occurred within a half-mile of where
Landers was killed.
</P>
<P>
   All were the result of vehicles crossing the median.
</P>
<P>
   Any one of the people hurt or killed in those accidents was
reason enough to put up barriers.
</P>
<P>
   People like George Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, the husband and father was fatally injured after a
guy trying to elude police drove his pickup truck across the median
and struck Riley's truck.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on. &QL; 
TAKE YOUR PICK
</P>
<P>
   Pick any year and any road like the Squaw Peak, the Loops 101
and 202, U.S. 60 or I-10 and you'll find the names of men, women
and children who weren't close to any politician but died in
crashes, and whose passing should have stirred some action.
</P>
<P>
   But didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Cable barriers are said to cost $155,000 a mile to construct.
</P>
<P>
   In the government decisionmaking process, money always comes
before lives.
</P>
<P>
   Except, maybe, with old chums.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the proximity of Getzwiller's accident to her
decision to build barriers, Hull answered, ``It's no one thing.
It's rather the fact that in June, we requested that ADOT present
us with facts, figures and a plan of action.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a fluke, in other words, an unpredictable confluence of
events.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know. Perhaps the mysteries of coincidence, fate and the
inner workings of state government can't be understood or explained
by a newspaper writer, but require one of those self-help books so
popular these days.
</P>
<P>
   The one I imagine would be called, ``When Bad Things Happen to
Good. . .Friends of the Governor''. &QL;

ONE MAN'S SPL ALL-STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Show us a league that exists to promote the
basketball welfare of sleepers, and we'll give you a Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   Consider it our little wakeup call.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, after a lengthy discussion (two minutes, tops), we decided
to provide one (1) glory day for a few Summer Pro League irregulars
before NBA general managers slap the snooze button on their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Our list will deliver a few shocks and surprises among
subjective-thinking agents and wannabe coaches. But we believe you
can't have a Dream Team without producing a collateral cause for
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   We also appreciate any bitterness stirred in those players who
didn't qualify for our Dream Team. But know this: Our squad was
chosen through the scientific method of noticing who was playing
well while we just happened to be inside the Pyramid at Cal State
Long Beach. And we probably witnessed a lot more of the SPL's 30th
edition than you did.
</P>
<P>
   We were there when some irony manipulator pushed a button that
caused the PA system to spit out the Village People anthem ``YMCA''
during a break in the action involving a team fronted by abstract
rap artist Percy ``Master P'' Miller.
</P>
<P>
   What a lovely dichotomy that was.
</P>
<P>
   We also were there long enough to notice the SPL's mightiest
slam dunk. The nasty jam was a right-handed fastball delivered with
bad intent by 6-foot-5 lefty Warren Rosegreen, who performed this
feat for the Korean All-Stars. The victim was Khari Stanley of the
NBA Pros. To humans other than Rosegreen, Stanley _ who goes about
6-10 and 270 _ seems imposing enough to make a grizzly bear call
for backup.
</P>
<P>
   And we were there long enough to keep score on lottery picks.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the first 13 players selected in June's NBA draft
competed in SPL '99. The roll call: Andre Miller and Trajan Langdon
(Cavaliers), Shawn Marion (Suns) and Baron Davis (Hornets). Of
course, the Suns and Hornets didn't sponsor SPL teams, so Marion
and Davis performed in the division largely populated by players
who make their living overseas.
</P>
<P>
   We were there long enough to accuse Clippers candidate Kebu
Stewart of qualifying as the Outstanding Player in the NBA
division. The 6-8, 245-pound Stewart had the league's highest
per-game scoring average (24.1), while ranking second in rebounding
(9.1).
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the Lakers shook the Pyramid by turning loose
a kid named Kobe, the Clippers weighed in with the delightfully
finesse-free and similar-sounding Kebu. In a loss to Boston,
Stewart made 15 of 16 field-goal attempts and all 10 of his free
throws. When the math was accounted for, he had 40 points and 15
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Stewart was given the OP nod over Boston's Paul
Pierce, whose SPL participation created the same caliber of
mismatch that would occur if Jeffrey Osborne sang on ``Star
Search.'' Pierce, a 6-7 small forward with NBA All-Star potential,
spent a great deal of SPL time refining his anticipated conversion
to the shooting-guard position.
</P>
<P>
   We believe this could move could backfire, but since the Boston
coaching staff behaves as if it invented basketball, it must be a
sage decision.
</P>
<P>
   One of Pierce's SPL teammates on the well-stocked and unbeaten
Boston squad was Vitaly Potapenko, the Celtics' starting center. In
lyrical tribute to his geographical history and surplus bulk,
Potapenko is referred to as the ``Ukraine Train.'' But this
provincial fame soon may be challenged by Stanislav Medvedenko, the
``Ukraine Trainee.''
</P>
<P>
   Medvedenko is a 6-10, 20-year-old forward and our choice as the
Outstanding Player from the SPL's free-agent division. ``Slav''
averaged 26.7 points and 10.5 rebounds at the Pyramid, but his
average of 6.5 turnovers suggests he can be as careless as
Gilligan.
</P>
<P>
   We admit to seeing quite enough SPL action to be impressed by
many free-agent division point guards. Our list includes ex-UC
Santa Barbara sniper Ray Kelly, Tes Whitlock, the former Orange
County prep star, Donte Mathis, a rookie from Southwest Texas
State, and busy Sean Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell, who only seems to show up with more teams than Anthony
Robbins, played at Southern Arkansas State, finishing his
collegiate run in 1996. A special education teacher at Texas High
in Texarkana, Texas, he made his first SPL appearance in 1998 but
was injured in the opening week.
</P>
<P>
   He has averaged 21 points and 3.5 steals in SPL '99, splitting
time between Toyota of Orange and Fila Select.
</P>
<P>
   The 30th Summer Pro League roars to its conclusion tonight.
</P>
<P>
   As far as our Dream Team is concerned, the well-earned rest will
be history.

WHIZ TURNED FROZEN DINNER INTO TRULY HOT COMMODITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be as painful as freezer burn to accept, but the man who
invented the TV dinner _ 8.4 billion meals sold _ does not eat from
aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Thomas, a 77-year-old former marketing whiz who emerged
this year from the deep freeze of Americana to celebrate the 45th
anniversary of his culinary breakthrough, favors gourmet meals on
china.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Susan, enjoy cooking in their well-appointed
Paradise Valley kitchen. And there's no TV-watching over dinner.
</P>
<P>
   In the freezer, where the Swanson chicken or Salisbury steak
dinners might be, is martini mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``A day without a martini is . . .'' he says dryly, letting the
thought drift off.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is enjoying the warmth of the limelight after all these
years of relative obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids (he has seven) say, `Hey, Dad, you're really cool.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the frozen-food luminary's hand prints and his
four-compartment aluminum tray were immortalized on the Hollywood
Walk of Fame, right there with other recent inductees Sean Connery
and Ron Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Edgy men's magazine ``Maxim'' named Thomas one of the ``50
Greatest Guys of the Century'' in its July/August issue. He's No.
28 along with with TV inventor Philo Farnsworth and Edwin
Shoemaker, who dreamed up the La-Z-Boy recliner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You owe them big,'' is the magazine's maxim on these guy-hero
inventors.
</P>
<P>
   They rank ahead of Chef Boyardee and James Bond, among others.
</P>
<P>
   So, how did he do it? How did a fresh-out-of-college guy making
$300 a month stamp out his place in history?
</P>
<P>
   His brilliant marketing marriage of television and turkey, sweet
potatoes and peas, was an instant hit with a nation hungry for
black and white images of Milton Berle in drag flickering across
tiny Philco TV screens. The cardboard food, as critics called it,
was secondary.
</P>
<P>
   It all started with turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   C.A. Swanson &AMP; Sons of Omaha, Neb., found itself with 520,000
pounds of frozen fowl after Thanksgiving that it couldn't unload.
Ten rail cars full of turkeys crisscrossed the country to keep the
train's refrigeration systems operating.
</P>
<P>
   At a frozen-food warehouse in Pittsburgh, Thomas stumbled across
a metal tray that a supplier for Pan American Airlines was
experimenting with so the carrier could offer hot meals on overseas
flights.
</P>
<P>
   He put the tray into his overcoat pocket and did some
``noodling'' on the flight back to Omaha to design the
three-compartment tray.
</P>
<P>
   His experience in the Army mess hall told him that Americans
wouldn't go for a frozen meal if the food mixed together like it
did in a soldier's mess kit. Hence, the original tray's three
compartments.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth compartment was added in 1960, not to add desert, but
so Swanson could get a design patent, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the desperate Swanson brothers, Gilbert and Clark,
gobbled up Thomas' idea and borrowed several hundred thousand
dollars to start production of the Swanson TV dinners.
</P>
<P>
   The TV dinner name Thomas coined was a natural for the era when
few Americans had televisions and everyone wanted one. He recalls
lunchtime window shoppers staring in store windows at test patterns
on TV screens about the size of today's microwave dinner plates.
Broadcasts were limited to about four hours of prime-time
programming.
</P>
<P>
   The other ingredient of the TV dinner's success was the
increasing number of working mothers in Eisenhower-era America who
liked the fast-food convenience and throwaway dishes.
</P>
<P>
   The original TV dinners, which sold for 98 cents, cooked at 425
degrees for 25 minutes. By today's standards of five-minute
microwave meals, that's glacial speed; but in 1954, that was
avalanche fast.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson had a hit. In the first year of national distribution,
the company sold 10 million TV dinners.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation of baby boomers, TV dinner night, eaten off TV
trays, was akin to home-delivery pizza night for their kids.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas shakes his head at how his invention took off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason in the world we should have been
successful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most grocery stores had only small coffin cabinet freezers to
sell frozen foods, and most home refrigerators at the time had ice
boxes with scarcely enough room for two trays of ice. But it
worked.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who left Swanson in 1970 after a heart attack and bought
a home in Arizona, said he never really thought about his
contribution to American popular culture. Not until last year, when
Swanson wanted to rebuild its slumping sales by celebrating the
anniversary of the TV dinner.
</P>
<P>
   He's had a lot of fun with the media attention, spots on CNN,
``Good Morning America'' and the ``Roseanne'' show. But there is an
important business lesson from the TV dinner, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been a great idea that has come out of a large
company,'' said Thomas, who went on to consulting after leaving
Swanson.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas jokes that he wishes he would have gotten a penny per
dinner, but his idea only earned him a $1,000 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and all these years later a spot in the Frozen Food Hall of
Fame, his name immortalized in the concrete outside Mann's Chinese
Theater and his aluminum TV dinner tray in the Smithsonian. &QL;

HAMBLETONIAN FIELD HAS BEEN DETERMINED  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERRY BREWER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Angus Hall and Self Possessed won their
Hambletonian heats Saturday, making them the favorites for next
Saturday's $1 million race here at the Meadowlands Racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Angus Hall won the first elimination heat Saturday in 1 minute
54.3 seconds, leading for most of the way and holding off the pack.
The second- through-fifth-place trotters _ Cherry Hills, Raffaello
Ambrosio, Pearsall Hanover and CR Commando _ also advanced to the
final.
</P>
<P>
   ``He raced very well today,'' said John Campbell, Angus Hall's
driver. ``The horse is in good shape, and if he stays healthy until
next Saturday he'll have a very good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said that Angus Hall's trainer, Bob Stewart, had
brought the horse a long way.
</P>
<P>
   Starchip Enterprise, who entered the day a 2-1 favorite in the
first heat, went off stride to begin the race and finished last.
</P>
<P>
   In the second heat, Self Possessed (1:53) came from behind in
the final three-eighths of a mile to win by three lengths over CR
Renegade, who had led for most of the race. Enjoy Lavec, Comets
Tail and Davanti finished third, fourth and fifth, earning spots in
the 10-horse final.
</P>
<P>
   The Hambletonian, for 3-year-old trotters, is harness racing's
premier event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cautiously confident for the final,'' said Ron Gurfein,
Self Possessed's trainer. ``I had Self Possessed real light. I
added weight to his shoes to temper his speed. I had him as light
as possible, and he was almost pacing. I've had to sacrifice speed
for safety, however, and it's paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver Mike Lachance said Self Possessed will be ready next
week. ``He's so versatile,'' he said. ``He was very relaxed today.
And it doesn't matter to him whether he's out front or not.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Breeders Crown race for mares, Shore by Five, the second
longest shot on the board at 15-1 odds, won in a photo finish over
Extreme Velocity. Robert McIntosh, trainer of Shore by Five, had
hoped Saturday that his mare would place high enough in the
$282,500 race to earn back the $7,500 entry fee posted by the
owner, Roger Saint-Germain, and his family. The victory in 1:50.4
earned Saint-Germain $141,250.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big shocker,'' McIntosh said. ``Going into the race,
I thought she had a chance for fourth or fifth. But she's a
grinder. She showed a lot of quality in the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two other Breeders Crown races, the 2-1 favorite Red Bow
Tie won the $380,000 pace for horses and geldings by a neck over
Color Me Best with a time of 1:50. And in the $580,000 open trot,
Super Grit come on at the end and upset the 6-5 favorite Fern in
1:53.1, a career-best time for the 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   But Shore by Five's surprising victory highlighted the day. She
didn't make her push until about an eighth of a mile was left in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Sanabelle Island, the 5-2 favorite, led for much of the race,
but faded. Without the favorite in the mix down the stretch, Shore
by Five capitalized, finishing just ahead of Extreme Velocity.
Galleria was third.
</P>
<P>
   ``This horse is a home bred,'' said Saint-Germain, who lives in
Quebec. ``It's a surprise for us, but we thought she could be in
the first five. Five is our lucky number. Her name is Shore By
Five, she had Post 5. I went to renew my license at the racing
commission today, and the guy who fingerprinted me was named Albert
Five and we have five boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, Saint-German decided to switch drivers. Daniel
Dube replaced William O'Donnell because, Saint-Germain said, he
wanted a familiar driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the decision myself,'' Saint-Germain said. ``Daniel
drove her last year in Quebec and won with her. She did not have a
consistent driver. I thought it was better she had someone who
knows her.''

MARLEY VALE PUTS THE PIECES TOGETHER IN TEST AT SARATOGA  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Marley Vale, a 3-year-old daughter of
Forty Niner, put all the ingredients together Saturday _ time,
distance and pace _ and outran 11 other star fillies to win the
Test, the first Grade I stakes of the season at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   It was a victory of patience and planning for Todd Pletcher, who
trains the filly for Eugene Melnyk. He found the right combination
Saturday when Marley Vale gunned her way from sixth place to
fourth, then into the lead in the homestretch and defeated Awful
Smart by 2{ lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything worked out beautifully,'' said Pletcher, who won
the training title at Saratoga last year at 31 and has already won
two major stakes in the first four days this year. ``The fractions
were hot, and we were close enough to be in position to take
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   In her three previous starts, Pletcher had tried his filly at
distances greater than one mile instead of in the sprints that she
had successfully handled in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Two races ago, Marley Vale ran in the Kentucky Oaks but was
overmatched by Silverbulletday, the superstar of fillies, when she
tried to go a mile and one-sixteenth at Churchill Downs. She
finished fifth. Then Pletcher brought her back to the sprints,
hoped for a fast pace and got it. In the Prioress at Belmont Park
four weeks ago, she ran second by a neck to Sapphire n' Silk.
</P>
<P>
   This time, back at seven furlongs with a streaking pace that
took them half a mile in 44 seconds and three-quarters in 1:09 1/5,
Marley Vale was in good position.
</P>
<P>
   John Velazquez, her jockey, moved her smartly to the outside,
got four-wide clearance as they headed home and drove past Bag Lady
Jane and Sapphire n' Silk. She crossed with daylight to spare,
while Awful Smart won second place by a head over Emanating. The
favorite, Olympic Charmer, who shipped here from California with
her rider, Chris McCarron, grew weary of it early and finished
10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on the Breeders' Cup pace last year,'' Pletcher said,
``but she had a little problem with her shins and we had to back
off her. We tried to stretch her out in Florida; it was simply too
far. We were planning on going to the Acorn last month, but she was
a really tired horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Marley Vale ran the seven furlongs in 1:22 3/5, paid $9.40 for a
$2 bet to win and earned $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron, who flew 2,700 miles to ride Olympic Charmer for Ron
McAnally, said: ``She didn't show her usual speed. This is the
first time I had to chirp to her and really get into her at the
start. I believe this is also the first time she has had dirt
kicked in her face.''
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney, the main event of the season for handicap horses,
still looks like a match race between the two leading seniors:
Behrens, the winner of four straight stakes, and Victory Gallop,
who won the Belmont last year and has raced with distinction since.
But they will have six rivals, including Sir Bear, winner of the
Metropolitan Mile, and Connecting Terms, the rabbit entered by
Elliott Walden to protect the finishing kick expected from Victory
Gallop. ``In my mind,'' Walden said, ``the most important races are
the Kentucky Derby, the Triple Crown and the Breeders' Cup. But the
Whitney is the race of the year so far.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A New York prison guard has been charged with sexually
assaulting a 15-year-old who had left the rampaging crowds at
Woodstock '99 last weekend to find a bathroom, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest is the first for a sex crime related to the concert,
but local prosecutors and the State Police are investigating
several other reported sexual assaults.
</P>
<P>
   The guard, Timothy A. Weeden, 26, of Rome, N.Y., demanded oral
sex from the woman, said Richard D. Dodge, an investigator for the
Oneida County Child Advocacy Center.
</P>
<P>
   The woman stopped in Rome at a convenience store about a mile
from the concert at about 2:30 a.m. Monday, officials said. The
restroom was out of order, so she walked behind the building,
officials said. Weeden approached her and said she could be charged
with indecent exposure, the investigator said. He led her behind
some trees and attacked her, Dodge said.
</P>
<P>
   Weeden has been suspended from his job at a state prison in
Marcy. He was indicted Tuesday on charges of first-degree sodomy,
third-degree sodomy, first-degree sexual abuse and endangering the
welfare of a child, Dodge said.

   &UR; The Murder of Helen Jewett: The Life and Death of a Prostitute
in Nineteenth-Century New York &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Patricia Cline Cohen. Vintage, $14.
</P>
<P>
   In 1836 it was possible to kill and get away with it, at least
if the victim was less than respectable. That is one of the lessons
of this history, which centers on the notorious bludgeoning of a
young prostitute by her lover, a small-time embezzler. ``Cohen does
a masterly job of identifying the mysteries at the heart of the
case,'' Janet H. Murray said last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Natural History &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Maureen Howard. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport, Conn., the author's hometown, is a prominent player
in her sixth novel, first published in 1992. It deals with the
Brays, Irish Catholics whose patriarch, Billy, was the police
detective investigating the local murder of a soldier by a
socialite during World War II. The book details how the episode has
molded the lives of his grown children. John Casey wrote that the
novel is ``a synergy of Maureen Howard's meditative social vision
and storytelling immediacy, of her highly developed technical skill
and of her alert heart.'' Howard's autobiography,  &UR; Facts of Life &LR; 
(Penguin, $12.95), has also been restored to print. Reissued with a
new afterword, it chronicles her working-class girlhood with
parents who were ambitious for Howard and her brother but deeply
ambivalent about their children's successes. The book is
``interesting and enjoyable,'' Diane Johnson said in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Salt Water &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Charles Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Square/Pocket Books, $12.
</P>
<P>
   A reimagining of Turgenev's novella ``First Love,'' this story
unfolds in the summer of 1963. The narrator, then 15, falls for an
older girl, who, he later discovers, is in love with his father.
The novel ``is a small masterpiece,'' Katharine Weber wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Black Notebooks: An Interior Journey &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Toi Derricotte. Norton, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The author, a poet and teacher, is a light-skinned black woman.
In this memoir she examines the consequences, to herself and
others, of the various times in her life that she has chosen to
pass for white. The book is distinguished by ``poignantly realized
details of feeling,'' Benjamin DeMott said in 1997. Questions of
racial identity are also explored in  &UR; The Accidental Asian: Notes
of a Native Speaker &LR; , by Eric Liu (Vintage, $12). The successful
son of immigrants from Taiwan, the author defends his own feelings
that he is ultimately more American than Chinese. Last year Gary
Krist, called the book ``remarkable for its ... refusal to buy into
the party line of identity politics.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The World I Made For Her &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Thomas Moran. Riverhead, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator is speechless but not deaf, silenced by the
respirator tube that is keeping him alive in a hospital where he is
being treated for severe complications of chickenpox. Based on the
author's own experiences, the novel describes the rich inner life
the patient still manages and the imaginary universe in which he
places his nurses. Moran is ``an admirably resourceful writer,''
Michael Upchurch said in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Opium: A History &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Martin Booth. St. Martin's Griffin, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   The author traces the science and culture surrounding a
substance that is older than mankind and that has proved to be both
a medical solace and a sociological scourge. ``It is a crowded, sad
and dramatic story,'' Jonathan Spence wrote last year. In  &UR; The
American Disease: Origins of Narcotic Control &LR;  (Oxford University,
$17.95), David F. Musto looks at the legislative response to
addiction in the United States. Now in a third edition that
continues the chronicle to the present, the book argues that strict
narcotics laws have often been inspired more by racial prejudice
and xenophobia than by sincere attempts to cure a problem. The book
``will probably become mandatory reading for anyone who wants to
understand how we got into our present mess,'' James M. Markham
said in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Rich Man's Table &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Spencer. Berkley, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   This novel chronicles the narrator's obsession with the man he
believes to be his father, a famous folk-rock singer and 1960s icon
who bears an uncanny resemblance to Bob Dylan. Last year Gary Krist
described the book as ``another charismatic and heartfelt
performance'' by its author.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In the Night Season &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Richard Bausch. Harper Perennial, $13.
</P>
<P>
   Nora Michaelson, alone with a young son, finds herself suddenly
haunted by more than the accident that made her a widow. Two men
descend on her family, determined to recover the remnants of a
high-tech smuggling operation that, unbeknown to Nora, involved her
husband. This is ``a brutal and relentless thriller,'' A.O. Scott
wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Black Glass: Short Fictions &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Karen Joy Fowler. Ballantine, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   These stories, which take place in locations ranging from
17th-century Japan to modern America, are peopled with characters
who are not necessarily human. The author ``manages to re-create
both life's extraordinary and its ordinary magic,'' Jenny McPhee
said last year.
