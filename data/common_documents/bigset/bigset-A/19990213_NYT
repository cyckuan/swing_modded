OLOWOKANDI WILL GET FIRST START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To finesse the politics of playing time, a coach
will emphasize the benefits of an individual finishing _ as opposed
to starting _ a game. But when his team is finished almost before
it starts, a coach may be forced to make alterations.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why Los Angeles Clippers coach Chris Ford will
start rookie center Michael Olowokandi in tonight's game at
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't get off to a good start,'' Ford said, ``you've
got to consider changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: In the Clippers first three games _ all losses _
they have been outscored by an average of 31.3 to 21.3 in the
opening quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is hoping Olowokandi, who produced career highs in points
(17) and rebounds (9) in Wednesday's loss at Vancouver, can make a
difference in his first NBA start. The ex-Pacific star has yet to
experience NBA life with his team in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the change is the corresponding matchup
bonus; the Suns start 7-foot-2 Luc Longley at center, then send him
to the sidelines in favor of 6-foot-10 forward Danny Manning.
</P>
<P>
   With Olowokandi coming off the bench in the first half of last
Friday's Suns victory at the Sports Arena, the matchup with Manning
was a difficult one for the 7-foot Clipper. But Olowokandi did have
some success with the slower Longley when the two hooked up in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the matchup with Longley is better for Michael,''
Ford said of Olowokandi, who managed three of his five made
field-goal attempts last Friday when Longley was on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   In three games, Olowokandi has averaged 14.3 points and 7
rebounds per game while making 15 of 30 field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Injury report: Forward Rodney Rogers, whose right knee sprain
kept him out of the Chicago and Vancouver games, practiced Thursday
and is expected to play in Phoenix. Rogers had 11 points and 11
rebounds in the season opener with the Suns. Maurice Taylor, who
has started in Rogers' absence, is expected to do the same tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Brian Skinner said his injured left knee is responding to
treatment, and the power forward from Baylor should return within a
week to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only been eight days, guys,'' Skinner said before
providing a convoluted analogy. ``God created the world in seven.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's D-minus: In the opening loss to Phoenix, the
Clippers lost the defensive-transition footrace with the Suns'
frontcourt. In the Chicago game, the team was pitiful on the
defensive boards.
</P>
<P>
   So, what did Ford's Clippers not do on defense in Vancouver?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with the way we gave up middle penetration,''
Ford said. ``After breaking down the film, we counted 17 times that
we gave up the middle; they (Grizzlies) scored 14 times.''
</P>
<P>
   A long way from 16: If you're wondering, Ford isn't even close
to matching his predecessor's record for Clippers coaching
futility.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Bill Fitch began his L.A. run by coaching 16
consecutive defeats.

LPGA TOUR IS JUST KIDS' STUFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ On a multicolored rug emblazoned with the
alphabet, 4-year-old Cori Inkster is putting the roof on a Lego
tower as tall as herself. On a high chair, 1-year-old Drew Killeen
is pawing the remains of an afternoon snack.
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Kaitland Currier and William Dormann, both 3,
are waking from naps. Just in time: William's mother has arrived to
pick him up.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded as we are by tiny chairs and tables, plastic toys and
horse dolls, Dr. Suess books and Crayon drawings, it's easy to
forget this is not just any child-care center and these are not
just any children.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Presidential Suite of a hotel not far from Oakmont
Country Club, and it has been converted into a day-care facility
during the Valley of the Stars Championship, this week's LPGA Tour
stop. These are some of America's best-traveled pre-schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Look closer and you see that ``The Cat in the Hat'' rests next
to a copy of Golf World magazine in the book rack.
</P>
<P>
   And that the U.S. map taped to the wall comes with a moveable
``We Are Here'' arrow pointing to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And that across the room hangs a tournament pairings sheet with
the names and tee times of the kids' favorite players highlighted.
Dana Dormann is highlighted, as are Juli Inkster, Cindy
Figg-Currier, Denise Killeen and a handful of other golfing moms.
</P>
<P>
   Normal kids? Sure they are, except for their precocious grasp of
the concept of room service and their tendency to snap their Legos
together in the shapes of the airports and hotels with which
they're so familiar.
</P>
<P>
   It's been seven years since the LPGA became the first
professional sports association to offer full-time child-care
services to its players, shipping a two-person staff and a
truckload of toys and educational material from town to town, where
they set up in hotel rooms, schools and churches.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, there were about a dozen kids in the service, said
Tony Verive, who bears the unique title of ``LPGA children's
development director.'' Now, there are about 50.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 44 LPGA players have a total of 74 kids _ about 50 of
whom use the service _ and four players are expecting.
</P>
<P>
   This is a light week, with eight kids in the room. During the
summer, roll call will include as many as 24 little Alexas,
Barrons, Erinns and Zacharys, ranging in age from 4 months to 9
years.
</P>
<P>
   The parents pay less than $100 a week for the service sponsored
by Smucker's (all that peanut butter and jelly!). A small price,
considering that for many, no child care would mean either no kids
or no golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It affected my decision to have a child,'' said Cindy
Figg-Currier, who shot a 2-under-par 70 in Friday's first round to
tie for seventh behind leader Annika Sorenstam (67). ``Once the
child care was announced, I got pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   The real estate business keeps Figg-Currier's husband, Patrick,
home in Austin, Texas, while Cindy is touring. That's a typical
LPGA family, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some players can afford nannies and don't need the service. At
least one has a nanny and uses the service anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the nanny mostly for the weeks that we're home (in
West Palm Beach, Fla.),'' said Catrin Nilsmark, mother of
16-month-old Tuva, after she shot a 68 to tie for second. ``Out
here, it's so convenient to use the day care.''
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA loves to see the child-care service written about. The
news that many of its players are wives and mothers helps to erase
the tour's most tiresome image problem.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the program's biggest impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's OK to be able to travel and have kids,'' said the
Golf Channel's Donna Caponi, who won 24 tour events in a playing
career that ended in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA program is unique no longer. The PGA has one, allowing
wives to follow players on the course without worrying about crying
children. The WNBA has one. Non-sports businesses increasingly
recognize the need for child care.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's not the ideal family life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when you say, `Why am I doing this?' ''
Figg-Currier said. ``(The kids) say, `I want to go to !ital!my!off!
house and be with my friends!' Kaitland's real close to her dad,
and last night when we hung up the phone after talking to him,
there was a quivering lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're real troopers,'' she said of the LPGA kids, ``because
it can be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   But Verive said there might actually be benefits to the extended
touring: The kids exhibit better-than-normal verbal skills, no
doubt thanks to the limited education Verive and assistant Allison
Strandquest provide. And they have no shortage of friends, since
their classmates are mostly the same from city to city.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the same nannies and the same toys every week. That
(stability) is sometimes lacking in our vagabond lifestyles,'' Dana
Dormann said.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty normal under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Now get up, William. Your mom's back from the course.

EDITORIAL: THE VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 2ndtake, 1st graf in section under subhead `Order in the
Senate' to add phrase on Lott's post-acquittal comments. Minor
editorial refinements throughout. No other changes. ) (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Feb. 13:
</P>
<P>
   In a season of frailty, the Constitution has prevailed once
again.
</P>
<P>
   It remains the great anchor rock of the Republic, enduring
through partisan storms in the Congress, immune in the end to even
so large and unpredicted a betrayal as a president's dereliction of
duty.
</P>
<P>
   If history were written on the same principles that govern news
articles, that would be the lead of the sad story of William
Jefferson Clinton and how he was spared to finish his second term.
Neither the cheapness of Clinton's liaison with Monica Lewinsky nor
the zealotry of some of his opponents should cause us to overlook
the grandeur and symmetry of the constitutional template that on
Friday produced the acquittal of the president on two articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Process
</P>
<P>
   Alarmists had argued that allowing the legal and constitutional
processes to deal with Clinton's offenses would do irreparable harm
to the political system. We had long believed that far greater harm
would flow from some kind of enablers' compact by which Congress
and the public agreed to ignore Clinton's disrespect of the
presidency, his obvious lies and his clumsy efforts to tamper with
the legal process. Although first the House and then the Senate
refused to adopt the resolution of censure advocated in this space,
we celebrate the outcome for making a point that is more important
and more lasting than this presidency. That point is simply that
American history has not yet produced a governmental conundrum that
could not be solved by careful adherence to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The President's Words
</P>
<P>
   It is to be hoped that Clinton's brief and somber Rose Garden
response to the acquittal will set the tone for the days ahead, for
it contained an admission heretofore missing in the serial evasions
and blame-layings that brought him to such a low pass. At long
last, he apologized ``for what I said and did to trigger these
events and the great burden they have imposed on the Congress and
on the American people.'' Clinton has been years too slow to
acknowledge that whatever the excesses of the other players _ some
of whom may yet be punished by the voters or the law _ this buck
started and stopped with the president.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Clinton found out on Dec. 6, 1997, that Ms.
Lewinsky was on the witness list in the Paula Jones case. He had 42
days before his sworn deposition on Jan. 17, 1998, to figure out a
way to avoid lying under oath. But his premeditated decision to lie
threw everything out of whack. The nation's legal system is not
designed to deal with blatantly irrational conduct, in this case a
calculated decision to violate the law by the person with the
utmost constitutional authority to uphold it. In the Rose Garden on
Friday, in an appearance of 82 seconds, Clinton got it at last. He
did ``trigger these events,'' and not just by reckless sexual
conduct. He plunged himself and the nation into crisis by turning
his White House into a factory for the weaving, stitching and
patching of a fabric of lies that was bound to unravel no matter
how many workers Clinton put to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr's Exit
</P>
<P>
   We shall never know, probably, just what the man thought he was
doing, or why, by the agencies of courage and truth, he could not
extricate himself. Perhaps he does not know himself. But if he is
willing to continue this reality-based contrition and get back to
the legislative business he has outlined, he deserves certain
benefits. One has to do with the future of the investigation by the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. That future needs to be, in a
word, short.
</P>
<P>
   Any thought by Starr of indicting the president now or after
2000 or through the use of sealed indictments would be, in
political terms, offensive to the Constitution, and in personal
terms, nutty. Starr heard that Friday from his biggest supporter in
Congress, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and he had better listen. This
matter has been adjudicated in the manner prescribed by the Framers
of the Constitution. As an investigation and prosecutorial matter
involving Starr, it is over. The charges were not of a magnitude to
warrant removal, and that having failed, they are not of a scale to
justify either the prosecution of a sitting president or pursuit of
a former one. If Congress wants to consider resolutions of censure
or petitions or other instruments of condemnation, they may do so
without the independent counsel's services.
</P>
<P>
   As for other investigative targets, Starr needs to indict them
or clear them and begin closing his operation. Meanwhile, the
investigation authorized into his prosecutorial techniques must
proceed according to normal Justice Department procedures. The
question of whether he lied to Attorney General Janet Reno about
contacts with Paula Jones' lawyers is a serious one. If he did, he
must be examined with the same rigor applied to the investigation
of Clinton's offenses. However that comes out, the main business
with which Starr was entrusted has been settled by the House and
Senate, and it is time for him to return to the private labors to
which he seemed so powerfully attracted.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The House's Blunders
</P>
<P>
   To commend the following of constitutional design is not to
dismiss the mistakes that prevented an earlier solution to this
matter. Those failures began in the House, where the Republican
majority too quickly succumbed to Starr's overly conclusionary
initial findings. Hyde, the Judiciary chairman, and Robert
Livingston, the would-be speaker, wasted many opportunities to
guide the Republicans toward a censure resolution that seemed from
the start more proportional to Clinton's offenses than impeachment
and removal. Their mistakes could be laid to bad judgment, but our
vote goes for cowardice. They were both intimidated by the majority
whip, Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, into supporting impeachment. If the
House managers want to blame someone for their defeat, they could
do worse than DeLay. More than any other person, he created the
atmosphere that sent them across the Capitol to argue a case that
was not strong enough to meet the constitutional standard for
removing a president.
</P>
<P>
   The managers varied widely in their abilities. Asa Hutchinson,
R-Ark., was devastating, George Gekas, R-Pa., looked irrelevant,
and Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., was easily outpointed by Ms. Lewinsky. But
all seemed infected by the decorum of the Senate and perhaps even
by the somber, focused argument of their chief adversary, White
House Counsel Charles Ruff. The managers could never recover,
however, from Hyde's defining strategic blunder. Having ruled out
fact witnesses as unnecessary in the House, he could not sell the
argument that they were suddenly essential in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Order in the Senate
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss., and his
Democratic counterpart, Tom Daschle, D-S.D., obviously learned from
watching the House. They firmly defeated early efforts by Hyde and
the House managers to set the rules for the Senate trial. As a
result, the Senate proceedings were fair and dignified and never
seemed out of control, even though Lott's remarks about the
president after his acquittal were ill advised. Given the fact that
it was obvious from the start that the 67 votes for removal were
not there, Lott did a solid job of containing the frustrations and
incendiary instincts of the most conservative members of his
caucus. He could not, however, prevent Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
from performing with his usual smarmy disingenuousness.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm blocked the bipartisan censure movement. He described his
motives as constitutional, but they were clearly based on tactics.
He wanted to prevent moderate Republican senators from opting for
censure before the final vote, and he also wanted to deny Democrats
the ability to say during the 2000 campaign that they had delivered
a just punishment to their own president.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the remarkably prescient Framers of the Constitution
could reach forward in time to invest every senator with good
judgment. But their design was vindicated in remarkable ways. The
Senate, with its longer terms and smaller membership, was intended
to be a cistern from which the water of wisdom could be drawn in a
dry time, and so it was. They intended that making the chief
justice the presiding officer would add another element of balance,
and William Rehnquist did more than fulfill that role with his
calm, taciturn rulings. He also resisted admirably the temptation
to make himself an actor rather than a stage manager in this drama.
</P>
<P>
   What Will Endure
</P>
<P>
   As the curtain fell in windy Washington, it seemed more than
ever a drama of tragical lineament. That is to say, the conflict
that swirled all round the stage originated from the conflict
within the protagonist's mind. Clinton and his constituents must
look there for even a partial understanding of the hash he has made
of his one and only presidency. Given what has been wasted, it is
understandable that Clinton would be drawn to blame a conspiracy
rather than his own addiction to reckless pleasures and bad advice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the end, we still believe that Clinton's tragedy is a
personal rather than a general one. With respect, we disagree with
Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s conclusion that because America has had a
weak president it now has a weakened presidency. The people
stepping forward from both parties to compete for the office look
capable of treating it with honor. And Congress has just
demonstrated that an impeachment based solely on partisanship
cannot succeed under a process that, like the presidency itself, is
founded on so steadfast a rock.

 STANLEY GILLETTE, 81, CLOTHING INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE

 IRWIN WATSON, 70, TV AND CLUB COMEDIAN

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stanley C. Gillette, a former clothing industry
executive, died on Feb. 4 at his home in New York City. He was 81
years old.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Joan.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette joined Phillips-Jones, the manufacturer of Van Heusen
brand shirts and other men's wear, in 1947 as a regional sales
manager. He rose to the position of vice president in charge of
sales in 1954 and was named a director the next year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Gillette was promoted to vice president for marketing
at the company, a family-held corporation that changed its name to
Phillips-Van Heusen in 1957. As vice president for marketing, he
was responsible for sales, advertising and marketing. Gillette was
named executive vice president of Phillips and president of Van
Heusen Co., a subsidiary, in 1963, positions he held for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette left Phillips in 1975 to become chairman and president
of McGregor-Doniger, a men's sportswear manufacturer. In 1979, he
joined Ship 'n Shore, part of General Mills Fashion Group, as
chairman and president, where he was also a vice president of
General Mills.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Gillette left General Mills to start a management
consulting company. He retired in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette attended City College, Columbia University and New York
University. He worked in the apparel industry in New York after
serving in World War II in the Army medical corps before he joined
Phillips-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Patty
Gillette of Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.; a son, Richard, of Forestville,
Calif.; four grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Midi Garth, 83, Choreographer and Dancer
</P>
<P>
   Midi Garth, a modern-dance choreographer and performer known for
her individuality, died on Jan. 28 at the Jewish Home and Hospital
in Manhattan. She was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garth came to prominence in the mid-1950s with dances
notable for a spareness and precision of gesture unusual in a time
of literary and psychological dances. She later established a small
ensemble but was best known for solos like her signature 1959
``Anonymous,'' in which movements were whispered rather than
shouted, as Don McDonagh put it in his ``Complete Guide to Modern
Dance.'' Dressed in black with her head covered, Ms. Garth
alternated between twitches and aimless swaying, driven, it seemed,
by the sound of a metronome.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garth was much praised in the 1950s. John Martin, writing in
The New York Times, described her as ``a dancer born and bred, with
a natural gift for movement'' and ``a single-mindedness that
commands and holds the attention.'' But by the late 1960s and into
the late '70s, when Ms. Garth performed infrequently, her dances
were described as cold and obscure.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garth, who was born in New York, studied at the New Dance
Group and at the Martha Graham school, where her teachers included
Louis Horst. Her greatest influence was Sybil Shearer, with whom
she worked in Chicago. Ms. Garth also taught dance.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.
</P>
<P>
   Albert B. Hudes, 75, Fund-Raiser for Opera
</P>
<P>
   Albert Beryl Hudes, who organized galas that raised millions of
dollars for the New York City Opera and March of Dimes Birth Defect
Foundation, died Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   He had suffered from a bone-marrow cancer called multiple
myeloma and from chronic kidney failure, said his friend and
co-executor, Stephen Kirschenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   Hudes (pronounced HEW-dees) held degrees from Harvard and Yale
and was a foreign service officer in the 1950s. After a corporate
career in the 1960s and '70s, he served as director of development
for City Opera and as a consultant to the March of Dimes.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center and former
general director of City Opera, credited Hudes with having raised
$1 million for the opera in a single night _ Oct. 27, 1980 _ at a
farewell gala on the occasion of her final performance as an opera
singer. Patrons paid up to $1,000 a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jennifer L. Howse, president of the March of Dimes, said the
Gourmet Galas organized by Hudes in the 1980s were the ``premier
fund-raising events'' for the charity, typically raising $750,000
in a night.
</P>
<P>
   Hudes is survived by his sister, Ethel Linn of Coconut Creek,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin Watson, 70, TV and Club Comedian
</P>
<P>
   Irwin C. Watson, a comedian who appeared frequently on
television in the 1950s and '60s and in nightclubs throughout the
country, died on Feb. 1 at the Winter Park Memorial Hospital in
Orlando, Fla. He was 70 and lived in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Edlyne O. Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Watson belonged to the generation of black comedians that
included Redd Foxx and Slappy White, with whom he performed.
</P>
<P>
   He was a familiar presence on the television shows of Johnny
Carson, Ed Sullivan, Mike Douglas and many others. He also
performed with singers, including Sammy Davis Jr., Bobby Darin,
Dakota Staton, Shirley Bassey, Gladys Knight, Aretha Franklin and,
most recently, Natalie Cole.
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared at most of the major resort hotels in the
Catskills and Poconos.
</P>
<P>
   Watson toured West Africa in 1981. He performed on Norwegian
American Cruise Line ships up to the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two children, Rodwin
and Regina, of Brooklyn, and two sisters, Bernice O'Neil of
Brooklyn and Cynthia Thorp of Barbados.

KINGS START TO FEEL INVINCIBLE
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It remains to be seen whether the Los
Angeles Kings' dramatic comeback Thursday against Philadelphia will
be remembered as the event that turned their season around or
simply a pleasant break in a year rife with disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   They'll begin to find out at 6:30 tonight when they play host to
the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the mood around the Kings clearly was lighter than it
recently has been, the result of a three-goal rally in the final
3:08 Thursday night that turned a 3-1 deficit against the Flyers
into a 4-3 victory. Jozef Stumpel scored the game-winner with
0:00.3 on the clock with a 60-foot blast that deflected off Flyers
defenseman Eric Desjardins and through the pads of goalie Ron
Hextall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big difference I notice is the atmosphere in the dressing
room,'' coach Larry Robinson said following Friday's practice at
the Forum. ``Everybody is kind of upbeat, laughing and giggling.
It's great to be able to go home and be able to feel great about
something for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Rob Blake said, ``You can just see the excitement.
It's a huge difference. But the thing is we've got to build off it.
You can see the excitement. There hasn't been that much of it
around here for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory over the Flyers moved the Kings (19-29-4) to within
four points of Edmonton in the race for the eighth and final
playoff berth in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was similar to a 5-4 victory over Detroit on March
31, 1979, in which they rallied with goals in the final 2:57 by
Butch Goring, Charlie Simmer and Mike Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings became only the second team this decade to win a game
with a goal in the last second. Pierre Turgeon scored with one
second left to give Montreal a 4-3 victory over Toronto on Oct. 21,
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have scored the game-winner with one second left two
other times in their history. Ross Lonsberry scored with one second
left in a 5-4 victory over the New York Rangers on Jan. 28, 1970,
and Steve Kasper scored in the last second of a 6-5 victory over
Vancouver on Oct. 13, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers weren't the only ones surprised by the Kings'
comeback. After Thursday's game, Kings media relations director
Mike Altieri returned to his office and turned on the television
just in time to hear Channel 13 report on its sports report that
the Kings had lost to the Flyers 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Even deal: Two forwards who have appeared in a combined 50 games
this season and have failed to score a single goal changed uniforms
when the Kings traded left wing Eric Lacroix to the New York
Rangers for center Sean Pronger, a former member of the Mighty
Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings acquired Lacroix, 27, from Colorado in October for
center Roman Vopat and a 1999 sixth-round draft choice. In 34 games
this season, Lacroix has recorded one assist.
</P>
<P>
   Pronger, 27, is the older brother of St. Louis Blues star
defenseman Chris Pronger. Sean Pronger began the season in the
Pittsburgh Penguins' organization, but was traded to the Rangers in
November. He had three assists in 16 games with New York.
</P>
<P>
   Murray close: Robinson said right wing Glen Murray, sidelined
since Jan. 2 with a torn medial collateral ligament in his right
knee, might return to the lineup as soon as Monday, when the Kings
play host to the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who began skating Monday, was more cautious in his
prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally my decision, how my leg feels and if I feel good
enough,'' Murray said, adding that a return Monday against the
Ducks hardly is carved in stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``But (returning) next week, I've kind of carved in stone,''
said Murray, who plays on the power play, kills penalties and is
second in scoring on the Kings with 28 points despite missing the
past 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Defenseman Mark Visheau, sidelined with a congenital
urinary tract obstruction, is expected to undergo surgery next week
and miss the rest of the season.... Winger Steve McKenna skated
Friday for the first time since suffering an abdominal strain on
Dec. 9.... Winger Sandy Moger was struck by a puck and suffered a
broken nose about 30 seconds after scoring his goal Thursday night.
He said he can play wearing a shield, but Robinson said he might
hold Moger out of the lineup tonight to give him a rest.... Andrew
Felix and Kimberly Decker of Huntington Beach are scheduled to be
married tonight at the Forum before the third period.

UCLA FALLS TO STANFORD
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's grasp on the Pacific-10 Conference women's
race has slipped.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Lindsey Yamasaki's 3-point basket with 3.8 seconds
remaining lifted Stanford to an 87-84 victory over the 12th-ranked
Bruins on Friday night at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   That basket also dropped UCLA (18-6, 10-2) into a first-place
tie with Oregon. Stanford (13-9, 9-2), also drew closer with its
sixth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal got a career-best 34 points and 39 minutes from
senior Regan Frueur. Her previous high was 23. Carolyn Moos added
17 points and 11 rebounds, and Yamasaki had 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins got 22 points each from Maylana Martin and LaCresha
Flannigan. Crescenta Valley High graduate Michelle Greco added 11
points.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA made up a 13-point deficit in the final seven minutes,
tying the score at 84 on a Flannigan free throw with 25.8 seconds
to play. The Bruins also cut a 12-point halftime deficit down to
one earlier in the half.

RANGERS ONLY HOPE THIS IS BOTTOM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Home not-so-sweet home.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal for Brian Leetch. Alas, however, another game with
only one goal. And in the end, another numbing defeat for the
Rangers at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   After their 3-1 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes Friday night,
the Rangers (20-25-7 over all, 11-12-2 at home) are a game below
.500 at the Garden this season and a season-high five games under
.500 over all.
</P>
<P>
   Home-ice advantage?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been no advantage wherever we've been,'' said Leetch, the
Rangers' captain.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's defeat, coupled with Washington's victory over
the Devils, dropped the Rangers into 12th place in the Eastern
Conference, ahead of only the lowly Islanders and the pitiful Tampa
Bay Lightning. Eight conference teams make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible,'' Wayne Gretzky said of the Rangers' play at
home. ``And I think we should be extremely embarrassed by it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have scored one goal or less in 21 games this
season, so Friday night they went out and acquired a gritty forward
in Eric Lacroix. Trouble is, he has not scored a goal this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lacroix's an aggressive hockey player,'' Coach John Muckler
said. ``He works hard. He's an initiator, a grinding type of
player, which is something we need.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Rangers really need is more goals. Curtis Leschyshyn,
in the first period, and Sami Kapanen, in the second, each scored
on weird deflections for Carolina. And after skating through a
pedestrian first 40 minutes, the Rangers trailed, 2-0, after two
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the Rangers were able to level 20 shots on
Carolina goaltender Arturs Irbe before the second intermission. But
shots are not goals. And because most of them came from long range,
and went straight into Irbe's body, there were very few rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Things have become so bad at home for the Rangers that when the
public address announcer announced the last minute of play in the
second period, some fans started cheering. Others began to jeer
Petr Nedved, who has just two goals in his last 17 games. And when
the period ended, the fans _ predictably _ showered the Rangers
with boos.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the hard-hitting defenseman Jeff
Beukeboom was kneed in the back of the head by Martin Gelinas in
the final two minutes of the period and did not return. Beukeboom,
who complained of dizziness, will be re-evaluated Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Leetch briefly rallied the Garden crowd 40 seconds into the
final period with his third goal in three games (after Leetch had
gone 23 games without a goal). But Bates Battaglia put the game
away for Carolina at 8 minutes 30 seconds of the period by chopping
a high pass from Ray Sheppard out of mid-air and past Mike Richter
for a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Leetch's goal was the only bright spot for the Rangers. It was
set up by Todd Harvey, who made a Gretzky-ish pirouette and curl
down left wing, before passing to Leetch at the top of the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Leetch blasted a slap shot off Irbe and into the net. Harvey had
an assist in his first appearance after missing 10 games with a
sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   The goal _ Leetch's ninth of the season _ moved the defenseman
into a tie for 18th place on the Rangers' goal-scoring list with
Tomas Sandstrom at 173. But even though the Rangers fired 31 shots
on Irbe, Leetch's goal was their only one.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Rangers can't even score on the power play. They went 0
for 5 Friday night and are 5 for their last 52 over their last 12
games. With only 30 games left in the regular season, the Rangers
are in real danger of missing the playoffs again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's discouraging is that we have to as a team understand
and realize that we're fortunate enough to be in a position where
we are still battling for a playoff spot,'' said an obviously
miffed Gretzky, who was double-shifted at times on Friday night.
``And we just keep giving games away. And it's always the same
way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' said Richter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brutal,'' Mathieu Schneider said.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   During the game, the Rangers announced that they had traded
center SEAN PRONGER to the Los Angeles Kings for left wing ERIC
LACROIX, the son of Colorado General Manager PIERRE LACROIX. It was
the second time this season Lacroix has been traded. His father
dealt him earlier after Lacroix _ who requested the deal _ had
played just seven games this season with the Avalanche. In 34
games, Lacroix has no goals and one assist with a minus-7 rating.
In a television interview, Rangers President NEIL SMITH
characterized Lacroix, 27, as ``a third- or fourth-liner; a
hustling, hard-checking player.''
</P>
<P>
   For Pronger, too, it was the second trade this season. He was
acquired from Pittsburgh on Nov. 25 with PETR NEDVED and CHRIS
TAMER for ALEKSEI KOVALEV and HARRY YORK. In 16 games this season,
14 with the Rangers, Pronger has no goals and three assists with a
minus-3 rating. &QL;

DEVILS DROP THEIR THIRD STRAIGHT AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In their attempt to get back in rhythm
playing in front of their fans, the Devils have been trying just
about everything. For Friday's encounter against the Washington
Capitals, for example, the Devils even eliminated the traditional
morning skate.
</P>
<P>
   But as in the previous two games here, losses to Toronto and
Vancouver, the Devils had a great deal of difficulty playing at
home Friday night and endured their third consecutive loss at
Continental Arena, 3-2, to the Capitals. The loss extended the
Devils' streak without a victory at home to five games (0-4-1) and
gave the Capitals their sixth consecutive victory, their longest
winning streak in six years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bright spots for the Devils in the previous two
losses _ and in the nine games before that _ had been their
efficiency in killing penalties.
</P>
<P>
   But that ability failed on Friday. The Devils entered the game
having allowed just one goal on 37 manpower advantages for the
opposition over the last 11 games, but in the second period they
allowed the Capitals two power-play goals 2 minutes 22 seconds
apart. It proved costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The special teams didn't do well tonight,'' said goalie Martin
Brodeur, who faced 21 shots, ``but you don't win anything in the
regular season. We're going through a tough stretch right now. It's
frustrating, but we showed some improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   The power-play goals came after Petr Bondra opened the scoring
for the Capitals 3:54 into the game during confusion in front of
Brodeur. Then Lyle Odelein tied it at 1-1, 5:44 into the second
period, from high in the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Bulis put the Capitals ahead by 2-1 when he scored the first
power-play goal 7:14 into the period. He beat Brodeur with a clean
shot to the near post from the top of the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   The second power-play goal came after a crisp exchange between
Bulis and Steve Konowalchuk in limited space near Brodeur.
Konowalchuk got the return pass for his 11th goal of the season,
from close range on the right 9:26 into the period.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Pederson brought the Devils within 3-2 with his eighth
goal of the season when he converted Sykora's pass from the left
side with 7:07 left in the second period. It was the last bright
moment in the game for the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who are 11-11-5 at home and 29-18-6 over all, showed
some improvement, but they failed to play with a high level of
intensity until the third period, especially in the late stages of
the period.
</P>
<P>
   They had a marvelous opportunity to tie the score after they
were awarded a man advantage with 1:16 left, when Washington's
Andrei Nokolishin was penalized for delay of game by gloving the
puck, and the Devils pulled Brodeur to have six skaters against
four.
</P>
<P>
   Randy McKay scored what appeared to be a goal in the frantic
final moments with 18.9 seconds left, but the whistle had blown and
the official said that Mark Tinordi of Washington had covered the
puck with his glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was behind the goal on the other side,'' McKay said of the
referee, Terry Gregson. ``He was in no position to see.''
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   The losing streak at home is starting to reflect on the
attendance. A crowd of 14,111 showed up for the game, rather poor
on a Friday night against a rival in the Eastern Conference. . . .
With Carolina visiting Saturday night, Coach ROBBIE FTOREK gave BOB
CARPENTER the night off. &UR;  &LR;  ... SERGEI BRYLIN &UR;  &LR; and KEVIN DEAN were
the scratches for the Devils. &QL;

PREDATORS GOALIE SMOTHERS ISLANDERS' SCORING CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ If there is a new reality for the Islanders,
it is not so different from the old reality.
</P>
<P>
   The work ethic that the team's new coach, Bill Stewart, tried to
hammer home following its lackluster effort against Washington
might have taken root, but it did not work Friday night. Despite
what Stewart called 17 dead-on scoring chances, it was the
expansion Nashville Predators who skated away with the 2-1 victory
at Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville goalie Mike Dunham, with 40 saves, had a brilliant
game, making spectacular stop after spectacular stop, particularly
during a feverish third period in which the Islanders tried
desperately to score _ to no avail. They dropped to 16-33-5, and
with 28 games left in the regular season they are 16 points from
the last playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played pretty hard,'' said Stewart, who is 3-4-2
since taking over as coach from Mike Milbury. ``We had 41 shots on
goal. We had numerous scoring chances. Unfortunately, we didn't put
the puck in the net. We created enough scoring chances to come away
with more than one goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Kenny Jonsson, their top defenseman and power-play
leader, back in the lineup, the Islanders were unable to take
advantage of a number of opportunities in the first two periods.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone 2 for 45 on power plays during Jonsson's nine-game
absence with a sprained knee, the Islanders scored Friday while
skating with a two-man advantage. The goal came 9 minutes 40
seconds into the game.
</P>
<P>
   With right wing Tom Fitzgerald (interference) and the center
Sebastien Bordeleau (obstruction-holding) in the penalty box and
the Predator defense keying on Jonsson, Trevor Linden fielded a
bullet pass across the goal mouth from Craig Janney and banged the
puck past Dunham for his 13th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Dunham signaled what kind of a game he was going
to have with a dazzling glove save on a hard shot by right wing
Mariusz Czerkawski that would have given the Islanders a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the difference,'' Stewart said of Dunham, formerly a
backup with the Devils. ``He made numerous first stops and second
stops. Their goaltender outdueled our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the first period, with the Predators having just killed
off power play No. 4, Nashville center Cliff Ronning beat Islanders
goalie Felix Potvin on his stick side to tie the game. The goal
came at 16:37.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Predators were outshot by the Islanders, 26-17,
through the first two periods, they were able to take advantage of
Potvin even as the Islanders continued to be frustrated by Dunham.
</P>
<P>
   At 14:06 of the second period, right wing Sergei Krivakrasov
picked up a pass from Ronning and knocked the off-balance shot
through Potvin's legs to a chorus of boos from the announced crowd
of 10,324. That goal gave the Predators a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders continued to pepper Dunham through the final
period, especially on power play No. 6, at 12:40, but there was no
getting anything past the 26-year-old goalie, who is 12-12-2 this
season. Potvin dropped to 1-6-1 in eight games since the Islanders
obtained him in a trade with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look reality in the face and move on,'' Stewart
said. ``We're looking for respectability around the league, and
wins do that.'' &QL;

REIGN IN MAINE GOES ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take a look at the University of Maine now and at the same point
last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Bears are 17-5 and leading the America East Conference
_ as they were last season. And their leading scorer once again
averages more than 23 points per game and ranks in the top four
nationally in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   But grab your magnifying glass and you'll see that these Black
Bears are vastly different than last season's NCAA Tournament team.
</P>
<P>
   Gone is Cindy Blodgett, the school's all-time leading scorer and
the NCAA's fourth all-time leading scorer
</P>
<P>
   In Blodgett's place is junior Jamie Cassidy, who stands 7 inches
taller than her predecessor. But don't tell her that she took
Blodgett's place, because she didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole team has to fill her shoes, it's not just me,''
Cassidy said. ``Its definitely different because we have more ball
movement this year and we're harder to defend. I still miss playing
with her, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy, who averaged 17.6 points last season as a sophomore and
averages 23.4 points per game this season _ fourth in the nation _
has 15 games this season with 20 or more points. She scored 41
points against Middle Tennessee. She has led the Black Bears in
scoring 18 times and in rebounding 14 times.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the numbers, her argument about the team _ not her _
filling Blodgett's shoes has merit; junior guard Amy Vachon is
fourth in the nation in assists, averaging 8.2 per game, and two
other players average in double figures in points.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one replaces Cindy, but I knew Jamie would have a banner
year,'' Maine coach Joanne Palombo-McCallie said. ``She is the
prototype post player. She's naturally comfortable with her back to
the basket, but she is a great passer and has the ability to go by
people.''
</P>
<P>
   As her game grows, maybe Cassidy's name will become as
synonymous with Maine basketball as Blodgett's was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's flattering because she's a great player, but we've gotten
tired of it,'' Cassidy said. ``It seems like every question is
about her, and just because she isn't here, people expected us not
to be as good.''
</P>
<P>
   The players are different, but the results stay the same.
SPOTLIGHT: VIRGINIA TECH'S TERE WILLIAMS
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing up in Chapel Hill, N.C., home of North Carolina,
Virginia Tech forward Tere Williams grew up dreaming of one day
playing for Duke.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had it all planned out: Duke would sign her and she
would finish her basketball career as a Blue Devil. One problem:
Duke backed off during her senior year and the dream was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Those dashed dreams have turned into a nightmare for schools
that wavered on her, because Williams has become the Hokies'
leading scorer and rebounder the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Duke backed off, I was thinking I would get an academic
scholarship and go there,'' Williams said. ``I didn't know where
Virginia Tech was or that they were 9-22 the year before I got
here.''

   The 5-foot-11 Williams was the Atlantic-10 co-rookie of the year
last season as the Hokies made the NCAA Tournament, advancing to
the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought this would happen,'' Williams said. ``What
freshman thinks they're going to lead their team in scoring? I
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, she has improved her scoring (16.4) and rebounding
(7.8) to team highs for No. 11 Tech (22-1 before its game
yesterday) which is having its best season ever. Those are nice
statistics, but Williams has her mind on something larger. The
Final Four perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going the distance,'' Williams said. ``I've never
played in a title game ever, and somewhere along the line I want to
play in one. That's going the distance.''
JUNIOR COLLEGE RUSH
</P>
<P>
   In about two weeks, coaches will begin the annual rush for the
top junior college players.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which has five teams ranked in the top 10 in the latest
Top 25 National Junior College Athletic Association poll, has some
of the top JC players in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Yalika Barnes of top-ranked Trinity Valley has signed with
Alabama, and Tyler Junior College guard Stacy Goudeau has signed
with Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The real prize, however, might be 5-8 guard Karlita Washington
of eighth-ranked Howard College.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sets her apart is that she can create her own shot off
the dribble and she's a good enough shooter to play the two-guard
spot at the Division I level,'' said Lady Hawks coach Matt Corkery,
whose team is 23-2.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, who signed with Nebraska after completing her high
school career in Washington, D.C., is being recruited by Rutgers,
Old Dominion, Kansas, Florida and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   She averages more than 20 points per game and cannot sign a
letter of intent until the first week of April.
BABY FEST '99
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State coach Charli Turner Thorne gave birth to her first
child, Conor Troy, at 3:55 a.m. Tuesday in Tempe, Ariz. He weighed
8 pounds, 3 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old coach returned to practice Thursday to prepare
the Sun Devils to play archrival Arizona today.
</P>
<P>
   Before ASU's game against Washington on Feb. 6 _ her due date _
Thorne said: ``I asked them to inspire me. After the game I went
back in and told them that they had inspired me and now I'm ready
to push.''
</P>
<P>
   About two hours before Thorne's delivery, in the same hospital,
ASU associate director of athletics Sandy Hatfield Clubb gave birth
to her first child, Tristan Lee.
HIRE ME
</P>
<P>
   Sam Jankovich, Cal State-Northridge interim director of
athletics, says he has a problem: He isn't sure whether coach
Frozena Jerro will coach next season.
</P>
<P>
   Here's your answer: Hire her.
</P>
<P>
   Jerro, given the basketball job on an interim basis in November
after Mike Abraham resigned amid federal drug trafficking charges,
is one victory from leading the Matadors (14-6, 8-2 in the Big Sky)
to a school record for victories in a season in Division I.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a great barometer,'' Jankovich said. ``We're going to
get the best basketball coach we can get, but yet, they're going to
have to compare to her, and that's a pretty good comparison. We're
going to have her as the person everyone has to measure up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Two possible factors working against her are age _ she's 27 _
plus that she is two years removed from coaching at a junior high
school.

SCHEDULE TO PICK UP FOR STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Brett Hull had a great idea earlier in the
season.
</P>
<P>
   At least he thought it was a great idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said that what the NHL needs to do is have you
play every other night for the entire season,'' the Stars winger
said. ``I think that's what all players want, just a nice
consistent pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Scheduling conflicts and travel problems aside, Hull's plan
sounds like a perfect scenario. And that's exactly what the Stars
will face for the remainder of the season. At least in principle.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars play their final 34 games over 66 days, beginning last
night in a late game against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim at the
Arrowhead Pond. And while there are back-to-back situations and
relatively long homestands followed by relatively long road trips,
the Stars say they're happy about the pace and ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sitting around doesn't do anyone any good,'' Stars
defenseman Craig Ludwig said of a 10-game span in which the Stars
played only one game. ``We've always played well when we play a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig has a point. The Stars rolled up their franchise-best
15-game unbeaten streak earlier in the season when they played
those games in 33 nights. They are 12-0-4 in back-to-back games and
last season were 23-11-2 when playing on consecutive nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to play well when we get in a groove,'' Stars center
Mike Modano said. ``That's just who we are as a team. For the past
three years we've been a team that likes to play every other day,
that doesn't think about the next game or the last game, just the
game we're playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock prepared for the ensuing onslaught
when the Stars play their next 13 games in 22 days by allowing them
to take two days off without skating in Newport Beach, Calif. While
Hitchcock said the team might have short-term rust because of the
off days, he said he believes they will be better off in the long
run.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to restingat the beginning of the final flurry,
Hitchcock also has prescribed rest days within the schedule.
Players like Guy Carbonneau, 38, and Ludwig, 37, will likely get
some practice days off and possibly a game or two of rest. With
center Brian Skrudland out 4 to 6 weeks with torn rib cartilage,
Carbonneau will become an even more important member of the fourth
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to look at things like that and keep close tabs on it
as the days go on,'' Hitchcock said. ``We might have to give some
days off or switch the lineups around. That said, we are in the
business of winning and we're going to put the lineup out there
that has the best chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said he hasn't decided whether he should bring in
extra players from the Michigan K-Wings to add depth. Left wingers
Jason Botterill, Jamie Wright, Dave Roberts and Jon Sim are
candidates to join the team. But Hitchcock said he doesn't want to
bring in players and let them sit the way defenseman Sergey Gusev
has.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to be here, we want them to play,'' Hitchcock
said. ``Wherever they are, we want them to be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stick around enough during this schedule and there should be
playing time for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to go,'' defenseman and captain Derian Hatcher
said. ``We've been waiting for this.''
</P>

BURKE WON'T STAY AT AWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coyotes owner Richard Burke, responding to reports about a
possible $10 million renovation plan to America West Arena, said he
has no intention of keeping his NHL team at the downtown Phoenix
arena beyond the 2000-2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   That is when the club's five-year lease agreement with the
building ends, and it's also the time Burke expects the Coyotes to
begin play in a new 20,000-seat hockey arena that would be the
centerpiece of Los Arcos redevelopment project in south Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   A reconfiguration plan to America West Arena, which would
address the 4,500 sight-obstructed seats at hockey games, will be
unveiled in less than two weeks, sources told ``The Arizona
Republic'' on Wednesday. The sources also said the plan has been
endorsed by the city of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, however, said the Coyotes never have been contacted or
consulted on any new renovation plans. He also questioned whether
the plan actually exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it and I don't care at this point,'' he said.
``For the record, we've never got a proposal from them about
anything. Not one single time in two years have we received
anything regarding improvements for us at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, we've already made it clear we cannot go down two
different routes at the same time. We're committed to the Los Arcos
project. There are no alternatives at America West Arena. Our lease
there is up in 2{ years. Los Arcos is the only option available to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Solving the sight-obstructed seat problem, Burke said, isn't
enough to keep the team's interests at America West. The hockey
club, which will lose an estimated $4 million or more this season,
doesn't reap enough revenue streams through luxury suits or signage
to financially continue operating out of the downtown arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't stay there. Financially, it just doesn't make any
sense,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a Michigan architecture firm developed a $20 million
renovation plan that was designed to eliminate most of the
obstructed-view seats. But it would have required shutting down the
arena for at least two summers, and arena management deemed it too
costly.
</P>
<P>
   Arena management, a subsidiary of the Suns organization, sought
to develop a cheaper alternative but hasn't revealed details.
</P>
<P>
   NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, the man who helped broker a deal
between the arena and the then-Winnipeg Jets/Burke, said he backs
the Coyotes' pursuit of a new arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any question that no major league team
could survive long term in America West Arena under the current
circumstances,'' Bettman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman said the obstructed-view seats and lease conflicts _
such as exclusivity clauses that prevent the Coyotes from selling
some sponsorships _ make the arena unworkable for a hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more gate dependent than the other leagues. While our
network (television) revenues have increased 12-fold in the last
five years, we're still lagging behind the other leagues by a
contract or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke said the Los Arcos arena ``will get done,'' but he openly
worries if the project is being sabotaged by outsiders. He
questioned the timing of various rumors that have circulated at key
points along the project's path, including talk this week that he
may be on the verge of selling the Coyotes' franchise _ a month
before a referendum vote on the arena issue.
</P>
<P>
   Burke vehemently denied the rumor Thursday night. He has been
seeking potential investment parters, however, since co-owner
Steven Gluckstern sold his share in the Coyotes back to Burke last
year to become an owner of the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no earthly idea where these things come from and I
don't care,'' Burke said. ``It isn't important to me. I'd just
appreciate whoever's doing it to stop.'' &QL;

   SALT LAKE CITY _ Posing as a member of the International Olympic
Committee is the only way to travel.
</P>
<P>
   I flew here . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``First class,'' the flight attendant said.
</P>
<P>
   Winking, she ushered me from the back of the main cabin to the
front of the plane, where she informed an elderly woman that 1A was
``my'' seat. She would have to sit somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The chardonnay was delightful.
</P>
<P>
   During lunch, I hardly noticed what sounded like a cane rapping
angrily against the inside of the toilet door.
</P>
<P>
   A limo driver waiting at the gate held a sign: ``Mr.
Samaranch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's me,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   At the hotel, the bellman put away my luggage and opened the
drapes in the presidential suite. ````Anything'' else, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   I tipped him $5.
</P>
<P>
   He gave me $500 in change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some extra towels?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How about a Rolex? Need a nose job? Free root canal? Jazz
tickets? Maybe a fur coat for the wife?''
</P>
<P>
   It is fortunate that the Winter Olympics won't begin until 2002.
This community will need three years to clean up its house and its
image and its air.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption produces an odor, like rotten meat. The foul smell
may never completely go away.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to say who is more despicable, the Salt Lake
people who did everything they could to buy the Olympics or the IOC
members whose votes were for sale.
</P>
<P>
   If you think the Starr Report was offensive, try reading the
300-page ethics panel report.
</P>
<P>
   Before Salt Lake City was awarded the Winter Games, bid
committee members provided cash, free vacations including Super
Bowl trips and free medical treatment to at least 24 IOC members
and their families.
</P>
<P>
   One executive loaned the wife of an IOC member $30,000. He
transferred the money from his children's trust account.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an IOC member from Swaziland received $110,000 in
tuition and living expenses from the bid committee while attending
the University of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   During visits to Salt Lake, IOC members and families went on
shopping sprees. They charged host committee credit cards $268 for
lawn equipment, $524 for a violin, $673 for doorknobs.
</P>
<P>
   At one department store, IOC delegates spent $7,054 for
fragrances. ``Eau de'' ``phew''. &QL;  &QL; 
Family fun &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Ganga is a first-ballot nominee for induction into
the Olympic Scandal Hall of Fame. He is a gold medalist. Ganga
apparently didn't have one hand out; he had both.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ethics report, the Salt Lake committee spent
$250,000 on the IOC member and his family. On visits here, Ganga
even brought his mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   The Ganga family took full advantage of Salt Lake's
comprehensive health plan. Jean-Claude was treated, free of charge,
for hepatitis. His mother-in-law underwent a hip replacement
operation. His wife had cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude and eight other IOC members have resigned or been
expelled. Three others are under investigation. One received a
warning. Another died, maybe from embarrassment. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   IOC guidelines called for members to to accept gifts worth no
more than $150. President Juan Antonio Samaranch accepted a limited
edition rifle worth $9,000. What kind of example is he? &QL;  &QL; 
Man at the top &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch allowed the abuses of power to go unchecked. One-fifth
of his membership has been implicated in the bribes-for-votes
scandal. Yet the leader of this five-ring circus hasn't offered to
step down himself.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, it seems, there is a new revelation into wrongdoing.
No wonder John Hancock Insurance canceled $20 million in TV ads to
protest the IOC's handling of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   What should be done to those with dirty hands? Resignations and
expulsions aren't enough. They should be ``punished,'' especially
old Jean-Claude.
</P>
<P>
   In 2002, I'd make him judge ice dancing. &QL;

PEPPERDINE FALLS TO USF

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Among the 3,509 in War Memorial Gym on Friday
was a certain San Francisco resident dressed in jeans and a light
blue shirt. Although best known for his acting and comedy routines,
he likely found no humor in the sloppy, grinding game he witnessed
from the top row.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Robin Williams probably saw better basketball on Ork
than he did in San Francisco's 56-44 victory over Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   This was worse than Patch Adams. The Waves committed a
season-high 27 turnovers and shot a season-low 31 percent from the
field. Leading scorer Jelani Gardner made 1 of 11 shots and
committed five turnovers. Forward Kelvin Gibbs, the No. 2 scorer,
was 0 for 5 and had six turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys that this may be the most discouraging loss
since we've been here,'' said third-year Pepperdine coach Lorenzo
Romar. ``We've never been in a position with this much at stake. If
we have a successful weekend, we go home with a chance to play for
the conference championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Waves (17-9, 8-3) trail Gonzaga by two games with
three remaining. The Bulldogs may have the regular-season title
secured before they visit Pepperdine next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves' season _ and postseason _ hinges on their ability to
purge this defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems this has been a pretty resilient group,'' Romar said.
``We lost to Gonzaga pretty good (last month) and won our next
(six). We lost to Loyola Marymount (last week), and the next night
we played our best game of the year (against LMU).''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco had lost 15 of its previous 17 and wasn't much
better Friday. The Dons committed 16 turnovers and shot 42.2
percent from the field, but they executed when it counted _
outscoring Pepperdine 7-2 to break the game open in the final
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Senior guard Gerald Zimmerman, fully recovered from a right
wrist injury that kept him out of four recent games, led the Dons
with 23 points and staked them to a 21-9 lead with several early
baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, we have bad starts,'' Dons coach Phil Matthews said.
``This was very important for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves held USF without a field goal for eight minutes to
start the second half and took their first lead with 12:28 left.
But instead of capitalizing, Pepperdine snoozed. Its offense shut
down, plagued by a series of bad passes and ill-timed shots, and
its defense softened, allowing the Dons to convert back-to-back
layups and take a 42-35 lead with 7:18 left.
</P>
<P>
   A timeout appeared to settle the Waves, who closed to 44-40 on
Gardner's 3-pointer from them left wing _ his only basket _ and
Gibbs' free throws.
</P>
<P>
   But the inspiration did not last. Pepperdine committed turnovers
on three of its next four possessions.
</P>
<P>
   With under two minutes left, Zimmerman dribbled past Tommie
Prince, slashed down the right side and scored a layup despite Marc
McDowell's foul. The three-point play gave the Dons a 51-42 lead.

   So when Crowe comes off the bench for the Cal State Northridge
men's basketball team tonight against Montana State, he may be
playing in his final home game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to look at this as my last game in front of this
crowd,'' Crowe said. ``Coach (Bobby) Braswell always says to treat
each game like it might be your last.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the NCAA, Crowe is completing his ninth semester.
College athletes are granted five years _ 10 semesters _ to play
four. That would give Crowe just one more semester of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN is petitioning the NCAA to grant Crowe an extra semester,
making him available for all of next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely feel I have a good case,'' Crowe said. ``For two
reasons. One, I was a part-time student at Wayne State. Second, I
didn't participate in any practices with the team. I wasn't on the
team. I didn't gain any advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Inglewood High in 1994 (where he was a
teammate of current Boston Celtic Paul Pierce), Crowe attended
Wayne State for two semesters. In the fall, he took nine units; in
the spring 11.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA generally regards students taking 12 units to be
full-time. Crowe also took a ``withdrawal'' from a class that
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe, who is scheduled to earn his degree in mathematics next
December, didn't know about the oversight until last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of his college career reads like a travelogue. In 1995,
Crowe transferred to L.A. Trade Tech, a junior college, where he
averaged 21 points and seven assists for one season.
</P>
<P>
   Then he transferred to American University in Washington D.C.
But Crowe left American even though he ``fell in love with the
school and the atmosphere,'' after coach Chris Knoche was fired. He
enrolled at CSUN, where he sat out the 1997-98 season because of
the NCAA's rule on four-year transfer students.
</P>
<P>
   His constant movement in college has taken a toll; he has
started just five of the Matadors' 23 games and is averaging 4.1
points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I'm not putting up big-time numbers, I'm starting
to understand what I can accomplish at this university,'' Crowe
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing only 18 minutes per game, Crowe is second on the
team in assists with 86.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely has been solid for us,'' CSUN coach Bobby
Braswell said. ``Jason is willing to do whatever you ask him to do.
Every time he steps out on the floor he gives 100 percent; he gives
us a lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowe was hard on himself after going 0 for 6 from the field in
the Matadors' 74-68 loss to Montana on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe missed two layups and two free throws, all in the final 10
minutes. He played despite a 103-degree fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I hurt the team by playing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the NCAA decision on his petition looming, he said he
didn't have a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never want to miss a game,'' he said. ``I don't want to lose
my spot in the rotation.''

BRUINS BURNED BY CALGARY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ They had played giant killer in their last
game, going into Colorado to face the red-hot Avalanche, who had
won 12 straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames played David to their Goliath Tuesday night and ended
the impressive streak.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, former Bruin coach Brian Sutter's young team won
its third in a row, as Jarome Iginla tipped in a shot with 3.4
seconds left in regulation to give Calgary a 4-3 victory over the
Bruins that ended the visitor's modest three-game unbeaten streak
(2-0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Flames right wing Valeri Bure scored a power-play goal against
the league's best penalty killers at 14:19 of the third period to
give the Flames a 3-2 lead, but Joe Thornton tied it at 18:55 as
the game appeared headed into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins struck first when left wing Sergei Samsonov tallied
his 19th goal midway through the opening period. Samsonov collected
the puck in the neutral zone and zoomed up the right side, teeing
up a slapper from high in the right circle that sailed past goalie
Fred Brathwaite at 7:54. The bad news was that Samsonov was lost
late in the second period after running into his own teammate in
open ice.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov said it's a charley horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw (Jason Allison),'' said Samsonov, who left the building
on crutches. ``I was trying to get out of the way. But somehow I
hit his knee. It was pretty bad, I guess. It tightened up right
away. I couldn't move my leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov has been on a decent offensive clip of late, although
he had his point streak snapped at three games Tuesday night
against Edmonton. He has four goals and 5 points in his last five
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had other chances in the period in which they outshot
the Flames, 11-6. During a Calgary power play, Rob DiMaio picked
off a pass by defenseman Cale Hulse in the Boston zone and took off
down the ice with Anson Carter on a two-on-none. DiMaio made a move
and tried a backhander from the slot, but the goalie gloved it. The
Flames turned up the heat in the second, tying the game and then
taking the lead during a 21-second span.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary, which outshot Boston, 15-9, pulled even during a power
play at 5:02. Defenseman Phil Housley moved the puck up to right
wing Theo Fleury at the right point. Fleury relayed the puck to
left wing Cory Stillman, who skated down the slot and beat goalie
Byron Dafoe with a backhander at the right post.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames went up, 2-1, on a fluky goal at 5:23. Defenseman
Chris O'Sullivan fired the puck to Stillman, who appeared to fan on
his shot. The puck caromed off the end boards and right out to
defenseman Denis Gauthier in front. Gauthier put it past Dafoe for
his first NHL goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them the game, we gave them two goals in the second
period,'' said a very unhappy coach Pat Burns. ``One on a bad
change. We battled back to tie the game and we lose our coverage
and they get a goal. It's very disappointing.'' Allison pulled the
Bruins even at 2-2 on the power play at 14:57. Defenseman Mattias
Timander, just summoned from Providence to take the place of Darren
Van Impe, who suffered a separated shoulder against the Oilers,
dumped the puck in at the left side of the blue line. Allison
stripped the puck from defenseman Steve Smith along the right-wing
boards and then darted in toward the net, burying it past
Brathwaite for his 15th goal.

Rudolph W. Giuliani. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   AIRCRASH-RESTAURANT (Baltimore) _ Patrick Turner plans to
convert a failed bar in Baltimore into the Crash Cafe, a culinary
monument to mayhem, with cars and motorcycles to wrapped around

honoring chaos and carnage does not sit well with everyone. By
Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSING-SEGREGATION (Chicago) _ The federal government is
achieving its stated goal of helping more minorities go from being

elusive, 31 years after passage of the Fair Housing Act. By Bill

</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CENSURE (Washington) _ Soon after the Senate failed to
convict President Clinton on Friday, the alternative of censure
died as well. Censure died in part because most Republicans and a

</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-VOICES (Madison, N.J.) _ In this suburban community of
moderate Republicans, there was disgust and exhaustion as the
impeachment trial drew to a close. Many of these Republicans said

RITTS PROVED AN ENERGETIC LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His name rhymes with glitz, which is fitting because Jim Ritts
is all of that. Energetic and flashy, Ritts stepped down as
commissioner of the LPGA last week, and the general feeling was not
of disappointment that he didn't stay the promised 10 years, but of
surprise that he hung around for three.
</P>
<P>
   Ritts has been named CEO of a new Internet venture called
Digital Entertainment Network and he will be living the
power-lunch, cell-phone life in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Rating Ritts's job performance is a muddled task. Some say he
should be given credit for adding more tournaments, nearly doubling
the purses, and getting far greater television exposure. But
critics will sneer that his greatest attribute was impeccable
timing, that he arrived to find corporate America tripping over
itself to get a piece of this white-hot sport, that he was blessed
to have The Golf Channel and all of its empty air time waiting at
his door, that much of the LPGA Tour's success can be traced to a
foundation put down by Ritts's predecessor, Charlie Mechem.
</P>
<P>
   The truth probably sits somewhere in the middle. Whereas Mechem
was genuinely embraced by the players, Ritts kept his distance and,
in fact, probably ruffled feathers by not catering to the stars.
Mechem used a fatherly style and made lots of friends. Ritts was
the leader out front, a self-described ``evangelist'' for the sport
always looking to shake a hand or answer a question if he thought
it helped the cause.
</P>
<P>
   When fires were burning out of control in Florida last summer,
Ritts and many LPGA Tour officials were in Kohler, Wis., attending
the US Women's Open at Blackwolf Run. Ritts was constantly in
motion in and around the media tent, monitoring the fires via
phone, discussing the situation, talking about going to Florida if
need be. He was in command mode, but he had time to talk about the
LPGA Tour returning to Pleasant Valley in 1999, though his answers
danced circles around the questions.
</P>
<P>
   Soon his attention drifted to another part of the room and
someone was holding a phone, pointing to it. Ritts stood up,
excused himself, and said he had to run.
</P>
<P>
   He meant it, too, for he sprinted to the phone. Funny to see a
leader of such a slow-paced sport in such a hurry. But, apparently,
Ritts is at his best when on the move.

   To her many friends on the LPGA Tour, Amy Alcott is known as
``Hollywood.'' So it was not lost on Alcott that her entrance into
the LPGA Tour Hall of Fame was announced at a press conference in
Los Angeles, not far from where she was raised and still lives.
During a round of golf at her home course last Wednesday, Alcott
got some playful kidding from a few members _ celebrities, of
course. ``I walked by Richard Crenna, Bob Newhart, Mike Connors,
and Dick Martin and they asked if they could have their picture
taken with me,'' said Alcott. The next day, Pat Bradley did the
honors and introduced the newest member of the Hall of Fame. ``We
have spent too much time on the one that Amy didn't get rather than
on all those that she did win,'' said Bradley, herself a Hall of
Famer, referring to the old criteria, under which Alcott was one
win shy of eligibility. Since Alcott has not won since 1991, she
has heard the question many, many times. ``I have gotten tired of
hearing, `Come on, Amy, you can win that one more.' '' Revision of
the criteria was a long time coming, and both Alcott and Beth
Daniel deserve their Fame. So do veterans such as Judy Rankin,
Donna Caponi, Jane Blalock, and Marlene Hagge, all of whom
registered more than 20 victories. But since they weren't active in
1998, they cannot become eligible under the new criteria, so their
future Hall of Fame hopes will fall to a veteran's committee. As
for those players closest to meeting the new Hall of Fame
requirements (27 points, with at least one major championship, one
Player of the Year, or one Vare trophy), Annika Sorenstam appears a
lock. It isn't so much a question of points (she's at 24) as it is
years (she's in her sixth on Tour and needs at least 10). Laura
Davies (22 points) is another good bet, but Hollis Stacy (also 22)
seems a long shot despite her three US Women's Open titles. Stacy
has not won since 1991.

   What happens to these stars when they go Down Under? Two weeks
ago, Ernie Els blew a fourth-round lead and lost the Heineken
Classic, then last Sunday, Bernhard Langer played like anything
other than the polished professional that he is. He led the Greg
Norman Holden International by five shots with nine to play and
appeared poised to win for the first time since 1997 _ until he
began impersonating a 14-handicapper down the stretch. At the 18th,
a par 3 of 225 yards, Langer hit his tee shot into a bunker and
flew the green with his blast out. He chipped within 9 feet and
needed that to force a playoff _ but he never got a chance because
of a mental error that is hard to fathom. Langer marked his ball,
cleaned it, but before re-placing the ball, he removed his marker.
Immediately he knew he had erred and the two-time Masters champ
asked for an official. The ruling: A one-shot penalty, meaning he
was putting for 5, not 4, and there was no chance for a tie.
Understandably ruffled, Langer then two-putted for a triple-bogey
to cap off a round of 80 . . . Tom Kite can relate. The 1997 US
Ryder Cup captain posted an 80 Thursday in the first round of the
Buick Invitational, one shot worse than an amateur named Tim
Mickelson, brother of Phil . . . Ah, to be young, fearless, and
capable of toasting a 3-iron 220 yards: Australian Aaron Baddeley,
who opened eyes last summer by advancing to the finals of the US
Junior Amateur, shot a 70 Thursday at the Australian Masters, while
Spanish sensation Sergio Garcia posted a 68 at the Dubai Desert
Classic . . . Brad Faxon and Billy Andrade, who have teamed to
raise more than $1.6 million for charities in their home state of
Rhode Island, have been named winners of the Charles Bartlett Award
for unselfish contributions to society. They will be honored April
7 at the Golf Writers Association of America annual banquet in
Augusta, Ga., an evening that also will be special to Ken Venturi.

Kraft/Szep missed the cut by two shots.

SIGNING TUPA GIVES THE JETS A PUNTER AND A QUARTERBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just hours after the National Football League's free-agency
period began Friday, the Jets filled one of their needs, signing
Tom Tupa, one of the league's better directional punters who has
also had a long career as a backup quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa, 33, a Cleveland native and former Ohio State star who
spent two seasons punting for the Cleveland Browns, was reportedly
eager to return to Cleveland with the expansion Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa, who has made 13 starts as an NFL quarterback, spent the
last three seasons of an 11-year career with the New England
Patriots. He becomes another Patriot player lured by Jets Coach
Bill Parcells. Tupa played for the Patriots in 1996 and 1997,
Parcells' last two seasons as New England's head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Since his first NFL season, Tupa has averaged 44.4 yards a punt.
His quarterback skills and his size _ 6 feet 4 inches and 220
pounds _ make him a constant threat to execute some special teams
trickery.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets used three punters last season: Nick Gallery, Brian
Hansen and John Kidd. Gallery was waived after the opening game.
Tupa ranked seventh in the NFL last season with an average of 44.5
yards. He was tied for 12th in the league with a net average of
35.4 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells had another card to play in his sales pitch: Tupa also
played for the Jets' defensive coordinator, Bill Belichick, during
his two seasons with the Browns in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It addresses what I feel was one of our primary needs,''
Parcells said of Tupa's signing. ``He's an outstanding punter and
our coaching staff is pleased to be reunited with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Cornrich, Tupa's agent, said the decisive factor in his
client's decision was being reunited with Parcells and Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom probably could have gotten more money elsewhere,''
Cornrich said. ``But he got the opportunity to go to the Super Bowl
with those two before and he feels it was the greatest experience
of his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Tupa was drafted out of Ohio State as a quarterback in the third
round by the Phoenix Cardinals. He was used exclusively as a backup
quarterback for the next six seasons except for six punts in the
1989 season. He was not a full-time punter until 1994 with
Cleveland.  &QL;

JARRETT'S HEALTHY, RARING TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
 TOP 10-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ On the eve of the Daytona 500, there are 9
million reasons why Jeff Gordon should be the top choice on
everyone's ballot to nab a third straight NASCAR Winston Cup
championship.
</P>
<P>
   And only two why he shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett and Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   With apologizes to Mark Martin, who, if not for Gordon's
spectacular season, easily would have captured last year's driving
crown, Jarrett is ``The'' ``Arizona Republic'' pick to knock Gordon
off stock-car racing's pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martin posted impressive numbers last season, which
included seven wins and 22 top-five finishes, Jarrett also
displayed moments of brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett shrugged off gall bladder surgery near season's end and
twice finished runner-up in the final two races. He also won three
races during the season and produced 19 top-five finishes.
</P>
<P>
   What hurt Jarrett was a rotten start, finishing 34th at the
Daytona 500 and 40th at Las Vegas, the third stop on the 33-race
season, and a rotten finish except for the second-place efforts.
</P>
<P>
   What hurt worse was Jarrett's body, thanks to an ill-performing
gall bladder that finally was removed in a Phoenix hospital a week
after the season ended.
</P>
<P>
   Although he didn't realize it at the time, Jarrett now knows he
wasn't 100 percent healthy all season.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is. And, boy, does he feel renewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we really have a championship team,'' Jarrett said.
``Even though (Gordon) is the best in the business and has all of
the right people in the right places, we're not giving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they can be beaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are even more reasons why ``The Republic'' is selecting
Jarrett to upset Gordon and capture the Winston Cup championship.
After Jarrett, in order, are ``The Republic's'' other nine choices
to complete the top 10. &QL; 
1.  &UR; DALE JARRETT
</P>
<P>
   1998: 3rd (3 wins, $4,019,657)
</P>
<P>
   Why in the name of Richard Petty would any sane person bet
against Gordon?
</P>
<P>
   And if not Gordon, why not Mark Martin?
</P>
<P>
   Call it a hunch.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Jarrett and other Ford teams were debuting an
unproven Taurus. Although most Ford teams spent much of the
preseason crying foul, telling anyone with a notepad and a
microphone how they would be the turtle against the Chevrolet hare,
it didn't turn out so badly, now did it?
</P>
<P>
   And with a year's worth of knowledge tucked away inside their
lap-top computers, Ford teams should be even stronger in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Jarrett bleeds undeniable talent. He twice has won the
Daytona 500 when a lot of top drivers never have, including Martin,
Rusty Wallace and Terry Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it certainly wouldn't be the first time ``The
Republic'' was wrong. A year ago in this space, Jeff Burton was
tabbed the predicted winner.
</P>
<P>
   Oops. &QL; 
2.  &UR; JEFF GORDON
</P>
<P>
   1998: (1st, $9,306,584)
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, baby. How's that for going out on a limb?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it really is going out on a limb not to select Gordon
to make it four championships over the past five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   There is absolutely no reason to believe Gordon won't be as
strong in 1999. None. Zippo. ``Nada.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gordon realizes one or two drivers dominating the
circuit is not good for the overall health of the sport, you think
that's going to stop him from pressing the pedal to the metal?
</P>
<P>
   Gordon even has more incentive this season with the return of
team owner Rick Hendrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to return Rick to victory lane,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   So, then, why bet against Gordon and the Rainbow Warriors?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, when was the last time a driver won three
successive titles?
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt? Nah.
</P>
<P>
   Petty? Nope.
</P>
<P>
   Cale Yarborough did it from 1975-77, but is the only driver in
the 50-year history of NASCAR to do so.
</P>
<P>
   And as good as Gordon is, all good things must eventually come
to an end, right?
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Chevy teams are expected to receive a
newly-designed Monte Carlo in late May, but late word is it may be
delayed until next season. If instead it arrives in May, will it be
as sleek and powerful as the present model? Only time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   And one last reason not to pick Gordon . . .
</P>
<P>
   It's just too easy. &QL; 
3.  &UR; MARK MARTIN
</P>
<P>
   1998: (2nd, $4,309,006)
</P>
<P>
   Take a straw vote as to who fans would like to see sitting at
the Waldorf-Astoria head table during the season-ending awards
banquet in New York City and I'll bet you a shiny new can of
Valvoline it's Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite never having grabbed NASCAR's brass ring, Martin is the
people's champion. No one is more respected, well-liked _ and yes,
that includes Bill Elliott _ than Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Folks, the man doesn't have an ornery bone in his body.
</P>
<P>
   Gut instinct suggests Martin should at least be picked as high
as second. But that would mean sliding Gordon to third or Gordon to
first and Jarrett to third.
</P>
<P>
   Helllp! &QL; 
4.  &UR; JEFF BURTON
</P>
<P>
   1998: (2 wins, $2,626,987)
</P>
<P>
   One of these years, this guy is going to blow the doors off the
competition. But when?
</P>
<P>
   Burton has as much talent as anyone and drives for one of the
circuit's best teams, yet can't seem to deliver that breakthrough
season.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, it will happen. It just won't happen this season. &QL; 
5.  &UR; BOBBY LABONTE
</P>
<P>
   1998: (2 wins, $2,980,052)
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is Pontiac's best team, and with the addition of
promising rookie Tony Stewart, Labonte will have even more
ammunition on NASCAR's battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   But something tells me it may take another year or two before
Joe Gibbs' team is ready to seriously challenge for the title.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is Labonte keeps taking steps upward. Baby steps,
but steps nonetheless. Two years ago, he finished seventh. Last
year, it was sixth following two wins.
</P>
<P>
   This year? See you in November. &QL; 
6.  &UR; RUSTY WALLACE
</P>
<P>
   1998: (1 win, $2,667,889)
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who is notorious for making bold predictions, is
keeping his mouth shut this preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make any predictions this year,'' Wallace
said. ``None.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wallace appeared mostly upbeat at the preseason media
tour hosted by Charlotte Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's some reason for optimism. Wallace did end a
miserably long losing streak by winning at Phoenix International
Raceway last season.
</P>
<P>
   And he's been one of the fastest drivers at Daytona
International Speedway. &QL; 
7.  &UR; JEREMY MAYFIELD
</P>
<P>
   1998: (1 win, $2,332,034)
</P>
<P>
   It took only one season and Mayfield already is talking like his
teammate Wallace. But make no mistake. Mayfield indeed has the
potential to become a weekly threat.
</P>
<P>
   He broke into the win column last season and even led the points
race near the midway point of the season. But Mayfield faded during
the second half. The question is, which half will show up in 1999? &QL; 
8.  &UR; DALE EARNHARDT
</P>
<P>
   1998: (1 win, $2,990,749)
</P>
<P>
   This might be too high. But it shouldn't be too low.
</P>
<P>
   Although Earnhardt still has more talent than a lot of drivers
will attain in a lifetime, the sad truth is he is much, much closer
to the end of his career than the start.
</P>
<P>
   So, Earnhardt likely will have to settle with remaining tied
with Richard Petty for the circuit's all-time lead in driving
titles (seven).
</P>
<P>
   But not for long.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Gordon? &QL; 
9.  &UR; TERRY LABONTE
</P>
<P>
   1998: (1 win, $2,054,034)
</P>
<P>
   Only three years ago, Labonte was the toast of NASCAR, having
captured the driving title ahead of teammate Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   But he dropped to ninth last season, and preseason
prognosticators don't believe it's a certainty he'll crack this
season's top 10.
</P>
<P>
   He will, but just barely.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte is too careful with equipment to not be a top-10
contender.
</P>
<P>
   Still, just as Martin and Burton are the focus at Roush Racing,
so is Gordon at Hendrick Motorsports. &QL; 
10.  &UR; BOBBY HAMILTON
</P>
<P>
   1998: (1 win, $2,089,566)
</P>
<P>
   Something tells me Mike Skinner's name should go here.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well.
</P>
<P>
   What could hurt Hamilton is he is without a teammate. Still,
Hamilton packs a lot of savvy underneath those racing britches. And
he feels good about the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   Don't, however, be surprised if Skinner, Ken Schrader or Jimmy
Spencer grabs the 10th spot. I won't. &QL;

CARDS OPEN TALKS WITH BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cardinals turned their attention to trying to re-sign
offensive tackle Lomas Brown on Friday as the NFL's free-agency
period opened.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's agent, Lamont Smith, met with Cardinals officials Friday
in Tempe, but both sides described the negotiations as preliminary.
</P>
<P>
   The team did sign former Colts offensive tackle Derek West, who
wasn't in the league last year.
</P>
<P>
   It also talked to a representative of former place-kicker
Michael Husted, who became an unconditional free agent when the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers cut him Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the Cardinals continued to talk to the agent of
outside linebacker Jamir Miller, who became an unrestricted free
agent after the team chose to put the franchise tag on wide
receiver Rob Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals wanted us to know they they want to re-sign
him,'' said Miller's agent, Steve Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Moore remains stunned the Cardinals placed the franchise
designation on him but is confident he can reach contract terms
with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Moore had hoped to become an unrestricted free agent on Friday.
But the Cards restricted his movement by making him their franchise
player, enabling them to match any offer.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how hard the Cardinals will try to re-sign
Miller. There is no doubt they won't pay the $6.5 million a year
Baltimore paid middle linebacker Ray Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely the Cardinals would be willing to pay about $5
million a year, which is more than the five-year, $22.5 million
deal the Miami Dolphins re-signed middle linebacker Zack Thomas to
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said there were three other teams that have shown the most
interest in Miller. Baker wouldn't specify the teams, but
Indianapolis officials have expressed their desire to try to land
Miller, the Cardinals' leading tackler last season.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams who seem to have interest in Miller are Carolina,
Minnesota and expansion Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the Vikings said Miller wouldn't be a high
priority because they have to re-sign four of their own free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   If Miller leaves, the most attractive outside linebackers in
free agency for the Cardinals to go after would be Anthony Davis of
the Kansas City Chiefs and Roman Phifer of the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is considered one of the top offensive tackles available
in free agency, but he isn't expected to be highly sought after
because he will be 35 next season and is in his 15th season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals reportedly offered Brown a one-year deal worth
about $3.5 million late last season, but he would like to sign for
two years.
</P>
<P>
   He has said often he wants to remain with the Cardinals because
of the emergence of second-year quarterback Jake Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   West (6-foot-8, 312 pounds), a fifth-round draft pick of the
Colts in 1995, remained with the team through the 1997 season. He
played for the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe last year and was an
all-league selection.
</P>
<P>
   Husted, who has been with the Buccaneers since 1993, has been
one of the league's most consistent kickers and has a strong leg.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is at one of the top teams on our list,'' said his
agent, Glenn Schwartzmann. ``It's a very attractive situation. I
think Michael would be a great addition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have no kickers on their roster after not making a
qualifying offer to Joe Nedney, who still is recovering from a torn
anterior cruciate ligament in his kicking (left) leg. Nedney's
replacement, Chris Jacke, is an unconditional free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Nedney and Jacke combined to win six Cardinals games last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was one of four high-profile receivers to get the
franchise tag placed on him. The others were San Francisco's
Terrell Owens, Cincinnati's Carl Pickens and Green Bay's Antonio
Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just sit back and see what happens,'' Moore said Friday.
``Now, I'm not in a situation of power. It has all been taken away.
I won't be afforded the option to look elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals decided to place the franchise tag on Moore
instead of Miller after not being able to come to contract terms
with Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised early in the week when I heard they were
thinking about doing it to me,'' Moore said of the franchise
designation. ``I thought it was a little absurd. Then, when I was
franchised, it wasn't like I was oh-so-disappointed or heartbroken.
It was just that I was upset with the numbers (put) on the table by
the Cardinals.''
</P>
<P>
   The team offered a three-year contract worth a little under $5
million a year, which would have allowed Moore to make about $6
million next season.
</P>
<P>
   Moore wanted a four-year deal and was unhappy with the
Cardinals' reported signing bonus offer of $2.4 million.

PREGNANCY TO SIDELINE GRIFFITHS FOR ENTIRE MERCURY SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mercury starting power forward Michelle Griffiths is pregnant
and will miss the WNBA season.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Australian has left her Italian team. Her leave
is said to be at a doctor's request even though she is only five
weeks into her pregnancy. She averaged 14.2 points and 5.2 rebounds
in 23 games with Famila Schio, in third place two weeks before the
Italian Final Four playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The baby, a first child for Griffiths and her husband, Steve, is
due in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously my first reaction is this is great for them,''
Mercury Vice President Seth Sulka said Friday. ``It's much more
important than basketball. As far as the team goes, it's secondary
to me. We'll figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it hurt to lose a starter? Yes. But I'd rather hear
positive news about Michelle Griffiths as opposed to hearing (point
guard) Michele Timms was injured in her Australian league and
wouldn't be back for the season. That would be a tougher position
to fill. The one position where we have depth is power forward.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the league runner-up Mercury hopes to slide
6-foot-3 Jennifer Gillom, second to Houston's Cynthia Cooper in
Most Valuable Player voting, to power forward and use 6-8 Maria
Stepanova as the starting center.
</P>
<P>
   They would be backed by 6-5 Marlies Askamp (center) and 6-1 Toni
Foster (power forward), providing neither is lost should the WNBA
use an expansion draft to help stock the Orlando Miracle and
Minnesota Lynx.
</P>
<P>
   An expansion draft has not yet been scheduled as the league
negotiates with the new players union to reach a collective
bargaining agreement. The availability of former American
Basketball League players to the WNBA complicates all draft
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1 Griffiths joined the Mercury for its second season
after the 1998 World Championships. When Foster, the 1997 starting
power forward, went on the injured list because of a stress
fracture in her leg, Griffiths was promoted.
</P>
<P>
   She played in all 30 regular-season games, starting 25, and
averaged 9.2 points and 4.4 rebounds. Her nine steals against Utah
on July 27 is a record for the 2-year-old league.
</P>
<P>
   In the WNBA playoffs, she averaged 12.3 points and 6.5 rebounds,
including her single-game highs for rebounds (12) and points (24)
in the Finals against the Houston Comets.
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths' official status will be suspended, like that of
Houston center Polina Tzekova, who did not report last season due
to a family illness.
</P>
<P>
   She has a year left on her WNBA contract and will remain with
the Mercury unless she is left unprotected and selected should an
expansion draft occur. The pregnancy, of course, takes away from
her value as an expansion target.
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths and Timms are members of the Australian National Team
that won bronze medals at the 1996 Olympics and '98 World
Championships. They and Mercury backup point guard Kristi Harrower,
also on the World team, hope to represent Australia at the 2000
Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   WNBA officials, preoccupied with current issues, have yet to
address how the league's 2000 schedule will be adjusted to
accommodate preparations for the Olympics, Sept. 15-Oct. 1. &QL;

SWIMSUIT FEVER HITS AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My vote for least-read ``Sports Illustrated'' story of all time:
a three-way tie between E.M. Swift's tale of sailing, Franz Lidz's
chronicle of a wild Caribbean bar and William Nack's profile of
Richard Branson in this week's issue.
</P>
<P>
   Not the regular issue.
</P>
<P>
   The swimsuit issue.
</P>
<P>
   (I figure at least a few people will read Austin Murphy's story
about applying body paint to supermodels, based on the subject
matter alone.)
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the swimsuit issue is back, and packed with plenty of flesh
to excite or offend, depending upon how you feel about this kind of
thing. The best part of the whole thing is the raft of letters it
generates, half from ``a college student in chilly Minnesota who is
really warmed up by the issue,'' the other half from ``a mother of
three who was greatly offended by your poor taste. This is
outrageous. It has nothing to do with sports. P.S. I think that
purple Teletubby is gay, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Time was, the swimsuit issue was just a few pages of scantily
clad models thrown into the middle of a regular winter issue of
``Sports Illustrated.'' But no more. Now there is an extra issue
devoted entirely to beautiful women wearing (and sometimes not
wearing) bathing suits.
</P>
<P>
   And frankly, it smacks of overkill. The swimsuit issue in the
old days was like a good bikini _ it left a little something to the
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The current swimsuit issue is more than 200 pages of bikinis and
body paint, broken up every now and then with the occasional
article that no one will read anyway (see above).
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the issue has nothing to recommend it.
There are, of course, pages and pages of beautiful women in
incredibly expensive bathing suits (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos sports a
chain-link number the size of a Handi-Wipe on the cover that goes
for ``$80''0), although the idea of anyone actually swimming in
them is laughable.
</P>
<P>
   The feature in which professional athletes _ including the Suns'
Tom Gugliotta _ pose in swimsuits with their spouses returns. (By
the way, if Joe Montana needs money, it looks as if he's a prime
candidate for a Rogaine ad.)
</P>
<P>
   The body-painting section is quite the optical illusion. You'd
never know you were looking at naked women until . . . wait, isn't
that . . . uh, never mind.
</P>
<P>
   And if you read the groan-inspiring, bad-pun introduction at the
beginning of the magazine, which takes the place of a proper table
of contents, you will find the following joke buried in a footnote:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virgin Islands, discovered by Columbus in 1493, were named
in honor of Saint Ursula, a ninth-century martyr who supposedly
rounded up 11,000 virgins for a pilgrimage to Rome and was killed
by Huns on her return trip. That expedition was the largest
gathering of virgins on record until a ``Star'' ``Trek'' convention
in Indianapolis in 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   (Rim shot.)
</P>
<P>
   Another highlight: Many of the advertisers tailor their ads to
the issue, but none as effectively or hilariously as Sony. Its ad
for the Digital Handycam on page 111 shows a slob of a man who
makes Gilbert Brown look like Spike Lee lounging in the surf
wearing a, yuck, Speedo. Above, it says, ``Pizza. Pork rinds. Beer.
Put him on the cover, dammit. Because he's never looked better.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most people probably won't see the ad, since on the
facing page is a picture of ``Tamara'' looking for all the world
like the winner of a wet T-shirt contest at a spring-break bar.
</P>
<P>
   Is it sports? Nah. Is it interesting? Absolutely. Should you buy
it? Like all other questions touching on morality, the answer is up
to you. But if you decide to, you might haul out that old lie
people used to tell when they picked up a copy of ``Playboy'': ``I
only get it for the articles.''
</P>
<P>
   No one will believe you, of course. But Swift, Lidz, Nack and
Murphy will thank you. &QL;

NASCAR GETTING READY FOR YET ANOTHER PETTY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ They are so much alike. And as different.
</P>
<P>
   It began with Lee Petty, patriarch, champion of the first
Daytona 500 in 1959. Although he is one of NASCAR's first heroes,
Petty, who with 55 career victories is No. 7 on the all-time
winning list, would rather mow the lawn than discuss NASCAR with
the media.
</P>
<P>
   Few know for certain why Petty, who refused to attend his own
introduction into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame,
remains disgruntled with the sanctioning body. He just is.
</P>
<P>
   Next came son Richard Petty, who is to stock-car racing what the
Louvre is to art museums. Richard Petty, a record-tying seven-time
driving champion, has 200 career victories, a feat likely to never
be toppled.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's grandson Kyle Petty, who not only remembers the
band Jefferson Airplane, he probably could have been one of its
guitarists. Unlike most NASCAR racers, including dad Richard, who
rarely is seen without his trademark cowboy boots and hat, Kyle
Petty has pierced ears, wears a pony tail and would prefer riding a
Harley-Davidson motorcycle to some Winston Cup venues rather than
airplane or automobile transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can grow a pony tail, but the earrings are out,'' Richard
Petty joked.
</P>
<P>
   And, now, here comes fourth-generation driver Adam Petty, who at
age 18 will make his NASCAR Busch Grand National debut today at
Daytona International Speedway, where he will start in the 11th
row.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take pride in having four generations of Pettys in this
sport, but it's almost like taking pride in being in the ``Guinness
Book of World Records'' for having the longest fingernails or
something,'' Kyle Petty said. ``It's just an oddity, man.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `What's wrong with that freak family. They've got
four of them keep wanting to do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   What does Adam Petty say?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Kyle Petty clone without the hair and earrings,'' said
Adam of his father, who starts Sunday's Daytona 500 in the 12th
row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't let him have a pony tail, anyway,'' Kyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Short hair or long hair, Adam Petty appears to possess the
unmistakable Petty genes to one day lift him to the Winston Cup
level.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Petty already has won an American Speed Association race,
which occurred two weeks before his 18th birthday last June. The
win made him the youngest driver ever to do so, snapping the
previous mark held by Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Adam Petty made his Automobile Racing Club
of America debut at Charlotte Motor Speedway, and won. At age 18
years and three months, he also became ARCA's youngest winner,
surpassing the previous record held by, uh, Kyle Petty, who was 18
years and eight months when he captured the Daytona 200 in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has a phenomenal amount of talent,'' Kyle Petty
said. ``It amazes me. But it's what he does with that talent. Right
now, he's so single minded and so focused on it that there's not a
ceiling on how far he can go. The sky's the limit for a kid like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Proud father yakking about a son? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   But Grandpa Richard, not one to shy away from speaking the
truth, no matter who it might or might not upset, said he also
believes his grandson has the potential for a bright future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam can definitely be better than Kyle,'' Richard said.
``He's more dedicated at what he's doing now. He's more focused. I
think he's seen how daddy done and how great granddaddy did. Right
now, racing full time is on his mind. As long as he keeps his head
screwed on right, he can go far.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Petty, 38, who is known for his off-track charitable
efforts toward fund-raising and recently was named True Value Man
of the Year, finished 30th in last year's final standings. He twice
finished as high as fifth (1992-93), but never has won more than
two races in a single season and only has one victory over the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Was it difficult being the son of Richard Petty, and if so, what
will that mean for Adam Petty? More comparisons?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go back and read the old newspapers, Richard Petty was
always Lee Petty's son,'' Kyle said. ``He (Richard) went through
that stage, then he found out who he was. He was Richard Petty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through the same stage. I went through a lot of down
times, then all of a sudden, people said, `Well, that's Kyle. He's
just different than Richard.' Well, Richard was different than Lee
and Adam came along and he's different than all three of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all look different and are totally different people. We're
not clones of each other. The only way we're cloned and the gene
that's the same in all of us is our love of the sport. We just love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam shares the same love, not only for the sport, but for his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my dad has had a great career,'' Adam said. ``He's
touched a lot of people's hearts and he's been there for a lot of
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great race car driver. A lot of drivers out there today
still haven't won a race and my dad has won (eight). I look up to
my dad a whole lot because he's always been there for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Kyle, who was a third-generation driver attempting to
follow in the footsteps of two famous Pettys before him, however,
Richard Petty believes grandson Adam won't face as much adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky. I was able to beat everything my father did. And
I feel like with Adam, he'll do a lot better than Kyle because Kyle
was a third-generation driver trying to break away from what his
father and grandfather did. With Adam, I think he's not trying to
break away. He's trying to do what his father did. I think that
will help him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Adam won't try and be anyone but himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I do have a lot to live up to,'' Adam said. ``My
grandfather has done a whole lot and my dad has done a whole lot.
If I can do half of what they've done, I'll be very happy.'' &QL;

DON'T BET THE HOUSE  
 HALF-BAKED IDEAS ON `BIG DANCE' 
</HEADLINE>
 PREVIEW-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a month remains until the 64-team NCAA Tournament
field is announced, seeded and bracketed on March 7, followed by
the whining of teams that don't make it. The end of the regular
season is in sight. But the speculation season is just starting to
heat up.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the small matter in our nation's capital has, at long
last, been put to rest, we can finally focus our attention on
what's really important: Who's going to get into the tournament,
where will they be seeded and where will they play?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is, who knows? If you think you're going to
find out here, think again. Go read the Senate roll-call votes, or
something. The fact is, no one can say for sure, not even the Web
site wise guys, nor the foremost, supreme authorities on everything
and anything, i.e., the talk show hosts.
</P>
<P>
   What can be promised in this space, however, is guessing and
half-baked theories, along with a solemn promise: Beyond this
sentence, you will see no further reference to teams being ``on the
bubble'' for ``the Big Dance.'' As we prepare for this century's
final Final Four, to be played in St. Petersburg, Fla., amid folks
born in the ``previous ''century, we aim for a cliche-free
millennium. In fact, isn't the phrase Final Four getting old? How
about something new and hip for 2000 and beyond, like ``Phat
Four''?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, there are some raging questions out there, and we'll do
our best to answer them. But remember, all this is one upset away
from being rendered entirely meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Question: Who will be the four No. 1 seeds?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: Well, you've got Duke, which could beat out the Suns
for an NBA playoff spot. Then there is Connecticut, which is pretty
darned good, too, and the way it's playing right now, Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: That's only three. What about the other one?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: You had to notice that. The hot pick currently is Michigan
State, which has won 10 straight Big Ten games. But don't rule out
Cincinnati, despite its mini-slump; Stanford, which has a chance if
it wins the rest; and teams like Kentucky and Maryland, if they do
well between now and the conference tournaments, and then win them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Where will the selection committee locate the No. 1 seeds?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: There's a heated debate going on. Should Duke, by virtue of
being the overall top seed, be rewarded and sent to the East
Regional, where it can play in Charlotte, N.C.? Or should the NCAA
maintain some geographic credibility and put UConn in the East,
where it can open in nearby Boston?
</P>
<P>
   The team not sent to the East likely would play in the South.
That would put Michigan State in the Midwest. What's left, Auburn
to the West? Sounds good to me. But so does any other scenario.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, speaking of the NCAA and geography, the two words
are mutually exclusive. Half of the South regional will be played
in that bastion of mint juleps, magnolias and antebellum mansions,
Indianapolis. At the same time, first and second round games of the
Midwest regional will be played in the capital of America's
heartland, New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: What about the rest of the seeded teams?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Assuming Michigan State and Auburn are No. 1s, you've got
Stanford, Cincinnati, Maryland and Kentucky as potential No. 2
seeds. Three-seeds look like North Carolina, St. John's, Wisconsin
and a Utah team coming up fast on the outside. Strongly resembling
No. 4 seeds right now are UCLA, Arizona, Ohio State and another
team surging to a strong finish, Temple.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Temple? Are you sure?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Of course not. Remember what I said about guessing and
half-baked theories?.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: What other teams might crack the top four seeds, depending
on how they finish?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Miami (Fla.), Iowa, and maybe about a half-dozen others. And
thanks for adding, ``depending on how they finish.'' Sounds like we
both like to shop at Butt-Covering `R' Us.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Shouldn't that be a backward `R'?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: Yes, but someone borrowed the Russian keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Can we please be serious? Where's Kansas?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: To answer the first question, absolutely. To answer the
second, if you check a map, you'll see it's dead smack in the
middle of the country. Sorry. As for its celebrated basketball
program, we can't see it being higher than a No. 6 seed. And maybe
lower, the way things are going.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: So what's with the Pac-10? Four teams and that's it?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: It sure looks that way. Washington, playing better than
anyone in the conference right now, should join Stanford, UCLA and
Arizona. The only other possibilities are California and Arizona
State. Cal, even though it beat Southern California on Thursday,
doesn't look like it's going to pass chemistry this season. ASU
needs to finish 5-1 to have a shot, and that includes road games at
Cal and Stanford, and UCLA at home. The Sun Devils can do it, but,
pardon the expression, don't bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: There's a lot of talk about eight of the 11 Big Ten teams
making the field of 64. What of it?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: First of all, that's a lot of numbers for one sentence. But
let's take a look. Michigan State, Wisconsin, Ohio State, Indiana,
Minnesota, Purdue and Iowa are in or close to being in. Then you've
got Northwestern on the bub . . . Ooops. Northwestern is, uh, on
the edge. Yeah, that's it, on the edge. Do they make it? A definite
maybe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Some are saying the Atlantic Coast Conference is ``down''
this year. Just what does ``down'' mean, and who makes the
tournament?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: According to Vitale's New World Dictionary, ``down'' means
when a conference thought by many to have invented college
basketball, or at least perfected it to such a point where the game
anywhere else might as well not be played, suddenly has a bunch of
average teams, just like everybody else. Having said that, as many
as six ACC teams might get in, including the likes of Georgia Tech
and Florida State. But let's hope not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: Quickly, some other conferences.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: That's not a question. What are you, a TV reporter? But
we'll overlook that. From the not-so-Big 12, there are Texas,
Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma and Nebraska. The Southeastern
Conference has Auburn, Kentucky, Florida, Mississippi and
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   From the Big East, it's UConn, Miami, St. John's, Syracuse,
Villanova and for fans of the acclaimed HBO series about a
fictitious organized crime family in New Jersey, ``The Sopranos'' _
Rutgers. The disappointing Atlantic 10 has Temple and we'll also
say George Washington because Monday is President's Day. But not
Xavier. The last Western Athletic Conference as we know it will
provide Utah, plus New Mexico and maybe Fresno State and maybe
Nevada-Las Vegas and maybe Tulsa. Conference-USA is Cincinnati,
UNC-Charlotte and, by virtue of the NCAA changing its mind,
Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting development is the surging Missouri Valley
Conference. Evansville, Southwest Missouri State and Bradley are
all tournament-worthy. College of Charleston is in, even if it
somehow tanks the Southern Conference tournament. Murray State
might be in the same position in the Ohio Valley Conference, but it
had better win the tournament to safely override the prejudice
against teams named ``Murray.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: What about the other conferences, like the Patriot League
and the Colonial Athletic Association?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: I'm afraid we're out of space. &QL;

ARENA BATTLE LATEST OF MANY FOR BURKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a young boy in Marietta, Ga., Richard Burke competed with
everyone _ friends, two younger brothers and, most often, himself.
Even a walk to school became a contest. Today's trip had to be
faster than yesterday's.
</P>
<P>
   As a businessman in Minneapolis, Burke refused to acknowledge
defeat, even when his fledgling health care company was struggling
and he didn't know how he was going to meet the payroll. He
persevered and turned it into one of the nation's largest HMOs,
making millions in the process.
</P>
<P>
   And as owner of the Phoenix Coyotes, Burke is stubbornly focused
on proving that the NHL team can thrive in the desert, despite
arena disputes and the team's lackluster history on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   His profile in the community has expanded in recent months, as a
dispute over obstructed-view seats and lease conditions at America
West Arena has led the Coyotes to become a partner in a proposed
arena venture of their own, on the site of Scottsdale's Los Arcos
Mall.
</P>
<P>
   It's a battle that the 55-year-old Burke expects to win.
</P>
<P>
   For him, life has always included a scoreboard. Quarterly
reports and marathon times. Share prices and number of quail shot.
Buyouts and hockey games.
</P>
<P>
   Burke admits that his competitiveness isn't always a bright,
shining attribute, and there have been times when he wished to be
different. ``As a young boy, I was always setting a bar with
everything,'' he said. ``Working out, running, tennis, hunting,
fishing. I look back on it and I'm a little appalled that there was
so little inclination to just enjoy something just for the sake of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's gotten better at that, but losing is still abhorrent to
him. It still confounds him that his 3-year-old son, Brendan, can
skate and he can't. He has tried and suffered a broken ankle in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   It drove him nuts the day Taylor, his oldest son, finally beat
him in tennis. And when he and Taylor hunt quail, Burke always
tries to get the inside position to get a split-second advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never fought fair,'' said Taylor, 27, the Coyotes assistant
general manager. ``We'd get in wrestling matches and he found a way
to win even if it meant playing dirty. I think he was more
competitive with us than he was in his business life.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke guesses that his competitiveness comes from his mother,
whom he describes as ``a very intense person.'' His father, he
said, was very easygoing.
</P>
<P>
   Burke's father was an engineer with the government, and the
family was secure, but not wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nicest present my parents gave to me is that I started
grade school with the same group of kids that I graduated high
school with,'' said Burke, who had two younger brothers.
</P>
<P>
   His competitiveness isn't readily apparent when you meet Burke.
He wears wire-rimmed glasses and speaks in an even, measured voice.
He gives the impression of being as serene as the farmland
surrounding his 25,000-square-foot home that sits on about 500
acres in Medina, Minn., just west of Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, he never sits still long. He sleeps just three to
four hours a night. He has run marathons, sometimes training on a
treadmill in the wee hours. He has several business interests,
although hockey is clearly the most important. And he and his
second wife, Jude, have three children _ Brendan and 20-month old
twins Ian and Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   He did not come to Arizona to retire and live off the interest
of his fortune, estimated a few years ago to be about $70 million
(and that was before the stock market took off).
</P>
<P>
   ``Being successful and having something like (United Healthcare)
work is probably just three-quarters being lucky,'' he said. The
other quarter is ``not taking no for an answer and not being
willing to fall on your face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times where it probably would have (failed) if I
had not been as competitive and as unwilling to stay down,'' he
said. &QL; 
To believe that three-quarters of Burke's success is luck or timing
is to sell him short, say those close to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the most unbelievable capacity to juggle 20 balls in
the air and be OK with it, because he can focus in,'' said Juanita
Burke, Richard's first wife and the mother of Taylor and Ryan, a
25-year-old who works on Wall Street. ``When roadblocks are thrown
up, he finds a way around them. On the third roadblock, I would
say, `This is not meant to be.' He would say, `There has to be a
way.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The accomplishments came with a price, however. Burke made
enemies, particularly among Minneapolis area doctors who were
opposed to an HMO telling them what they could charge.
</P>
<P>
   Burke was also accused of a conflict of interest because he was
the president and CEO of both United Healthcare and Physicians
Health Plan of Minnesota, then the largest client of United
Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   Burke was the medical community's poster child for everything
that was wrong with managed care, and in the late 1980s, doctors
revolted against his control. The dispute eventually was mediated
by the state. Burke remained in charge. The doctors were given a
stronger voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not a lot of doctors who will say a lot of nice
things about him,'' said Doug Leatherdale, a close friend of
Burke's and a longtime board member at United Healthcare. ``He
clearly rubs some people the wrong way.'' &QL; 
Burke's juggling act didn't last forever, and inevitably a few of
the balls fell. His devotion to success and his doggedness took a
personal toll. He blames himself for his divorce in 1979 from
Juanita, his high school sweetheart, whom he married in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably two things responsible for that,'' he said.
``One was me not being grown-up enough to keep it from happening.
And the second was probably just business and how I tend to go
about things, regrettably, all or nothing. I didn't have enough
balance in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The divorce was bitter at first as the couple tried to reach a
financial settlement. How to spend time with the two boys was never
an issue, however. Richard bought a house close to Juanita's and
the boys were free to stay at either place. There were no arguments
over visitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get older, you realize how difficult it is to end a
relationship of that significance,'' Taylor said, ``and to . . .
make sure their kids grew up in an environment that allowed them to
live their lives the same way as before was a tremendous
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke and Juanita eventually became close friends, and Juanita,
who hasn't remarried, spends holidays with Burke's new family and
the two older boys.
</P>
<P>
   At the Burkes' home in Paradise Valley, the plastic toys of
toddlers are scattered about the patio, symbols, courtesy of
Fisher-Price and Playskool, of what Burke believes: that one life
is really is made up of many lives.
</P>
<P>
   He and Jude met about 10 years ago on a blind date. Both enjoyed
the outdoors and travel and immediately hit it off. She worked for
Honeywell in the employee counseling department, and Burke
remembers calling her one time from Russia, where he was traveling
with Ryan, who speaks Russian fluently.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me she was going to start a subsidiary for this
company, United Healthcare, and asked me, had I ever heard of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   They eventually married, and Jude worked for United until about
two years ago as the couple began to raise a family. It's been fun,
Taylor said, to watch his father so excited about his younger
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at him and told him he was crazy,'' Taylor said of
reaction to his father having more children. ``He said, `You don't
understand, I enjoyed it so much the last time.' He thought it was
tremendous he had the opportunity to do it again.'' &QL; 
It was a new life, one far away both in time and personal
commitment from United Healthcare. There, Burke had grown weary and
was run down physically and emotionally because of the demands.
</P>
<P>
   He retired as CEO in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first six months, I tried to get myself back
together,'' he said. ``I had always taken care of myself, but I was
getting to the point where I was starting to wear down. I didn't
have the foggiest idea what I was going to do. I just knew I was
going to do something different and get my head sorted out and my
priorities back in order. And hopefully, I was going to do
something that would let me live awhile. Because with the pace I
was on, that wasn't going to be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   He was approached by some acquaintances in Minneapolis about
buying the Winnipeg Jets of the NHL and moving them to Minnesota.
But when a lease arrangement couldn't be reached with the Target
Center in Minneapolis, Burke and his partner, Steven Gluckstern,
decided to move to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   They were confident their deal with America West Arena and
landlord Jerry Colangelo would generate enough revenue to make the
Coyotes financially viable.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't long before Burke and Gluckstern butted heads with
Colangelo, perhaps the most powerful man in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, who later bought out Gluckstern when the partner decided
to buy the NHL's New York Islanders, contends details of the lease
were interpreted by Colangelo and those in his organization in ways
that hurt the Coyotes. Colangelo believes the Coyotes have a
sweetheart deal at America West Arena. He and Burke no longer
speak.
</P>
<P>
   It's not in Burke's nature to back away from a fight, and he
could have challenged the lease in court, or put more pressure on
the city of Phoenix, which owns the arena, to intervene. But Burke
decided leaving America West Arena was a more pragmatic
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Burke and the Coyotes are pursuing a new arena in Scottsdale as
part of the redevelopment plans for Los Arcos Mall. Officials from
America West Arena and the city are pursuing renovation plans that
would ease some of the seating problems, but Burke is committed to
moving into a new arena. And he thinks the area can support two
arenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to compete with everything, and with some
things it's not appropriate,'' Burke said. ``In this sense (the
arena issue), it's not a zero sum game. I think there is room for
both of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obviously not pleased with the way some things have been
handled, but you have to have the maturity to look at it and figure
out what's the best way to handle it. And having a confrontation
doesn't serve a whole lot of purpose or get us to where we want to
get.''  &QL; 
Getting an arena built is never an easy task, however.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed 20,000-seat, state-of-the-art arena will sit below
ground. If built, it would be surrounded by a conference, retail
and entertainment complex that would take in 92 acres at one of the
Valley's busiest intersections.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes and Burke have pledged to chip in about $100 million
for the $624 million project. Developers want state sales tax
revenues to pay for about a third of the project, but they have
said that the arena portion will be paid for with private money.
</P>
<P>
   There is significant opposition to the Scottsdale development. A
group called NO PUCKS _ Neighborhoods Organized to Prevent Unwanted
Community Killing in Scottsdale _ is protesting the development.
But even their lawyer and spokesman, Alan Kaufman, gets along well
with Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very intelligent, sophisticated, articulate and a
successful man,'' Kaufman said. ``That doesn't mean I agree with
him. (The arena) is a waste of taxpayer money. I'd rather put the
money into schools. Burke and his team have adequate resources to
pay for their own house.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke had been reluctant at first to enter the arena business,
but he thinks it's the only way his hockey franchise, which he said
has lost money each year, will become financially viable. He has
embraced the pursuit of an arena, and friends say it's unwise to
bet against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a better prognosticator than anybody I've seen in
business,'' said Rick Powell, a close friend and the CEO of First
Cash Financial Services, which is based in Arlington, Texas, and
operates a chain of pawn shops and check cashing stores. Burke owns
about 2 million shares in the company, worth around $26 million,
depending on market fluctuations .
</P>
<P>
   Powell said, ``He's not a particularly patient person and he
would like to see things materialize right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's taken some time, but Burke is adjusting to a business where
success is judged after each of 82 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really an oddity and it's one that as a competitive
person I don't know how well suited I am for it,'' he said. ``In
business, if you're running a public company, the measurement of
whether you're smart or stupid comes every quarter. In between you
have a little latitude to be smart or stupid. In this business,
it's goes day to day and game to game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to sit in the stands on nights we stink.''
</P>
<P>
   The hockey team stinks less often now. The Coyotes are 28-13-10,
and are a legitimate contender to advance far into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Burke is confident things will improve for the Coyotes off the
ice, too, and that eventually the Coyotes will be playing in their
own arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard is not a Jerry Jones or a Colangelo or a (George)
Steinbrenner from an ego standpoint,'' Powell said, ``but the
wealth the man possesses, both in a dollar sense and in knowledge,
would rival anybody's. I would rather be on his side than
anybody's. I don't know just how, but he always wins.'' &QL;

TEAM EFFORT KEEPS COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ A team effort by local and state officials plus a
$1million loan convincd plastics manufacturer Poly-Tainer Inc. to
spurn relocation offers from three Western states and expand
locally, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Poly-Tainer employs 240 workers and will add 72 new jobs, 60 of
them full-time, to the payroll during this year. The company will
also consolidate operations, spread out among three buildings, to a
100,000-square-foot facility in the Simi Valley community northwest
of Los Angeles by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old company, one of the West Coast's largest
independent manufacturers of molded plastic products, had received
attractive pitches from communities in Utah, Arizona and Nevada.
Those three states were popular destinations for companies fleeing
California during the early part of the 1990s because of its
prolonged economic slump and cool attitude toward business.
</P>
<P>
   In response, California created so-called red teams that
included private and public sector officials with special skills to
address retention efforts on a case-by-case basis. Such a team was
brought into play to woo Poly-Tainer.
</P>
<P>
   That helped turn the situation in California's favor, said
company President Paul Strong.
</P>
<P>
   Team members included officials from the Ventura County Solid
Waste Management Department, &UR;  &LR; Southern California Edison and the
state Employment Development Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed us very clearly that California is indeed a great
place to do business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the loan, with terms at 5.6 percent for 10 years,
the package included funds to cover a portion of new workers'
salaries during training and five years of discounted electrical
rates from Southern California Edison.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of the deal's key elements, Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``California utilities are expensive compared to other states,''
Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   Edison spokesman Grant F. Thomas said the red team program is
designed for situations like those faced by Poly-Tainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for attraction of businesses outside of California . . .
and retaining those that are definitely looking to go to another
state,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   David Goldstein, an analyst with the waste management
department, said Poly-Tainer's expansion will enable the company to
increase its use of recycled plastics to 700 tons a year from 300
tons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just not any old business retention. This is the
retention and expansion of a important company for recycling,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Gabler, Simi Valley's assistant city manager, said
Poly-Tainer is an important cog in the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've very pleased with the outcome of this. The company has
been a longtime major employer in the city, and you don't want to
lose any employer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Poly-Tainer makes plastic bottles, toys, canteens, golf
sand-trap rakes and cosmetic containers. The privately held company
had $12 million in annual sales in 1997, company officials said. &QL;

FRETTING SINKS GUITAR CENTER SHARES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES_ Despite reporting a profitable year, Guitar Center
Inc.'s stock fell nearly 22 percent as investors dumped shares on
fears that the company would be hurt by increasing competition
among music instrument retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported after the markets closed Thursday that its
pro forma per share earnings were 71 cents for the year _ just one
cent below analysts' consensus predictions, but 31 percent above
the prior year's results. It met analysts' 30 cent prediction for
the fourth quarter, up 25 percent from the like 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Guitar Center stock closed Friday at $17.75, down
$4.9375, on volume of 936,100 shares traded compared with a 30-day
average of 155,000 shares _ even as analysts remained upbeat about
the company's present and future position in what they deem a
highly competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   Investors shouldn't be scared off by the degree of competition
in the market given that Guitar Center's ``vital signs'' remain
strong, said Alan Rifkin, a managing director at Piper Jaffray Inc.
in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe that, going forward, sales and margins will come
under pressure as the competitive environment intensifies,'' he
said. ``I personally believe this is (an) overreaction here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Ross, Guitar Center's chief financial officer, said that
investors may have misinterpreted comments he made during a
conference call with analysts when results were released, regarding
a proposed distribution and fulfillment center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was misinterpreted that we were going to spend a few
million dollars doing that,'' Ross said. ``All we indicated is that
we moved it up as a priority and we're doing a study.''
</P>
<P>
   The company should have details about this plan, and its
financial impact on the company, when it releases its first quarter
results on April 28.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Ramos, an analyst at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Minneapolis,
said Guitar Center's competitors have been more aggressive of late,
but the company's fundamentals remain strong. ``I thought the
numbers were pretty good; we really didn't see any issues in the
numbers they reported,'' Ramos said about the company's year-end
results.
</P>
<P>
   Neither analyst budged in his prior recommendation on Guitar
Center stock: Ramos kept his ``buy'' rating, and Rifkin continued
to rate it a ``strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is an uncommon opportunity'' for investors,
Rifkin said.

DUCKS FALL TO STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Some things just aren't in the stars for the Anaheim
Mighty Ducks, and beating the Dallas Stars appears to be one of
those things.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights after defeating the mighty Philadelphia Flyers,
Anaheim had an opportunity to do something even more impressive _
defeat Dallas and complete a sweep of the two teams with the most
points in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   For 47 minutes they skated stride for stride with the Stars,
only to fall behind on a fluke goal by Jaime Langenbrunner and wind
up losing yet another game to Dallas, 3-2, before 16,230 at the
Pond on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat snapped the Ducks' four-game winning streak and
prevented them from moving past St. Louis, into fifth place in the
Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's chance for a rare win over Dallas all but ended when
Langenbrunner skated down the right wing and fired a shot that
deflected off the stick of Anaheim defenseman Pascal Trepanier and
then the skate of Ducks defenseman Jaime Pushor at 7:26 of the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull gave the Stars a 3-1 lead at 8:56 when he converted
Mike Modano's centering pass from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg was pleased with his team's
effort, but he refused to blame the loss on a bad bounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lucky bounce, he said. ``But we turned the puck over
in the neutral zone. You make a mistake against those guys and it
will cost you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably two or three plays cost us the game. We turned the
puck over once and relaxed on the third goal.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Sandstrom gave the Ducks one last chance when he scored
with 23.9 seconds left, but it turned out to Anaheim's last gasp
and the Ducks fell to 4-17-1 in their last 22 games against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get them, we still have a few more cracks at them, said
Hartsburg, whose team fell to 21-23-9. ``We played them a lot
better than we did a month ago (a 3-1 loss on Jan. 15).
</P>
<P>
   Sandstrom, who scored his seventh goal of the season in the
final minute, said the Ducks can take something positive out of
their last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proves we can play with them (the league's best teams), he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg agreed, but warned that the Ducks can only do so if
they play their ``best each game. We can't drop off at all.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have the NHL's No. 2 ranked power play, while the
Ducks are No. 3 and first at home. And both units had plenty of
chances to show off their abilities as referee Kerry Fraser kept
both penalty killing units on edge by calling 12 minor penalties in
the first 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks were 1-for-5 (Teemu Selanne's 25th goal in the first
period, while Dallas was 1-for-3 in the opening period (a
deflection by Jere Lethinen) and 0-for-4 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   As they did against Philadelphia the Ducks stormed out of the
gate. Anaheim recorded seven of the game's first eight shots,
forcing Dallas goalie Ed Belfour to come with some big saves early.
</P>
<P>
   On Anaheim's first power play of the night Belfour stopped Steve
Rucchin from the slot, Fredrik Olausson's rebound bid and shot from
the point by Ruslan Salei.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of jump, said Sandstrom. ``If we could have got a
goal then ... but it's a 60-minute game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference tonight was Belfour, said Hartsburg. ``Belfour
was better than Vanbiesbrouck was (on Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
   Dallas broke on top with a power play goal after being outshot
12-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' fourth shot -- a blast from the left circle by Darryl
Sydor -- was deflected by Lethinen just inside the left post at
13:07.
</P>
<P>
   The tied the game on their fourth power play, scoring on a
two-man advantage with 51 seconds left in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, despite being down by two skaters, didn't allow the
Ducks to get organized, let alone get a shot off until there were
13 seconds left on the two man disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   But Selanne took things into his own hands -- and feet -- by
blowing around Modano at center ice and beating Belfour high on the
glove side with a 40-footer.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim goalie Guy Hebert picked up his third career assist on
the play.

 &HT;    CLINTON TURNING TO NEW BATTLE FOR POLICY IDEALS
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If it's true, as Winston Churchill once said, that
nothing's quite so exhilarating as being shot at and missed,
President Clinton is unquestionably a man revitalized.
</P>
<P>
   As he steps from the impeachment cross hairs, he'll need all his
newfound vigor.
</P>
<P>
   After a year spent fighting Republican efforts to remove him
from office, Clinton has vowed to get down to the work his
constituents elected him to do: gut the Republican tax cut plan,
keep Al Gore in the White House and help Democrats win back the
Congress in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to go into full public policy gear,'' said Michael
Genovese, political science professor at Loyola Marymount
University in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's in some ways an act of desperation,'' said Genovese,
author of ''The Paradoxes of the American Presidency,'' published
two months ago. ''He knows he has a very limited time to reclaim
the voice of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can't wipe the stain of scandal from his legacy. He
would certainly like it to fade a bit, though, against a background
of achievement.
</P>
<P>
   He can do little without working with the Republicans who
control the House and the Senate, all but a handful of whom have
judged him guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice and have
voted to end his presidency over it.
</P>
<P>
   Given the partisan rancor of the impeachment proceedings, it's
not easy to imagine where Clinton might begin to build a new bridge
from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts questioned how much he would even try.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton's going to be mad,'' said presidential scholar Shirley
Anne Warshaw of Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw, who has written a study of Clinton's staff, expects
relations to be strained, if not hostile, between the
administration and the more aggressive Republican impeachment
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ''My feeling is that he is going to cut out the knees of some of
these people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, at least, White House aides insist Clinton's not a man
to carry a grudge, particularly against those whose cooperation he
must win if he is to govern.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a country with a rich tradition of co-opting
former enemies once the shooting's over.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the nation of the Marshall Plan,'' said White House
political counselor Paul Begala, referring to the huge infusion of
foreign aid the United States sent to help rebuild Germany after
World War II. ''I think there's something fundamental about the
American public that is committed to progress.''
</P>
<P>
   No one denies that it will take time for Clinton to rebuild his
credibility among congressional Republicans, a task that's
essential if he's to deal constructively with them on the central
tax and budget issues where disagreement is sharpest.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's going to have to work hard at talking about
the
</P>
<P>
   issues and the agenda,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
Friday, just hours after the Senate voted to acquit Clinton. ''He
will work hard. He will reach out across party lines.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll first have to peer over the battle lines already drawn by
Democrats and Republicans over the most traditional of political
conflicts: the annual budget debate.
</P>
<P>
   Amid projections of federal budget surpluses adding up to $4.4
trillion over the next 15 years, Clinton has proposed funneling
$2.7 trillion into the Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement and disability program is accumulating money at
the moment, but is on track to begin paying out more in benefits
than it collects from payroll taxes by 2013. Clinton has said his
plan would save the program, which sends a monthly check to one out
of every six Americans, until 2055.
</P>
<P>
   He has proposed devoting more than $600 billion of the
anticipated surplus to shore up Medicare, the federal health
insurance program for retirees, and another $500 billion over the
next decade and a half to create federally subsidized savings
accounts for lower-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   He has proposed using most of what's left of the projected
surplus for education and defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, though, have other ideas. They've called for
across-the-board income tax cuts ranging from 10 percent to 14
percent, plans Clinton has vowed to oppose.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their approach would squander the surplus,'' said Begala. ''It
would reward consumption rather than savings and reward
disproportionately those who are already succeeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The great debate will likely begin in earnest the last week of
February, after Congress returns from next week's recess.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to steal a march on his Republican foes, Clinton plans to
showcase his Social Security scheme at a White House event this
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's issue-a-day approach to governance is one reason he's
emerging from his impeachment ordeal with his popularity intact.
Recent polls by the Gallup Organization of Princeton, N.J., show
his job approval rating at 67 percent, remarkably high for a
second-term president, and the constant focus on bread-and-butter
issues appears to be countering any perception of a lame-duck
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The White House expects Clinton's poll numbers to slip in the
weeks ahead, as a public that has been largely turned off by the
impeachment effort no longer sees the imperative of rallying around
a president under siege.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton's popularity remains the top drawing card for
Democrats, who have called on him to travel to New Hampshire this
Thursday to help raise money in preparation for critical primaries
in the run-up to next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's event _ coming auspiciously on the seventh
anniversary of the primary that set Clinton on course for the White
House _ kicks off the start of a busy season for Clinton, who hopes
to strengthen the presidential campaign of Gore and fellow
Democrats seeking House and Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got about a day a month over the next five months devoted
to party-building and fund raising,'' said Lockhart, adding that
the best thing Clinton can do for his fellow Democrats is to
advance his agenda for the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think, ultimately, it's the best politics,'' said Lockhart,
''that, if we get a lot done and we move forward to the year 2000
with a strong presidential candidate and strong senatorial and
congressional candidates around the country, campaigning on
Democratic ideas, ideas that the president leads the Democratic
Party with, the Democrats will do quite well.''

   METAIRIE, La. _ Even at the giddy height of Carnival, as nightly
Mardi Gras parades roll past the strip malls and suburban homes
that make up Rep. Bob Livingston's district, many people in this
Republican stronghold are almost gloomy. Not only did they lose
their conservative champion to the Washington sex scandals, but now
President Clinton himself has been acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of angry people in this district over what is
going on,'' said Roger Villere, a Republican national committeeman
who works as a florist on Veteran's Boulevard, the traffic-choked
commercial spine of this New Orleans suburb. ``Every day I have 7,
8, 10 people call and say, `We don't know what people these polls
are talking to.'''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to his high national job approval ratings, Clinton is
all but despised in this very conservative district, and his
acquittal Friday was doubly vexing because of Livingston's demise.
Poised for elevation from chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee to speaker of the House, Livingston announced his
resignation in December, after his own past extramarital affairs
had surfaced in the heat of the impeachment debate, and officially
leaves Congress this month. Now perhaps no district in the country
has lost more from the entire scandal than Louisiana's 1st.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bittersweet?'' said Rick Legendre, who runs Livingston's local
office but is now shopping a resume. ``I don't know of any
sweetness to it at all if you are referring to Bob. It appears so
unfair that Newt Gingrich is gone, that Bob is gone and that the
president still stands.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Legendre sat in the congressman's office as two
secretaries shuffled papers. The telephones never rang, and
Legendre said he had stopped watching the news or reading
newspapers since December. So he indulged in a game of ``what might
have been.'' The Speakership, he said, was like winning the
lottery. What was once Livingston's imminent ascension had helped
speed plans, for example, to build a Defense Department technology
center at the nearby University of New Orleans, bringing 1,200
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only does it hurt the district, it hurts the entire
state,'' he said of Livingston's fall. ``As Appropriations
chairman, Bob helped the state tremendously. One can only imagine
what he could have done as Speaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the misshapen 1st District, which was gerrymandered to
include most of the white suburbs of New Orleans, will rank last in
House Republican seniority once Livingston leaves office Feb. 28. A
special election to replace him is set for May, and the Republican
candidacy of the former Klan leader David Duke, who once
represented part of the area in the state Legislature, has further
embarrassed local Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Many here are disgusted with both Clinton and his Republican
adversaries. ``Our country is the worse for it,'' said Jim Loyd,
55, a retiree waiting for his wife inside a local shopping mall.
Loyd described himself as a ``reactionary'' who voted for
conservative Republicans only because he had no better alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``What have they demonstrated recently that shows that the
Republicans are in control?'' he said. ``They're not. And the
reason is the moderate Republicans are voting Democratic, and they
should be held accountable for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of more than 40 people interviewed throughout the district
condemned Livingston for his affairs, considering them private,
family matters. But many were critical of Clinton's cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a better person than Clinton,'' Michelle Trosclair, 46,
said of the congressman after finishing lunch at Bozo's restaurant
with her mother, Jo Hug. ``At least he did admit it and moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hug sympathized with Livingston's decision to resign, though
she felt a little betrayed. ``He should have stuck it out,'' she
said, for the greater good of the district. Of her fellow
Republicans, she said: ``They don't have any gumption. The
Democrats outsmarted the Republicans. They made fools out of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone condemned Clinton, who won 37 percent of the vote
here in 1996. ``I'd like to see Hillary as President for the next
four years and then have Clinton come back for eight years after
that,'' said Gaston Rodrigue, 77, who was with his wife, Rita, at
the Morning Call coffee shop. ``If all the politicians who
committed adultery resigned, you wouldn't have nobody left.''
</P>
<P>
   But Villere, the Republican committeeman, seemed more typical of
voters here, lambasting Clinton for his indiscretions and Senate
Republicans for what he deemed their cowardice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got scared because of the polls,'' he said, ``and they
got scared because of the incredible pressure they were getting
from the radical left.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Decker, 32, eating lunch at Lakeside Mall, seethed at
the mention of Clinton. ``If I perjured myself, I would go to
jail,'' said Ms. Decker, a loan officer at a car dealership. ``I
recently had a deposition, and my attorney said, `No matter what
you do, tell the truth.' And that wasn't even a grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, nibbling on a chicken sandwich, Angela Langdon, a
49-year-old piano teacher, said she found something honorable in
Livingston's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate adultery,'' she said, ``but you've got to hand it to
Bob Livingston. To me, he's honest, he's not a hypocrite. Maybe he
fell in one way, but in another way he set a terrific example. I
don't know why Clinton got away with all this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But George Rome does not think Clinton necessarily got away with
anything. ``His legacy will be that he's the first impeached
president of his generation,'' said Rome, a 50-year-old retiree.
``He's got to live with that for the rest of his life. If they
can't find him guilty, I'll settle for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's office declined requests for an interview with him.
The special election to fill his seat is scheduled for May 1, with
an expected runoff between the top two finishers May 29. There are
six candidates, with Duke's presence already generating some
publicity if not voter passion. In a splintered field, local
Republicans say, Duke could advance to a runoff, but he is given
little chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana voters are known for a sense of humor, which could
influence the election. One candidate is a wealthy ophthalmologist,
considered a serious contender, and her full name, believe it or
not, is Monica Monica.

<P>
   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia _ Jutting over Golden Horn Bay, this
rough-and-tumble port city is the wildest outpost in Russia's wild
east. A closed, militarized city during the Cold War, Vladivostok
has long been a den of intrigue and hardship.
</P>
<P>
   But these days it is also the daffiest place in Russia. The
former mayor claims to have extrasensory powers. Local elections
have been invalidated 15 times. The mental hospital even released
some of its patients after squabbling officials allowed its budget
to run dry.
</P>
<P>
   So the news that the autocratic governor, Yevgeny Nazdratenko,
has received a mysterious $1 million prize for his work as one of
the world's great leaders seemed par for the course. The accolade
was issued by the ``World Aristocratic Academy,'' an organization
whose only known address is a post-office box in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   The magnanimous governor has promised to distribute the proceeds
to the needy before the gubernatorial election in December.
</P>
<P>
   And while critics mutter that the prize is no more than a goofy
vote-buying scheme, swarms of pensioners, who survive on as little
as $25 a month, are clamoring for their share. They swamped a local
theater where the governor's aides were taking applications for the
money.
</P>
<P>
   It all added up to just another week in Vladivostok, Russia's
main Pacific port and an object lesson in how hard it can be to
raise a democratic society out of the ruins of the Soviet empire.
</P>
<P>
   With the fetters of state control off, Vladivostok's new-found
freedoms have dissolved into political farce, an especially bizarre
version of the tragicomic ``Winter's Tale'' now playing across
Russia. The nation's ailing president goes to work so rarely that
his trips to the Kremlin prompt urgent news bulletins.
</P>
<P>
   And Alexander Lebed, a Siberian governor and presidential
hopeful, seemed to typify the punchy, touchy national mood when he
lost control recently in front of television cameras and harangued
a local businessman with bleeped-out expletives.
</P>
<P>
   In Vladivostok, as across Russia, the political ironies might
raise more laughs if they did not have such dire consequences for
the residents.
</P>
<P>
   Like this richly endowed country, Vladivostok ought to be better
off. Perched on the edge of Russia, it has a huge port, a fishing
industry and timber. Its neighbors are China, Japan and Korea. A
snazzy new Korean-owned hotel reflects its proximity to potentially
lucrative Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   With rolling hills that evoke images of San Francisco,
Vladivostok is also a magnet for painters attracted by the sweeping
vistas, as well as a wellspring of ``Vlad Pop,'' Russia's brand of
alternative rock music.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese markets, once strictly outlawed within the city limits,
have cropped up, befitting a region that sits on the ruins of
ancient Manchurian civilizations. Even in the days of the Soviet
Union, Vladivostok's port status gave it a window on the world.
</P>
<P>
   The independent spirit of the city seems to be captured by the
families and couples taking weekend strolls on the frozen waters of
the city's bay.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these people say they are sick of the region's political
soap opera, which has pitted the authoritarian Nazdratenko against
Viktor Cherepkov, the former mayor, who was disqualified from
running for re-election in September by officials loyal to the
governor and then was removed from his post in December by
presidential decree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all on our own,'' said Alexander, 57, a former welder
who did not want to give his last name, as he ice-fished on the
bay. The bucket of small fish he catches on a good day helps him
supplement his monthly pension of 560 rubles, or $25.
</P>
<P>
   But try as many do, it is hard to forget about politics. After
all, it is not every city that is festooned with banners like
``Vladivostok Is Not a Psychiatric Ward'' _ a sly dig at
Cherepkov's eccentricity _ or ``City, Wake Up From the Hypnosis.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the political struggle is straightforward. Who
will dominate Russia's Far East? Will it be the government of the
Primoriye region run by Nazdratenko, or the city of Vladivostok,
Cherepkov's former fief, which is the major business center of the
area and home to almost one-third of Primoriye's 2.3 million
people?
</P>
<P>
   But that simple power struggle is vastly complicated by the
strange personalities involved.
</P>
<P>
   First there is Cherepkov, the owlish former director of a
military laboratory, who served as Vladivostok's mayor off and on
for the last seven years. He claims to have used his mental powers
to produce more than 520 inventions, including one that cures
female infertility.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is extra sense?'' he mused in an interview in a hospital,
where he was unwinding before a new bout of politicking. ``It is
someone who has capabilities others do not have. I never sleep more
than three or four hours. I compete with computers to see who has
more in his memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Cherepkov's years as mayor were unusual. Convinced
that the regional administration should be paying more for the
upkeep of the city, Cherepkov slashed financing for vital services.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of apartment blocks were left without heat. Orphanages
ran low on food. Elevator maintenance was stopped. As stocks of
medicine were exhausted, the local mental hospital even began
releasing patients. The city's former main psychiatrist said he was
forced out of his job after he privately recommended that Cherepkov
be ``tested.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cherepkov won the loyalty of many voters by fixing the
traffic-clogged roads, a major preoccupation for drivers who zip
around in used Japanese automobiles, the steering wheels fixed
incongruously on the right.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy-handed methods employed by Nazdratenko to prevent
Cherepkov from running for re-election as mayor also transformed
him into a martyr in the eyes of many city residents, who would
like to see him run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Nazdratenko runs his domain with his own
idiosyncrasies. Flouting Primoriye's special environmental
regulations, last year he bestowed the skin of an endangered
Siberian tiger on Alexander Lukashenko, the autocrat who rules
Belarus, more than 5,000 miles and eight time zones to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Nazdratenko quarreled relentlessly with President Boris
Yeltsin's team of market reformers until they were ousted in the
wake of last August's financial crisis. And his deputy, Konstantin
Tolstoshein, still speaks disparagingly of the ``Yids'' who
launched Russia's capitalist reforms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in the white marble administration building,
which towers over the port, Tolstoshein dismissed reports of vast
corruption within the administration as a sinister and potentially
mortal conspiracy by Russia's secret services.
</P>
<P>
   Then he whipped out a photograph of himself with his nephew,
Pavel Bure, the Russian-born hockey star and national celebrity, as
evidence of his own good character.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to crush me physically they know how to do it,''
he said ominously. ``They can make it look like I had a heart
attack or like I was hit by a car.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 3 man in the region, Viktor Kondratov, laughs off
Tolstoshein's claim of persecution. A senior official in the
Federal Security Service, the heir to the old KGB, Kondratov
doubles as Yeltsin's anointed personal representative to this
region.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed impeccably in a suit and tie and carrying an unlighted
pipe, Kondratov looks like a suave character out of a John Le Carre
novel. He has staunchly opposed the governor, who he charges has
played fast and loose with the region's budget.
</P>
<P>
   But the security man is also not supporting Cherepkov. That has
raised speculation that the Kremlin favors the so-called ``zero
option'' in which Nazdratenko and Cherepkov are both ousted from
office and a new figure becomes the overlord of this eastern
outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Moscow reformers, for their part, say that if the choice
boils down to Nazdratenko and Cherepkov, the eccentric former mayor
is the best bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nazdratenko has been an absolute disaster and has created the
conditions for enormous corruption,'' said Yegor Gaidar, the former
prime minister. ``I do not overestimate Cherepkov's administrative
abilities, but he was elected and the actions the governor has
taken against him are clearly unlawful.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, most of the political gossip centers on
Nazdratenko's mysterious commendation for leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Critics quietly complain that the $1 million prize is simply a
device to transfer state money to Nazdratenko so he can in turn
hand it out to appreciative voters. Most of the cowed local media
have been careful not to ask too many questions.
</P>
<P>
   Nazdratenko's aides insist the award was arranged by a secretive
French baron, who has never been to Vladivostok and who learned
about the governor when one of his strongest supporters, Viktor
Fersht, visited the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Fersht says that both the New York City mayor, Rudolph Giuliani,
and the actress Demi Moore have been among the lucky winners.
Spokesmen for Giuliani and the actress said they had never heard of
the supposed donor and certainly never received $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not chastened Fersht. He insists that the New York
mayor is simply keeping mum about the prize to avoid U.S. taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Fersht also volunteered an explanation for Cherepkov's continued
popularity with many voters: a secret device that Fersht said
enables the former mayor to control voters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our region is simply a testing ground for the parliamentary
and presidential elections,'' Fersht said in a telephone interview.
``I have one of these devices and I will demonstrate it for you
sometime.''

MEXICO OPPONENTS SEE POLITICS IN AGENDA FOR CLINTON'S VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For a visit to Mexico starting Sunday, President
Clinton has not scheduled a single meeting with opposition
political leaders, prompting charges that he is taking sides before
presidential elections in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton and President Ernesto Zedillo will be the
guests in Merida of an authoritarian governor battling opposition
attempts to impeach him, and they will be entertained at the
hacienda of a wealthy banker who has profited from his ties to the
governing party.
</P>
<P>
   The impression that Clinton's agenda was politically one-sided
formed the week before last as top officials in Washington showered
praise on Interior Minister Francisco Labastida Ochoa, who analysts
say has Zedillo's backing as the governing party's presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gross mistake not to pay attention to the opposition,''
said Enrique Krauze, a prominent Mexican historian, one of several
independent intellectuals who criticized Clinton's agenda. ``It's
like visiting the Czar in 1917, without thinking that there might
be other forces around.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials denied playing favorites and
insisted that Clinton's visit should not be viewed as an insult to
the opposition parties that control Congress and the Mexico City
government. Clinton did not have time on this 24-hour trip to meet
with everyone, they said.
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's two-day visit in May 1997, however, he made
time for two 15-minute encounters with opposition party leaders,
breaking the United States' long tradition of unqualified backing
for the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to fly on Sunday to Merida, in the Yucatan peninsula,
to meet with Zedillo and other Mexican officials before returning
to Washington on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Deputy Foreign Minister Juan Rebolledo Goot said in an
interview that Mexico hoped to focus the talks on immigration,
trade and other issues. At least two significant agreements could
be signed, one providing for increased cross-border airline flights
and another aimed at reducing the deaths of Mexican migrant
workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But because the visit comes two weeks before Clinton must report
to Congress on whether Mexico is a reliable partner in the drug
war, narcotics will probably dominate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all our efforts we never succeed in bringing attention
to our huge and complex bilateral agenda because we always end up
focusing on narcotics,'' Rebolledo said.
</P>
<P>
   The week before last, Labastida visited Washington to present a
new anti-narcotics plan. Mexican newspapers and political
cartoonists portrayed the visit as a blatant campaign stunt. Jorge
Castaneda, a political scientist, said the warm reception of
Labastida has been interpreted here as an unofficial endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever their intentions, Clinton administration officials
placed themselves in the middle of the politics of Mexico's
presidential succession,'' Castaneda said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Hamilton, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City,
denied any interference was intended. ``We don't have any opinion
about who should be Mexico's next president,'' he said. ``The idea
that the reception Labastida got in Washington is some kind of
political signal is just silly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Felipe Calderon, president of the pro-business National
Action Party, said that Clinton and Zedillo administration
officials ``ignored us completely.'' Several National Action
senators were asked to travel to Merida to meet only with a U.S.
congressional delegation, but refused, Calderon said. ``They were
going to be choreographed like extras on a PRI movie set,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Merida, the two presidents will be the guests of Yucatan's
PRI governor, Victor Cervera Pacheco, from a hard-line conservative
group within the PRI known as the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign officials for Vicente Fox, an opposition presidential
candidate, said Friday that Cervera had deployed Yucatan state
police to destroy or dismantle 20 of Fox's campaign billboards in
Merida to erase all sign of opposition presence before Clinton's
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Zedillo and Clinton will meet at a hacienda owned by
Roberto Hernandez, a banker who during Mexico's last presidential
race catered a fund-raiser at which Mexican billionaires were each
asked to donate $25 million to the governing party.

MALAYSIA SAYS ITS MUCH-CRITICIZED FINANCIAL STRATEGY HAS WORKED 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ From the plush conference room with
teakwood panels to the rich coffee served in china cups, the
Malaysian Central Bank was determined to make the right impression
on the foreign fund managers it had invited to a recent briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia wanted them to bring their capital back to the country,
the bank officials told the group. They understood if the investors
were still angry at Malaysia for imposing strict controls on
foreign investment last September. But the rules had since been
relaxed, they said. Malaysia was ready for business.
</P>
<P>
   The one word the Malaysian bankers did not utter was ``Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Five months after Malaysia incurred global opprobrium by closing
off its currency and capital markets, its officials are in no mood
to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Far from wrecking the Malaysian economy, they say, the
isolationist strategy has stabilized the country and put it on the
road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   By suspending trading of the Malaysian ringgit and fixing its
exchange rate to the U.S. dollar, the government was able to lower
interest rates and ward off speculators.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, Malaysia's exports and foreign reserves have
increased, consumer confidence has flickered back to life, and the
country has escaped the violent social unrest of its neighbor,
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is responding to what we have done,'' said Finance
Minister Daim Zainuddin. ``People are comfortable. They say things
are predictable. To us, that's a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Daim has little patience for foreigners who tell him that
Malaysia has committed economic heresy. ``They're entitled to their
opinion,'' he said with a shrug. ``Either they invest here or they
don't. If they prove us wrong, we look stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's experiment has not spawned imitators. Brazil, which
fell into its currency crisis after Malaysia had begun reaping
benefits from the policy, has kept its markets open.
</P>
<P>
   And not all of Malaysia's economic indicators point to recovery.
According to government statistics, foreign investors are pouring
an average of $1 billion a month into Korea and $500 million a
month into Thailand. Malaysia has not issued recent numbers, but
economists say it is getting only a fraction of that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, government officials, academics and business leaders here
relish the fact that Malaysia has avoided the prophecies of doom
made by the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. Treasury
Department and other critics of capital controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were seen as having done something very naughty,'' said
Francis Yeoh, a Malaysian-Chinese industrialist and one of the
nation's richest men. He predicted that ``pragmatism and greed''
would eventually overcome foreign fury at Malaysia for its actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, the fury flows in both directions. Malaysia's
irascible 73-year-old prime minister and unchallenged leader,
Mahathir Mohamad, blames the West in general, and George Soros in
particular, for precipitating the Asian crisis. He once said a
cabal of mainly Jewish currency traders had destroyed Asian
countries by speculating against their currencies and forcing them
to deplete their reserves.
</P>
<P>
   To many Malaysians, it seems unjust that Mahathir reaps
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mahathir and Soros both support regulating hedge funds,'' Yeoh
said, adding that in the eyes of the world ``one is a heretic and
one is a guru.''
</P>
<P>
   But the world has also been troubled by Mahathir's crackdown on
political opponents. On Sept. 2, the day after he imposed capital
controls, Mahathir ousted his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who had
opposed the policies. When the prime minister threw Anwar in jail
on lurid corruption and sex-related charges, it ignited the largest
street protests in Malaysia in decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign investors don't give much importance to human
rights,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, a professor of political science
at the University of Malaya. ``But they should be concerned about
the Anwar episode, because it has implications for Malaysia's
short-term and long-term stability.''
</P>
<P>
   When Malaysia imposed its controls, the government declared that
foreign capital could not be withdrawn from country for 12 months.
The goal was to punish speculators and other short-term investors.
But people who invest for the long term felt like they were being
held hostage, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``What right do they have to confiscate people's capital?''
asked Bill Kaye, a fund manager at the Pacific Group in Hong Kong.
``If you're an attractive place to invest, why do you need to do
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Malaysia lifted the ban on repatriating capital
and replaced it with an exit tax that encourages investors to leave
their funds in the country for more than a year. The change
mollified a few investors, but not Kaye. ``Most people just want to
get their money out,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Malaysia says its economic future does not depend on foreign
investors. By fixing its currency at a time when other Asian
currencies are rising, Malaysia is suddenly very competitive. Its
total exports rose 18 percent in the first 11 months of 1998,
compared with all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends the new stability has cheered consumers.
Monthly car sales rose from 12,000 to 19,000 between September and
November. Unlike Indonesia, Malaysia does not feel like a country
in the grip of recession. Bars and restaurants in the capital are
crowded and the streets are choked with lines of orderly traffic.
</P>
<P>
   If the government had allowed the ringgit to erode in value,
Daim said, it would have driven up the price of food, which could
have set off widespread riots.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters angry over Anwar's arrest ``tried to imitate the
Indonesians,'' the finance minister said. ``But Malaysians by
nature understand that it is not going to solve any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the controls restored order to Malaysia's storm-tossed
currency. Companies like Dell Computer, which owns a manufacturing
plant in Penang and does most of its business in local currency,
found the fixed exchange rate made it easier to do business, said
Mark Stevens, corporate vice president of Dell's Asia Pacific
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Daim vowed that Malaysia would not float the ringgit until the
international financial community agreed to regulate hedge funds
and currency traders. ``If banks can be regulated, why can't
currency traders?'' he said. ``If stockbrokers can be regulated,
why can't currency traders?''

IRISH SCANDAL,   IN LIMELIGHT,   JEOPARDIZES   GOVERNMENT  
(DW)

<P>
   DUBLIN _ An ebullient performance on national television by one
of Ireland's most prominent politicians has embarrassed the
20-month-old coalition government of Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
and raised the prospect that the government might collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Padraig Flynn, Ireland's member of the European
Commission in Brussels, the executive body of the European Union,
is a target of one of two government-established tribunals
investigating accusations that members of Ahern's party and other
politicians took large sums of money from businessmen in return for
official favors.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, joking and lecturing the national television audience,
annoyed people and politicians of all parties by refusing to answer
directly an accusation that he took the equivalent of $75,000 from
a Dublin entrepreneur in 1989, three years before he moved to
Brussels. The public response refocused attention on the tribunals.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare act of public criticism of one of its own political
stars, members of Parliament from Ahern's Fianna Fail party
approved a resolution Wednesday night telling Flynn to explain the
affair immediately. Only Flynn's daughter, Beverly Cooper Flynn,
who succeeded him in the Parliament, defended his failure to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, leaders of the largest opposition party, Fine Gael,
said at their annual convention that the scandal would force a
national election in the next six months, three years earlier than
the constitutional deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Harney, the leader of the small, conservative Progressive
Democrats party and the deputy prime minister, has threatened to
withdraw from the government and bring down the coalition, and
force a new election if more damaging disclosures are made at the
two tribunals.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern has not been accused of taking any money improperly or
illegally himself, and the gifts were not necessarily illegal when
they were made, at least 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition political leaders say that as head of the largest
governing party, Fianna Fail, Ahern, a professional accountant,
should know about the payments and make his knowledge public. Ahern
asserts that he is an honest man and will testify before the
tribunals if summoned.
</P>
<P>
   To stay in power, Ahern needs the four votes held in the
166-member Parliament by members of the Progressive Democrats
party. The Progressive Democrats broke away from Ahern's party 14
years ago to combat what they saw as corruption in Fianna Fail.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, according to the sworn testimony of one witness, accepted
about $75,000. The witness, Tom Gilmartin, an entrepreneur, said he
passed it to Flynn in 1989 for the Fianna Fail party, but that
Flynn kept it for himself. He said in interviews that Flynn begged
him to say that the money was intended for Flynn, not the party.
Gilmartin was looking for needed approval of a development in
downtown Dublin. Flynn was then the Environment Minister, and his
approval was needed for the project.
</P>
<P>
   The huge complex was never built.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern confirmed that the party never received the money and
called on Flynn to explain.
</P>
<P>
   After ignoring calls for him to comment, Flynn, in an appearance
two weeks ago on a national prime-time entertainment show, spoke of
how little money he earned ($150,000 after taxes) and how hard it
was to maintain his three houses, in Dublin, Brussels and
Castelbar, Ireland, on that kind of money.
</P>
<P>
   He brushed aside the question of the $75,000, saying only that
he had never taken money in return for favors. Critics in all
parties were quick to note that this begged the question of whether
he received and kept the money. He has since refused to elaborate,
saying only that he will cooperate with the investigating tribunal
if requested.
</P>
<P>
   The television performance stimulated widespread anger among
ordinary people and led directly to calls for Ahern to resign and
call a new parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmartin, who lives in England, said his anger at Flynn's
televised comments led him to disclose, two weeks ago, that he had
discussed the payment to Flynn in a meeting in 1989 with Ahern.
</P>
<P>
   This put Ahern at the center of the scandal. The prime minister
said at first that he had only a vague recollection of one meeting
with Gilmartin. Within 24 hours he changed his account, saying
there had been several meetings, but that he had never discussed
the gift money and that his party had never received it. He noted
that he has no power to remove Flynn. He said he thought Flynn
should say what he knows about the $75,000 gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an honest person, a credible person,'' the prime minister
said.

   WASHINGTON _ After going to the House Judiciary hearing room, to
watch Henry Hyde modestly concede defeat under an oil portrait of
Henry Hyde, I sat in the park near my office for awhile.
</P>
<P>
   It was a near-tropical day. Seagulls swooped. Valentine
sweethearts canoodled. I felt hopeful, giddy even. Something that
never should have happened had ended with some dignity and sense.
</P>
<P>
   What a relief. All the gasbaggery and phony seriousness and
incredible hypocrisy that had gone into this farce could now be
applied to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The coda of the president's trial brought a goofy blast of
bonhomie, with a grinning Trent Lott presenting William Rehnquist
with a cheesy gold-plated gavel plaque, as if the chief justice had
presided over a Rotary Club meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The horrid fever that gripped Washington for a year seemed to
break _ recalling the moment when the Fairy Queen Titania, released
from her spell, looks at Bottom and realizes she's been obsessed
with an ass.
</P>
<P>
   ``And think no more of this night's accidents,'' Oberon tells
her, ``but as the fierce vexation of a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dream, as we like to say in the news biz, soon turned
into a nightmare. Within hours of what the incredibly annoying
Lindsey Graham called the constitutional cleansing of the
president, the skies suddenly grew dark with lightning and thunder
and the capital grew dark with talk of revenge and betrayal. We
spiraled from ``Midsummer's Night's Dream'' to ``King Lear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I pardon that man's life, what was the cause?'' Lear rails in
the storm. ``Adultery? Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.
The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly does lecher in my
sight. . . . fie, fie, fie! Pah, pah!''
</P>
<P>
   As Shakespeare knew, it's not easy to restore balance after an
upheaval in the natural order of things. ``I fear,'' Lott said as
he belittled the president's character mere hours after the vote,
``that this sordid saga is not over.''
</P>
<P>
   Pardoned, Bill Clinton wants payback. That's normal. As he once
said about fund-raising, ``You can't take politics out of
politics.'' (It would also seem that you can't take Bill Clinton
out of politics.)
</P>
<P>
   The only real closure, after all, is revenge. Or, as Michael
Corleone would say, the time has come to settle the family's
business.
</P>
<P>
   If the impeachment was Republican payback for Watergate and the
'60s, and the trashing of Anita Hill was Republican payback for the
Democratic thwarting of Robert Bork, now the pendulum swings again,
with Democrats determined to extract a pound of flesh. (It was a
pound of flesh that got us into this mess.)
</P>
<P>
   And the Republicans have given the Democrats plenty of
ammunition. Just as Democrats once labored to shed the ``L'' word,
now Republicans will be branded with the ``I'' word. Impeachment
will carry the ominous overtones of a new Comstockism, the
intrusion of moralism and politics into private lives. We will
continue to witness the titanic twilight struggle between Comstock
and Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are whining about the president's plans to get
even. The party of mega-bullies like Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay is
shocked that Clinton might yearn to knock off some of the guys who
tried to knock him off.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP has always been expert at trivial vendettas.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbying for President George Bush's budget deal in 1990, chief
of staff John Sununu canceled an Ohio Republican's reservation for
the presidential box at the Kennedy Center after that congressman
said he was leaning against the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In October, there were news reports that DeLay threatened a
high-tech trade group when it hired a former Democratic congressman
as its president, arguing that lobbying groups should only hire
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides are trying to play down the notion that their
boss plans a Valentine's Day massacre. They admit the president
wants retribution in the next election, but say he has that dark
impulse compartmentalized in one section of his brain. In another
part of his brain, they say reassuringly, he wants reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   We should be happy the president is plotting revenge. At least
revenge is an agenda. And an agenda is what Bill Clinton
desperately lacks. If there's one thing we now know about this
inhabitant of the Oval Office, it's that he must at all costs be
kept busy.

JORDANIANS HOPE CONDOLENCES TURN INTO TANGIBLE AID
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ After a week that brought the death of King Hussein and
the crowning of his son as successor, Jordanians are hoping that
the overwhelming solidarity shown in response to their trauma will
prove to be more than passing.
</P>
<P>
   In the sadness prompted by the king's death, world leaders and
fellow members of the Hashemite family alike have pledged support
for King Abdullah, first at Monday's vast state funeral and then in
the days of mourning that followed.
</P>
<P>
   But what is important now, Jordanians and diplomats in the
region say, is that those pledges be made tangible. Jordan is now
led by a 37-year-old ruler who has little experience of power,
while a heavy debt burden has cast a shadow over a hoped-for
economic revival, and tensions within the royal family still have
the prospect to become a troublesome distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Abdullah is on more solid ground than his father was in
1952,'' a former Jordanian Cabinet minister said, in a reference to
the year that Hussein took power, at a time of turmoil in the Arab
world. ``But it's certainly shaky in some respects.''
</P>
<P>
   Another former minister offered this assessment when asked about
the young man who was thrust into his position as next in line to
the throne only in the final weeks of his father's life: ``He's not
incapable. But he needs plenty of counsel and advice, and he's also
going to need some outside help.''
</P>
<P>
   By nearly every account, where Jordan is most vulnerable is in
its economy, already suffering from high unemployment, low growth
and facing more than $8 billion in debt, an amount greater than its
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   There had been worries that nervousness over Hussein's death
could set off a crippling run on Jordan's currency, the dinar. For
now, an American promise to speed payments of millions of dollars
in economic aid to the kingdom appears to have averted that danger,
said diplomats in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the diplomats say that Jordan, an important stabilizing
force in the Middle East, remains in urgent need of relief _
perhaps through the rescheduling of hundreds of millions of dollars
in debt owed this year to Japan and Europe, or, preferably, through
forgiveness, a step embraced by the United States in 1994, when it
wiped away $700 million in Jordanian debt.
</P>
<P>
   Another hope that has been rekindled in Jordan is the prospect
that Saudi Arabia or Kuwait might revive old generosities. Before
the Persian Gulf War of 1991, those countries provided both aid and
employment to Jordan, but both streams were all but eliminated as
punishment for Hussein's tilt to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the funeral and afterward, Saudi and Kuwaiti
leaders have spoken of Jordan with fresh warmth. Diplomats in the
region are watching closely to see if those remarks translate into
any fresh sharing of wealth, although the Persian Gulf states may
be less giving now because of depressed oil prices and their own
economic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   A more distant but no less troublesome challenge for Jordan
could come in relations with the Palestinians. On Friday, the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, in a surprise move, offered what
he portrayed as a goodwill gesture to Abdullah, saying that the
Palestinians would welcome a future confederation with Jordan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such an arrangement could bring economic benefits, but it might
also carry political problems for Jordan, whose population already
includes a large Palestinian majority. If a confederation were
forged, Jordanians would become a much smaller minority, something
that could add to the prospect of internal instability.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan itself, what many citizens have been watching most
intently is a drama unfolding in the royal family, which is still
recovering from the shock of Hussein's decision last month to
dismiss his brother, Hassan, as crown prince, and to replace him
with Abdullah, Hussein's eldest son, who became king last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was very much noticed that Prince Hassan did not join
Abdullah on Tuesday in receiving mourners on the day after the
state funeral, and that when he did appear in public, he did not
wear a kaffiyeh, the traditional sign of mourning that was worn all
week by Abdullah and Hussein's other four sons.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Hassan did stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the new
king, and he pledged in a public letter to his nephew, ``I will not
hold back love, or knowledge or support.'' In a separate show of
unity, Hussein's widow, Queen Noor, received female mourners
alongside not only Princess Rania, Abdullah's wife, but also
Princess Muna, the king's British-born mother, whom Hussein
divorced in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   But associates of Hassan say he remains bitter at his removal
just two weeks before he himself would have become king, and at a
lack of sympathy shown by the Jordanian people, many of whom turned
against him after his dismissal. And as evidence of trouble within
the family, Jordanians close to the royal court pointed out that
neither Hassan's wife, Princess Sarvath, nor their three daughters
had joined other members of the royal family at Hussein's bedside
as the monarch lay dying.
</P>
<P>
   Linking Jordan's personal and practical problems is the fact
that Hassan had come to be seen by many Jordanians and foreign
investors as a figure capable of putting Jordan's economy on firmer
footing.
</P>
<P>
   There remain rumors that Hassan, 51, might leave the country, as
his father, King Talal, did in 1952 after being forced to cede the
throne to Hussein. His associates say that is unlikely; they say he
feels no animosity toward either Abdullah or the crown prince,
Hamzah, 18, who is Queen Noor's eldest son, and feels bound to
Jordan by duty and family ties. But they say he is having a
difficult time adjusting to the idea of playing a peripheral role
in a country he served for 34 years as the king's closest adviser
and confidant.
</P>
<P>
   During his reign, Hussein installed a new prime minister on the
average of once every 11 months, and diplomats say they expect
Abdullah to move soon to install his own prime minister, as a sign
that a new era has begun. But such a move is not likely, they say,
until after a 40-day mourning period ends, in mid-March.

BEHIND ERITREA-ETHIOPIA WAR, A `KNACK FOR STUBBORNNESS'  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia _ On a continent of conflicts that often
make little sense to outsiders, the war that has reignited on the
Horn of Africa may make the least sense of them all.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations here, Ethiopia and Eritrea, know full well that
they are shambling into a confrontation nearly impossible for
either of them to win. The United States has praised both nations
for their bright leaders and promising economies. Yet people here
talk with resignation of how the war has an unusual potential for
destruction. Ethiopia and Eritrea, once brother nations, have spent
the last eight months since hostilities ceased buying as much
weaponry _ planes, tanks, artillery _ as possible. In manpower
alone, the war could become the biggest in Africa. Estimates of the
number of soldiers along the border range from 120,000 to 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   These troops are dug into trenches, hard to overtake. Each
nation is run by former guerrilla leaders, and neither side is
likely to back away now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are accustomed to war,'' Hambissa Ensermu, a 19-year-old
student at Addis Ababa University, said the other day. ``The only
choice we have now is to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
warned, ``We have got to accept the fact that this war is going to
produce tens of thousands of dead if it goes ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there has been a lull in hostilities over the last
several days, Eritrea already says it killed roughly 3,000
Ethiopian soldiers since fighting broke out Feb. 6. While Ethiopia
ridicules that claim as wildly inflated, it says more than 7,000
Eritreans have been killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the State Department advised American citizens to
leave both countries, citing worries that the fighting could spread
to either capital, as it did last spring, when Ethiopia launched
attacks against Asmara.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the weaponry and number of soldiers, there is another
element that may be driving the conflict to catastrophe, a quality
one observer called the two nations' ``knack for stubbornness.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is nominally about a rocky piece of land along the
border, known as the Badme region, which is barely populated and
holds no special significance, as one merchant in the main market
here said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That area, I think, is desert,'' the merchant, Tilahun Wolde,
25, said. ``It's valueless.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said he believed that Ethiopia should fight as
long as necessary to reclaim it from the Eritreans, who have held
it since May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's territory, you know,'' he said. ``We'll die for our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from around the world, including Kofi Annan, the U.N.
secretary-general, have called for a halt to the fighting. Last
week, President Clinton spoke out for the second time recently,
saying that ``a peaceful solution can and must be found without
delay.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments underscore that this, unlike most conflicts in
Africa, is one in which America has definable interests. Each
nation is a strong ally, and Eritrea sits astride the oil channels
of the Red Sea.

</P>
<P>
   Despite their dispute, the two nations have been regarded as
being comparatively stable in a turbulent region. Their neighbor to
the west, Sudan, is a haven for both terrorists and Islamic
militants, U.S. officials contend. Their neighbor to the east,
Somalia, where 18 American lives were lost in 1993 in an effort to
alleviate famine, remains fractured among competing clans.
</P>
<P>
   More abstractly, the war would seem to sound death knells for
the notion of an ``African renaissance,'' pushed with special vigor
over the last few years by the United States and derided by many
less optimistic outsiders. Meles Zenawi, the prime minister of
Ethiopia, and Isaias Afwerki, president of Eritrea, were among the
``new breed'' of African leaders hailed by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of their conflict are tangled. Meles, from the
Ethiopian border province of Tigray, and Afwerki fought side by
side for years in the war to overthrow the brutal regime of
Mengistu Haile Mariam. They won in 1991, and two years later,
Eritrea, which had been the northernmost province of Ethiopia only
since 1962, separated peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   But the divorce of the two nations did not come without tension.
The most pronounced split came in 1997, when Eritrea introduced its
own currency over Ethiopia's objections. Ethiopia responded by
demanding that all trade with Eritrea be conducted in hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations also never formally drew their 600-mile border.
Last May, the bad feelings erupted when Eritrean troops occupied
the Badme region, roughly 250 square miles. The Eritreans said that
old colonial maps showed that it belonged to them, but the
Ethiopians said it had always been theirs.
</P>
<P>
   After brief but fierce battles, the two sides agreed to a
cease-fire last June. Since then, they have worked toward both war
and peace.
</P>
<P>
   For war, each nation has bought hundreds of millions of dollars
in military hardware, mostly from Russia and Ukraine, several
diplomats said. Eritrea purchased half a dozen Russian MIG fighter
jets, essentially doubling the size of its small air force.
</P>
<P>
   For peace, the Organization of African Unity drafted a plan that
called for Eritrea to withdraw its troops and for Ethiopian
administration to be restored as international mediators decided
where, in fact, the border lay. Ethiopia accepted the plan. But
Eritrea has objected to a renewed Ethiopian administrative presence
and has demanded instead that impartial monitors be placed in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said Eritrea is willing to leave the disputed areas,''
said Yemane Ghevreab, an aide to Afwerki. ``We are saying that the
other side should also withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea also has called for any peace plan to address what it
calls the violations of the human rights of the 52,000 Eritreans
deported from Ethiopia since the first round of hostilities.
Ethiopia says that nearly 40,000 of its citizens have been ejected
from Eritrea. Human rights officials say both claims are inflated.
</P>
<P>
   Most foreign nations seem gingerly to blame Eritrea for not
accepting the OAU plan, the only peace proposal on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia has been using that refusal by Eritrea as its first
line of defense in the battle for public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not only an OAU exercise,'' Ethiopia's foreign
minister, Seyoum Mesfin, said in an interview. ``It's the voice of
the international community, which Ethiopia has accepted and
Eritrea has not.''
</P>
<P>
   There are currently no negotiations. Mesfin said that Eritrea
must be taught that ``acquiring territory by use of force is
unacceptable to civilized nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghevreab, of Eritrea, accused Ethiopia of resuming the
hostilities Feb. 6, in what he called ``an adventurist, very
reckless path.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' he said. ``We shouldn't have come to this.''
</P>
<P>
   One Western defense official theorized that the fighting may in
fact have begun by accident.
</P>
<P>
   With so many troops in place along the border and clear
boundaries yet to be marked between them, there was, and remains,
ample room for miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is that this was not a planned offensive,'' the
official said. ``What you are seeing now is something we have
feared for months.''

U.S. BRUSHES OFF MEXICO DRUG DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MEXICO-CLINTON) 
(lb) 
 By TIM GOLDEN with CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Clinton administration weighs its annual
evaluation of Mexico's cooperation in fighting illegal drugs, U.S.
officials admit privately that by most statistical measures, the
Mexican record looks especially bad this year.
</P>
<P>
   Drug seizures by the Mexican police have fallen significantly.
Nearly all of the most important Mexican narcotics traffickers
identified last year remain at large. The promised extraditions of
some Mexican drug suspects to the United States have not
materialized, and drug enforcement programs have been rocked by a
series of public conflicts between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as President Clinton embarks on a brief visit to Mexico
starting Sunday, his aides have neither despaired of such facts nor
spent much time analyzing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between cooperation and success,'' the
State Department spokesman, James Rubin, argued last week. While
their cooperation might not be having much effect on the problem,
he suggested, Mexican officials ``are cooperating more closely with
the United States at virtually every level than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   The fervor with which administration officials are praising
Mexico's record _ even before studying the assessments being
collected from various government agencies _ underscores how for
Mexico the yearly ``certification'' process has become more of a
joint public-relations campaign aimed at the Congress than an
objective appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about what Mexico has done,'' one administration
official said, speaking on the condition that he not be identified.
``This is about convincing the Hill that whatever Mexico has done
is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say their evaluation, which is expected
by the end of the month and mandated by a 1986 law for countries
where drugs are produced or transported, is particularly
counterproductive in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   To observe the law strictly and possibly impose the economic
penalties it contemplates, they argue, would be to place a
strategic and complex relationship at risk for just one of the many
interests that the United States has in Mexico. And Mexican
officials have done their best to underscore that risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to think what decertification would
provoke,'' Mexico's ambassador to the United States, Jesus Reyes
Heroles, said in an interview. ``The equilibrium that underlies our
relationship with the United States would be undone.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts of Mexican politics describe such warnings as
overblown. Moreover, aides to a half-dozen Washington legislators
who have played leading roles on the drug issue say Mexico's
decertification is unlikely anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The aides, speaking on the condition they not be identified,
said they expected a formal endorsement of Mexico's efforts from
the administration and then an energetic congressional effort to
override that endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   But they added that they see no clear sign that they will be any
more able to reverse the certification than they were last year,
when a Senate motion for disapproval gathered only 45 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of weariness with fighting the same battle over
and over,'' a Senate aide said. ``It gets old.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the administration note that although the Mexican
authorities have not made much headway against the drug mafias over
the last year, the establishment of elite anti-drug units within
the army and the federal police has led to closer working
relationships with the CIA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   But officials from each of those agencies challenge the
administration's public assertion that the Mexican authorities are
trying their best. Those officials contend that the obstacle to
success in Mexico is not so much the strength of the traffickers or
the inexperience of the police but the Mexican government's
unwillingness to fight corruption more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officers working with the military's special
anti-drug force, the Center for Anti-Narcotics Information, say
they believe that some of its efforts may have been compromised by
corrupt superiors, officials said. Three senior agents of an elite
Mexican police force trained by U.S. officials failed lie-detector
tests last year over questions about their contacts with drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The agents were moved out of the unit but remain in the federal
police.
</P>
<P>
   Drug investigations that have touched on several well-known
Mexican politicians and at least a dozen high-ranking military
officers have not yet led to any arrests, despite what U.S.
officials describe as strong evidence that some of the politicians
and officers have sought to protect traffickers in return for large
bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, officials say that on a series of
occasions over the last year, U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement
officials have provided their Mexican counterparts with information
on the whereabouts of powerful drug traffickers, only to have
Mexican agents mishandle the intelligence or wait for hours before
carrying out raids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give them houses, we give them phone numbers _ and nothing
happens,'' said a U.S. official. ``Cases go nowhere.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   An embarrassing example of the problem will provide a backdrop
for President Clinton's meetings with President Ernesto Zedillo,
which are to take place in and around the city of Merida, on the
Yucatan peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the peninsula, in the state of Quintana Roo, U.S.
intelligence and law-enforcement officials have been working for
more than a year with elite Mexican forces to dismantle a major
drug-smuggling operation with headquarters in the resort city of
Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   In one debacle last spring, U.S. officials said, officers of the
military intelligence unit recognized two of the most important
traffickers in the Cancun organization, Ramon Alcides Magana and
Albino Quintero Meraz, but made no attempt to capture them.
</P>
<P>
   On other occasions, U.S. intelligence officials gave officers of
the military unit home addresses and telephone numbers for each of
the two traffickers. But again, officials said, opportunities to
arrest the pair were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the unit appeared to get an important break when
it captured Gilberto Garza Garcia, the trafficker who oversaw the
mafia's movement of cocaine shipments from Cancun up the gulf coast
to McAllen, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. and Mexican officials said that after negotiating with
the general who headed the military unit and promising to help him
trap Magana, Garza Garcia was placed in the custody of two
detectives from whom he escaped the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The general has since been reassigned, Garza has been recaptured
and the detectives have been under investigation since being found
with more than $20,000 given to them by the trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   The White House drug-policy chief, Gen. Barry McCaffrey,
suggested that such short-term failings should not distract the
United States from its ultimate goals for Mexico. And while he and
other White House officials have often tried to silence
law-enforcement agencies that are critical of Mexico's performance,
he did not hesitate to offer his own view on certification in
advance of the administration's deliberations on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we ought to do is look at U.S. national interests
in the long term,'' McCaffrey said. ``Do we think that partnership
with Mexico is important to us and is beginning to show signs of
substantial cooperation? My own advice'' to Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright ``is they should be certified.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials have undertaken a similarly aggressive defense
of their efforts, lobbying more intensively than ever in Washington
and spending $100,000 a month to hire three high-profile lobbying
firms to assist them in getting their message out.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials have also held out to U.S. officials the
possibility that they might yet deliver a spectacular, last-minute
blow in the drug fight, one that could erase questions on Capitol
Hill about their willingness to move against the mafias.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical U.S. officials have taken to calling this notion ``the
February surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   According to senior officials of both countries, the surprise is
that the Mexican authorities, who have long been investigating the
governor of Quintana Roo, Mario Villanueva Madrid, might move to
indict him on drug-related charges sometime after Clinton's
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva has repeatedly denied providing any support to the
drug mafia that has flourished in Quintana Roo during his
administration, but a Mexican federal judge last week denied the
governor's request for information about the investigation against
him.

COMMENTARY: WHAT'S GOING ON? 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The students at Bushwick Outreach, an alternative
high school in Brooklyn, were telling me about their encounters
with the police. Some were quietly emotional, but the prevailing
tone was resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Lani Soto, 18, recalled the night last July when two uniformed
officers approached her on a subway train in Bay Ridge. She had
just left work and was on her way to Williamsburg, where she lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about 11 o'clock,'' she said. ``I was just sitting
there and the cops came up and started asking me questions. One of
the cops said, `Get up.' I said I didn't want to get up. He grabbed
me by my hair and said, `You're going to get up.' He pulled me up
by my hair and pushed my face into the doors. Then he started
touching me sexually, claiming he was frisking me. He put his hands
between my legs and on my breasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the train stopped and the doors opened, I just stepped
out and they started laughing at me. I just started crying. The
cops can do what they want because they have a badge and a gun.
When it happened it made me feel low. I sat down on the bench and
waited for the next train.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Coram, 18, said he's been stopped and searched so many
times ``you almost become immune to it.'' He said the ``most
embarrassing incident'' occurred late on a Friday afternoon when he
and about eight friends were on their way to a party. ``An
undercover squad car pulled up on Liberty Avenue and these guys
jumped out real fast, screaming at us. My friend said, `Well, who
are you?' They didn't like that so they said, `All right, everybody
on your knees.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And they put us on our knees side by side and searched us one
by one. They cursed at us the whole time. The sun was out and
everybody was looking at us. When we got up we didn't even feel
like going to the party. We went home.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard said he and his friends feel there is nothing they can
do about the harassment, that it is just a routine part of life.
``If you resist, you will get the beating of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Angerosa, 19, said he and some friends were hanging out
on New Year's Eve when a group of police officers drove up and
ordered them to line up against a wall. Joseph's mother spotted
them from a window and ran outside. Joseph said that when she
demanded to know what was happening, a cop told her to ``shut the
(expletive) up and keep on walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph said, ``I asked the cop why he was talking to my mom like
that. He pulled out his gun, pointed it dead at me and told me to
get up against the wall. I did what he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always being harassed by the police. I believe it is
because we are Hispanic. But what can you do about it?''
</P>
<P>
   The students related their stories in separate interviews, one
after another. Richard Wilcher told of the officer who, during a
search, grabbed his genitals and squeezed and yanked so hard he had
to go to a hospital for treatment. Omega Linton told of the officer
who, for no reason, demanded identification, including her name,
address, telephone number and Social Security number. When she
objected, he threatened to arrest her. She gave him the
information.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Cruz was stopped in a subway station by an officer who
demanded identification. She didn't have any. She said that when
she objected to the way she was being treated the officer grabbed
her, threw her against a wall and put her in handcuffs. Emily's
teacher, Ellie Weiss, happened to come by a few minutes later. She
persuaded the officers to remove the handcuffs and release her
student.
</P>
<P>
   The stories went on and on, too many for me to hear. Such is
life for young black and Hispanic residents of New York City. They
do not have the same rights as whites. The police treat them as
lesser beings, stopping them, demanding identification, and
searching their clothing and their bodies at will. They are fondled
and beaten and endlessly humiliated while the mayor, the police
commissioner and other top officials simply look the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've actually seen students break down, crying over what they
feel is serious harassment,'' said Adam Gerstein, the principal of
Bushwick Outreach. ``When you see that the students really are
traumatized, and when it happens so often, you've really got to
wonder what's going on out there.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 14:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's acquittal of President Clinton brings relief to a
scandal-weary country, but it ushers in a new era of distrust in
Washington. For all their pledges to seek a new bipartisanship,
Democrats may now be more interested in trying to capitalize on
impeachment fatigue by confronting and demonizing the Republicans
in order to retake Congress. Republicans are divided, perplexed and
wary of Democratic motives.
</P>
<P>
   But that is only a snapshot, 21 months before the next election.
The future need not be characterized by more trench warfare. Both
parties have time to lift their sights and approach their work in
the constructive spirit desired by the public.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are feeling confident now that Republican House
managers could not get even a majority of senators to back the
perjury and obstruction charges against Clinton. Dick Gephardt,
assessing the slim Republican edge in the House and the party's
fumbling since the election, has sensibly decided to remain as the
House Democratic leader, withdraw from the presidential race and
focus his energies on becoming speaker. That leaves Gephardt and
Vice President Al Gore in a tight alliance that poses a more
serious political and fund-raising threat to the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats must also be careful not to appear indifferent to
the public's tortured ambivalence toward President Clinton and his
conduct. Any White House-inspired attempt to punish the House
impeachment managers could easily backfire, reinforcing the image
of an unrepentant president. Most of the House managers are from
extremely safe districts, in any case.
</P>
<P>
   As chastened as they may be by the impeachment debacle,
Republicans can take some comfort in the fact that it ended with a
measure of dignity. That conclusion is a tribute to Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, who managed to maintain a bipartisan spirit even
when the votes were not. He avoided the mistakes of the House, kept
the Senate dialogue going, and mostly allowed all sides to feel
they had given it a legitimate shot, though this judicious tone was
marred somewhat by Lott's bitter comments about the president after
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures on Republicans are tremendous. They are more split
over politics, cultural matters and basic issues like tax cuts and
Social Security than at any time since seizing control of Congress
in 1994, and have a precarious House majority that makes any
defection a potentially fatal blow. The underlying fissures
surfaced last week when 11 House Republicans walked away from a
plan for an across-the-board tax cut supported by the Speaker
Dennis Hastert, who had hoped to make taxes the centerpiece of his
campaign to unite the party around Reagan-style verities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the partisan tension, there are points of agreement on
issues of great concern to the public. A bipartisan majority in
both the Senate and the House favors legislation to reform
campaign-finance laws, raise the minimum wage and create a
patient's bill of rights. Many Republicans are also prepared to
join with Democrats to spend more for school construction and new
teachers, special-education programs, tax credits to help families
care for the disabled and for stopping suburban sprawl through
undeveloped land.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert apparently feels he cannot afford politically to anger
his party's base or its right wing. But he also needs to respect
the independence of those Republicans ready to make deals with the
Democrats. Besides, if agreements on smaller issues can be
fashioned, they can serve, to borrow the language of arms control,
as confidence-building measures to get to the larger issues later
in the year.
</P>
<P>
   With the impeachment process completed, Americans yearn for a
Congress that can actually accomplish something. Reverting to more
party warfare will hurt both sides. The trick will be for lawmakers
to look beyond their trenches to see where the public interest
lies.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The official word from President Clinton and
congressional leaders in the aftermath of Friday's impeachment vote
was that the time had come to bury the hatchet and work together on
important policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   But out of camera range, many in the White House and the Capitol
said the bad blood was so pervasive, the ideological divisions so
vast and the political interests so disparate that they doubted
productive bridges could be built between Clinton and the
Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were stung by the report last week that Clinton
planned to seek political retribution in the next elections against
those who impeached him and tried to drive him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't sound like reconciliation and progress to me,''
said Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader. ``That
sounds like revenge and politics. Then he says, `You can trust me
on Social Security.' Yeah! Uh-huh!''
</P>
<P>
   A top Republican legislative strategist, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said: ``I don't think the president has any
interest in achieving solutions in the next two years. Electing
Gore president and a Democratic House would be vindication for him,
and that's what he will focus on.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House official who also insisted on anonymity said that
while some of the president's advisers thought he should seek
compromises this year with Republicans on divisive issues like
Social Security, Medicare, taxes and education, many other advisers
were arguing that a better course would be to wait until after the
next election, when they expect Al Gore will be president and
Democrats will control the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bipartisan cooperation isn't the reflex response right now,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the naysayers, another school of thought holds that
it is to the advantage of both the president and the Republicans to
strike compromises on the big issues so that both can rise above
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's been badly damaged by this,'' said Rep. Peter
King, R-N.Y. ``He has to be aware of that. We have to realize that
we were badly hurt by impeachment and we have to show we're a
governing party.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Begala, the president's counselor, offered a similar view.
Asked whether Clinton's efforts to promote a Democratic sweep in
the 2000 elections would pose a risk to legislative compromise, he
replied: ``That's a false choice. Getting things done and
prospering politically go hand in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The political atmosphere in Congress may have been improved by
the Republicans' election this year of Dennis Hastert of Illinois
as speaker of the House and by a newfound camaraderie in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we need to show we're not something to be
scared of,'' King said, and Hastert, a low-key former high school
wrestling coach, seems to fit that bill.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN last week, in one of the first interviews he has granted
since he became speaker, Hastert contrasted himself with his
bombastic predecessor, Newt Gingrich:
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt was a visionary,'' Hastert said. ``He was articulate. He
had his own ideas, and I mean he was on TV a lot. My job is to make
sure that we can put the right people in the spotlight to get the
job done. I guess that's part of going back to my old coaching
career, where we made stars out of a lot of people, but I was never
in the spotlight much myself. That's how I see this job.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Capitol, senators from both parties
said that the long hours they spent together during the impeachment
trial could have positive effects. ``This may actually help us work
together,'' Lott said. ``What it has done is given us a renewed
understanding of each other's problems and viewpoints. We have
gotten to know each other better as people.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the question of whether Clinton and the Republicans in
Congress overcome their hard feelings from impeachment and find
legislative alliances is the matter of whether the Republicans can
present a united front. In both the House and the Senate, if the
Democrats hold the party line and only five or six Republicans
break ranks, the Democrats will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The first test of this will come in the next few weeks when
lawmakers try to draft a budget blueprint to guide the tax and
spending legislation for the rest of the year. Last year, the House
and Senate were at such odds over taxes that for the first time in
25 years, no budget plan was adopted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tax policy, of course, is the most fundamental dispute between
Clinton and the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The president wants a steep increase in the federal cigarette
tax that would more than offset a grab bag of small tax cuts he has
proposed to help taxpayers meet specific expenses like nursing-home
bills and child care. Almost all Republicans, by contrast, want
large tax cuts, but there is no agreement on how to apportion them.
</P>
<P>
   One faction, led by Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, chairman of the
House Budget Committee, favors an immediate 10 percent reduction in
income-tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   Another faction, headed by Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico,
chairman of the Budget Committee, would implement the tax cuts
gradually as the projected budget surplus grew. Under Domenici's
plan, there would be little or no cut this year, a cut of 4 percent
or so by 2004 and a cut as high as 15 percent by the end of the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other Republican tax proposals, too. For example,
a band of moderate representatives led by Nancy Johnson of
Connecticut favors more moderate reductions than those sought by
Kasich, and there may be enough support for this plan to deny
Kasich a majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The tax issue is crucial to Republicans. Clinton has co-opted
many traditional Republican issues like balanced budgets, crime
control, welfare reform and additional military spending.
</P>
<P>
   Tax policy is one of the few remaining areas where they think
they can win popular support.
</P>
<P>
   The other big issue of the year is Social Security. If the
president and Congress can reach an accord, it would certainly be
the biggest legislative accomplishment since the tax code was
rewritten in 1986 and possibly the most important one since the
days of the Great Society more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, the chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said in an interview that he thought the time was ripe
this year. ``I think the president really wants to save Social
Security before he leaves,'' said Archer, a Texas Republican who
plans to retire at the end of next year. ``I really want to save
Social Security before I leave, too, and I think we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither the president nor Archer has expressed willingness
to compromise, and the two sides are far apart.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans want to turn Social Security partly into a private
program in which workers take some of the money they now pay in
taxes and invest it in their own accounts in the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats fear that could result in unsophisticated workers
losing a big part of their retirement savings to bear markets or
unscrupulous sales pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the Democrats in Congress argue that to the extent
any Social Security money is put into the stock market, the
government should do the investing. That strikes most Republicans
as a dangerous breach of the capitalist system.
</P>
<P>
   As if that division were not enough, neither side has been
willing to address the basic question of how, in the long term,
retirement benefits should be cut, even though both sides agree
this is an essential element to preserving Social Security for
today's children.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, for all their talk about strengthening Social
Security, Republicans are gun-shy. It has been a mainstay of
Democratic politics for more than 60 years, and whenever
Republicans have tried to tinker with the program, they have been
burned.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the heavyweight issues of taxes and Social Security,
there are some middleweight matters where deals may be struck. The
president and the Republicans, for example, seem prepared to work
together on a sizable increase in military spending.
</P>
<P>
   But other issues on which there is apparent agreement could
still become mired in political quicksand.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there was considerable harmony last year over the
idea that new regulations should be enacted to protect patients in
their dealings with health insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation foundered when Democrats insisted that the law
be changed so that people could sue their health maintenance
organizations, and Republicans objected.
</P>
<P>
   To get around the sticking point this year, Archer suggested,
the House may take up the issue piecemeal _ passing one bill, for
example, to require HMOs to pay for all reasonable emergency-room
procedures, then another bill to require the insurers to allow
women to use their obstetrician-gynecologist as their primary-care
physician, and so forth until all the popular provisions have been
approved one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of the House that restrict amendments, the
question of lawsuits could be bypassed. But it would not help the
case when the bill got to the Senate, where amendments are not
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure on which the president and the Republicans seem
in accord involves tax breaks to promote school construction. But
there are political pitfalls here, too.
</P>
<P>
   Tax bills must be initiated in the House. Republican leaders
there fear that if they pass a small-gauge tax bill like the one
for schools and send it to the Senate, they will have no control
over sweeping tax measures the senators may attach.
</P>
<P>
   What all this means is that when Congress returns from its
weeklong recess, there will be a few weeks of shadowboxing while
the president and Congress take each other's measure.
</P>
<P>
   But sooner or later they will have to make contact. They cannot
accomplish anything alone.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial reinforced the low regard that the
Republicans have for Clinton, Lott told reporters. But he added,
``We have to deal with him as long as he's president.''

   PARIS _ President Clinton's acquittal on impeachment charges was
seen in most places around the world Saturday as a victory for
common sense.
</P>
<P>
   The good guys won, the influential French daily Le Monde told
its readers. ``The country recognized more of itself in Bill
Clinton than in Kenneth Starr, and so much the better,'' the
newspaper said in an editorial, referring to the independent
counsel whose findings led to the president's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The news itself did not even make the front page of Le Monde, or
that of popular British tabloid newspapers that normally thrive on
sex scandals.
</P>
<P>
   The slightly more sedate Times of London ran the banner
headline, ``Clinton: the great escape,'' but it did not get very
excited about the news. ``As an event it was rather like listening
to the football results when you already know who has won,'' the
article said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Britain, Clinton's impeachment on perjury and
obstruction of justice charges in the Monica Lewinsky affair has
always been seen as a matter of neither seamy sex nor high
principle, but rather as pure partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   Never having really understood why the House of Representatives
and the Senate went through with the impeachment process, most
foreigners are glad it is over.
</P>
<P>
   South African President Nelson Mandela Africa congratulated both
the Senate and the White House on Friday's verdict and said he
hoped that the United States could turn its attention to more
urgent things.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, where Clinton planned to talk in Merida with
President Ernesto Zedillo on Sunday about immigration and drug
trafficking problems, political analyst Sergio Sarmiento told The
Associated Press: ``It's incomprehensible for the majority of
Mexicans that an intimate relationship would be converted into a
political persecution.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of Israel's opposition Labor Party, Ehud Barak, said he
had written to Clinton to express satisfaction with the Senate's
decision. Israeli radio reported that Barak hoped Clinton could now
turn to trying to restart the Middle East peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer hoped that the
United States could now focus on trade, The Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the conservative daily Le Figaro, which did put the
news of the acquittal on its front page, wondered whether Clinton's
popularity, soaring in all the months of the scandal inquiry, might
drop now.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who visited Clinton in
Washington before the final Senate votes, said, ``The subject
doesn't interest me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the chancellor told reporters, was to him ``one of the
great American presidents.''

   LOS ANGELES _ After the tapes and the lies, the tears, the
betrayals and the trial, the impeachment drama that gripped, then
repelled and finally seemed to numb the nation for more than a year
is over at last. And in its wake, in the culture it both reflected
and so often seemed so disconnected from, it has left _ what?
</P>
<P>
   Deeper partisan dissension and a sharper moral divide? A renewed
respect for the instincts of democracy and the accuracy of public
opinion polls? A surfeit of sex jokes and a nation of children who
learned in the same breath about the birds and the bees and how a
bill becomes a law?
</P>
<P>
   Husbands and wives have been forced to face infidelity, perhaps
even their own, in new and public ways. Politicians and would-be
politicians have had skeletons in their own closets rattled. Much
of the press and popular culture has let slip all remaining
restraint on topics once taboo, because those topics arose in a
criminal investigation of the president and appeared in the Starr
report's footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   The reference points are pervasive. The night before the Senate
voted to acquit President Clinton, an episode of ``ER'' featured a
fetching young doctor in thong underwear, and the same ``Today''
program that broadcast the first televised interview with Linda
Tripp also included an interview with talk show host Jerry
Springer, who conducts his own daily brawls over infidelity, failed
friendship and the follies of lust and power.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to say that Watergate had the effect of making the
country more cynical,'' said Nelson George, the author of ``Hip Hop
America'' (Viking, 1998), a well received work on the pervasive
effects of hip-hop culture. ``This contributes in a different way.
Whereas there was a great suspicion of political leaders trying to
steal things or mislead the public, this feels like the presidency
and politics has become part of the Ricki Lake culture. This whole
thing is nothing more than another episode.''
</P>
<P>
   A highly arbitrary and unscientific sampling of writers,
historians and critical thinkers on both the left and right last
week revealed little certainty about the impact on the nation of
the investigation into the president's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, beyond the foregone conclusion that the law allowing
appointment of independent counsels will be greatly modified or
allowed to lapse.
</P>
<P>
   But a rough consensus did emerge that the whole affair left the
transitory feeling of a nightmare or a movie, and that it amounted
more to an amplification of social and political trends already
well under way than a wholly new phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that there will be any lasting consequences
beyond the wretched Beltway,'' novelist Ward Just said from Berlin.
``The affair seems to me a kind of parenthesis in the national
narrative. It came out of nowhere and will end as it began, a
matter of tremendous consequence to Clinton and to Lewinsky, with
not much resonance for the rest of us. Anything momentous has a
mystery at its heart, and this episode has no mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, it's been some time since Americans took moral
instruction from anyone in Washington. This story is like this
week's best-selling novel, remembered for as long as the plane
flight, forgotten almost at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Cass Sunstein, a professor at the University of Chicago Law
School who has argued that the independent-counsel law has created
``bizarre incentives'' for prosecutors with unlimited budgets and
undivided attention to pursue investigations beyond reasonable
bounds, said it was good that the Lewinsky case had apparently
doomed the law.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunstein added: ``There is also heightened risk of political
polarization among people for whom this is a defining event. Some
people will think that the impeachment shows the zealotry and
extremism of some elements, others that it shows that some
Democrats don't care about lawlessness. I tend to think that, by
itself, it's more blip than earthquake, but it may aggravate some
bad current tendencies toward political polarization, accusation,
even rage.''
</P>
<P>
   David Horowitz, a writer and president of the Center for the
Study of Popular Culture in Los Angeles and one of the more
prominent conservative voices here, said he thought ``people are
going to be less enthusiastic about probing questions and
investigations about candidates' private lives.'' By contrast,
Douglas Brinkley, a liberal historian at the University of New
Orleans, declared: ``We've learned that character does matter. It
is always going to be scrutinized in elections after this, because
people are going to want to know answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nora Ephron, the screenwriter and director, said that ``it's too
soon to tell'' what the impact of the past year's events would be
but added dryly: ``Will there ever be a husband anyone believes
again?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Debra Haffner, the president of the Sexuality Information and
Education Council of the United States, a nonprofit group that
advocates sex education, said the affair had forced painful
discussions between couples and between parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this did either force some parents to talk perhaps
before they felt ready to do so, and I also think the adult silence
on this issue simply left many kids to their own devices,'' Ms.
Haffner said. ``In relationships I know where people had had
infidelity and moved on, and here it is again every night in your
bedroom on the 11 o'clock news, it has been very painful. No one's
talking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ms. Haffner said, she was surprised at the way
most Americans responded to the Starr report's more explicit
descriptions of sex in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected that America would not accept that and would turn
on the president,'' Ms. Haffner said, ``and yet America responded
with a maturity that said, `This is private, and these kinds of
details don't belong in the public sphere.'''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Kalb, a longtime correspondent for CBS News who now heads
the Shorenstein Center for Press and Politics at the Kennedy School
of Government at Harvard, said the Lewinsky story, with its tabloid
details, and the all-news-all-the-time culture of cable and the
Internet inspired a level of sensationalist coverage that ``has
trumped old-fashioned mainstream journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalb said of the coverage, ``Years ago, it established a
beachhead on what could be called the island of journalism, and
gradually, it has extended that beachhead.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Kalb said, other stories, like the country's policy
toward weapons inspections in Iraq, had received less coverage than
usual ``because there is simply not enough space and time on
network news when there are so many pressures forcing editors and
producers to come in with more Monica or more ``news you can
use.''''
</P>
<P>
   Brinkley of New Orleans said he feared that one corollary of the
investigative and prosecutorial culture pervading Washington would
be ``a conscious effort not to leave historical footprints'' in the
form of tapes, notes and diaries, long the lifeblood of historians.
</P>
<P>
   But Brinkley was quick to say he did not believe the year's
events had left students particularly disillusioned, if only
because they had few illusions to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a society with a 40 to 50 percent divorce rate, and a
lot of these students come from broken homes,'' he said. ``The
perfect family is not a reality to them; they watch ``The Brady
Bunch'' and mock it.''
</P>
<P>
   Horowitz, the conservative writer, said the year was rife with
anomalies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society works by a lot of unspoken rules and mores and
manners,'' he said. ``And that code was snapped by Clinton. He
doesn't seem to have the kind of conscience you'd expect in
somebody who has the responsibilities that he has.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Horowitz said, moderation won out. ``We're
not going to have, `Oh, God, the moralistic authoritarians telling
us what to do,''' he said, ``and it's not going to be anarchy,
sexual or otherwise, either. This is a very centrist country, knock
wood.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has said he would
defer a decision on whether to indict President Clinton until his
impeachment trial was over. Decision time has now arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But it comes at a precarious moment for Starr and his office:
Never before in his 41/2-year tenure as independent counsel has
Starr been forced to fend off as many escalating inquiries and so
much mounting criticism from different quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is launching an inquiry into alleged
misconduct by Starr's prosecutors. A special master is nearing
completion of a report on alleged leaks to the news media by
prosecutors in Starr's office. And the District of Columbia's
Office of Bar Counsel, which investigates accusations of wrongdoing
by lawyers, is conducting a separate inquiry into allegations of
misconduct made against several prosecutors in Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   If that were not enough, the conduct of Starr's office will be
closely examined by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee,
which will begin hearings on Feb. 24 to explore the strengths and
weaknesses of the independent counsel law. The controversial law,
enacted in 1978 after the Watergate inquiry, will expire on June 30
unless Congress reauthorizes it; the almost-certain demise of the
statute in its present form is likely to be one of Starr's
legacies.
</P>
<P>
   Although Starr has been relatively quiet in recent weeks, his
prosecutors watched the Senate trial very closely while preparing
for four pending criminal trials to be held later this year. Two
are scheduled to begin next month.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Starr must decide whether or not he
should seek the indictment of the president. Starr has told
associates that he believes he has the constitutional authority to
seek Clinton's indictment before his term expires in January 2001,
said several associates who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr has not told his closest associates what he intends to
do, nor has he ``dropped any hints,'' one associate said.

   The associates said they believed that Starr was sensitive to
the fact that the indictment of a sitting president could cause the
nation to suffer a cataclysmic constitutional crisis after having
already endured a lengthy impeachment process. These associates
said they doubted whether Starr would ever be prepared to take such
a momentous step.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of Starr's cautiousness, one associate recalled
that Starr was especially sensitive about the timing of sending the
445-page impeachment referral to the House of Representatives last
September. The associate said Starr insisted that it not be sent
while the president was out of the country, or while Congress was
in recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he would decide to indict a sitting president, he would
consider many factors, including the impact of such a decision on
national security and the economy,'' said the associate who speaks
frequently with Starr. ``He is not reckless.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the House Judiciary Committee last November,
Starr said he would wait until the end of the congressional
impeachment process to decide whether there was sufficient evidence
to seek the indictment of Clinton on charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice related to the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also testified that he had not reached a decision on the
question of whether there was sufficient evidence against Clinton
to persuade a ``fair-minded jury'' to ``convict based on these
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   But since the outcome of the Senate trial appeared certain for
weeks, Starr and members of his team have quietly confronted the
question. Several associates said last week that a sharp rift had
developed among Starr's prosecutors over what he should do and when
he should do it.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers inside the office and advisers outside the office
have quietly lobbied Starr to seek the indictment of the president
before he leaves office, associates of Starr said. Two senior
constitutional advisers, Ronald Rotunda and William Kelley, have
told Starr that they believe there is nothing in the Constitution
or recent legal authority that would prevent such an indictment.
Starr's office is aware that the president's lawyers would
challenge the constitutionality of an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   However, some lawyers in Starr's office and advisers outside the
office firmly believe that the office of the independent counsel
should not indict Clinton until after he leaves office in 23
months, if at all. Those lawyers said that a grand jury indictment
of the president while he was in office was unlikely, according to
associates.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another issue facing Starr is that some of the most senior
lawyers in the office who played pivotal roles in the Lewinsky
inquiry will not be remaining in the office until Starr makes his
decision. Robert Bittman and Brett Kavanaugh, two of the office's
most important lawyers on the Lewinsky inquiry, have announced
their intentions to leave. And Jackie Bennett, Starr's deputy who
participated in the grand jury questioning of the president, is
also hunting for a job in Indiana, his native state, the associates
said.
</P>
<P>
   With those lawyers most familiar with the case leaving, The
Washington Post reported last week, it looks increasingly unlikely
that Starr intends to indict the president before he leaves office.
But one associate dismissed the speculation, saying, ``Those
lawyers don't know what Ken is thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, after the Senate's votes to acquit the president, the
leading prosecutor for the House impeachment managers said that it
would not be good for the country if Starr indicted the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think indicting and criminally trying him, after what
we have all been through, is going to be helpful to the country,''
said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who heads the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been speculation about Starr's thoughts and plans
for his own professional fate, although he has been mum about his
future. Several associates have said they are convinced that Starr
may leave the office within the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   But another associate predicted that Starr would stay until the
important decisions were made and the clouds over his office had
lifted. ``I think he now feels a moral obligation not to drop this
thing,'' said the associate, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``He wants to see it through.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky grand jury's 18-month term expires next month. But
prosecutors could seek a six-month extension, which would allow the
current 23 members to continue hearing evidence about the Lewinsky
matter. Or, the associates said, Starr could seek a sealed
indictment against the president, or present the existing evidence
to a new grand jury for an indictment later.
</P>
<P>
   The statute of limitations on perjury and obstruction of justice
is five years, meaning that Starr could conceivably seek an
indictment as late as 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the matter of an indictment of Clinton, the office is
also actively investigating several issues relating to a former
White House volunteer, Kathleen Willey, who has testified that the
president made an unwanted sexual pass at her just outside the Oval
Office in November 1993. Starr's prosecutors are investigating
whether there were unlawful efforts to influence her testimony in
the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   In a related case, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Ms. Willey's,
faces trial on charges that she made false statements under oath
that had cast doubt on Ms. Willey's claim. She is also charged with
trying to influence the testimony of others in the office.
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, Starr's prosecutors will begin Susan McDougal's
criminal contempt trial in Little Rock, Ark. Ms. McDougal is
charged with refusing to answer a grand jury's questions about
whether the president lied under oath when he testified in 1996
about the failed Whitewater land deal. If convicted, she faces a
10-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDougal is a former business partner of the Clintons in the
Whitewater real estate venture in Arkansas. She has already served
18 months in jail after a federal judge in Little Rock found her in
civil contempt for refusing to answer a grand jury's questions
about her dealings with the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, there will likely be two trials involving a
former Clinton Justice Department official, Webster Hubbell. In one
case, Hubbell is charged with fraud connected to a land development
deal in Arkansas. In the other case, which was recently reinstated
by an appeals court, he faces charges of tax evasion and mail
fraud. Hubbell has denied wrongdoing and is trying to quash the
indictment in the tax case.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office must complete reports on his investigations into
the Whitewater land deal. He also must complete two other reports,
one on White House travel office dismissals, in which nepotism was
alleged, and another concerning an improper retrieval of hundreds
of FBI background inquiries of current and former government
employees, most of whom were Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   All three reports must be filed with the three-judge panel that
appointed Starr in August 1994. Associates said that those reports
would not likely be completed for some time.  &QL;

IRISH SCANDAL,   IN LIMELIGHT,   JEOPARDIZES   GOVERNMENT

<P>
   DUBLIN _ An ebullient performance on national television by one
of Ireland's most prominent politicians has embarrassed the
20-month-old coalition government of Prime Minister Bertie Ahern
and raised the prospect that the government might collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Padraig Flynn, Ireland's member of the European
Commission in Brussels, the executive body of the European Union,
is a target of one of two government-established tribunals
investigating accusations that members of Ahern's party and other
politicians took large sums of money from businessmen in return for
official favors.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, joking and lecturing the national television audience,
annoyed people and politicians of all parties by refusing to answer
directly an accusation that he took the equivalent of $75,000 from
a Dublin entrepreneur in 1989, three years before he moved to
Brussels. The public response refocused attention on the tribunals.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare act of public criticism of one of its own political
stars, members of Parliament from Ahern's Fianna Fail party
approved a resolution Wednesday night telling Flynn to explain the
affair immediately. Only Flynn's daughter, Beverly Cooper Flynn,
who succeeded him in the Parliament, defended his failure to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, leaders of the largest opposition party, Fine Gael,
said at their annual convention that the scandal would force a
national election in the next six months, three years earlier than
the constitutional deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Harney, the leader of the small, conservative Progressive
Democrats party and the deputy prime minister, has threatened to
withdraw from the government and bring down the coalition, and
force a new election if more damaging disclosures are made at the
two tribunals.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern has not been accused of taking any money improperly or
illegally himself, and the gifts were not necessarily illegal when
they were made, at least 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition political leaders say that as head of the largest
governing party, Fianna Fail, Ahern, a professional accountant,
should know about the payments and make his knowledge public. Ahern
asserts that he is an honest man and will testify before the
tribunals if summoned.
</P>
<P>
   To stay in power, Ahern needs the four votes held in the
166-member Parliament by members of the Progressive Democrats
party. The Progressive Democrats broke away from Ahern's party 14
years ago to combat what they saw as corruption in Fianna Fail.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn, according to the sworn testimony of one witness, accepted
about $75,000. The witness, Tom Gilmartin, an entrepreneur, said he
passed it to Flynn in 1989 for the Fianna Fail party, but that
Flynn kept it for himself. He said in interviews that Flynn begged
him to say that the money was intended for Flynn, not the party.
Gilmartin was looking for needed approval of a development in
downtown Dublin. Flynn was then the Environment Minister, and his
approval was needed for the project.
</P>
<P>
   The huge complex was never built.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern confirmed that the party never received the money and
called on Flynn to explain.
</P>
<P>
   After ignoring calls for him to comment, Flynn, in an appearance
two weeks ago on a national prime-time entertainment show, spoke of
how little money he earned ($150,000 after taxes) and how hard it
was to maintain his three houses, in Dublin, Brussels and
Castelbar, Ireland, on that kind of money.
</P>
<P>
   He brushed aside the question of the $75,000, saying only that
he had never taken money in return for favors. Critics in all
parties were quick to note that this begged the question of whether
he received and kept the money. He has since refused to elaborate,
saying only that he will cooperate with the investigating tribunal
if requested.
</P>
<P>
   The television performance stimulated widespread anger among
ordinary people and led directly to calls for Ahern to resign and
call a new parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmartin, who lives in England, said his anger at Flynn's
televised comments led him to disclose, two weeks ago, that he had
discussed the payment to Flynn in a meeting in 1989 with Ahern.
</P>
<P>
   This put Ahern at the center of the scandal. The prime minister
said at first that he had only a vague recollection of one meeting
with Gilmartin. Within 24 hours he changed his account, saying
there had been several meetings, but that he had never discussed
the gift money and that his party had never received it. He noted
that he has no power to remove Flynn. He said he thought Flynn
should say what he knows about the $75,000 gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an honest person, a credible person,'' the prime minister
said.

BIG CENSUS ISSUE: USING SAMPLING IN REDISTRICTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (lb) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The two communities could hardly be more
different.
</P>
<P>
   One, in South Philadelphia just east of the Schuylkill River, is
largely black and poor, with people clustered in low-slung row
houses amid abandoned cars and trash-strewn lots.
</P>
<P>
   The other, Cheltenham Township, north of the city, is affluent
and racially integrated. Parked on the winding streets in front of
large fieldstone houses are Volvos and sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the method used in the next census count of the low-income
area south of the city's gleaming skyscrapers may determine which
district Cheltenham is in when new congressional maps are drawn in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   And statistical sampling may be the key.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the bureau could not
use sampling to help produce an official population figure that
will be used to determine the number of House seats each state will
be allocated.
</P>
<P>
   But the High Court did not explicitly rule on whether sampling
was permitted to establish precisely where inside a state people
live. Such information is used to draw boundaries for congressional
and state legislative districts.
</P>
<P>
   Though combatants often toss around terms like ``accuracy'' and
``fairness,'' the heart of the political battle over the 2000
census is whether sampling will be used in redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans and Democrats, political strategists and House
members, that far outweighs any questions on use of population
counts for distributing federal money or for determining the number
of House seats allocated to each state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redistricting is the central issue,'' said Clark Bensen, a
Republican demographer who advises the Republican National
Committee on the issue. ``For most state legislators and House
members, the money is not the key issue that they care about.
Redistricting is what gets them excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Redistricting is the redrawing of every election district in
every state, for offices from city council to the House of
Representatives. The process is the masonry of American politics,
laying the foundation _ whether they have a politically safe
district or a competitive one _ upon which politicians base
virtually all their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Redistricting is carried out by state legislatures and
influenced by local and state politics. It is also affected by the
federal Voting Rights Act, which says the political power of
minorities cannot be seriously diluted in the process, and by the
``one-man, one-vote'' Supreme Court decisions requiring that all
congressional districts contain roughly the same number of people.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the next round of congressional redistricting will
not be felt until the 2002 elections. But with Republicans holding
a wafer-thin majority in the House, both parties are striving
mightily to gain whatever partisan advantage they can from the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that it's so close, I think people are seeing that any
little thing might have the potential of swinging control,'' said
Kimball Brace, president of Election Data Services, a political
demographics company. ``So now you're introducing this unknown
factor called sampling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau would like to use sampling to adjust the next
head count and avoid the errors of the last census. In the 1990
count, more than 8 million people were missed, many of them
minorities living in urban congressional districts that generally
vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau also estimated that 4 million people were counted
twice _ most of them affluent whites living in suburbs that tend to
vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Using sampling to correct those errors could have enormous
consequences on redistricting. ``Where you put these people,
whether by addition or subtraction, makes all the difference in the
world,'' said a Republican congressional aide who insisted on
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia is an example of the implications of sampling for
redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   The city has lost population since 1990, and will probably lose
one of its congressional seats after the next census.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent the 2nd Congressional District, which is about 62
percent black, from being broken up and its inhabitants scattered
into adjoining districts _ which may be a violation of the Voting
Rights Act _ local and state politicians are considering extending
its northern boundary across the city line into suburbs like
Cheltenham and Lower Merion.
</P>
<P>
   Such a change would not politically harm Rep. Chaka Fattah, the
district's Democratic incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have a slight majority in Cheltenham and Lower
Merion, but these communities have voted Democratic in the last few
elections. The two townships are now in the 13th District, and
though Republicans outnumber Democrats by 2-to-1, the 13th is a
true ``swing'' district.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton carried it in 1992 and 1996. Also in 1992,
voters elected Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, a Democrat, to the
House. Two years later, she was defeated by a Republican, Jon Fox,
who was re-elected in 1996 by 84 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Joseph Hoeffel, a Democrat, beat Fox, largely on the
basis of a strong showing in places like Lower Merion and
Cheltenham. Losing those areas in redistricting would severely harm
Democratic prospects in the 13th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Hoeffel carried Lower Merion Township by about 5,000
votes, and Cheltenham by about 6,000 votes,'' said Marcel Groen,
chairman of the Montgomery County Democratic Party. ``He won the
election by 9,000 votes. Any questions?''
</P>
<P>
   But sampling might influence how much of Lower Merion and
Cheltenham are moved to the 2nd District. The 1990 census failed to
count nearly 15,000 people in the 2nd District, and counted more
than 4,300 in the 13th District twice, according to an analysis by
Democratic redistricting experts who used estimates from the Census
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those missed tend to be renters, the poor, children, transient
people and those with low levels of education _ people who tend not
to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But whether they vote is irrelevant, redistricting experts say.
Every person added to Fattah's Democratic district through an
adjustment based on sampling reduces the need to move a person from
Lower Merion or Cheltenham Townships into the 2nd District. Without
sampling, those voters can be left in the 13th District, where they
improve Democratic prospects and harm Republican chances.
</P>
<P>
   Similar calculations are being made for congressional districts
all across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Republicans and Democrats fight over the use of sampling
for redistricting, experts in congressional map-making acknowledge
that they do not know the extent, if any, of sampling's effect on
the process. Other factors will influence redistricting as much as,
if not more than, sampling _ the makeup of state legislatures,
which party controls the governorships or whether the redistricting
plan faces a court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Still, neither side is willing to ignore any impact sampling may
have, however small.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you do know is that if there is any impact that comes
about from sampling for redistricting, it's going to be bad if
you're a Republican,'' Bensen said. ``So as a Republican you don't
want it to take place, and as a Democrat you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, redistricting experts agree that to best understand the
debate over the next census, an issue replete with figures, the
best number to keep in mind is not the size of the undercount or
overcount, or the error rate in counting black or Hispanic people.
</P>
<P>
   The number to keep in mind is six. That is the size of the
Republicans' majority in the House.

   RUSSIA-VLADIVOSTOK (Vladivostok, Russia) _ These days, this
rough-and-tumble port city is the daffiest place in Russia. The
former mayor claims to have extrasensory powers. Local elections
have been invalidated 15 times. The mental hospital even released
some of its patients after squabbling officials allowed its budget

mysterious $1 million prize for his work as one of the world's
great leaders seemed par for the course. Michael R. Gordon. With

SPORTS COLUMN: AMERICANS WILL GET TO SEE WHAT THEY MISSED IN '96 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If a wonderful sports event takes place but
nobody sees it on television, did it really happen? As a matter of
fact, yes, sometimes a game has validity even if it is shunned by
the big tube.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most glorious parts of the 1996 Summer Games was the
American women's gold medal in soccer before huge crowds in
collegiate Athens, Ga., far from the grubbiness of downtown
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, NBC was locked into its format of scripted
documentaries and jaded male basketball players, so the nation
hardly got to see Hamm and Akers and Overbeck doing what they do so
well.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, U.S. soccer officials raged at the injustice of
being ignored, but the tree that fell in the forest was heard,
ultimately. As a result, women will be seen playing soccer this
summer at the Women's World Cup, in front of large audiences, live
and on television.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter that women will be playing the third of their
quadrennial World Cups at a time of year when basketball stages its
finals and baseball is in full gear? Maybe it will matter. Soccer
is already played by a huge swath of young American women, and some
of us who have seen compelling women's matches between the United
States and Norway or China think it could just be the ultimate team
sport for female athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Until that epic Olympic soccer tournament in 1996, the plans
were to limit the 1999 Women's World Cup to 16 teams, have them
play in modest stadiums in the Northeast, and allow teams and fans
to shuttle from game to game, on limited budgets. But Alan
Rothenberg, then the top U.S. official, huddled with Joseph (Sepp)
Blatter, who would soon take over FIFA, the world soccer body, and
they decided to think big and go national.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a crowd of 62,000 for the semifinals and over 70,000
for the finals, and our sense was that it was not just spillover
from Atlanta,'' said Marla Messing, the president of this 1999
Women's World Cup. ``We wanted to do justice to the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of staging a regional event, they expanded to a
three-week jamboree in major stadiums in or near New York, Boston,
Washington, Chicago and the Bay Area, and culminating in the Rose
Bowl near Los Angeles, June 19-July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night at 8 p.m. Eastern time, there will be a preview at
Spartan Stadium in nearby San Jose, with the Americans taking on a
world all-star team. At halftime, the draw for the World Cup will
be held, all of it televised on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is not expected to be huge Sunday night, but Messing
says the crowds will come out this summer, and she should know. She
was responsible for filling the stadiums for the men's World Cup in
1994, and she remembered how pleased she was ``when we blew right
through our allotment'' a year ahead and had to scrounge for more
tickets to sell.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is not known as a soccer nation, but American
promoters do know how to sell a big event. The World Cup of 1994
sold 3.5 million tickets for 52 games, an average of 68,604 per
game, and Messing is not expecting to come close. However, she has
already sold 215,000 of the estimated 700,000 seats available in
the stadiums, some of which will be downsized, restricted only to
lower decks.
</P>
<P>
   Messing and staff have worked closely with girls' leagues
offering ticket packages and urging them to tailor their schedules
around the Cup. Messing has lined up corporate sponsorship and
television coverage and, while some dedicated promoters of men's
soccer chafe at perceived do-the-right-thing sentiment, for women's
soccer, Messing insists, she has not had to play a gender card _
``not once.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that ABC and ESPN will be televising all 32
games _ not just some heart-warming feature about Joy Fawcett's
being a mother of two, but Fawcett's booting a solid 20-yard pass
to a teammate; not just the stirring tale of Michelle Akers' battle
with Epstein-Barre syndrome, a neurological disorder, but Akers'
maneuvering herself into the atmosphere to head the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of these players will tell you they saw an image of
some other athlete when she was growing up,'' said Donna de Varona,
the Olympic swimming gold medalist and chairman of this Women's
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it was the ice hockey team in 1980,'' said Brandi
Chastain, referring to the Miracle on Ice by the United States team
at Lake Placid. ``I was impressed by the effort they gave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the 1986 World Cup in Mexico,'' said Julie Foudy.
``I loved the enthusiasm and the passion in all the stadiums. It
was not just one country. It was the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the Olympics on television, gymnastics and soccer,''
Fawcett said. ``They made me want to be better, and now I want to
do that for young girls, to inspire them.''
</P>
<P>
   These athletes were shaped by established sports, male sports.
Now they will get a chance to play a World Cup in their own country
_ this time with the television cameras turned on. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: MORALISM OVERLOAD IN SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the righteous among us, the week spun into glorious
overload; you could sprain both wrists wagging I-told-you-so
fingers after Latrell Sprewell, the choking guard, was injured and
lost for a month; Eugene Robinson, the weak unsafety, announced he
would return his award for high moral character; Mike Tyson, the
people bender, went back to jail; Juan Samaranch and his merry band
were exposed as Olympian shakedown artists, and Dennis Lundy, the
Northwestern scholar-fixer, admitted to fumbling on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But some history might temper the moralism. This season will
bring us the 80th anniversary of the Black Sox Scandal. Once
they've tampered with the World Series, can we crank up honest
outrage over anything else?
</P>
<P>
   Is that why there were no antisports demonstrations last week?
Were people numbed by the sheer critical mass of unsporting
conduct? Perhaps we are no longer looking for moral renewal in the
won-lost column, finding it instead in religion and politics.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early in the American sports century, the first major retailer
in the athletic mall, baseball, helped save its box office by
spinning an image of Shoeless Joe Jackson as a bucolic buffoon
caught in an urban web; this barefoot boy was no ungrateful farmer
striking back at greedy landowners. No, he was a sweet dummy
manipulated by teammates from the city and an evil genius, the
gambler Arnold Rothstein.
</P>
<P>
   At century's end, the major retailer, basketball, created the
athlete-model, Air Jordan, in a stunning display of marketing
synergy. Basketball sold shoes sold basketball sold shoes, as well
as other products. Because Michael's image was so carefully limited
to superior performance as a result of a passionate work ethic,
corporations were comfortable with him. The international audience,
which also responds well to action movies where language and
complex characterization don't intrude, loved Michael.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael is over now and Shoeless Joe will probably be
debunked as the Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs of sport, selling us
out to the enemy. It's time to get happy with what we've got. I was
disappointed that Sprewell was hurt just when I was appreciating
his game. Sprewell and Allen Iverson are the immediate future of
the National Basketball Association, as well as its most exciting
performers. Forgive their transgressions _ if indeed they got fair
shakes in the first place. If Sprewell had really done something
wrong, he would have been arrested for felonious assault, right?
Unless, of course, the NBA didn't want to risk exposing itself in
open court.
</P>
<P>
   There was guilty glee and empathy among male sportswriters when
they learned that Robinson had headed to vice-town after dropping
off his family the night before the Super Bowl. The Atlanta
Falcons' safety is a God Squadder, one of the growing number of
contemporary athletes who seem to be using higher powers as
performance-enhancing drugs. That very day he had received his
award from Athletes in Action. Shouldn't he have been above the
shabby rituals of traveling men playing by out-of-town rules? He
was a handsome, rich star, an All-Pro. Where were the swimsuit
models waiting to frolic in his suite?
</P>
<P>
   Was this just another Willie Loman story, filled with fear and
bravado? Just another little man caught in a plantation system?
Just another posturing football player who can't stand up and
organize against the National Football League owners' systemic
discrimination against black coaches?
</P>
<P>
   Fear and bravado, Mike Tyson was always champion of that
division. It's easy to understand the desire to punch out two guys
whose car just rear-ended yours. Jail? You should receive a high
moral character award. But Mike is marked for elimination; we used
his rage to entertain us and now he's more trouble than he's worth.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No sympathy for those Olympic devils. These are the same
hustlers who sue little Greek-American diners for using the sacred
name. (Now, the sponsors are busy scraping the five rings off their
corporate logos.)
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics have been frantically selling out since they
restarted as a sexist, classist, racist club in 1896. Forty years
later, under Samaranch's role model, Avery Brundage, the Olympics
lent its prestige to Adolf Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   The 1936 Berlin Games were a public-relations spectacular for
Nazism. Every city since has wanted the same cosmetic make over.
It's only too bad that some small-time chiselers from poorer
countries will take the fall on this.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Lundy's legal turnover. He pleaded guilty to perjury,
admitting he lied about fumbling at the goal line in 1994 to
protect the spread on a bet he had made on his own team. That
admission nullified Northwestern University's bet that the millions
it spent on a winning football team would pay off in national happy
news, increased enrollment and alumni donations.
</P>
<P>
   Results plus: Get-well cards to Sprewell, no more Robinson
jokes, therapy for Tyson, re-education camp for Lundy; dump the
Olympics and sell the franchise to Ted Turner's Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   Historical redress: Dump Jordan and feature Shoeless Joe in a
Nike spot. &QL;

AIMING FOR SALES, CRITICS SAY, INDUSTRY MADE MORE POWERFUL
PISTOLS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Ill, Fla, Ga., Conn., Mass, Pa., Calif. Ind.)  By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As cities prepare to sue the gun industry for not taking steps
to keep their products out of criminals' hands, critics of the
industry are building an argument that gun makers began making more
powerful handguns to make up for stagnant sales and that these guns
quickly became popular among criminals.
</P>
<P>
   While the marketing innovation increased the gun makers'
profits, the critics contend, it also helped account for the rise
in homicides in the 1980s and the greater seriousness of gunshot
wounds in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The latest and most detailed addition to the argument is made by
Tom Diaz, a former congressional expert on handgun control, in his
book, ``Making A Killing: The Business of Guns In America,''
published last month by the New Press. Over the last decade, gun
makers have found that what would sell best are higher-caliber,
more rapid-fire pistols that can be easily concealed, Diaz writes,
and that by designing such pistols they have gotten gun lovers
addicted to more powerful weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun industry has deliberately enhanced its profits by
increasing the lethality _ the killing power _ of its products,''
writes Diaz, now a senior policy analyst at the Violence Policy
Center in Washington, a research and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   This argument may become part of the case against gun makers, as
a growing number of cities contend in lawsuits that the
manufacturers concentrated on making their handguns more deadly
rather than incorporating new safety devices. Some of the cities
say the gun makers have data showing that their products were being
sold in ways that increased their chances of ending up in the hands
of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   An example of this kind of accusation was made in a lawsuit
brought in Brooklyn on behalf of victims in seven shootings against
25 gun manufacturers. In a jury verdict returned on Thursday in
U.S. District Court, 15 of the arms makers were found negligent and
nine were held liable for damages. The gun manufacturers were
accused in the suit of oversupplying stores in Southern states that
have lax gun laws, knowing that some of the guns would be bought by
people in New York City who would resell them to criminals and
juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   Five cities have sued the gun makers: New Orleans, Chicago,
Miami, Atlanta and Bridgeport, Conn. Cities planning to file such
suits soon include Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles
and Gary, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz has built on the work of Dr. Garren Wintemute, an emergency
room physician and director of the Violence Prevention Research
Program at the University of California at Davis, who reported that
the new generation of semiautomatic handguns introduced in the
1980s led to an increase in the number of wounds in gunshot victims
and made people shot by handguns more likely to die.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Feldman, the executive director of the American Shooting
Sports Council, a trade association, said that Diaz was drawing a
faulty conclusion from a normal business practice. ``Just like the
fashion industry, the firearms industry likes to encourage new
products to get people to buy its products,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   The gun manufacturers should not have to worry that their guns
are becoming more deadly or be more likely to cause worse wounds,
Feldman said. ``I don't think that enters into our calculations,''
he said. ``If the gun has more stopping power, it is a more
effective weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Feldman said, ``We design weapons, not for the bad
guys, but for the good guys.'' If criminals happen to get their
hands on a gun, it is not the manufacturer's fault, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could design a gun for the bad guy, they would all shoot
backward,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in pistols that are more deadly began with a shift
in design from revolvers, which generally hold six rounds, to
faster-firing semiautomatic pistols with larger magazines capable
of holding 10 or more rounds of ammunition, Diaz argues. The next
step was the introduction of higher-caliber ammunition, moving from
the older and smaller .22- or .38-caliber pistols to the larger
9-millimeter or .40-caliber handguns.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the gun industry introduced yet another change,
producing very small, lightweight pistols known as ``pocket
rockets,'' which are easily concealed, but have more firepower than
older handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sanetti, a lawyer for Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co., the largest
manufacturer of all types of guns, said that his company's
largest-selling handgun continued to be revolvers and that it did
not manufacture the new small-size handgun.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Diaz says that the gun industry was led to its
strategy of innovation because demand for its traditional products
_ rifles, shotguns and revolvers _ had slowed as the number of
Americans who hunt began to decline and the end of the military
draft reduced familiarity with guns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, there were 14 million hunters in America, down from
20.6 million in 1975, according to the United States Fish and
Wildlife Service. Surveys by the agency have shown that hunters
tend to be white males in rural areas, a shrinking proportion of
the population. From 1989 to 1996, the overall sales of rifles,
shotguns and handguns declined to 3.8 million from 4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   While there was no ``smoking gun'' memorandum that proved gun
manufacturers intended to increase sales by making their handguns
more deadly, Diaz says, those statistics were behind the gun
makers' strategy of innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry might have chosen to develop safer firearms,''
Diaz contends in the book, like guns with child-resistant safety
locks, ``but gun-industry executives deliberately chose to take
exactly the opposite direction.'' The new handguns have proved
``more suitable for use in crime,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, new research has found that more than 90
percent of the increase in homicides from 1985 to 1993 involved
crimes with handguns, said James Alan Fox, dean of the college of
criminal justice at Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   In those same years, Diaz said, the number of pistols made by
United States gun manufacturers increased by 92 percent and deaths
by handguns jumped 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wintemute said that although there were no national figures
available, statistics from hospitals in Chicago, Washington and
Philadelphia in the 1980s showed a sharp rise in the number of
patients admitted for the treatment of gunshot wounds who had more
than one bullet wound. In addition, from 1986 to 1992, the
proportion of handgun homicides in those cities involving
semiautomatic pistols rather than revolvers jumped to nearly 50
percent from about 10 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As another indication of the trend, Wintemute said, although
there has been an overall decrease in shootings since 1993, ``there
has been an increase in the percentage of people who get shot who
die as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   As criminals were able to purchase the new class of
semiautomatic pistols with larger magazines, police forces also
began switching from revolvers to pistols for protection, Diaz
said, and then the gun makers introduced higher-caliber bullets,
which he says led criminals and the police to go to more potent
ammunition.

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The aftershocks of impeachment are already being
felt by politicians who fear the nation is entering an era in which
their private lives will draw more intense scrutiny and
embarrassing disclosures than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of candidates and strategists at the local, state and
national levels express concern that the political climate wrought
by the White House scandal has set the tone for a sullied discourse
in the elections of 2000. Already, there are examples of how
information about politicians' personal lives, the kind once deemed
private, threatens to be injected into campaigns:
</P>
<P>
   _ Three Republican presidential contenders _ former Vice
President Dan Quayle, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas _ have felt obliged to declare
publicly that they have been faithful to their wives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Influential conservatives have vowed to raise, and keep alive,
questions about candidates' private lives. William J. Bennett, the
conservative author and former education secretary, is traveling
the nation, warning Republican presidential prospects, ``If
adultery is part of your baggage, forget it.'' And the Rev. Louis
P. Sheldon, whose Traditional Values Coalition claims a membership
of 40,000 evangelical churches, said he would insist that
presidential candidates answer his questions about their sexual
pasts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Several politicians said what they viewed as an intensified
intrusion into their private lives had led them to think twice
about running in the first place. Bush, for one, said worries about
what might be dredged up about his past, accurately or not, and the
repercussions for his family weighed heavily as he pondered whether
to seek the Republican nomination. Steve Forbes, the millionaire
publisher who sought the presidency in 1996 and will again in 2000,
said: ``There's going to be a lot of muck thrown at those who run.
The president has defined the standard downward.''
</P>
<P>
   _ It has become standard fare for reporters, even from some
major news organizations, to unapologetically quiz candidates about
their sexual histories and possible use of drugs. In a recent
interview, Bernard Shaw of CNN told Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, ``You had an
affair during your first marriage,'' and then asked: ``Should a
politician's private acts be part of public discourse?'' (McCain's
response: ``Let me say that I am responsible for the breakup of my
first marriage. I will not discuss or talk about that any more than
that.'')
</P>
<P>
   _ Candidates are already plotting how to contend with aggressive
inquiries into their private lives. An outside adviser to Bush said
he suggested that the governor hire an opposition research team to
ferret out any negative information about him that opponents could
find. But Bush, in an interview, said such a move was unnecessary
because he had already hired such a researcher during his two runs
for governor. ``We looked into the record that people would look
into,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the local level, politicians are undeterred about making an
issue of elected officials' private lives. In Utah, the state
attorney general, a Democrat, recently sent affidavits to the
state's five republican members of Congress, asking them to attest
under oath that they had been faithful to their spouses. (The
lawmakers refused to sign the pledge but publicly declared their
marital fidelity.)
</P>
<P>
   In interviews across the country, politicians, strategists and
academics denounced what they described as excessive attention to
candidates' personal baggage, and said it would discourage
prospective candidates from running for office, further alienate
the public from politics and make it even more difficult for
candidates to discuss substantive issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political culture has changed and so has the news
culture,'' said Rep. David R. Obey, D-Wis. ``What is now dominating
is winning at all costs. There are almost no issues that are off
limits. There seems to be no real constraints on people's
willingness to hurt somebody else. That goes for politicians and
the press alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney, a former defense secretary and House member from
Wyoming who decided not to seek the Republican presidential
nomination four years ago, citing the toll it would take on his
family, said campaigning now seemed even less appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a total loss of privacy that goes with being a
candidate for public office these days,'' Cheney said. ``It's hard
to watch what's happened with Clinton and not think it's gotten
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Several politicians who are seeking the White House said they
were wrestling with how to react to questions about their own
private behavior and that of their opponents. Politicians said they
were not sure whether, in the post-Lewinsky era, voters would
demand of their candidates a more upstanding private life than
Clinton's _ or whether voters would be so weary of the whole
scandal culture that they would forgive politicians'
transgressions, as they seem to have with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Some strategists warn, in fact, that candidates who declare
their personal ``purity'' could turn off voters by appearing too
moralistic.
</P>
<P>
   In November's elections, Gary Mueller, a Democrat who challenged
Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill. , signed an ``affidavit of integrity'' in
which he swore he had never had an extramarital affair, abused his
wife, had any homosexual encounters, experimented with illegal
drugs or been charged with a felony.
</P>
<P>
   But Mueller, who lost the election, was attacked from several
quarters, including an editorial in The Chicago Sun-Times that
described him as a ``sanctimonious political opportunist trying to
impose a sexual code of conduct on politics.''

 WASHINGTON: on politics.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   McCain's calculation, his advisers said, is that details of his
personal life have already been public and that in this
post-impeachment era voters will not care. His strategy, as well as
that of Bush, has been to refuse to answer questions about his
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the standards will be because I'm so close
to it,'' McCain said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John R. Kasich, R-Ohio, who is running for president, said
he, too, struggled over what should be fair game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed emotions about what should be asked and what
shouldn't,'' Kasich said. ``But I don't think my view of whether
it's in bounds or out of bounds matters. When the press asks the
question, you have to figure out a comfortable answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians contend that Republicans, particularly
conservatives who are important in presidential primaries, are far
more concerned about candidates' private behavior than Democrats
are.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dal Col, Forbes' top strategist, argued that Forbes'
reputation as personally upright would be a boon to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican primary voter will be very concerned that we do
not nominate a candidate who in any way, shape or form mirrors Bill
Clinton,'' Dal Col said. ``Therefore, the president's behavior and
past history will be used as a barometer to measure our candidates,
where in the Democratic primary they tend to accept a wide range of
personal histories.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their grousing about the intrusion into their own
private lives, many Republicans said they would make ethics a
central issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to talk a lot about restoring integrity,'' McCain
said. But he emphasized that he would not discuss Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky or the subsequent scandal but
would focus on other accusations against the president on matters
like campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, who has endured two national campaigns and is being
scrutinized anew as a contender for the White House in 2000, said:
``I hope there's a timeout, that everybody takes a pause here. Do
we really want to ask or answer all these irrelevant questions
about what someone may or may not have done 20 or 30 years ago?
Quite frankly, the American people don't care. And quite frankly,
it's not that important. What's important is who you are today,
what you're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his insistence that private conduct is unimportant,
Quayle, in response to a question on national television, declared
that he had been faithful to his wife. ``I don't think the question
should be asked,'' he said, ``but when it gets raised, you deal
with it.''
</P>

<P>
   Republicans and Democrats alike said a turning point that
underscored a new, ugly political climate came on a Saturday in
December shortly before the House voted to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., stunned the chamber when he
announced he would quit the House rather than succeed Speaker Newt
Gingrich. He had been prompted by Larry Flynt, the publisher of
Hustler, to confess that he had engaged in several adulterous
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This notion about what's going on with Larry Flynt and others
and this business about trying to destroy candidates over what
might have gone on in their past has dampened a lot of people's
enthusiasm for the process and for entering the process,'' Bush
said in an interview. ``I've been through this process before. I'm
used to it to a certain extent. But my worry is people make
mistakes in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Those mistakes, he said, can be blown out of proportion and make
it difficult for politicians to focus on issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said reporters' inquiries had
grown so excessive that ``I've been asked whether he killed
somebody _ a journalist asked me that from a major Texas
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Sosnik, a senior adviser to Clinton, suggested that
politicians were also at fault for a coarsening of the political
dialogue. ``I can't imagine how anyone in America can watch us in
Washington and not think that the whole system is broken,'' Sosnik
said, ``whether it's how we finance our campaigns, how we conduct
our campaigns, how we govern _ or even on a human level, how we
deal with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Several politicians despaired that the win-at-all-costs politics
and focus on personal lives had grown so offensive that they feared
people would no longer want to enter politics; already, figures
show that younger people are less and less likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I frequently get asked by my students, `Why should we put
ourselves through this?''' said former Rep. Mickey Edwards,
R-Okla., who is now a professor at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School
of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who care about issues. But the political
world just seems very unattractive. More and more of them want
nothing to do with politics or government. They go into consulting
or management or into nonprofits, where they can work for good
causes.''  &QL;

CLINTON PROPOSES FORCE FOR KOSOVO

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton announced Saturday that he would
send nearly 4,000 troops to Kosovo to defend the ``national
interest'' as part of a NATO peacekeeping force, provided the
ethnic Albanians and Serbs who are warring there strike a peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has a national interest in achieving this peace,''
Clinton said. ``If the conflict persists, there likely will be a
tremendous loss of life and a massive refugee crisis in the middle
of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the parties have made little progress during peace talks
in France, despite pressure from NATO to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But in the event of an agreement, the Clinton administration and
its European allies want to have a force ready to move swiftly into
the area, a formerly autonomous enclave in southern Serbia, on the
border with Albania. Ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo are demanding
independence from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Senate found him not guilty on charges of
perjury and obstruction of justice, the president used what is
often a low-key forum for perfunctory policy ruminations _ his
weekly radio address _ to announce a decision that has been in the
works for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement was timed to strengthen the hand of
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who flew on Saturday to
Paris to meet with representatives of the Serbs and Kosovo
Albanians, as well as with European foreign ministers who are
overseeing the peace negotiations under way in Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   But White House aides also expected Clinton's announcement to
draw concentrated news coverage and commentary to compete with
lingering musings over the trial.
</P>
<P>
   In his radio address, Clinton argued that the prospect of U.S.
participation in the NATO force would give ``both sides the
confidence to lay down their arms.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that the NATO mission, which is expected to include
28,000 troops in all, ``be well-defined, with a clear and realistic
strategy to allow us to bring our forces home when their work is
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been consulting with members of Congress
to secure their support for the mission, but it has taken the
position that it does not need formal congressional approval to
send troops. Clinton said Saturday that he would make his ``final
decision'' to send troops ``in close consultation'' with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent Republicans have voiced support for such a
mission, but others have raised concerns, some of which were echoed
by Pentagon officials until late last week. They worried that the
mission could drag on indefinitely, at high cost, and embroil U.S.
soldiers in what amounts to a civil war over ethnic grievances that
have roots dating back to the 14th century.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that he would not send troops unless the
Serbs and Kosovo Albanians agree to the force and demonstrate that
they will implement the peace agreement. That agreement, he said,
``must provide for an immediate cease-fire, rapid withdrawal of
most Serbian security forces, and demilitarization of the
insurgents.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for NATO peacekeepers on the ground in Kosovo to
enforce an armistice, the ethic Albanians are being asked to give
up demands for independence and accept autonomy, officials said. As
the president showed himself once again focused on his job on
Saturday, he also signaled that he is willing to put his robust
political approval ratings to the test on a potentially risky
military mission in a place unfamiliar to most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he had learned from the conflict in Bosnia,
where a bloody conflict raged for years before the United States
brokered a still-fragile peace agreement and dispatched troops to
enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bosnia taught us a lesson,'' the president said. ``In this
volatile region, violence we fail to oppose leads to even greater
violence we will have to oppose later, at greater cost.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that in the case of Kosovo, the violence could spread
to Albania and Macedonia, and reignite the conflict in Bosnia. ``It
could even involve our NATO allies, Greece and Turkey,'' Clinton
said. ``If we wait until casualties mount and war spreads, any
effort to stop it will come at a higher price under more dangerous
conditions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under the current NATO plan, Kosovo would be divided into zones
overseen by a peacekeeping force that would be overwhelmingly
European. In Bosnia, by contrast, the NATO-led force is dominated
by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1989, Kosovo was an autonomous region within the old
communist Yugoslavia, and ethnic rivalries there had been subsumed
for decades under the tough doctrine laid down by communist
Yugoslavia's founder, Josip Broz Tito.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also the cradle of Serbian nationalism, revered by
many Serbs as the site of their most holy Orthodox monuments and a
1389 battle that marked the start of their centuries-long struggle
to preserve that faith during rule by the Ottoman Turks.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic used the cause of Kosovo to whip up
his campaign to carve a Greater Serbia from the collapse of
communist Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's Albanians, who make up about 90 percent of the
province's estimated 2 million people, responded with a campaign of
nonviolent civil disobedience, creating a completely parallel
system of schools and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   As Yugoslavia disintegrated with a war, first in Slovenia and
then in Croatia and Bosnia, Kosovo was viewed by diplomats and
military specialists as the ultimate flashpoint.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, local police and special military units sent by the
Serbian government in Belgrade began a violent campaign to crack
down on the Kosovo Liberation Army, a rebel force that had
abandoned the Kosovo Albanians' previously peaceful tactics and
decided to fight for independence.
</P>
<P>
   A threat last fall of NATO air strikes has muted but not ended
the violence. On Saturday a bomb exploded outside a
government-owned bank in a southern Kosovo town, injuring nine
people, according to The Associated Press. No one immediately
claimed responsibility.

CHEATING ALLEGED ON LAW SCHOOL TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Danny Khatchaturian and Dikran Iskendarian wanted
to be lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Now they need one.
</P>
<P>
   In the first case of its kind, the men from Glendale and La
Canada Flintridge face charges of stealing a Law School Admissions
Test through a clever but bungled scheme. Prosecutors say it
involved forging identification to get the exam questions in Los
Angeles, and then using a pager to transmit the answers to Hawaii
where the test was being administered hours later because of the
time difference.
</P>
<P>
   Clever enough that the two men scored in the 99th percentile on
the test, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   But bungled. The accomplice, identified as Ashot Melikyan of
Glendale, is accused of pulling a switchblade on a test proctor who
chased him down the street when he tried to run off with the exam.
In Hawaii, the test-takers were spotted paying more attention to
their pagers than the examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, this case is about two college students who
decided they wanted to go to law school, and they decided to cheat
to get there,'' Deputy District Attorney Loni Petersen said during
a recent grand jury hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The organization that administers the LSAT said it's the first
time one of its exams has been stolen, while prosecutors in the Los
Angeles County District Attorney's Office say it's a new legal
territory for them as well.
</P>
<P>
   Khatchaturian, Iskendarian and Melikyan were each charged with
conspiracy, robbery and grand theft, which could lead to a
five-year prison term. Melikyan faces the enhancement that he used
a weapon during a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The three men pleaded not guilty last month, and Khatchaturian
and Iskendarian are free on $250,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Khatchaturian, 23, a University of Southern California honors
student, is represented by former California Supreme Court Justice
Armand Arabian, who declined to comment on the case. Melikyan, 23,
could not be reached for comment. Iskendarian, 22, who attended
Woodbury University in Burbank, referred comment to his lawyer,
Christopher Armen, who said his client wasn't involved in any
conspiracy and is confident he will be acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the pressure to succeed on the LSAT is especially
high, because one-day exams sometimes count for more than four
years of letter grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheating on it is not like cheating on your history final in
high school,'' Loyola Law School dean Laurie Levenson said. ``This
means so much more to people. This opens the door to your legal
career.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The men are accused of devising an intricate conspiracy,
finding a way to exploit time-zone differences and satellite
technology to ensure high scores.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the no-nonsense examination administers
still managed to thwart almost every step of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claim that in February 1997, Khatchaturian and
Iskendarian enlisted Melikyan to register for the LSAT at USC with
a fake student ID and sneak out with one of the test booklets.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Melikyan followed the plan successfully until
the tests were handed out and he made so much noise dashing for the
door he alerted proctor Brian Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he chased Melikyan down Exposition Boulevard, and got
his hands on him when Melikyan pulled what looked like a
switchblade and escaped into a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to find out for sure if it was a switchblade or
how good he was at using it, so I let him go,'' Gore testified.
</P>
<P>
   While this was occurring, Khatchaturian and Iskendarian are
accused of waiting in Hawaii, where the test hadn't started because
of the time zone difference. Prosecutors say they planned to take
the test there, while receiving answers on their alpha-numeric
pagers.
</P>
<P>
   LSAT proctors from Hawaii _ who flew to Los Angeles to testify _
said that they confronted both test takers after noticing what they
characterized as bizarre behavior, including repeated tinkering
with the pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting that Khatchaturian and Iskendarian had received the
answers from someone else, the Law School Admissions Council
investigated and the case eventually went to the grand jury. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Judging by his accolades as a student at USC, Khatchaturian
seemed on his way to a prosperous legal career.
</P>
<P>
   According to the school yearbook, the political science major
was president of the Armenian Student Association and member of a
pre-law honor society called the Blackstonians.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 19,000 or so who took the LSAT that day worldwide,
only 40 scored higher than Khatchaturian, while 129 scored higher
than Iskendarian, exam officials testified.
</P>
<P>
   At the grand jury hearing, prosecutors interviewed a Rand Corp.
statistician, Stephen Klein, who said the scores were almost surely
fraudulently obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said in contrast to the main score, the pair were less
than mediocre in a ``variable'' section of the exam, where Hawaii
questions differed from other states _ making it impossible to
cheat with a California test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Khatchaturian had a score that was equivalent to a chance
score,'' Klein said of the variable section. ``If you had just
flipped a coin, you would have gotten a score the same as his
score.''
</P>
<P>
   While Khatchaturian never took the LSAT again, Iskendarian tried
again in December 1997 and scored in the 40th percentile _ a drop
that Klein said was a statistical impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds of that occurring by chance are about 3 in 10
billion,'' Klein said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Deputy District Attorney Petersen made it clear that
Khatchaturian, Iskendarian and Melikyan are being prosecuted for
the alleged conspiracy and theft of the test _ not the actual
cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Law School Admissions Council officials said they administer
four exams each year, each costing more than $600,000 to produce,
making even a single test ``intellectual property'' that is almost
irreplaceable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to talk about the pennies it costs for the pieces
of paper, that's one thing,'' Petersen said. ``Creating this test
is an ongoing process that takes years and years.''
</P>
<P>
   After LSAC officials first suspected that cheating had occurred
on the February 1997 test, they checked exams in Japan and China to
see if other students had produced similar ``answer patterns,'' but
found none.
</P>
<P>
   While LSAC officials said their security has never been breached
before, there is a record of arrests for time zone scams on other
tests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, an Arcadia man was accused of running a New York-to-Los
Angeles cheating scheme that supplied correct answers to more than
100 men and women taking the Graduate Record Examination.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, administers of the Scholastic Aptitude Test estimated
that cheaters represent approximately 450 of the 1.8million
students who take the college entrance exam each year.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House managers working to convict President
Clinton fashioned their argument as a straightforward legal
proposition: They would prove he committed specific crimes and the
Senate would have to respond by evicting him from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, their legal case was far from airtight and was
no match for the undeniable political reality that the nation and
the Senate did not want to overturn an election. The public even
believed, and by significant majorities, according to polls, that
Clinton committed many of the very acts with which he was charged
by the managers.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing that he committed two crimes, perjury and obstruction
of justice, the managers found themselves stymied by
inconsistencies in testimony and ambiguous facts, as well as
confounded by White House lawyers who picked apart the elements of
the alleged crimes with care and precision.
</P>
<P>
   But for many senators, the measuring of Clinton's actions
against strict reading of the criminal code was almost beside the
point. Many of those who voted to acquit Clinton said flatly that
they believed he had committed some form of perjury and obstruction
of justice.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who voted against both
articles of impeachment, said that ``the case presented by the
House managers proves to my satisfaction that the president did, in
fact, obstruct justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Collins said she believed the affidavit that Monica Lewinsky
filed in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct case and the efforts to
find Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York were all intended to conceal an
intimate sexual relationship with Clinton. Similarly, Ms. Collins
said she was convinced that Clinton's conversation with his
secretary, Betty Currie, in which he appeared to feed her innocent
explanations for his friendship with Ms. Lewinsky, was part of the
president's cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that the frantic efforts to find
Ms. Lewinsky a job, the retrieval and concealment of gifts under
the bed of the president's secretary, and, most egregious, the
president's blatant coaching of Betty Currie _ not once, but twice
_ were clear attempts to tamper with witnesses and obstruct
justice,'' Ms. Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   But like many others, mostly Democrats, Ms. Collins said she
believed that the impeachment trial required a different approach
than an ordinary criminal trial. Even if he committed the offenses,
they said, it was not the kind of high crime and misdemeanor
required by the Constitution for removal.
</P>
<P>
   The managers fashioned the perjury article out of what some
might view as the most trivial issues in the impeachment drama.
</P>
<P>
   For example, they charged that Clinton should be convicted and
removed from office for such allegedly false statements as
asserting he was alone with Ms. Lewinsky on a limited number of
occasions when the actual number was 20. They also charged he
committed perjury when he read a statement to the grand jury saying
that ``what began as an innocent friendship'' evolved into a
regrettable intimate relationship. They say the relationship
actually began with flirting and Ms. Lewinsky's flaunting her
underwear.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear in the trial that the perjury charge was the
weaker of the two, and the managers spent most of their energy
prosecuting the second impeachment article, the one that charged a
widespread scheme to obstruct justice. But that effort was also
handicapped in legal terms by conflicting sworn accounts and an
inability to construct a coherent story in which they could prove
the president's role and motivations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, several of the ``seven pillars'' of obstruction, as
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chief manager, called them, involved
differing sworn testimony or interpretations of complicated events
like the effort to find Ms. Lewinsky a job.
</P>
<P>
   One of the issues was whether Clinton orchestrated the retrieval
of gifts he had given Ms. Lewinsky. Mrs. Currie said Ms. Lewinsky
had called her to initiate the retrieval. Ms. Lewinsky testified
that Mrs. Currie had called her and the House managers asserted
that meant the president had been behind the effort. The House
managers repeatedly portrayed Clinton as the master ``puppeteer''
behind many events.
</P>
<P>
   But as in the case of the gifts, they could never solidly
demonstrate his involvement. In addition, Mrs. Currie directly
contradicted Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Bucy, a criminal law professor at the University of
Alabama, said the managers' case may have been weakest in their
inability to show that Clinton intended to commit perjury or
obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if one resolved the factual discrepancies against the
president _ he was trying to get the gifts back, and he was trying
to coach her _ the weak part of the case is proving the intent to
violate the law,'' said Ms. Bucy, a former federal prosecutor.
``The reason is that he probably had multiple plausible intents,
like to hide this from his wife and daughter and everyone else.''

DEBATE CONTINUES AMONG OBSERVERS OF THE AMERICAN SCENE

   The Lewinsky scandal has been the talk of the nation for more
than a year. And at times it has seemed that just about every
American had an opinion, a strong opinion, on the matter. But that
said, it also seemed at times that just about every American wanted
the whole mess to go away.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's votes Friday that found the president not guilty of
perjury or obstruction of justice brought the long debate to an
official close. But, of course, the actions in the Senate chamber
did not end the debate.
</P>
<P>
   It resumed immediately in the nation's coffee shops, workplaces,
campuses, bars and wherever kibitzers were gathered. That is clear
in the widely divergent opinions voiced by some prominent Americans
from coast to coast. As one of them, William Kristol, editor of The
Weekly Standard, a leading conservative magazine, puts it:
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't over, not by a long shot.''
</P>
<P>
   JULIAN BOND
</P>
<P>
   Chairman of the board of the NAACP
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the process was out of control from the start. It was
ideologically driven by a rabid band of Clinton-haters, and it has
seriously cheapened the political dialogue. That is because the
Republican Party is dominated by the most retrograde forces in
American public life, and its congressional representatives live in
mortal fear of offending them. Collectively and singly, the House
managers have abysmal civil rights records and did not recognize
civil rights when asked to vote for them. Their attempts to cloak
themselves as civil rights defenders and champions turned the
Senate chamber into a hall of hypocrisy. As for the president, he
is seriously weakened, much of it by his own doing, but much of it
by these incessant attempts to overturn the last two elections.''

   ``Clinton was my all-time favorite president. I thought he was
going to be the best president we ever had. I liked his character.
I liked his message. I voted for him twice. I danced at his last
inauguration. And now I think I was wrong. I think this has been
one of the most shameful episodes in presidential history. And I
think he's going to make Warren G. Harding look like a giant. . . .
I've been a white liberal Southern Democrat. There aren't many of
us. We could have had our conventions in kayaks. The best of all of
us was B.C. But now, I have to be on the side of people who don't
care about perjury? Who don't care about obstruction of justice?
Who make excuses? . . .

   I would have voted to throw him out. He would have been back
shopping for a condominium in Little Rock.''

<P>
   ``To me, the most striking aspect of this entire event is that
in the end there are no winners. Everyone has lost. The president
was publicly humiliated. His enemies have been repudiated. And the
divide separating the American people from those who represent them
in Washington has widened into a chasm. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Watergate there was at least the sense that the
system had been tested and that it worked. And there was also
significant evidence of dignified political leadership during the
hearings. In this case no strong political leaders have emerged
from the fray. It is very sad for all of us.''

   ``What do I know? If I knew anything about politics, I'd be
talking in another capacity. I haven't taken this whole business
seriously because I never thought what happened was impeachable. If
Iran-Contra wasn't impeachable, this doesn't come close. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I think it has added to the sense folks have that the Republican
Party doesn't stand for anything. When they finally come up with a
proposal, it is a tax cut for the rich. With enemies like that,
Clinton doesn't need friends. I can't but believe this won't have
an impact on the Republicans in 2000. Clinton, for all his
weaknesses, has continued to focus on the needs of the country. He
and the Democrats are increasingly seen as the party that cares
about what people care about. The other side has gotten itself
totally caught up in impeachment.''

   ``Justice was not done. And the impeachment clause is very dead,
at least when a popular president is involved. There will be no
psychological impact on the president, except anger on his part,
because the man has no shame, thinks that opposition is never
legitimate. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The presidency has been cheapened. The Congress is now more
polarized than ever, the Democratic Party further to the left. And
I don't expect much different when an important issue comes up like
this again.
</P>
<P>
   It has become completely partisan, part of the culture war. It
has also revealed the American public, probably a majority, is
relatively indifferent to issues of this sort. They're apathetic, a
lot of them nonjudgmental. When immoral behavior takes place _ and
I'm not talking sex; I'm talking about obstruction of justice,
witness-tampering, perjuries _ they should be judgmental. Not a
hopeful sign.''

great, everybody has a job, crime is down. What do they want? If he
has to be a little bit kinky, that's fine. I don't want a saint as
president. I want someone with life experiences. If a politician
said he tried drugs 30 years ago, to me he'd be more fit to serve.
He has to deal with drug problems as president, right? If he had no
experience, all he can do is ask, `Why do people take drugs?'
</P>
<P>
   All it was, was a bunch of mean old white men. They don't govern
me. They aren't my constituency. . . . Clinton is the only
president I ever voted for who won. He is maybe, selfishly, the
only president who could have seen `Pink Flamingos' in college,
maybe. I know none of the other ones ever did.''

And you never know who out there might turn state's evidence next.
So I think no Republican is going to wake up in six months and say,
``Wish I hadn't cast that vote.'' But a lot of Democrats might. As
someone pointed out the other day, there's been a Clinton scandal
about every other month so far. Well, we've still got 20-odd months
to go. In the meantime, the Republicans have been liberated for a
while to work on tax cuts and, as far as I'm concerned, that's the
best of all worlds for my crowd and for Republican salvation.

people had taken that up as an idea you could have had a resolution
under which the president would have accepted censure and would
have accepted a sizable fine not paid from defense funds. That
would have been a marker with sufficient seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   I have studied impeachment enough to know that what went on was
not impeachable, and as a former prosecutor I know it would not
ordinarily be prosecuted. If it would not be prosecuted, it should
not be impeachable. The president should not be above the law, but

we're going to see, as some are predicting, any degenerative effect
on our moral standards. I think people condemn from a moral
perspective what the president did. I don't think anybody approves
of it in their right mind. I think there will even be a tightening

<P>
   With political leaders, the more successful ones are the ones

their personalities. There's going to be a lot of caution for the

covered the issue.''

   ``There are probably two questions that will be asked about what

   One, was it a legitimate use of the blunt instrument of
impeachment? The answer will probably be `no.' The failure to
persuade a bipartisan majority in the House or Senate that it
represented an irreparable injury means that it will be seen as a
predominantly partisan effort to get the president.
</P>
<P>
   The second question, raised by the president, is, `Will it be
seen as much ado about nothing?' My answer is `no.' The newspapers
are the first rough draft of history. When historians 100 years
from now read the newspapers, they will see all the strong language
condemning the president's conduct, and editorials calling for
censure. It will be harder to say it was just about sex.''

PILOTS UNION IN CONTEMPT, FINED $10 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ill., Minn., Fla., N.Y., Colo.)   (Eds: Also moving in `f' category.) 
(jw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge in Dallas cited the union representing American
Airlines pilots for contempt Saturday and fined it $10 million for
ignoring his back-to-work order as the pilots' continued sickout
stranded tens of thousands of passengers on an especially busy
holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall of North Texas also imposed a
$10,000 fine on the president of the Allied Pilots Association and
likened the union's weeklong sickout to extortion by the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, lawyers for American, the nation's second-largest
airline, asked Kendall to hold the pilots in contempt and to issue
``a coercive fine'' for failing to end the sickout despite his
Wednesday order directing them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilots association resembles one of the five families in
New York,'' Kendall said Saturday. ``It is the type of negotiation
one usually sees doing business with one of the five families in
New York. Pay us what we want or we will cost you more.''
</P>
<P>
   In a full-day hearing on Friday, the judge frequently scoffed at
the union's leaders when they insisted that they were doing
everything possible to persuade their members to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   American said about 2,100 of its pilots called in sick Saturday,
down slightly from Friday, but still enough to cause the airline to
cancel more than one-third of its 2,250 scheduled flights.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Foster, a board member of the union, said only 1,300
had called in sick Saturday, insisting that many were unable to
signal their desire to return to work because of jammed American
switchboards.
</P>
<P>
   As the labor dispute dragged on, airline terminals grew even
more crowded and passengers' tempers grew shorter as their anger at
the pilots mounted. Over the last two days, passengers have erupted
into screaming at the American terminal at Kennedy International
Airport in New York, while passengers started a near-riot in Miami,
airline officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, American officials said, the sickout has affected more
than 450,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   At O'Hare International Airport outside Chicago Saturday
morning, Del Dooling, 43, a tired, unshaven salesman from
Riverside, Calif., was so angry about the cancellation of his
Friday flight to San Juan that he vowed never to fly American
Airlines again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service has been wretched,'' he said. ``It's just
horrible. Everything is going wrong.'' Dooling added that in his
view the pilots should face a harsh penalty for defying the judge's
order. ``It should be prison and a big fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Norbert and Elaine Donay of Minneapolis were also stranded at
O'Hare because their Friday flight to San Juan was canceled,
disrupting their plans to vacation with their son. ``I was
furious,'' Mrs. Donay said.
</P>
<P>
   American officials had booked them on a Monday flight, but they
were so upset that their trip would be cut short that they made an
against-the-odds attempt to fly stand-by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At Miami International Airport, Gertrudis Gonzalez, a
21-year-old student from Managua, Nicaragua, complained about being
stranded for more than a day because her Friday morning flight home
was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went hungry, they gave us nothing to eat,'' she said. ``We
were left wandering along the passageways.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute forced passengers, travel agents and American
service representatives to show a lot of resourcefulness. Standing
in the American terminal Saturday morning at Kennedy, Patrick Reed,
a plumbing wholesaler from Albany, N.Y., complained about the
cancellation of his flight to Vancouver. But he managed to make
alternative arrangements on a TWA flight to Chicago and then a
Cathay Pacific link from Chicago to Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   While relieved about his rerouting, Reed remained angry at
American's pilots, saying, ``I think the pilots have long since
made their point, and they're being very selfish.''

<P>
   At the court hearing in Dallas on Friday, lawyers for the
airline asked Kendall to impose ``a coercive fine'' against the
union to punish the pilots for shunning his order and to pressure
the pilots to return to work as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Rich LaVoy, the union's president, told the judge that he was
doing his utmost to get the pilots to end their sickout.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Kendall had questioned the sincerity of the
union leaders' efforts to urge pilots to end their sickout. The
judge even mocked the union's protestations that it had urged
pilots to return to work after he learned that 12 of the union's 18
board members had called in sick on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, the union stepped up the urgency of its
messages calling on pilots to return to work. The union updated its
telephone message and its World Wide Web site on Friday night to
carry a statement by LaVoy, who said: ``I want to make a personal
plea to all of our pilots. The association's leadership needs your
help in complying with Judge Joe Kendall's order. We need to get
this airline back up and running at full capacity, and we need to
do so quickly. Please clear the sick list immediately and resume
your normal schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between the union and the airline grew out of
American's purchase in December of Reno Air, a small carrier
serving the West. American has said that it intends to merge Reno
Air, which has 25 planes and 300 pilots, into American's much
larger network, but that it will take as long as 18 months to refit
Reno Air's planes and retrain pilots at both carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But the union contends that American is violating the most
fundamental clause in its contract, which requires that all flying
at the airline and any of its wholly owned subsidiaries be
performed by members of the pilots' union. The pilots say they are
concerned that American may want to transfer some of its flying to
pilots at Reno Air, who are paid about half as much as American
pilots. Many pilots have also voiced concerns that if the union
does not make a stand now, it will have set a dangerous precedent
if American buys an even larger airline.
</P>
<P>
   The union has demanded that the company speed up the integration
with Reno Air and immediately begin paying pilots at both carriers
as if the integration were already completed. Pilots at Reno Air,
who are members of a different pilots union, have expressed
reservations about the union's integration proposal because they
would lose seniority.
</P>
<P>
   American has said that the union's proposal would add $50
million to the $124 million it paid to buy Reno Air. The airline
said in court on Friday that it had already lost $40 million as a
result of the disruption caused by the sickout.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Buttrick, an airline industry analyst at Paine Webber in
New York, estimated that the airline could lose as much as $110
million in sales in the current quarter from the disruption alone
plus $50 million more from passengers' booking future tickets on
other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But few analysts expect that American will suffer long-term
damage as a result of the job action, despite pledges by some angry
passengers never to fly the airline again. ``Consumers have the
attention spans of monkeys,'' said Mike Boyd, an aviation industry
consultant in Evergreen, Colo. ``They just forget real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Fare reductions and other incentives will draw passengers back
once a settlement is reached, he said. ``When American does fly,
they are really pretty good at it,'' he added. ``It is a
high-quality airline. They are going to get a pretty fast
response.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines was grounded for nearly three weeks in
September after its pilots went on strike. The carrier suffered
steep losses through the end of the year but has recently seen its
traffic return to normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term damage,'' Boyd said, referring to American, ``is
the continuing shattering of trust between the airline and its
pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots group, which is not part of the AFL-CIO, has received
little support from other unions or from its main rival, the Air
Line Pilots Association, from which it split three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Mitchell, a spokeswoman for the AFL-CIO, said the
American pilots had neither kept other unions abreast of the
situation nor asked for help.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots' dispute has caused some inconveniences for other
union leaders because it has disrupted the plans of many labor
leaders to fly to Miami for the AFL-CIO's annual winter meeting,
which begins on Tuesday at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The American pilots have received a message of solidarity from
an international pilots association, the Oneworld Flight Crew
Coalition, which includes 21,000 pilots from more than a dozen
airlines, including British Airways, Iberia, Japan Airlines and
Cathay Pacific.

PILOTS UNION IN CONTEMPT, FINED $10 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ill., Minn., Fla., N.Y., Colo.)   (Eds: Also moving in `a' category.) 
(jw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge in Dallas cited the union representing American
Airlines pilots for contempt Saturday and fined it $10 million for
ignoring his back-to-work order as the pilots' continued sickout
stranded tens of thousands of passengers on an especially busy
holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall of North Texas also imposed a
$10,000 fine on the president of the Allied Pilots Association and
likened the union's weeklong sickout to extortion by the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, lawyers for American, the nation's second-largest
airline, asked Kendall to hold the pilots in contempt and to issue
``a coercive fine'' for failing to end the sickout despite his
Wednesday order directing them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilots association resembles one of the five families in
New York,'' Kendall said Saturday. ``It is the type of negotiation
one usually sees doing business with one of the five families in
New York. Pay us what we want or we will cost you more.''
</P>
<P>
   In a full-day hearing on Friday, the judge frequently scoffed at
the union's leaders when they insisted that they were doing
everything possible to persuade their members to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   American said about 2,100 of its pilots called in sick Saturday,
down slightly from Friday, but still enough to cause the airline to
cancel more than one-third of its 2,250 scheduled flights.
</P>
<P>
   But Larry Foster, a board member of the union, said only 1,300
had called in sick Saturday, insisting that many were unable to
signal their desire to return to work because of jammed American
switchboards.
</P>
<P>
   As the labor dispute dragged on, airline terminals grew even
more crowded and passengers' tempers grew shorter as their anger at
the pilots mounted. Over the last two days, passengers have erupted
into screaming at the American terminal at Kennedy International
Airport in New York, while passengers started a near-riot in Miami,
airline officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, American officials said, the sickout has affected more
than 450,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   At O'Hare International Airport outside Chicago Saturday
morning, Del Dooling, 43, a tired, unshaven salesman from
Riverside, Calif., was so angry about the cancellation of his
Friday flight to San Juan that he vowed never to fly American
Airlines again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service has been wretched,'' he said. ``It's just
horrible. Everything is going wrong.'' Dooling added that in his
view the pilots should face a harsh penalty for defying the judge's
order. ``It should be prison and a big fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Norbert and Elaine Donay of Minneapolis were also stranded at
O'Hare because their Friday flight to San Juan was canceled,
disrupting their plans to vacation with their son. ``I was
furious,'' Mrs. Donay said.
</P>
<P>
   American officials had booked them on a Monday flight, but they
were so upset that their trip would be cut short that they made an
against-the-odds attempt to fly stand-by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At Miami International Airport, Gertrudis Gonzalez, a
21-year-old student from Managua, Nicaragua, complained about being
stranded for more than a day because her Friday morning flight home
was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went hungry, they gave us nothing to eat,'' she said. ``We
were left wandering along the passageways.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute forced passengers, travel agents and American
service representatives to show a lot of resourcefulness. Standing
in the American terminal Saturday morning at Kennedy, Patrick Reed,
a plumbing wholesaler from Albany, N.Y., complained about the
cancellation of his flight to Vancouver. But he managed to make
alternative arrangements on a TWA flight to Chicago and then a
Cathay Pacific link from Chicago to Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   While relieved about his rerouting, Reed remained angry at
American's pilots, saying, ``I think the pilots have long since
made their point, and they're being very selfish.''

</P>
<P>
   At the court hearing in Dallas on Friday, lawyers for the
airline asked Kendall to impose ``a coercive fine'' against the
union to punish the pilots for shunning his order and to pressure
the pilots to return to work as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Rich LaVoy, the union's president, told the judge that he was
doing his utmost to get the pilots to end their sickout.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Kendall had questioned the sincerity of the
union leaders' efforts to urge pilots to end their sickout. The
judge even mocked the union's protestations that it had urged
pilots to return to work after he learned that 12 of the union's 18
board members had called in sick on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, the union stepped up the urgency of its
messages calling on pilots to return to work. The union updated its
telephone message and its World Wide Web site on Friday night to
carry a statement by LaVoy, who said: ``I want to make a personal
plea to all of our pilots. The association's leadership needs your
help in complying with Judge Joe Kendall's order. We need to get
this airline back up and running at full capacity, and we need to
do so quickly. Please clear the sick list immediately and resume
your normal schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between the union and the airline grew out of
American's purchase in December of Reno Air, a small carrier
serving the West. American has said that it intends to merge Reno
Air, which has 25 planes and 300 pilots, into American's much
larger network, but that it will take as long as 18 months to refit
Reno Air's planes and retrain pilots at both carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But the union contends that American is violating the most
fundamental clause in its contract, which requires that all flying
at the airline and any of its wholly owned subsidiaries be
performed by members of the pilots' union. The pilots say they are
concerned that American may want to transfer some of its flying to
pilots at Reno Air, who are paid about half as much as American
pilots. Many pilots have also voiced concerns that if the union
does not make a stand now, it will have set a dangerous precedent
if American buys an even larger airline.
</P>
<P>
   The union has demanded that the company speed up the integration
with Reno Air and immediately begin paying pilots at both carriers
as if the integration were already completed. Pilots at Reno Air,
who are members of a different pilots union, have expressed
reservations about the union's integration proposal because they
would lose seniority.
</P>
<P>
   American has said that the union's proposal would add $50
million to the $124 million it paid to buy Reno Air. The airline
said in court on Friday that it had already lost $40 million as a
result of the disruption caused by the sickout.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Buttrick, an airline industry analyst at Paine Webber in
New York, estimated that the airline could lose as much as $110
million in sales in the current quarter from the disruption alone
plus $50 million more from passengers' booking future tickets on
other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But few analysts expect that American will suffer long-term
damage as a result of the job action, despite pledges by some angry
passengers never to fly the airline again. ``Consumers have the
attention spans of monkeys,'' said Mike Boyd, an aviation industry
consultant in Evergreen, Colo. ``They just forget real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Fare reductions and other incentives will draw passengers back
once a settlement is reached, he said. ``When American does fly,
they are really pretty good at it,'' he added. ``It is a
high-quality airline. They are going to get a pretty fast
response.''
</P>
<P>

steep losses through the end of the year but has recently seen its
traffic return to normal levels.
</P>

ONCE MORE, BRAZILIANS TIGHTEN BELTS FOR A ROUGH RIDE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO _ Jose Oliveira has abandoned construction of the
addition to his house. Cleber Franca and his wife, Cristina, have
cut up their credit cards and decided not to replace their 1981
Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   When classes resume in late February, Wagner Gomes Carneiro's
two teen-agers will not return to the private school they attended
before Brazil plunged into economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Luiz Dominguez has canceled the vacation he and his family
planned to take and will go camping instead.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, the Brazilian middle class was the main
beneficiary of the burst of stability and growth enjoyed by Latin
America's largest economy. But in the last month, that entire
edifice has begun to wobble, along with the sense of financial
security that accompanied it. Families all across this country of
165 million people are now scrambling to protect themselves from
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody whose budget isn't being pinched and who
isn't cutting back in some way or another,'' said Luiz Henrique
Afonso, 55. He works for the state government here, which has
announced it does not have enough money to pay employees past
March. ``Everybody is working the maximum to spend the minimum,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The drastic devaluation of the nation's currency, the real, over
the last month has made that process as necessary as it is painful.
Prices of imported products, ranging from the wheat used in making
bread to medicine and car parts, have shot up, so much of the belt
tightening has begun with foreign-made goods.
</P>
<P>
   Although they seem convinced that the situation can only worsen,
most middle-class Brazilians have responded so far with
resignation, not panic. As veterans of decades of triple-digit
inflation and economic crises too numerous to count, they say they
know how and when to make the necessary adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 39, and this is probably _ what _ the 10th time that some
economic plan of the government has gone down the tubes?'' said
Franz Slama, a civil engineer who worries that a leaner government
budget, as demanded by Brazil's agreement with the International
Monetary Fund, will mean less work for him. ``As Brazilians, we're
accustomed to being in this sort of thing, and have learned how to
improvise.''
</P>
<P>
   Many families, in fact, began to economize even before foreign
reserves, a currency linked to the dollar and the stock market all
started to plunge precipitously in early January after a state
Governor threatened to default on $13.5 billion in loans his state
owed to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy to see this mess coming from a long way off,''
said Domingos da Silva, 68, a retired military officer and
architect. ``As soon as interest rates hit 50 percent back in
September, we started cutting back on all unnecessary expenditures
in our household.''
</P>
<P>
   Da Silva and his wife, Walkiria Sanches, 60, a retired civil
servant, said their income comes from pensions that now add up to
less than $1,500 a month. As a former army captain, he is exempt
from the increase in social security contributions that Congress
recently approved, ``at least for now,'' he said. But his wife is
not: under the new system, she calculates, her monthly check will
drop by $27.50 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's real money,'' she said. ``It represents a couple of
kilos of beans, a couple of kilos of butter and a couple of kilos
of meat every month. We've got to save more, and we're doing that
by not buying clothes and not going out at all to dinner, the
movies or the theater anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Oliveira, a 43-year-old father of two, worked lots of
overtime to make enough to expand his kitchen, a project now
mothballed because of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to cost us at least $1,000 just in labor, not to
mention the raw materials,'' he said. ``So we told the contractor
to stop, and we canceled the order for the new curtains we were
going to install.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliveira, a supervisor in the repair department of the state
water utility, also has eliminated the bottle of beer he drank
every evening, and has withdrawn his daughter from the after-school
English course she was taking. ``As for shopping,'' said his wife,
Vera Costa, ``all we do now is look in the windows.''
</P>
<P>
   The major worry is care for Oliveira's mother. At 68, she
recently had a stroke and needs therapy, as well as medication that
costs almost double her $80 a month pension.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis hit Brazil at the peak of the Southern Hemisphere
summer vacation season; this runs from Christmas until Carnival,
which this year ends on Feb. 17. Many families were locked into
vacation packages for which they had paid in advance with Christmas
bonuses and could not cancel, and so they plan to tighten their
belts even more drastically as soon as they return to work or
school.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the recent crisis, Brazil's economy was expected to
contract by between 1 and 2 percent in 1999. But many forecasters
have now revised their calculations downward as a result of the
combination of high interest rates and a weakened currency, with
some even predicting a recession that may see the economy shrink by
as much as 5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crisis isn't our fault, but we're going to be the ones to
pay the price,'' da Silva said. ``That's the way it has always been
in Brazil, and that's the way it will always be.''

FAR FROM SCANDAL, SYDNEY PREPARES FOR 2000 OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ In the northern hemisphere, it has been the
harshest winter in history for the International Olympic Committee.
But as you stand before the Sydney Opera House on a summer
afternoon in the other hemisphere, it is easy to feel warmer about
the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   From here, in 19 months, the world's finest female triathletes
will take the plunge on the morning of the opening day of
competition at the 2000 Summer Games. With the familiar white forms
of the Opera House for a backdrop, they will freestyle their way
around one of the world's more idyllic harbors as tens of thousands
of spectators cheer them from the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those spectators will be Sydneysiders, the name for
those who live in this seaport of approximately 4 million. Bump
into a Sydneysider by accident, and the reply will come quickly:
``You're all right, mate.'' And after several days of contact
recently with Sydney's future Olympic sites, it was difficult not
to return the encouraging words. In the midst of an Olympic bribery
scandal, which has turned into a crisis of credibility for the IOC
and sparked an independent local investigation of the Sydney bid,
this city has continued to prepare for the biggest event in its
history. For the moment, the city is on, and, in some cases, ahead
of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The new 110,000-seat stadium, the largest used in an Olympics,
is essentially completed and will host its first event in March,
three months earlier than planned. The Sydney International
Aquatics Center, the largest of its kind, has been open since 1994
and already has received five million visits: an appropriately high
number in a nation where swimming is a major sport, not a
predominantly suburban diversion with a quadrennial exclamation
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy percent of the competition venues are finished, and
ninety percent of the contracts or tenders have been awarded,''
said Elsie Hasting, a spokesperson for the Olympic Co-Ordination
Authority, the governmental agency overseeing construction of the
venues.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new sites, including the Olympic stadium, are
located in Homebush Bay, which lies about 10 miles west of the city
center where the Parramatta river begins to widen on its way to the
harbor. Fifteen of the 28 Olympic sports will be contested there,
including those that generally attract the greatest interest in the
United States: gymnastics, swimming and diving, basketball and
track and field. The main news media center, international
broadcast center and Olympic village will also be in this area,
which will make the Sydney Games the most compact in memory. In
theory, many athletes will be able to walk from their housing to
their events, and no competition venue is expected to be more than
30 minutes away from Homebush Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proximity is one of the advantages we will have over
Atlanta,'' said Michael Knight, the minister of Olympics for the
New South Wales state government.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta represents something of a cautionary tale for the Sydney
Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games. Because of the bus
system that often went awry in Atlanta in the opening days, the
committee has already brought drivers to Sydney for early training,
and those drivers will be responsible for no more than two routes.
There will also be strict limits on street vendors and no attempt
to re-create the tent city that passed for Centennial Park in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called it Centennial Park, but I always thought that a
park had trees,'' said Sue Graham, director of media services for
the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney will be easier on the public eye, particularly when its
athletes have water views, as beach volleyballers will at
celebrated Bondi Beach and marathoners will as they hustle across
the Harbor Bridge. But not all will conform with the positive
stereotype of Sydney. In general, the city center, with its
hodgepodge of tall buildings, is not nearly as stirring as its
setting, and there is still some truth in the observation of the
architect Clough Williams-Ellis about Sydney in the 1950s: ``By
God, what a sight! By man, what a mess!''
</P>
<P>
   Homebush Bay may sound idyllic but has long been quite the
opposite. Once the home of a large slaughterhouse, it later became
a dumping site for industrial waste. When Sydney won the bid,
cleanup and redevelopment accelerated, and though fishing is still
illegal because of toxins that remain in the bay, the areas where
Olympic sports will be contested and the village where Olympic
athletes will live have been deemed safe.
</P>
<P>
   The village will be the first to house all the Summer Olympic
athletes (except for certain professional sports stars who will
inevitably opt for more luxurious private accommodation). Houses in
the village will run essentially on solar power, and they have been
constructed with an emphasis on eco-friendly materials, including
wood from timber companies that follow strict environmental
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Sydney won the right to host the Olympics, bid
officials were billing these as ``the Green Games,'' and
Greenpeace, the environmental watchdog organization, helped design
the plans for the village and has provided input elsewhere.
Visitors to Homebush Bay are shown an abandoned and uninspiring
brick pit that has been preserved as a habitat for the endangered
green-and-gold bell frog. Visitors to the equestrian center in the
appropriately named western suburb of Horsley Park are informed of
efforts to protect rare snails.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been friction between Greenpeace and the
organizing committee over the chemical refrigerants that builders
plan to use for the air-conditioning system in the 20,000-seat
SuperDome, which is still under construction at Homebush Bay.
According to Greenpeace, the chemical HCFC 123, which is to be used
by the builders, is an ozone-depleting substance. Greenpeace
proposes an ammonia-based system. The organizing committee has
rejected that suggestion and says the ozone risk with its system is
minimal and that it is safer than an ammonia-based approach. That
prompted lawyers for Greenpeace to file suit in Australian federal
court in December.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But even Michael Bland, Greenpeace's Olympics Campaign
Coordinator, concedes that there is more good environmental news
than bad. ``Right now, I'd give them 7 out of 10, even with the
refrigerants,'' Bland said. ``If we get that resolved, we will have
to give them 8 out of 10.''
</P>
<P>
   There would still be other rubbing points, however. Bondi Beach
residents are none too delighted at the prospect of their beloved
stretch of sand being blocked off for weeks by a beach volleyball
stadium (if southerly winds blow in cold air from Antarctica, the
beach volleyballers will be none too delighted, either).
</P>
<P>
   There are serious concerns about the utility and profitability
of the massive and evocative Olympic Stadium, which will be reduced
to a capacity of 80,000 after the Games but could still have
difficulty filling that many seats on a regular basis. When the
private consortium that financed the bulk of the stadium's $440
million cost attempted to sell shares in the project to the public
in 1997, the offering was 69 percent undersubscribed. And that is
not the only Olympic-linked fund raiser to flop here: the sales of
Olympic license plates and souvenirs have also lagged badly, as has
the sale of memberships in an Olympic Club, which offers Olympic
paraphernalia and other perquisites.
</P>
<P>
   There is also concern about traffic jams in a sprawling city
linked by relatively narrow roads and about pedestrian traffic at
Homebush Bay, where as many as 400,000 people could crowd onto the
site during the second weekend when swimming and track and field
will be running concurrently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The operations and logistical guys are spending a lot of time
on that one,'' said Greg Thomas, a Sydney organizing committee
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear what impact the IOC corruption scandal will
have on local enthusiasm. The story has received intensive news
media coverage here, and an independent inquiry into the Sydney bid
has been launched by Knight in an attempt to address public and
sponsor concern. The Sydney organizing committee is still
approximately $145 million short of its sponsorship targets, and
more revelations could affect ticket sales, which will begin in
earnest this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the most sanguine of times, ticket sales were going to
be a marketing challenge. The organizing committee has four million
individual tickets to sell in a country that, for all its love of
sport, only has 18.3 million inhabitants. Atlanta might not have
had a striking Opera House with an ocean view or bus drivers with a
fine sense of direction, but it did have 250 million Americans for
a target audience.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Braves closer Mark Wohlers made some progress while
attending ``Camp Leo'' this week, but his comeback and major-league
future remain in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   In throwing sessions at Turner Field this week, Wohlers
continued to exhibit the same control problems that had him
pitching in AAA Richmond during the 1998 season. Some of his
pitches were short and in the dirt; others sailed to the backstop.

   ``We're keeping our fingers crossed,'' manager Bobby Cox said.
``We'll do whatever we can for him, because he'd be a huge plus for
us if he rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers' control problems were attributed, in part, to a
strained oblique muscle, his mother's health problems and his
divorce. The muscle has healed; his mother has recovered from a
heart attack and is in much better health now; and Wohlers has had
some time to work through his personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   He asked to work this offseason with Braves pitching instructor
Guy Hansen, who helped Wohlers last summer. Wohlers spent January
in Puerto Rico and California working with Hansen on his mechanics,
his grip and arm extension. But progress has been slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take it a day at a time,'' pitcher Tom Glavine
said. ``He's not going to get up one morning and throw every pitch
on the corner and throw every slider where he wants it. It'll be a
gradual progression. If anybody thinks he'll get there in the next
two or three days, they're crazy. It's not going to happen. That's
why you have to be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers is hesitant to discuss the 1998 season, when he compiled
a 10.18 ERA and issued 33 walks in 20 1/3 innings in Atlanta,
followed by his 36 walks, 17 wild pitches and 21 hits allowed in 12
1/3 innings at Class AAA Richmond. He declined all interview
requests this week, saying that he might discuss his comeback
Wednesday when pitchers and catchers report for spring training in
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone called Wednesday's session _
Wohlers' second of four that were scheduled this week _ a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a good day (Wednesday),'' said Mazzone, who annually
runs a camp for his pitchers before spring training.
``Mechanically, he executed what he wanted to do about 60 percent
of the time, which is a big upgrade. He pulled a couple off, but he
knew what he was doing mechanically. . . . On a day like today you
go into the clubhouse feeling good.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves director of scouting and player development Paul Snyder
also watched the workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he had his extension, he was fine,'' Snyder said. ``When
he didn't, he was just like every other pitcher (without good
extension). . . . Sometimes he can be a little careless. He knows
that. But things are better now than they were last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports psychologist Jack Llewellyn has been working with Wohlers
throughout the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he ever considered for a minute he wouldn't be
able to pitch,'' Llewellyn said. ``That's a big part of it, his
attitude. And his attitude is tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Llewellyn said he works with Wohlers on visualizing success and
trying to recover from throwing bad pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every pitcher goes through adversity,'' Llewellyn said. ``The
question is: If he throws a bad pitch, how long does it take for
him to recover?''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers showed some resilience Wednesday, when three of his
first dozen or so pitches flew to the backstop and another four
landed in the dirt, one of which bounced over the fence. By the end
of his session of more than 30 pitches he was closing in on the
target.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take the good days and try to run with them,'' Llewellyn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers did talk to Peter Gammons of ESPN and the Boston Globe
two weeks ago, saying: ``I'm just trying to put it all behind me
and move forward. I know what happened and where I've been. I just
have to use this experience to my advantage and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers also said: ``I really feel that dwelling on the past
will be counterproductive. What can it accomplish? This is 1999. I
plan to have a strong 1999. When I've re-established myself, maybe
sometime during the summer, I will open up. But for now, the best
thing I can do is concentrate on throwing and not talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine said watching Wohlers go through this process is hard on
everybody in the Braves clubhouse. He said he just tries to offer
his support and advice when Wohlers asks for it and stay out of his
way when he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things as a player you hear stories about
and hope it never happens,'' Glavine said. ``When you see it
happen, it's almost unbelievable. You don't want to watch it. You
don't want it to happen to you. It's a difficult situation for
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody in here wishes the best for him. For
personal and selfish reasons, we want to see him come back.''
</P>
<P>
   As for how or when, nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it takes eight months, that'll be fine,'' Snyder said.
``Putting himself on a timetable _ that's the worst thing he can
do. That puts even more pressure on him.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, it's up to Wohlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe,'' Cox said, ``it can be worked out _ if
something can just snap one day, and there he goes.''

 &HT;    Pulling away from image of 'Triple-A'
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If money can buy status, NASCAR has a million reasons
to believe it can change the perception of the Busch Grand National
racing series from Triple-A to major league.
</P>
<P>
   The Busch, NASCAR's ``other'' racing series considered the
stepping stone to Winston Cup, is getting a big marketing push in
1999 as the No. 2 racing circuit in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   That's Busch league, not bush league.
</P>
<P>
   The series has enjoyed tremendous growth in popularity,
attendance and prize money.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance has increased 286 percent during the past 10 years.
Sponsor Anheuser-Busch's contribution to the points fund has
increased from $150,000 in 1992 to $650,000 in 1998 to $1.5 million
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we developed plans for the Busch series, we knew we had a
valuable property that is much more than a feeder system to the
NASCAR Winston Cup series,'' said Brian France, senior vice
president of NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   While showcasing future Winston Cup stars, the Busch series has
offered something the Cup has not: close competition.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen different drivers won in the 31-race series last year.
Nineteen different drivers won the pole in the last 19 races.
Fifty-two drivers led at least one lap. The fastest qualifier and
the slowest qualifier have been separated by an average of .536
seconds, and the average margin of victory was 1.432 seconds from
first to second.
</P>
<P>
   The series had a huge range in experience and age: 17-year-old
Casey Atwood became the series youngest-ever pole-winner, and at
the age of 56 years and 10 months, Dick Trickle became the oldest
driver to win a Busch race with his victory at Hickory, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But there's this second-banana position that NASCAR is trying to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to position the series as the proving ground for the
Winston Cup series while emphasizing that in no way is the NASCAR
Busch series a minor league,'' said Kevin Triplett, a NASCAR
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because so many people are familiar with baseball, we refer to
Busch as a Triple-A series,'' Triplett said. ``In no way do we feel
that the Busch series is minor league. We've felt that way for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, a number of Winston Cup drivers feel the same way.
Mark Martin, Ken Schrader and Jimmy Spencer regularly run Busch
races, and this year defending Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon
will drive five races for a team he is starting with his wife,
Brooke, and his Cup crew chief, Ray Evernham.
</P>
<P>
   Randy LaJoie, a two-time Busch champion who has made brief runs
in Winston Cup, has seen first-hand the growth of the Busch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more money than there used to be,'' said LaJoie,
who won the Busch title in 1996 and 1997. ``I think that's what's
bringing Gordon back. Also it's a good series, otherwise people
wouldn't want to come here and race. And maybe these guys are using
it as a test for Sunday. With NASCAR's testing procedures now, any
track time you get is a bonus. The cars are getting very similar.
There are things you can do in a Busch car that can help you on
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   But LaJoie knows the series needs an image makeover.
</P>
<P>
   He has run several races in Winston Cup. ``I got recognized more
for running the Budweiser car than I did for winning two
championships,'' LaJoie said. ``The fans, I think, have followed
the Busch series the last couple of years, but they still ask you
'when are you going to drive NASCAR?' We do drive NASCAR. But the
fans really put your name with Winston Cup because that's the
elite, that is the upper echelon. But there's nothing wrong with
the Busch series.''
</P>
<P>
   While other drivers are leaving Busch for the upper echelon _
Buckshot Jones, Elliott Sadler, Kevin Lepage and Tony Stewart are
moving up to Winston Cup this year _ LaJoie, for one, has been
content to remain in Busch.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the involvement and the money Busch is putting in,
there's no reason you can't make a good living in the Busch
series,'' he said. ``I'm going to take my piece of that cake and
run with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trickle, the veteran, isn't shy about referring to Busch as the
proving ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard for a guy to go right to Winston Cup without
schooling himself,'' Trickle said. ``In order to run Winston Cup
some day you have to get a lot of seat time in cars that are close
to them. Busch is the closest thing to them. It's really a major
stepping stone for what is Winston Cup. It's the next notch under
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a place for drivers to compete, but more
importantly to marketing-savvy NASCAR, it's another vehicle for
sponsor involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start a Winston Cup race on Sunday, 43 cars,'' Trickle
said. ``Does that mean there's only 43 sponsors in this country,
only 43 drivers in this country? No, there's a lot of great drivers
out there, and you can't put them all into 43. This gives a second
43 drivers a chance to race. They need a place to race, and the
fans want to watch more than just Winston Cup.''

 &HT;    Birth of a race car
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOORESVILLE, N.C. _ Things are hopping in the biggest little
race shop in NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   The Penske-Kranefuss Racing Team is about to give birth.
</P>
<P>
   Four just-about-completed stock cars are lined up, showroom new,
in the main building. Another car, half-finished, is in the
spraying booth getting a red interior. Welders are putting the
finishing touches on a surface that measures the car's balance and
weight.
</P>
<P>
   It's the week before the season-opening Daytona 500, and
everyone is concerned with finishing touches. It's a little like
looking at a newborn and counting fingers and toes.
</P>
<P>
   The mood is jovial. The Penske-Kranefuss team is 26 strong, and
like most other NASCAR teams, it will build some 12 cars this
season for drivers Rusty Wallace and Jeremy Mayfield. The $70,000
machines instantly become part of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the cars have a little variance to them,'' shop foreman
Joe Don Bailey said. ``They're like kids. They might have the
parents' genes, but they've all got a little different
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Every part of the operation is gearing up for what it hopes will
be a run at a Winston Cup championship. In the chassis shop, Billy
Woodruff looks at a wall full of steel pipes and sees a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big ol' giant steel puzzle is all it is,'' Woodruff said.
``It's just that you've got to make your own pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the pieces fit better than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is our brand-new Daytona car,'' Bailey tells a visitor.
``When we tested it and wind-tunneled and digitized it, it showed
that the two previous cars we had were just a little bit better. So
it'll be a spare, ride the trailer down there. We won't even get it
out unless we crash before qualifying. If we crash before
qualifying, that'll be a better qualifying car. But if we crash
after qualifying, then we'll take the Busch Clash car because it's
a better race car. It's got low drag, but it's still got a little
bit more downforce.''
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the few Winston Cup teams that builds its cars
entirely within its own operation. Right down to its own nuts and
bolts. But don't ask machinist/programmer Dewayne Trammell how the
Computer Numerical Control machine works. It might be easier to
learn how to drive the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Z-minus-point-five, that would be a half-inch below
wherever you established Z-zero is,'' Trammell said, trying to
explain a formula for the manufacture of one of the 250 parts he
custom makes for the car. ``You have to establish that so the
program knows where to machine the piece.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to comprehend Bailey talking about one of the cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the car we built for Rusty (Wallace) to run at Indy
and Darlington,'' he said. ``He decided to go back to the Hopkins
cars because he won the race in Phoenix with a Hopkins car, so we
got it back from him. That car has two races on it. We'll take it,
strip it, cut the body off, get it to where we like our bodies at
and change it to what Jeremy likes in a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is just a sentimental bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just sent a car out to get sand-blasted; it was 01, the
very first of our own chassis,'' Bailey said. ``After Japan, it was
supposed to be sold to Jeremy's ARCA team. We got to looking at it,
and it was our oldest car, so we were going to delete out of the
stock. But every time Jeremy's run it, it's been a top-five car, in
position to win, just like it was in Japan. We ended up pulling it
back down here, cutting the body off of it. It's going back into
our stable. Sometimes it's hard to throw them out. When you've got
a good horse, you've got to ride it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a new model year, some NASCAR teams recycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the old car is better than a new car,'' Bailey said.
``Kind of like an old shoe. Until you got that new shoe broke in,
you like to wear that old pair.''
</P>
<P>
   The team continuously looks for an edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race cars are always in evolution,'' Woodruff said. ``You're
always looking for that 2-10ths of a second advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   They might be found in the paint booth, where Terry Mayfield is
putting a darker blue on the No. 12 skin this season. Or in the 40
percent room, where a scale-model of the car, looking like a
beautiful toy, is manufactured with the same seriousness as a
full-size beast in hopes it will bring maximum results in a
mini-wind-tunnel test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data that we get will be 98 percent of what the big cars
show you in the wind tunnel,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Or it might be something that visionary crew chief Paul Andrews
dreams up in a pre-building skull session with engineers. ``You
take what is working for you,'' he said, ``and tweak and refine
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All cars are not built the same,'' Bailey said. ``Like for
Daytona, we change frame-rail heights; for short-track cars we
prepare them for high-braking instances, different braking in them.
Our air program is doing some different things under the cars where
we're going to a different aero package. We have five full-time
engineers, so we change our chassis design to always make it
better.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, staying within NASCAR's guidelines, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got it wrote to where you can't hardly do nothing,''
Woodruff said. ``There's been so many things tried, almost every
trick's been pulled.''

 &HT;    Ford drivers improving along with the Taurus
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dale Jarrett is healthy. Mark Martin isn't.
</P>
<P>
   But both drivers enter the 1999 Winston Cup series among a
handful of NASCAR teams trying to close the gap on two-time
defending champion Jeff Gordon and the No. 24 Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Gordon, who won last year's Cup title by a whopping
364 points, is a heavy favorite to win his third championship in a
row and fourth overall.
</P>
<P>
   But a handful of drivers could emerge and cut into Gordon's 13
victories of a year ago. Several Ford teams are optimistic after a
full season of driving the Taurus, which replaced the Thunderbird
before the 1998 schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But the real challengers know they're going to have to improve
their operations, because Gordon probably isn't going to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way that dominance is going to go away is if they
self-destruct somehow,'' three-time Cup champion Darrell Waltrip
said.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the top five candidates looking to challenge Gordon:
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeff Burton, No. 99 Ford. At age 31, Burton could be a rising
star on the circuit. He finished fourth and fifth in points the
past two seasons and in 1998 won two races with a career-high in
top-fives and top-10s.
</P>
<P>
   Burton finished in the top five in the final three races last
year, and he's looking to carry that momentum into this season. If
he improves his qualifying _ he started an average of about 10
positions farther back than those ahead of him in points _ Burton
should be improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point in your career, you have to get over that
potential label and start doing it,'' Burton said. ``You can't just
keep saying, 'It's time to learn; it's time to learn.' It's time to
apply everything you've learned, and now is that time.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Dale Jarrett, No. 88 Ford. In the last three seasons, Jarrett
finished second once _ 1997 _ and third twice in the points
standings. He says he feels physically better than he has in 20
years, thanks to offseason surgery to remove his gall stones.
Jarrett has gone to a low-fat diet and has lost nearly 15 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot better, better than I've felt in maybe 20 or 25
years,'' Jarrett said. ``I didn't realize how bad I felt until I
got everything taken care of. I'm much healthier, and I finally
have the energy and desire to get back on a good workout program.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett also should benefit from owner Robert Yates' decision to
move second-year driver Kenny Irwin out of the main facility so
Jarrett could concentrate on winning a championship. Irwin, last
year's rookie of the year, struggled to a 28th-place finish in
points, which might have been a distraction for the No. 88 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have one team that does well one week, and the other
one doesn't, it's kind of hard for those guys to enjoy their time
when they come in Monday morning,'' Jarrett said. ``They don't want
to hurt the feelings of the other guys. That's just very difficult.
Plus, we were running out of space.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mark Martin, No. 6 Ford. Martin enjoyed the best season of his
16-year career in 1998, winning seven races and finishing with 22
top-fives and 26 top-10s. Yet, he still finished eons behind Gordon
in the points standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take that season again any year I can get it,'' Martin
said. ``But those guys on (Gordon's) No. 24 team didn't miss a
beat. If they do that again, it doesn't matter what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's biggest concern remains the serious back pain he
suffered last season, a condition he says probably will bother him
the rest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Martin planned surgery after last season to improve a herniated
disc in his lower back. But doctors decided not to go through with
the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``My back is about the same status that it was in November _ not
better,'' Martin said. ``My hope was to have surgery in November
and come into the season with no back problems. I have back pain,
but I may have back pain the rest of my life. I can live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's back hasn't hindered him in preparing for the Daytona
500. He had the fifth-fastest speed in first-round qualifying, then
won the Bud Shootout, his first victory at Daytona International
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's team returns nearly intact after starting last season
with all but two new crew members. If Roush Racing improves its
restrictor-plate program _ Martin lost all but 43 of his 364-point
deficit to Gordon in the four restrictor-plate races _ Martin could
mount a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeremy Mayfield, No. 12 Ford. Mayfield and teammate Rusty
Wallace were the biggest surprises of last season, totaling 37
top-10s. If Mayfield continues to learn from Wallace, he could be
Ford's answer to Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield scored his first career victory 15 races into the 1998
season at Pocono and led the points race for four of the 33-week
schedule. The following week at Sears Point, however, Gordon
regained the lead, and he did not relinquish it. After Pocono,
Mayfield had finishes of 18th twice, 30th, 31st and 42nd, ending
any threat of a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rusty and I have talked about this before, but with any luck
at all, or if both of us had been a little bit better last year, we
would have won 10 or 12 races between the two of us, easy,''
Mayfield said. ``That's something we haven't forgotten, and we know
that we were that close last year. We feel we're going to be much
better this year.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Rusty Wallace, No. 2 Ford. Wallace improved to fourth in
points last season, his best finish since placing third in 1994.
The resurgence comes from a couple of factors _ the dramatic
improvement of teammate Mayfield and the development of Penske's
engines after purchasing Larry Wallace's operation last year.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who won at Phoenix last season to extend his streak to
13 consecutive years with at least one victory, didn't finish 11
events in 1997. In 1998, he had only two DNFs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Wallace posted the fastest testing times at Daytona
and held the pole for the 500 for more than hour before being
bumped out of the front row by Gordon, rookie Tony Stewart and Mike
Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a brand-new car,'' Wallace said. ``We had a lot of
problems with some of last year's cars and that limited us to only
go so far with our suspension setup, so we went back and built a
new car. Man alive, it's so much better, it's unreal.''

 &HT;    Other drivers hoping for complacency from champ
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was more than six years ago that Jeff Gordon sat
behind the wheel of Rick Hendrick's third car and ran his first
Winston Cup race in the 1992 season-finale at Atlanta Motor
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 races later, Gordon enters the '99 campaign still
looking at the competition in his rear-view mirror. ``The Kid'' _
Gordon doesn't turn 28 until August _ has 42 victories in 189
career starts, an average of one victory every 4.5 races.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon is coming off his best season, winning 13 races in 1998,
tying Richard Petty's modern-day record and posting 26 top-five
finishes and 28 top-10s. Gordon won more than $9 million in prize
money last year, increasing his career winnings to more than $26
million.
</P>
<P>
   In only six full seasons, Gordon already is 13th on the all-time
victory list, tied with Bill Elliott and the late Tim Flock. Among
active drivers, only veterans Darrell Waltrip (84 victories), Dale
Earnhardt (71) and Rusty Wallace (48) have won more races than
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   With a third straight points title this year, Gordon would tie
Cale Yarborough as the only drivers to accomplish that feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of us will race for second if Gordon does that
again,'' said Dale Jarrett, who has finished second and third in
points to Gordon the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's set a big standard, and everybody is going to be out
there trying to make sure that it doesn't happen again,'' said Paul
Andrews, crew chief for Jeremy Mayfield and the No. 12 Ford.
``Everybody is going to step it up. Everybody is going to be
gunning for him, so he's going to have a tough road. Right now,
he's got a bull's-eye on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this the year someone finally catches Gordon and puts some
drama back in Winston Cup racing? Or will Gordon, who won the pole
for today's season-opening Daytona 500, simply move the bull's-eye
even faster?
</P>
<P>
   ``They have raised the bar and set a new standard,'' Rusty
Wallace said about Gordon and his Rainbow Warriors. ``Since it
doesn't seem like they're going to slow up any time soon, it's up
to us and the rest of the series to catch up to them. It doesn't
look like they're going to wait around for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Few NASCAR drivers believe that this is the year the No. 24
Chevrolet finally slows down. But it could be tough for Gordon's
dominance to continue, and his unprecedented success _ he has won
three points titles in his first six seasons, something no other
driver has accomplished _ could be a big reason why.
</P>
<P>
   Success can breed complacency, and some people think that Gordon
might not be as hungry. After Yarborough won 10 races and his third
straight points title in 1978, he had only four victories the next
season and finished fourth in points standings. Earnhardt, after
winning consecutive titles in '90 and '91, couldn't manage a top-10
finish in points in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be the team to beat than a team that doesn't do
anything,'' Gordon said. ``When we hear things like that, that
other teams are gunning for us, that's the best feeling you can
have. That's what you want to hear, because you want to be the team
to beat. I just hope we can live up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Gordon might have the distraction of his new Busch
Series venture with wife Brooke and crew chief Ray Evernham.
Gordon-Evernham Motorsports will compete in 10 races on the Grand
National Series in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon will drive in five of those events _ the two Charlotte
races, Michigan, Las Vegas and Texas. The last two are tracks where
Gordon has not won, as are Phoenix and the new Homestead, Fla.,
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job to make sure I don't get burned out and don't do
too much,'' Gordon said. ``The more successful we are as a race
team, the more I have to work. The more demands that are on me, I
just have to learn to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people think that Gordon's new Busch team could be the
first step in the dismantling of the Hendrick juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that is interesting to me is the Busch team
they are starting,'' Darrell Waltrip said. ``There is probably more
there than meets the eye. That could be the beginning of the end,
to some degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Or will it just be more of the same?

 &HT;    Russell draws a winner
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ One of the offensive sets is called Picasso,
with a Pablo option. The press defense is Van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
   As a player, Cazzie Russell was an artist on the court. Now he
is teaching basketball to artists.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been surreal.
</P>
<P>
   With the three-time All-American and 12-year NBA standout as
coach, Savannah College of Art and Design is 17-8 and hopes to get
a bid to the NCAA Division III men's basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   If SCAD makes the field for the first time, Russell promises to
unveil a new play, one that is truly a work of art. ``We're saving
Rembrandt for the big dance,'' he said, breaking into a big laugh.
Russell, 54, obviously is enjoying himself, despite his unlikely
career path. You'd expect someone with Russell's basketball
pedigree to be coaching in the NBA or at a major college _ not
working at an art-and-design school of about 4,500 students located
amid the Spanish moss-draped streets of Savannah's historic
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I love coaching here,'' said Russell, who was an assistant
with the Atlanta Hawks for two years. ``Nobody expects anything
from us _ a team of graphic artists, cartoonists and fashion
designers. We come into another team's gym and they're going,
`Yummy, yummy.' But we fool 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Russell arrived three seasons ago, the only attention SCAD
had generated in basketball was for having a female on the men's
team _ an NCAA first. With Melissa Burden as a backup guard, the
Bees were 1-24 in 1992-93 after a winless first season of
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone laughed at us for having a girl,'' said Eddie
Concepcion, a former player who now is one of Russell's assistants.
``But she was as good as we had. We didn't have many players who
really belonged on a college team.''
</P>
<P>
   Tired of losing, SCAD president Richard Rowan, a former player
at Furman, decided to go after a big-name coach. He targeted
Russell after seeing a CNN feature on the all-time University of
Michigan scoring leader who was the No. 1 pick in the 1966 NBA
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of life in the CBA, where he had coached for nine seasons,
Russell was associate pastor at Love Zion Baptist Church in
Columbus, Ohio, and coach at Centennial High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I really had to pray about,'' said Russell,
who was ordained in 1989 and is now associate pastor of Happy Home
Missionary Baptist Church. ``I believe there is a divine purpose
for everything and I feel that Savannah is where the Lord wanted
me. I'm at peace. I feel really blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowan _ who hopes to move SCAD up to NCAA Division II and then
Division I _ is more convinced than ever he went after the right
person. And not just because the team is 51-23 in Russell's three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's concerned about the whole student, not just the
basketball player,'' Rowan said. ``There is no reason to think a
really good artist can't also be a really good athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   But academics come first at SCAD, despite Rowan's high-profile
hirings of Russell and baseball coach Luis Tiant.
</P>
<P>
   Trokon Nagbe, the team's second-leading scorer and top defender,
took last season off so he could take a year-long internship with
Marvel Comics in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a question about it,'' Russell said. ``They're
here to prepare for the future. And at a Division III school,
that's not pro basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading scorer Chris Morris hopes to illustrate CD or magazine
covers. Backup guard Carroll Boomer is interested in designing
women's evening wear. Steven Stecina, the team's tallest player at
6 feet 9, came from Hungary to study computer art.
</P>
<P>
   SCAD's success has come despite a nightmare schedule that
requires almost as much travel as Russell endured in the NBA. The
school doesn't have a gym or a league affiliation, forcing a
25-game schedule with 20 road games. The Bees have been to New York
three times and to Maine and California once each.
</P>
<P>
   The long trips leave Nagbe and others plenty of time for their
artistic passions. ``I fill up a whole sketchbook,'' Nagbe said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the educational value of travel, Russell would prefer
more home games. But the Savannah Civic Center isn't available in
December, and that is when most teams play nonleague games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just pray that the NCAA will look at all our road games when
they pick teams for the tournament,'' Russell said. ``We deserve a
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell played in the NCAA Final Four twice at Michigan and won
an NBA title with the New York Knicks in 1970. But he insists that
reaching the postseason in Division III, where no athletic
scholarships are allowed, would be just as big a thrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm where I want to be,'' Russell said. ``Coaching is in my
blood, and so are these kids.''
</P>
<P>
   CAZZIE RUSSELL FILE
</P>
<P>
   _ Age: 54.
</P>
<P>
   _ Family: Wife Myrna, a former Alvin Ailey dancer, and three

 &HT;    Advocates sputtering over mentally disabled boy's jailing
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ With an IQ of 58 and the functional
capability of a 5-year-old, Tony Laster cannot comprehend the legal
thinking that put him behind bars for seven weeks for stealing $2
from an eighth-grade classmate.
</P>
<P>
   Laster is not alone in this.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys and advocates for the mentally retarded say
they can't comprehend it either.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney Barry Krischer's ``zero tolerance'' policy for
school crimes is itself being judged by the treatment given Laster,
a hearing-impaired 15-year-old from Boynton Beach who is not able
to remember an address or phone number _ let alone sort out the
uproar his playground incident has ignited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's outrageous,'' said Lynn Whitfield, president of
the Palm Beach County Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ``To
have this child sitting in jail and not even being able to
understand why he's there is not fair, and it certainly is not
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Laird, executive director of The Association of Retarded
Citizens, said the Laster case is evidence of a prosecutor's
reckless disregard for the rights of the most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is almost inhumane,'' Laird said. ``It is the height of
hypocrisy not to take disabilities into account when punishment is
administered.''
</P>
<P>
   Laster's attorney, public defender Toni Gilliam, believes the
state attorney's office is confusing get-tough politics for
justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to look at these on a case-by-case basis,''
she said. ``This is not the type of case even Barry Krischer
himself developed zero tolerance for. It should have been handled
as a juvenile matter or perhaps by the school itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Krischer has stood firm on his decision to treat Laster as an
adult and charge him with strong-arm robbery and extortion,
felonies that could send him back to jail for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids going to school must know they'll be safe there,''
Krischer said.
</P>
<P>
   He defends treating offenders as adults by saying it is the most
effective way to get their attention. Neither the dollar amount
stolen nor Laster's mental disability is reason to deviate from the
zero tolerance approach, prosecutors argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``A significant number of defendants in juvenile and adult
courts have low IQs or some form of retardation, or one of their
principal defenses is low IQ or mental retardation,'' said Mike
Edmondson, spokesman for the state attorney's office. ``What the
state has to establish is competence to prosecute. We regularly
prosecute offenses from murder to petty theft against defendants
with low IQs, physical addiction or alleged mental retardation.''
</P>
<P>
   Laster's unwitting challenge to prosecutorial policy began in
special-education art class at Congress Middle School in Boynton
Beach, where on Dec. 1 he pulled the two $1 bills out of the pocket
of a 14-year-old classmate, police say.
</P>
<P>
   Laster told them he was hungry and used the money to buy candy.
The victim said he felt physically threatened, and Laster was then
arrested by campus police.
</P>
<P>
   His sister Carolyn, 30, said her brother has had behavior
problems at school before, and that those worsened after his
grandfather, with whom he was very close, died of a heart attack in
May and his mother died of AIDS in November.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Laster said it is difficult for Tony to follow
instructions because of a hearing loss that forces him to wear aids
in both ears during classes. Quiet and withdrawn, Laster speaks in
sparse fragments of sentences and has struggled to advance in the
special education program.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Coleman, Palm Beach County school district associate
superintendent, said the school acted properly in arresting Laster
but would not discuss the case in detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to say anything about it,'' Coleman said. ``We
dealt with it like we should. If anyone steals anything, the
student code of conducts says it's very appropriate for the schools
to contact police.''
</P>
<P>
   MOVE TO ADULT COURT
</P>
<P>
   Laster was transported by campus police from the school to the
Juvenile Assessment Center in West Palm Beach for evaluation.
Records show his disabilities were not recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Youth acts in a normal manner,'' a caseworker wrote on an
evaluation form.
</P>
<P>
   Even had his handicaps been noted, Laster's fate likely still
would have been driven by the system's reaction to the serious
charges against him. A juvenile court judge by law had to score him
at 12 points on a risk assessment scale _ all of them coming from
the strong arm robbery count _and ordered him detained. A score of
11 or less would have allowed him to be released or monitored at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Though prosecutors could find no previous criminal record, the
allegations by Laster's classmate were enough to send him to the
Juvenile Detention Center.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 22, Krischer filed to have the case moved to adult court
and on Christmas Eve, Laster made his first appearance there.
County Judge Barry Cohen set his bond at $5,000, the statutory
minimum for the felony charges. Court records show the issue of
Laster's competence was raised at least briefly during the
appearance, which came during a mass hearing in which many other
defendants were called.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Laster said the family was telephoned by
juvenile-justice officials and told of her brother's arrest the day
after he was removed from the school. But it took weeks for the
family to fully realize the depth of the trouble Tony was in. By
then he was being held in the juvenile section of the Palm Beach
County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 20, Carolyn Laster paid $500 to bail her brother out. To
free him, she used the inheritance left him by his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody took a good close look at this kid or the family
situation,'' said John Walsh, an attorney with the Palm Beach
County Legal Aid Society who was assigned to the case Jan. 22 by
Circuit Judge Edward Garrison. ``What went drastically wrong was
the state attorney made a misinformed decision on this child.''
</P>
<P>
   Another case, same boy?
</P>
<P>
   This week, Krischer's office found juvenile records that may
indicate another incident involving Laster. They show a teen-ager
with a similar name (Lester), different birthday but same address
was charged with retail theft last summer. The boy was accused of
stealing a $60 crucifix from Burdines. The case never went to
court, and Laster's attorneys remain unconvinced the offender was
their client.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an attempt by the state attorney to retroactively
justify their actions,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Laster said her brother has been traumatized by the
events of the past year. Four family members have died, and the
loss of his mother and grandfather have left him without adequate
supervision. Tony says he does not understand why he was put in
jail, or why he's being asked about the $2, or why reporters want
to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He cried a lot and told people he wanted to go home when he
was in jail,'' Carolyn Laster said. ``He wants to be on TV, but he
doesn't understand how much trouble he's really in. He says he does
not want to go back to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance Block, an attorney who has been on the ARC's board of
directors for 12 years, said he hopes the state attorney's office
will reevaluate its position. He said ARC has been asked by
prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges to intercede in past
cases and work to rehabilitate offenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole essence of criminal law is that there be intent and
an understanding of wrong,'' Block said. ``When you're dealing with
the mentally retarded, you have to step back and ask if they have
the same level of understanding. They are among the most vulnerable
in our society. This has been a gross overreaction and unjust all
the way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh and Gilliam will ask a judge at a March 8 hearing to
return the case to the juvenile courts. Laster is scheduled to be
tested by psychologists for competency before then, his IQ to be
measured once again. State attorney's office spokesman Edmondson
says his office's zero tolerance policy will remain in effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were truly a zero tolerance policy,'' Walsh said, ``they
wouldn't have enough state attorneys to prosecute every kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Oblivious to the legal arguments, Tony Laster is attending
classes again at Congress Middle School. His sister said he's
telling his friends to watch for him on TV.

 &HT;    The Queen of Diamonique
 &HT;    WITH SIDEBARS at end of file
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Kathy Levine recalls when a prankster
swiped the brass deer off the mantel of the original QVC set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything to make it a little different,'' jokes Levine, the
first host to appear on QVC's inaugural broadcast Nov. 24, 1986.
``The mantra back then was to keep everything the same day after
day so viewers would get used to us and feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, deer or no deer, viewers got comfortable _ and fast. Less
than five years later, QVC racked up 125,000 phone orders in one
day totaling $10.4 million. In one day.
</P>
<P>
   And these days, the home-shopping behemoth boasts more than $2
billion in sales a year (twice that of St. Petersburg-based Home
Shopping Network).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, in fact, set up for success,'' Levine says of the
cable network, created by Joseph Segel, founder of The Franklin
Mint. ``It had the proper backing financially, and timing was
perfect. If I hadn't been such a boob in the world, I'd have
thought about QVC's huge potential when I applied, but I wasn't
positioned that way mentally. I was just happy to have a job and be
on television for the first time in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine's mom, Pat, who lives in Palm Beach Gardens, was just as
joyous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there the night she opened, cheering her on,'' Pat says.
``When she called and said, `I auditioned for this dumb thing,
mother, and they called me back,' well, I popped every button! It's
so right for her.''
</P>
<P>
   So right because, as her mom says, ``Personality and humor are
Kathy's long suits.''
</P>
<P>
   That and her ability to yak ad nauseam about most anything _
from a cubic zirconium ring to a holiday figurine _ as phone orders
roll in at a rate of three calls per second.
</P>
<P>
   The first ``products'' she ever hawked, handed to Levine during
her impromptu audition in 1986, were a phone and pencil. There was
no prep time, no quiet moment to gather thoughts. The items were
thrust forth, and she was commanded to ``sell!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pencils are incredible because you can erase your mistakes,''
she improvised in front of a camera, yellow No. 2 in hand. ``And if
you get angry, you can break a pencil in two. Then you can give the
extra piece to a friend, making you resourceful ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Levine, then in sales at a Philadelphia hotel (``and hours from
getting fired''), responded to QVC's Help Wanted ad in The
Philadelphia Inquirer thinking she'd be a phone operator. But once
in the company's then-modest headquarters in West Chester, Pa.,
Levine _ egged on by a friend _ requested an audition.
</P>
<P>
   Just six weeks later, she was on-camera extolling the virtues of
a wet-dry vac.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Sears product because we needed a brand name to lend
credibility,'' she explains. ``I loved it! You could pick up baby
food or sawdust.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, QVC sells items from a mile-long list of major brands, plus
products endorsed by celebrities galore. Joan Rivers and Nolan
Miller (jewelry). Victoria Principal, Tova Borgnine and George
Hamilton (skin care/cosmetics). Diane Von Furstenberg, Delta Burke
and Bob Mackie (fashion). Richard Simmons, Denise Austin and Susan
Powter (fitness equipment). And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Other categories include electronics; cookware; housewares;
books; videos; music; and memorabilia/collectibles. (Although
people guess jewelry is QVC's top seller, it's actually
housewares.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when a vast number of companies wouldn't be
caught dead associating their names with us,'' says Levine, who has
a bachelor's degree in Spanish education from C.W. Post College in
New York. ``The most sophisticated evolution has been in marketing.
Now people are lining up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lining up because QVC is the mall that never closes. The network
broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week to 67 million homes.
There are 20 or so show hosts, who become loosely linked with the
products they sell most. For example, Levine and Diamonique, QVC's
cubic zirconium line that accounts for about $18 million in sales a
year. Jane Rudolph Treacy and sterling silver jewelry. Mary Beth
Roe and collectible dolls and teddy bears. Bob Bowersox and
anything in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   (Treacy, Bowersox and Levine, by the way, are the only remaining
original hosts out of 20.)
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Kauffman Levine _ who describes herself as a
``not-so-beautiful, not-so-brilliant, smart-ass Jewish girl from
Allentown, Pa.'' in her book, ``It's Better to Laugh'' _ is the
youngest of three kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two boys, so I was thrilled to finally get my little
girl,'' recalls Kathy's mom, Pat, an aspiring actress who ran a
charm school back in Allentown. Kathy's dad, Arnold Kauffman, who
died about a year ago, was a dentist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, her personality came through in a hurry.
Other mommies took their kids to Girl Scouts, but I had to keep
Kathy from eating the cookies. She was always popular but not
somebody's girlfriend. But she's developed into a stunning young
lady.''
</P>
<P>
   (Pat, by the way, is as chatty and quick to joke as a daughter.
When told the photos of her in Levine's book are gorgeous, she
replies, ``Oh my God, honey, everything's gone south since then!''
Pat and her second husband, Lee, once just seasonal residents of
Palm Beach County, came south for good in 1994.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, young Kathy battled weight and what she considered to be
a big nose (which she had fixed at 27). Those insecurities, though,
are part of what make her so appealing to viewers. Real folks can
relate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to be in a business where people are
perfect,'' says Levine, now in her mid-40s and a size 10. ``The
pressure, I realize, comes mostly from me. I'm much nicer when I'm
thin. But it's very hard to stand next to Susan Lucci, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Soap diva Lucci is just one of many celebs Levine meets on the
job. The host works most often, however, with comic Joan Rivers,
who sells a line of ``fashion'' jewelry. (Not costume jewelry, mind
you. Sure, it's the same thing, but ``fashion'' sounds, well, less
cheap.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of Levine's most memorable on-air moments was with
Rivers _ who's known for her candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was showing a ring and doing my spiel,'' Levine recalls,
``and I said something to the effect that the ring would be admired
even at a formal dinner party. I paused, and Joan said, `Have you
ever been at a formal dinner party when somebody farts?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it. And she just kept talking about it. I
doubled over in my chair laughing. I couldn't draw a breath. The
producer was screaming at me so loud the earpiece fell out.''
</P>
<P>
   (QVC hosts sport a little earpiece _ think Secret Service agent
_ so producers can feed them directions, product information and
updates. ``And you'll hear them order out for Chinese,'' Levine
jokes. ``You hear everything.'')
</P>
<P>
   There are no TelePrompTers in the studio; however, a caller's
name and hometown are displayed for the host. (``We were trained to
repeat names. People like that. We used to have to memorize
them.'')
</P>
<P>
   There's no makeup and hair team standing by (``we do our own'');
no dressing room with a star on the door (``are you kidding?''); no
car service like Katie Couric and Matt Lauer get each morning (``if
the weather's bad, they'll pick us up in the van''); and no free
clothes from publicity-seeking retailers (although they offer).
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd love for us to wear their clothes because I get mail
asking, `Where'd you get that jacket you wore last Thursday?'''
Levine says. ``But we get a wardrobe allowance and $10 a week for a
manicure. It amounts to about $3,000 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hosts earn between $50,000 and $100,000, she says, with yearly
bonuses based on QVC's sales (``no big shakes, but you can take
your kid to EPCOT'').
</P>
<P>
   Levine, who's divorced, has no kids (unless you count her
miniature schnauzer, Chelsea). She lives and loves her job, pals
around with other hosts and is currently taking flying lessons. She
isn't mobbed at the grocery store (``people do look'') and isn't
the least bit stuck up, although she's considered to be a pioneer
in her industry _ an industry that has revolutionized American
shopping. And an industry that has gained overwhelming respect
because of sales results and savvy marketing.
</P>
<P>
   QVC's faux fireplace of yore _ once home to a brass deer (``we
loved to knock `Bambi' off the mantel''), the occasional plastic
plant and other tchotchkes _ was recently replaced by a $100
million state-of-the-art broadcasting facility with six different
stages, including a two-story house.
</P>
<P>
   All flash aside, though, QVC hosts still hang out in the lounge
with curlers in their hair. And they still nosh in the cafeteria
with everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget that this is a retail operation,'' Levine says.
``What I do is really no different than working at
Bloomingdale's.''
</P>

<P>
   SO YOU WANT TO BE A QVC PHONE REP?
</P>
<P>
   On an average day, QVC receives about 233,000 calls (and you
thought your teen-ager tied up the line!). To help handle that
load, the retailer is opening a phone center in Port St. Lucie this
fall. Others are in San Antonio, Texas; Chesapeake, Va.; and West
Chester, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   John Hunter, QVC's senior vice president for customer services,
oversees phone reps, the company's vital link to viewers. He took a
moment while in Port St. Lucie recently to answer a few questions:
</P>
<P>
   1. How do you decide which calls go to which phone center? Is it
based on region?
</P>
<P>
   No, calls are distributed evenly to all three centers. For
example, the first might go to Texas, the next to Virginia, the
next to Pennsylvania, then back to Texas. There are people that
monitor this and route calls elsewhere if one center is
particularly busy. We have bilingual speakers in San Antonio, so we
route all bilingual calls there. We'll also be hiring bilingual
speakers in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   2. Do phone reps receive a discount on QVC merchandise?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, every employee _ whether full- or part-time _ gets a 30
percent discount on jewelry, 20 percent on electronics. Other
discounts range from 15 to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   3. Are reps paid on number of calls answered or whether the
customer places an order?
</P>
<P>
   No, they're paid by the hour, and there are incentives but not
what you'd call commissions. Incentives are based on quality of
service. (Most full-time workers in Port St. Lucie will earn
starting salaries of between $7 and $8 an hour, plus benefits of
about $4.15 an hour.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Does it matter if a rep has a strong regional accent (i.e.,
``Thank y'all for callin'!'')?
</P>
<P>
   That used to be a big thing but not anymore. At one time, you
had to sound sort of neutral, but now we look for people who can
articulate well and who are service oriented.
</P>
<P>
   5. Do reps mingle with hosts and corporate bigwigs at the
headquarters in West Chester?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, everybody's family regardless of what job you do at QVC. We
all eat in the same cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   6. Say a customer wants to go on and on about her grandchildren.
Or about his golf score. How are reps trained to get the order and
move on?
</P>
<P>
   That's part of ``call control.'' Once you feel the call's
getting off track, you have to graciously steer the person back to
the business at hand. But we don't rush people. If they mention the
Bronx, the rep might say, ``Oh, gee, you're from New York?'' and
make some small talk. Reps are trained to mirror the caller's
manner and pace. If someone wants to chat, the rep chats _ within
reason, of course. If someone sounds impatient, they know to take
the order quickly.
</P>
<P>
   7. How do reps decide what callers to put on the air?
</P>
<P>
   It's actually kind of random. They ask questions, like if the
caller's tried a certain product before or is a first-time
customer. If a certain product is airing and the producer wants
callers on that item, a flag will go up on everyone's computer
screen. They also try to make sure there are no babies screaming or
dogs barking in the background, that the customer's account is paid
up and that the person hasn't been on the air in the past 30 days.
Then the call is sent to a coordinator who sits with the producer.
</P>
<P>
   8. How can phone reps make sure someone isn't going to scream
something ludicrous on the air?
</P>
<P>
   They can't. The coordinator talks to the person to make sure
they're not a crackpot, but you can't always be 100 percent sure.
The host doesn't have any sort of ``panic button'' to push, but the
producer can disconnect the call. When that happens, the host
handles it by saying something like, ``Well, folks, that's live TV
for you!''
</P>
<P>
   9. Have the computers ever crashed, making it impossible for
reps to take orders?
</P>
<P>
   Way back in the early days, yes, but not anymore. That's why we
have phone centers in different areas of the country, in case of
power outages and whatnot. We can manually take orders if we have
to.
</P>
<P>
   10. Are calls monitored?
</P>
<P>
   Randomly, yes, and reps like this because of the coaching and
feedback. For example, we might say, ``That was a great call, but
I'd recommend you do such-and-such next time.'' It helps them
improve and feel like part of a team. Being a phone rep is more of
a personality type than an age group or education level. We've
pretty much said you have to have a high school diploma, but beyond
that, we're open. You do, though, have to enjoy dealing with people
_ lots of people.

 &HT;    Salt Lake goal: Forget scandal, ignite spirit
 &HT;    By Glenn Hannigan
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Frank Zang misses the simple joy of flipping
through the morning paper and sipping a cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   His quiet ritual has turned into a daily test of nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit,'' says Zang, a media representative for the
Salt Lake Olympic Committee, ``I cringe each morning when I walk
out to get my newspaper, thinking about what might be greeting
me.''
</P>
<P>
   He has plenty of company. The bloodletting has persisted for
months in Salt Lake, draining the city's Olympic joy drop by drop.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the 2002 Winter Games face each day with
apprehension, dreading a new allegation that will open fresh
wounds. The ongoing scandal, which has taken more agonizing turns
than the giant slalom course at Park City, has been excruciating
for a city that has exemplified the virtues of hard work and clean
living.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of celebrating the three-year milestone to the start of
the Games this past week, Salt Lake had to face a jarring 300-page
report that accuses top officials of making covert payments to
International Olympic Committee members, providing extravagant
gifts and trips and concealing their actions.
</P>
<P>
   In a week when the organizers expected to be hosting parties,
they instead were reeling from the recent resignation of the SLOC's
two top officers. On Thursday, the SLOC hired Mitt Romney to take
over the beleaguered organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of humbling to deal with in Salt Lake,'' said
Margaret Adams, who manages the historic Beehive House, the former
residence of Brigham Young. ``We're very disappointed by the
activity of some of the Olympic leadership. We know it's going to
take a lot of work to restore our integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest Olympic scandal in history began in November, when
allegations arose of scholarship payments made by Salt Lake
organizers to family members of IOC officials. That rumor quickly
snowballed from a regional ripple into an international avalanche
as accusations surfaced that IOC members accepted large cash
payments, lavish gifts, college tuition, Super Bowl excursions,
European vacations and free medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Since the IOC launched an internal investigation, nine members
have resigned or been expelled, but that number is likely to
increase as investigators review allegations raised in the Salt
Lake report, and an additional report from Nagano, site of the 1998
Winter Games. Japanese officials have said that nine IOC members
might have broken rules during visits to Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney, which will host the 2000 Summer Games, also has come
under scrutiny, but was cleared by the IOC after an internal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, organizers of the '96 Summer Games have consistently
denied any wrongdoing in their bid efforts. But this past week,
Atlanta Olympic chief Billy Payne was confronted with a memo he
wrote to a top aide in 1990, suggesting they consider providing a
college scholarship, plane tickets and medical treatment for IOC
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was continually thinking out loud about things which might
have made a difference in our campaign,'' Payne explained. ``None
of these directives were ever seriously discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Salt Lake has graduated from the suspicion phase to a state
of full-blown scandal and disgrace _ and everyone here wants to
know when the hemorrhaging will stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the peak of this story a couple weeks ago, I was fielding
more than 100 calls a day from all over the world,'' Zang says.
``I'll be grateful when it slows down. Every day I just try to look
at it as though we're one step closer to the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of Games? USOC officials have expressed concern
over the potential fallout if corporate and public confidence in
the Olympics is shaken. Last week, for example, David D'Alessandro,
president and chief operations officer of John Hancock insurance,
said his company was canceling negotiations with NBC for $20
million in ads to protest the IOC's failure to deal with the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published in the Deseret News of Salt Lake City last week
found that 72 percent of respondents are worried about the SLOC's
ability to secure adequate funding because of concerns expressed by
corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   And Salt Lake City still must find a substantial number of
sponsors to meet its $1.45 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have every confidence that people of Salt Lake will return
the reputation and dignity of the Olympics,'' says Payne, who was
successful in raising $1.7 billion to pay for the Atlanta Games.
``The power of the Olympic movement is far stronger than the
misdeeds of any small group of people. The goodwill and the spirit
of the people are 100 times more important than the leadership of
any organization.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Payne's belief that the same force that pulled the Atlanta
Games from its darkest hour _ the bombing at Centennial Olympic
Park _ has the power to do the same for Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our volunteers who rekindled the spirit of Atlanta,''
Payne says. ``After the tragedy of the park bombing, we weren't
sure what to do. I remember standing on my office balcony after the
bombing, privately grieving and not knowing whether we should
postpone the Games or not. It was the most difficult time of my
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``In just six hours, we had competition scheduled at the World
Congress Center. We knew if the volunteers didn't begin showing up
at 7 a.m., we couldn't continue the Games. We realized people were
going to be waking up, hear the news of the bombing, and possibly
get scared off.''
</P>
<P>
   That morning, with the future of the '96 Games on the line,
Payne walked toward the World Congress Center to thank whoever
showed up and try to rally them on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volunteers were scheduled to gather in the big Murphy
ballroom. I had no idea what to expect when I walked in at 7 a.m.
...'' Payne's voice breaks, recalling the scene. ``I still get
emotional when I think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were twice as many volunteers in that room as were
scheduled to show up. It was incredible. I've made speeches about
that moment _ the one time I was supposed to be a leader and I
ended up being inspired by them. The people took the bombing
personally. They decided they would not allow it to diminish their
Games. The people of Atlanta turned our greatest tragedy into our
biggest triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the circumstances have little in common, Payne believes
the people of Salt Lake will ultimately decide the fate of their
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of folks in Utah feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can always weed out corrupt people from any
organization,'' says Curt Daems of Layton, Utah. ``That has nothing
to do with me or the people of Salt Lake. The challenge will be for
us to bring the enthusiasm back. I absolutely love Salt Lake City
and I'm committed to supporting this Olympic effort. Most of the
people I've talked with feel the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Daems is one of about 8,000 Olympic volunteers in and around
Salt Lake. The SLOC anticipates needing 15,000-18,000 volunteers
for the Games. At the peak of the 1996 Olympics, Atlanta needed
47,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Eynon, the SLOC's senior vice president for human resources,
says he's been ``surprised and thrilled'' by the response from
Utahns eager to volunteer. ``The magic of the Games is so powerful
it can blow through turmoil,'' Eynon says. ``Knock on wood, all
this negative news hasn't impacted the support we've been getting.
I think most people believe that after the scandal has run its
course, there will still be a spectacular Olympics to host.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne agrees: ``There's not a single day that someone doesn't
tell me how important the Olympic experience was for them. I have
received around 60,000 personal letters since the end of the Games
from people who wanted to share their stories. When you see how
everyone comes together for this event _ the miracle of people from
different cultures interacting _ it gives you hope for the world.''

 &HT;    Fla. study suggests funds from tobacco deal should target
elderly care, research
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Smokers go into nursing homes sooner and
die there younger than nonsmokers, but those who survive stay
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Those effects add up to more than $103 million a year in
smoking-related costs to Florida's Medicaid system, says a study by
a state and university research team.
</P>
<P>
   The study's principal author says it reinforces the need to
spend more of Florida's $12.7 billion tobacco lawsuit settlement
money on care for the elderly and research on preventive treatment
for smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clearly demonstrates they have needs that are
smoking-attriubtable and that are beyond the needs of nonsmokers,''
said economist Tim Lynch, director of Florida State University's
Center for Economic Forecasting and Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch teamed with Dr. Richard Hopkins, chief of epidemiology at
the Florida Department of Health, to study nursing home residents
in 11 counties, the largest being Pinellas, Palm Beach and Broward.
They finished the two-year project in January, working under a
$100,000 grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch and Hopkins concluded that if the smokers had had the same
average length of stay as nonsmokers, it would have amounted to
10,781 fewer days for the year. That would have equaled more than
7.2 percent of the $1.4 billion in Medicaid spending on nursing
home care in 1997.

<P>
   COXNET FOCUS 0212: In a move expected to spark a new partisan
battle in Congress, President Clinton wants the federal government
to authorize $22 billion in bonds to build new schools and repair
old ones, issuing tax credits to those who buy them. The debate on
school construction also is being fueled by a 1996 federal report
that showed 60 percent of American schools need significant
repairs. (Monroe, Cox Washington Bureau)
</P>
<P>
   w/DREAM SCHOOL _ As politicians debate federal support for
school construction and renovation, Missouri is just one of several
states creating a new generation of improved learning environments
for students. (Monroe, Cox Washington Bureau)

   IMPEACHMENT FOLLOWUPS
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-NEXT _ WASHINGTON _ Now that the impeachment cloud has
been lifted, how effectively can President Clinton govern? He'll be
a lame-duck president facing an opposition-led Congress, and his
poll numbers may drop without anti-impeachment sentiment to prop
them up. Still, Clinton may find politically bruised Republicans
willing to meet him more than halfway on policy. (Deans, Cox News
Service). MOVED

<P>
   GINGRICH-LEGACY _ Although Newt Gingrich tried to distance
himself from it at the end, the failed impeachment effort is the
last legacy of his tenure as speaker. But the ex-speaker is already
making good progress in leaving the whole mess behind. (Sherman,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   BLACKWHITE-JASPER _ On a lonely stretch of road outside the
EastTexas town of Jasper, a black man dies a mysterious death late
one night. His broken body is found in a ditch. The suspects are a
couple of young white men in a pick-up. The black man's family
believes the white men lured him to the fog-shrouded road so they
could castrate him and beat him. Jasper, Texas 1998? No, it all
happened in 1977, a bigoted time when a black teen in East Texas
could lose his life for dating a white girl and no one would be
punished. We trace the modern history of East Texas race relations
through the Peacock family, a mother, father and five surviving
children who are still emotionally wounded by the death of
18-year-old Anthony Peacock on an isolated road near Jasper.
Through their personal experiences, we document the moral shadow
dance between whites and blacks in a part of Texas that still
carries vestiges of the Old South. Advances beginning of trial
testimony, scheduled to begin Tuesday. (Gamino, Austin
American-Statesman).

<P>
   BUSH-IMPEACH _ AUSTIN _ The impeachment is over. Bill Clinton is
still in office, to the chagrin of many Republicans. Yet, a
Republican with possible designs on the office, Gov. George W.
Bush, has stayed way out of the fray. Why? How has that helped/hurt
him? How has the impeachment affected the timing of his
announcement for the office? Will the GOP experience with Clinton
inoculate Bush against prying into his ``young and irresponsible''
days? Or will it redouble efforts to dig up dirt on him? A look at
how impeachment politics intersects with presidential politics in
2000. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman).

   SALTLAKE _ SALT LAKE CITY _ Frank Zang misses the simple joy of
flipping through the morning paper and sipping a cup of coffee. His
quiet ritual has turned into a daily test of nerves. ``I have to
admit,'' says Zang, a media representative for the Salt Lake
Olympic Committee, ``I cringe each morning when I walk out to get
my newspaper, thinking about what might be greeting me.'' Zang has
plenty of company. The bloodletting has persisted for months in
Salt Lake, threatening to sap the color from city's Olympic facade,
drip by drip. The ongoing Olympic scandal has been excruciating for
a city that has historically extolled the virtues of hard work and
clean living. Instead of celebrating the three-year milestone to
the start of the Games this week, Salt Lake has had to face a
jarring 300-page report that accuses top officials of making covert
payments to IOC members, providing extravagant gifts and trips,
then concealing their actions. (Hannigan, Atlanta

   MENTALLY-DISABLED-JAILED _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ With an IQ of
58 and the functional capability of a 5-year-old, Tony Laster
cannot comprehend the legal thinking that put him behind bars for
seven weeks for stealing $2 from an eighth-grade classmate. Laster
is not alone in this. Defense attorneys and advocates for the
mentally retarded say they can't comprehend it either. State
Attorney Barry Krischer's ``zero tolerance'' policy for school
crimes is itself being judged by the treatment given Laster, a
hearing-impaired 15-year-old who is not able to remember an address

   SMOKE-FUNDS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Smokers go into nursing
homes sooner and die there younger than nonsmokers, but those who
survive stay longer. Those effects add up to more than $103 million
a year in smoking-related costs to Florida's Medicaid system, says
a study by a state and university research team. The study's
principal author says it reinforces the need to spend more of
Florida's $12.7 billion tobacco lawsuit settlement money on care
for the elderly and research on preventive treatment for smokers.

   WWII-MERCHANTMARINE _ BRUNSWICK, Ga. _ It was the middle of the
night of April 8, 1942 when a gigantic explosion shook this port
town and lit up the black Atlantic sky like the Fourth of July.
John Henderson, then 11 and now a physician, remembers it well. A
German submarine had just torpedoed the USS Oklahoma, killing 22
men. All of the bodies were identified, except four that were
burned beyond recognition. Now, a Brunswick group made up of former
Merchant Marine sailors has finally identified the four, and is
raising money for a bigger monument to mark their common grave.
Rep. Jack Kingston is trying to have the four awarded the
Distinguished Service Medal, and helping the Brunswick group track
down relatives of the long-dead sailors. It's a little known fact
about World War II that the Merchant Marine suffered more
casualties, per capita, than any other branch of service. It's
little known for a reason - Washington didn't want the public to
know that 10 times the number of ships sunk at Pearl Harbor went
down within sight of East Coast cities - several near Brunswick.
We'll tell the story of these men, what happened to them, talk to
people who remember hearing the explosion, and others, to Merchant
Marine vets who are now demanding their due. Illustrate with photo
of a small marker, headlines from the Brunswick papers, photos of
the site where this ship went down, etc. Hopefully we will have
mugs of the four men, now that they have been identified. And we'll
try to talk to members of their families who were simply told their
loved ones had been lost at sea. (Hendrick, Atlanta

his records (and his manager) die, Cyrus also soared into
depression, retreated into his teepee on his farm, and did some
soul searching. This year, he emerged from the isolation with a

POLICE SLAYING CASTS CLOUD OF FEAR OVER AFRICANS IN NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story has been added to Page One; See also

 (bl)  
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The glow from the Farafina Coffee Shop on West 116th
Street one evening last week was warm, the smell of frying fish and
fufu sweetly familiar, the conversation among the West African men
gathered inside easy. But as the large television broadcast yet
another report about the police shooting of Amadou Diallo, an
immigrant from Guinea, the feeling was sour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are afraid, we are afraid,'' said Silla Sidique, 35, a
Guinean businessman who lives in Harlem. He nodded as Mamoudou
Jawara, 30, also a Guinean businessman, described being repeatedly
stopped by the police near his Staten Island home, asked for his
license, and occasionally told by officers to ``go back to
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go back before somebody kills me,'' said Sidique,
who has been in the country a year.
</P>
<P>
   For Africans, particularly West Africans, Diallo's death has
only reinforced the vulnerability they feel as black immigrants in
New York City. They left a continent where they were a racial
majority _ where divisions were based on class or politics or tribe
but rarely on skin color _ for a country where they are a minority
and where, they say, race matters all too much.
</P>
<P>
   And the fatal shooting of Diallo on Feb. 4 has highlighted their
insularity, living in but not necessarily assimilating in a country
they view with caution. Like many West Indians, they have chosen to
remain largely apart from African-Americans here, although Diallo's
shooting shows signs of forging bonds between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   Many African immigrants say that whether they stay here for two
or 20 years, Africa is, and always will be, home.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more are coming to New York City than ever. From 1990 to
1996, the number of sub-Saharan Africans here nearly doubled, to
about 84,000 from 44,000, said Dr. Andrew Beveridge, a professor of
sociology at Queens College. Most are from West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   By the 2000 census, Beveridge said, the official count will
exceed 100,000 _ and the real count will probably be higher.
Compared with other groups, like Dominicans, whose numbers will
most likely pass 500,000 in the next census, their numbers are
still small, but their presence is becoming visible.
</P>
<P>
   It is most notable in the restaurants and businesses and mosques
lining West 116th Street, but also in scattered pockets around the
city, from Morris Heights in the Bronx to Clifton on Staten Island
to Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The Africans arriving are diverse in origin and language and
religion, and in station and aspiration. While Nigerians and
Ghanaians remain the most numerous among sub-Saharan African groups
in the city, many new arrivals are, like Diallo, from Francophone
West Africa, and many, like him, are Muslim. They greet one another
softly with ``Bon soir'' or ``Salaam aleikum,'' or in African
dialects like Fulani.
</P>
<P>
   The common perception of Africa as a desperate continent,
bleeding from wounds of war and poverty, would suggest that its
inhabitants are equally desperate to escape it. Many are. But
others are well-educated, and often have relatively good jobs in
their homeland. They simply want to see if there is something
better beyond their country's borders, and many crave more
education than Africa can offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason most Africans leave to come here is not different
from the reasons any European leaves for _ for education, upward
mobility, to maintain their family, to start as an entrepreneur,''
said Sidique Abubakarr Wai, the president of the United African
Congress, one of the many groups that the African diaspora has
created in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As with countless other immigrants, many Africans say that what
they find here is far from what they expected. ``Everyone thinks
America is like `Dallas,' '' Dame Babou, a Senegalese immigrant who
is the host of a radio show broadcast here and in Dakar, said of
the television show that has given people around the world a false
picture of lavish American wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, then, interviews with more than 100 Africans
around the city suggest a profound ambivalence about America: they
cherish its economic opportunity, its political freedom and its
education system, but they dislike its racism and its violence, and
they disdain its values.
</P>
<P>
   Historically negligible, the number of Africans in New York
began to increase in the 1980s as a result of drought, inflation
and repression in Africa. In 1986, several thousand Africans were
granted amnesty, enabling relatives to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this decade, the government significantly expanded the
number of visas available to Africans through a federal lottery
system, with the number allotted to Africa increasing to 30,514 in
fiscal year 1997 from 11,571 in 1993. Continuing unrest in
countries like Sierra Leone and Liberia has brought still more
Africans, many of whom have been granted asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Many Africans come to study, often at community colleges,
usually majoring in practical subjects like accounting. Often, they
will work 40 hours a week to pay costly foreign-student fees. Like
many immigrants, they see education as the path to upward mobility.
</P>
<P>
   With limited higher education in most of Africa, New York can
seem like an academic candy store. Maurice Ojuang, 33, a Kenyan,
earned two degrees in computer science, and is working toward a
Ph.D. at Lehman College.
</P>
<P>
   But to feed his mind and his family, Ojuang spends 40 hours a
week in the underbelly of New York, managing a residential
hotel-cum-city-shelter on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx. The
owner has been good to him, he said, but the job has few charms.
Last week, he worked the front desk as residents demanded new rooms
or televisions or repairs, heaping expletive-laced abuse on a stoic
Ojuang, who sat in a locked room behind a glass partition in a
pressed shirt and tie.
</P>
<P>
   Such days are one reason Ojuang said he despises New York, which
he thought would be ``halfway on my way to heaven.'' Instead, he
said, it has become two-thirds of the way to hell. But having given
up a solid job back home and raising a family in New York, he is
still here 10 years later, still dreaming of home.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who come are young men, often living three or four
or eight to an apartment, much as Diallo did. Many, largely from
Senegal, but also from numerous other West African countries,
become peddlers, or taxi drivers, working for a few years, living a
spartan existence, sending money home, and then returning there
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, more Africans are staying longer in New York,
driven by growing economic pressures back home. Many are starting
small businesses, like restaurants or groceries offering African
products, in a sign that Africans are putting down roots.
</P>
<P>
   They have also started small import-export businesses, making
them bicontinental merchants who leverage American dollars for
African products. The building at 1225 Broadway, near West 30th
Street, for example, is a vertical bazaar, floor after floor filled
almost entirely with African small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some African immigrants, particularly those from
English-speaking countries like Nigeria or Gambia, are getting jobs
in the city bureaucracy, as their Francophone counterparts,
hindered by a lack of English, watch their ascendancy toward the
middle class.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of commitment to longer-term stays, the last six
years have seen more men bringing over their wives. And many single
men are going home for ``vacation'' and returning with a wife.
</P>
<P>
   But that creates complications, said Babou, the radio host.
Often, the couples barely know each other. Many men do not take
well to their wives having to work. And many women balk at the
discrepancy between the image of America that their suitors painted
and the reality. Quite a few marriages end, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women who come work in the hair-braiding salons
sprinkled across the city. Some women are even coming on their own,
to study as well as to work.
</P>
<P>
   More children are also in the mix, although the city's schools
still have fewer than 5,000 sub-Saharan African students, according
to the Board of Education. But how, and where, to raise children is
also a contentious topic among Africans, many of whom believe any
educational advantages America offers their children may be wiped
out by the corrosion of African values.
</P>
<P>
   Africans are strict disciplinarians; children are raised to be
polite, to respect their fellow human beings and to obey their
parents, said David Udotong Jr. 33, a Nigerian immigrant. American
children, in contrast, ``are very wild,'' he said, and African
parents must constantly battle their influence.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, many families decide to leave their children in
Africa with grandparents or other family members.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Weah, 22, who fled the civil war in Liberia and received
asylum here, said he watched his younger brother fall into a bad
crowd of American teen-agers in Clifton on Staten Island. He became
hostile, Weah said, then was arrested for shoplifting, and is now
in a group home.
</P>
<P>
   Weah's neighborhood is home to both Africans and
African-Americans, but he himself does not mix with his American
neighbors. Barriers of language and culture keep the groups apart,
although there is some intermarriage, and many Africans say they
keep to themselves out of fear of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Some Africans simply fear that mixing with the melting pot that
is New York will mean subjugating their culture.
</P>
<P>
   Eugenie, 32, a graphic designer from the Ivory Coast, who would
not give her last name, said her husband has been here for 15
years, but ``he's still pretty much an African.'' They work to keep
it that way _ they eat African food, listen to African music and
the French news, shop at African stores. ``We are trying to keep
that side of us that we think is the best,'' said Eugenie, who
joined her husband here two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Another way many Africans maintain their cultural ties is
through religion _ whether they are Roman Catholics, or Seventh-day
Adventists, or Pentecostalists, or, in large numbers, Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Most West Africans are Muslims, and they cling to their faith
here, saying it encourages them to work hard and live cleanly.
Around 5:30 each day, livery cabs pull up to mosques around the
city, and men trickle out of nearby apartment buildings, responding
to the call to prayer, many wearing traditional African dress.
</P>
<P>
   Various Islamic groups and African leaders also organize
material support as well as a spiritual anchor for immigrants who
are sick or unemployed. ``We practice `African socialism,' '' said
Demba Sanyang, a Gambian who works for the city's criminal justice
office. ``We must take care of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that means helping to pay the way home for those who
have lost either hope, or their lives, here. Many say they have had
to ship home too many compatriots, slain while driving the livery
cabs so essential to their livelihood. Since 1986, more than 50
West African cabdrivers have been killed, West African groups say.
America is far more violent than many Africans expected. Some, like
Weah, left strife-torn countries, only to find themselves in
neighborhoods where shots still ring out. ``I ran from gunshots. I
come here _ the gunshots are very scary,'' he said of his
neighborhood. ``Most of the time I stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Africans say this has become their new home,
preferring its abundant strengths and weaknesses to the lacks _ of
opportunity, freedom and food _ in their native land. Tunde
Babwale, 40, a Nigerian who works as an operating-room technician,
and is a U.S. citizen who served in the Army, said the Diallo case
had only cemented his determination to become a lawyer and remain
politically active here.
</P>
<P>
   But many others say that America is a utilitarian stop until
they can return home. They do not want to grow old in a country
where they say the young do not respect the old.
</P>
<P>
   And for many Africans in New York, and perhaps America, the
Diallo shooting has scraped against old uncertainties, and bred new
ones. Many say they will reserve judgment, but they believe that
Diallo may have been shot because he was black.
</P>
<P>
   Tingah Mohammed, a 49-year-old Ghanaian who has been here 15
years, said he had never heard of racism until he came here. He
recalled walking late one night down a TriBeCa street, and seeing a
white woman begin to run. She hid behind a rubbish heap. She was
afraid, he realized, of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I nearly cried,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Dr. Balde Ngere immigrated to the United States
from France, where he had immigrated from Guinea. In Guinea, he
said, he had fled a government that cared little for political
freedom or ending poverty. But the racism in France was so bad, he
said, that it was no place for an African.
</P>
<P>
   Now his friend Amadou Diallo has been killed by the police in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where,'' he asked, ``do we go now?''

<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ From the plush conference room with
teakwood panels to the rich coffee served in china cups, the
Malaysian Central Bank was determined to make the right impression
on the foreign fund managers it had invited to a recent briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia wanted them to bring their capital back to the country,
the bank officials told the group. They understood if the investors
were still angry at Malaysia for imposing strict controls on
foreign investment last September. But the rules had since been
relaxed, they said. Malaysia was ready for business.
</P>
<P>
   The one word the Malaysian bankers did not utter was ``Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Five months after Malaysia incurred global opprobrium by closing
off its currency and capital markets, its officials are in no mood
to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Far from wrecking the Malaysian economy, they say, the
isolationist strategy has stabilized the country and put it on the
road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   By suspending trading of the Malaysian ringgit and fixing its
exchange rate to the U.S. dollar, the government was able to lower
interest rates and ward off speculators.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, Malaysia's exports and foreign reserves have
increased, consumer confidence has flickered back to life, and the
country has escaped the violent social unrest of its neighbor,
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is responding to what we have done,'' said Finance
Minister Daim Zainuddin. ``People are comfortable. They say things
are predictable. To us, that's a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Daim has little patience for foreigners who tell him that
Malaysia has committed economic heresy. ``They're entitled to their
opinion,'' he said with a shrug. ``Either they invest here or they
don't. If they prove us wrong, we look stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's experiment has not spawned imitators. Brazil, which
fell into its currency crisis after Malaysia had begun reaping
benefits from the policy, has kept its markets open.
</P>
<P>
   And not all of Malaysia's economic indicators point to recovery.
According to government statistics, foreign investors are pouring
an average of $1 billion a month into Korea and $500 million a
month into Thailand. Malaysia has not issued recent numbers, but
economists say it is getting only a fraction of that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, government officials, academics and business leaders here
relish the fact that Malaysia has avoided the prophecies of doom
made by the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. Treasury
Department and other critics of capital controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were seen as having done something very naughty,'' said
Francis Yeoh, a Malaysian-Chinese industrialist and one of the
nation's richest men. He predicted that ``pragmatism and greed''
would eventually overcome foreign fury at Malaysia for its actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, the fury flows in both directions. Malaysia's
irascible 73-year-old prime minister and unchallenged leader,
Mahathir Mohamad, blames the West in general, and George Soros in
particular, for precipitating the Asian crisis. He once said a
cabal of mainly Jewish currency traders had destroyed Asian
countries by speculating against their currencies and forcing them
to deplete their reserves.
</P>
<P>
   To many Malaysians, it seems unjust that Mahathir reaps
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mahathir and Soros both support regulating hedge funds,'' Yeoh
said, adding that in the eyes of the world ``one is a heretic and
one is a guru.''
</P>
<P>
   But the world has also been troubled by Mahathir's crackdown on
political opponents. On Sept. 2, the day after he imposed capital
controls, Mahathir ousted his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, who had
opposed the policies. When the prime minister threw Anwar in jail
on lurid corruption and sex-related charges, it ignited the largest
street protests in Malaysia in decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign investors don't give much importance to human
rights,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, a professor of political science
at the University of Malaya. ``But they should be concerned about
the Anwar episode, because it has implications for Malaysia's
short-term and long-term stability.''
</P>
<P>
   When Malaysia imposed its controls, the government declared that
foreign capital could not be withdrawn from country for 12 months.
The goal was to punish speculators and other short-term investors.
But people who invest for the long term felt like they were being
held hostage, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``What right do they have to confiscate people's capital?''
asked Bill Kaye, a fund manager at the Pacific Group in Hong Kong.
``If you're an attractive place to invest, why do you need to do
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Malaysia lifted the ban on repatriating capital
and replaced it with an exit tax that encourages investors to leave
their funds in the country for more than a year. The change
mollified a few investors, but not Kaye. ``Most people just want to
get their money out,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Malaysia says its economic future does not depend on foreign
investors. By fixing its currency at a time when other Asian
currencies are rising, Malaysia is suddenly very competitive. Its
total exports rose 18 percent in the first 11 months of 1998,
compared with all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends the new stability has cheered consumers.
Monthly car sales rose from 12,000 to 19,000 between September and
November. Unlike Indonesia, Malaysia does not feel like a country
in the grip of recession. Bars and restaurants in the capital are
crowded and the streets are choked with lines of orderly traffic.
</P>
<P>
   If the government had allowed the ringgit to erode in value,
Daim said, it would have driven up the price of food, which could
have set off widespread riots.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters angry over Anwar's arrest ``tried to imitate the
Indonesians,'' the finance minister said. ``But Malaysians by
nature understand that it is not going to solve any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the controls restored order to Malaysia's storm-tossed
currency. Companies like Dell Computer, which owns a manufacturing
plant in Penang and does most of its business in local currency,
found the fixed exchange rate made it easier to do business, said
Mark Stevens, corporate vice president of Dell's Asia Pacific
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Daim vowed that Malaysia would not float the ringgit until the
international financial community agreed to regulate hedge funds
and currency traders. ``If banks can be regulated, why can't
currency traders?'' he said. ``If stockbrokers can be regulated,
why can't currency traders?''

   TBILISI, Georgia _ Dato stood ramrod straight _ all four feet of
him _ discarded his considerable shyness, then defined proper
battlefield behavior: ``When we are defending our land, we should
not forget to remain just.''
</P>
<P>
   His classmate, Gyorgy, spoke up. ``If we ever appear in a war
zone,'' he declared, ``we know we should take care of people,
especially the wounded, and bring them to the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Tbilisi Public School 76, where 30 sixth grade
students are taking a course this year in the international rules
of war, with an emphasis on sparing the wounded, not executing
prisoners and respecting civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Devised by the International Committee of the Red Cross, it is
an emblem of the ferocity of the civil wars that have followed the
collapse of Communism and an experiment in preventing war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The course reflects the sober realization of humanitarian groups
that work day after day in the world's numerous war zones that
ethnic hostility has defied exhaustive mediation efforts. The
Geneva-based Red Cross, which has lost 12 of its own workers to the
murderous conflicts in the former Soviet Union, is addressing the
next generation with the message, ``This is if it does happen,''
said Guy Mellet, the Red Cross delegate in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to insure that ``the future elite of these countries
have knowledge that international humanitarian law exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is an apt spot for the trial. Since the 1991 Soviet
breakup lifted the harsh rule that suppressed ethnic rivalries and
nationalism, it is one of many former Soviet battlegrounds _
Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan, Chechnya _ rent by death and
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   As Georgian nationalism rose in this traditionally fractious
Caucasus republic, two of its regions _ Abkhazia and South Ossetia
_ tried to break away. By 1994, the toll of both wars was about
135,000 dead in a population of 5.5 million, more than one million
homeless, thousands of square miles of homes burned down to prevent
the return of rival ethnic groups and the virtual secession of
large chunks of Georgia's territory.
</P>
<P>
   The killing and bombardment of neighbor by neighbor tore at the
fabric of ethnic ties so violently that tradition would demand
blood revenge for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, from specially prepared booklets, 2.6 million 11- and
12-year-olds in Georgia, in neighboring Armenia and Azerbaijan, in
Uzbekistan and in Russia are taught the spirit of accords like the
Geneva Convention. While central to contemporary Western conduct of
war, few people in less peaceful parts of the world read or even
know about such accords.
</P>
<P>
   While mouthing the phrases about respecting certain conventions
in war, the pupils of Tbilisi School 76 are as robustly determined
as their parents, for example, that the breakaway region of
Abkhazia, a semitropical strip of resorts and mountains along the
Black Sea, belongs in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Abkhaz have long held otherwise, giving voice to
their discontent even in Soviet times. In 1993, fighting claimed
10,000 lives. Backed by Russian troops sent by hard-liners in
Moscow, the Abkhaz expelled Georgian forces and drove 260,000
civilians from home.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, mediation backed by the United Nations broke down when
the Abkhaz, asserting potential and actual terrorism, forced out
some 40,000 Georgians who had returned to homes abandoned in the
earlier war.
</P>
<P>
   In this Tbilisi school, traditional Georgian literature is used
as the vehicle to preach peace, or at least civil conduct during
war.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent day, the sixth graders discussed ``Mirandukht,'' a
story by a Georgian writer, Revaz Inanishvili. The main character
is a young girl who stands up for an elderly woman who is about to
be cheated by a rapacious butcher and who ends up befriending and
transforming him into an honest man.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, Khahuti Khvedelidze, uses the story to ask students
how they would solve the conflict with Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
   A chorus of voices suggests approaches ranging from, ``We should
forgive them and become friends,'' to speaking a common language or
``Get back our land in a peaceful way.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news from the session was that no one suggested
resorting to violence. But there is no guarantee that these
children will grow up to find a peaceful way to settle undoubted
territorial disputes.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Khvedelidze suggested that the very absence of the
Communist clamps that suppressed and distorted national feelings
across the Soviet Union and its satellite states may give grounds
for hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very good children,'' she said. ``They are freer
than we were.''

 JORDANIANS HOPE CONDOLENCES TURN INTO TANGIBLE AID

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ After a week that brought the death of King Hussein and
the crowning of his son as successor, Jordanians are hoping that
the overwhelming solidarity shown in response to their trauma will
prove to be more than passing.
</P>
<P>
   In the sadness prompted by the king's death, world leaders and
fellow members of the Hashemite family alike have pledged support
for King Abdullah, first at Monday's vast state funeral and then in
the days of mourning that followed.
</P>
<P>
   But what is important now, Jordanians and diplomats in the
region say, is that those pledges be made tangible. Jordan is now
led by a 37-year-old ruler who has little experience of power,
while a heavy debt burden has cast a shadow over a hoped-for
economic revival, and tensions within the royal family still have
the prospect to become a troublesome distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Abdullah is on more solid ground than his father was in
1952,'' a former Jordanian Cabinet minister said, in a reference to
the year that Hussein took power, at a time of turmoil in the Arab
world. ``But it's certainly shaky in some respects.''
</P>
<P>
   Another former minister offered this assessment when asked about
the young man who was thrust into his position as next in line to
the throne only in the final weeks of his father's life: ``He's not
incapable. But he needs plenty of counsel and advice, and he's also
going to need some outside help.''
</P>
<P>
   By nearly every account, where Jordan is most vulnerable is in
its economy, already suffering from high unemployment, low growth
and facing more than $8 billion in debt, an amount greater than its
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   There had been worries that nervousness over Hussein's death
could set off a crippling run on Jordan's currency, the dinar. For
now, an American promise to speed payments of millions of dollars
in economic aid to the kingdom appears to have averted that danger,
said diplomats in the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the diplomats say that Jordan, an important stabilizing
force in the Middle East, remains in urgent need of relief _
perhaps through the rescheduling of hundreds of millions of dollars
in debt owed this year to Japan and Europe, or, preferably, through
forgiveness, a step embraced by the United States in 1994, when it
wiped away $700 million in Jordanian debt.
</P>
<P>
   Another hope that has been rekindled in Jordan is the prospect
that Saudi Arabia or Kuwait might revive old generosities. Before
the Persian Gulf War of 1991, those countries provided both aid and
employment to Jordan, but both streams were all but eliminated as
punishment for Hussein's tilt to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the funeral and afterward, Saudi and Kuwaiti
leaders have spoken of Jordan with fresh warmth. Diplomats in the
region are watching closely to see if those remarks translate into
any fresh sharing of wealth, although the Persian Gulf states may
be less giving now because of depressed oil prices and their own
economic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   A more distant but no less troublesome challenge for Jordan
could come in relations with the Palestinians. On Friday, the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, in a surprise move, offered what
he portrayed as a goodwill gesture to Abdullah, saying that the
Palestinians would welcome a future confederation with Jordan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such an arrangement could bring economic benefits, but it might
also carry political problems for Jordan, whose population already
includes a large Palestinian majority. If a confederation were
forged, Jordanians would become a much smaller minority, something
that could add to the prospect of internal instability.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan itself, what many citizens have been watching most
intently is a drama unfolding in the royal family, which is still
recovering from the shock of Hussein's decision last month to
dismiss his brother, Hassan, as crown prince, and to replace him
with Abdullah, Hussein's eldest son, who became king last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was very much noticed that Prince Hassan did not join
Abdullah on Tuesday in receiving mourners on the day after the
state funeral, and that when he did appear in public, he did not
wear a kaffiyeh, the traditional sign of mourning that was worn all
week by Abdullah and Hussein's other four sons.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Hassan did stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the new
king, and he pledged in a public letter to his nephew, ``I will not
hold back love, or knowledge or support.'' In a separate show of
unity, Hussein's widow, Queen Noor, received female mourners
alongside not only Princess Rania, Abdullah's wife, but also
Princess Muna, the king's British-born mother, whom Hussein
divorced in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   But associates of Hassan say he remains bitter at his removal
just two weeks before he himself would have become king, and at a
lack of sympathy shown by the Jordanian people, many of whom turned
against him after his dismissal. And as evidence of trouble within
the family, Jordanians close to the royal court pointed out that
neither Hassan's wife, Princess Sarvath, nor their three daughters
had joined other members of the royal family at Hussein's bedside
as the monarch lay dying.
</P>
<P>
   Linking Jordan's personal and practical problems is the fact
that Hassan had come to be seen by many Jordanians and foreign
investors as a figure capable of putting Jordan's economy on firmer
footing.
</P>
<P>
   There remain rumors that Hassan, 51, might leave the country, as
his father, King Talal, did in 1952 after being forced to cede the
throne to Hussein. His associates say that is unlikely; they say he
feels no animosity toward either Abdullah or the crown prince,
Hamzah, 18, who is Queen Noor's eldest son, and feels bound to
Jordan by duty and family ties. But they say he is having a
difficult time adjusting to the idea of playing a peripheral role
in a country he served for 34 years as the king's closest adviser
and confidant.
</P>
<P>
   During his reign, Hussein installed a new prime minister on the
average of once every 11 months, and diplomats say they expect
Abdullah to move soon to install his own prime minister, as a sign
that a new era has begun. But such a move is not likely, they say,
until after a 40-day mourning period ends, in mid-March.

   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia _ On a continent of conflicts that often
make little sense to outsiders, the war that has reignited on the
Horn of Africa may make the least sense of them all.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations here, Ethiopia and Eritrea, know full well that
they are shambling into a confrontation nearly impossible for
either of them to win. The United States has praised both nations
for their bright leaders and promising economies. Yet people here
talk with resignation of how the war has an unusual potential for
destruction. Ethiopia and Eritrea, once brother nations, have spent
the last eight months since hostilities ceased buying as much
weaponry _ planes, tanks, artillery _ as possible. In manpower
alone, the war could become the biggest in Africa. Estimates of the
number of soldiers along the border range from 120,000 to 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   These troops are dug into trenches, hard to overtake. Each
nation is run by former guerrilla leaders, and neither side is
likely to back away now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are accustomed to war,'' Hambissa Ensermu, a 19-year-old
student at Addis Ababa University, said the other day. ``The only
choice we have now is to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
warned, ``We have got to accept the fact that this war is going to
produce tens of thousands of dead if it goes ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there has been a lull in hostilities over the last
several days, Eritrea already says it killed roughly 3,000
Ethiopian soldiers since fighting broke out Feb. 6. While Ethiopia
ridicules that claim as wildly inflated, it says more than 7,000
Eritreans have been killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the State Department advised American citizens to
leave both countries, citing worries that the fighting could spread
to either capital, as it did last spring, when Ethiopia launched
attacks against Asmara.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the weaponry and number of soldiers, there is another
element that may be driving the conflict to catastrophe, a quality
one observer called the two nations' ``knack for stubbornness.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is nominally about a rocky piece of land along the
border, known as the Badme region, which is barely populated and
holds no special significance, as one merchant in the main market
here said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That area, I think, is desert,'' the merchant, Tilahun Wolde,
25, said. ``It's valueless.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he said he believed that Ethiopia should fight as
long as necessary to reclaim it from the Eritreans, who have held
it since May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's territory, you know,'' he said. ``We'll die for our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from around the world, including Kofi Annan, the U.N.
secretary-general, have called for a halt to the fighting. Last
week, President Clinton spoke out for the second time recently,
saying that ``a peaceful solution can and must be found without
delay.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments underscore that this, unlike most conflicts in
Africa, is one in which America has definable interests. Each
nation is a strong ally, and Eritrea sits astride the oil channels
of the Red Sea.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite their dispute, the two nations have been regarded as
being comparatively stable in a turbulent region. Their neighbor to
the west, Sudan, is a haven for both terrorists and Islamic
militants, U.S. officials contend. Their neighbor to the east,
Somalia, where 18 American lives were lost in 1993 in an effort to
alleviate famine, remains fractured among competing clans.
</P>
<P>
   More abstractly, the war would seem to sound death knells for
the notion of an ``African renaissance,'' pushed with special vigor
over the last few years by the United States and derided by many
less optimistic outsiders. Meles Zenawi, the prime minister of
Ethiopia, and Isaias Afwerki, president of Eritrea, were among the
``new breed'' of African leaders hailed by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of their conflict are tangled. Meles, from the
Ethiopian border province of Tigray, and Afwerki fought side by
side for years in the war to overthrow the brutal regime of
Mengistu Haile Mariam. They won in 1991, and two years later,
Eritrea, which had been the northernmost province of Ethiopia only
since 1962, separated peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   But the divorce of the two nations did not come without tension.
The most pronounced split came in 1997, when Eritrea introduced its
own currency over Ethiopia's objections. Ethiopia responded by
demanding that all trade with Eritrea be conducted in hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations also never formally drew their 600-mile border.
Last May, the bad feelings erupted when Eritrean troops occupied
the Badme region, roughly 250 square miles. The Eritreans said that
old colonial maps showed that it belonged to them, but the
Ethiopians said it had always been theirs.
</P>
<P>
   After brief but fierce battles, the two sides agreed to a
cease-fire last June. Since then, they have worked toward both war
and peace.
</P>
<P>
   For war, each nation has bought hundreds of millions of dollars
in military hardware, mostly from Russia and Ukraine, several
diplomats said. Eritrea purchased half a dozen Russian MIG fighter
jets, essentially doubling the size of its small air force.
</P>
<P>
   For peace, the Organization of African Unity drafted a plan that
called for Eritrea to withdraw its troops and for Ethiopian
administration to be restored as international mediators decided
where, in fact, the border lay. Ethiopia accepted the plan. But
Eritrea has objected to a renewed Ethiopian administrative presence
and has demanded instead that impartial monitors be placed in the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said Eritrea is willing to leave the disputed areas,''
said Yemane Ghevreab, an aide to Afwerki. ``We are saying that the
other side should also withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea also has called for any peace plan to address what it
calls the violations of the human rights of the 52,000 Eritreans
deported from Ethiopia since the first round of hostilities.
Ethiopia says that nearly 40,000 of its citizens have been ejected
from Eritrea. Human rights officials say both claims are inflated.
</P>
<P>
   Most foreign nations seem gingerly to blame Eritrea for not
accepting the OAU plan, the only peace proposal on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia has been using that refusal by Eritrea as its first
line of defense in the battle for public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not only an OAU exercise,'' Ethiopia's foreign
minister, Seyoum Mesfin, said in an interview. ``It's the voice of
the international community, which Ethiopia has accepted and
Eritrea has not.''
</P>
<P>
   There are currently no negotiations. Mesfin said that Eritrea
must be taught that ``acquiring territory by use of force is
unacceptable to civilized nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghevreab, of Eritrea, accused Ethiopia of resuming the
hostilities Feb. 6, in what he called ``an adventurist, very
reckless path.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' he said. ``We shouldn't have come to this.''
</P>
<P>
   One Western defense official theorized that the fighting may in
fact have begun by accident.
</P>
<P>
   With so many troops in place along the border and clear
boundaries yet to be marked between them, there was, and remains,
ample room for miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is that this was not a planned offensive,'' the
official said. ``What you are seeing now is something we have
feared for months.''

 By TIM GOLDEN with CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Clinton administration weighs its annual
evaluation of Mexico's cooperation in fighting illegal drugs, U.S.
officials admit privately that by most statistical measures, the
Mexican record looks especially bad this year.
</P>
<P>
   Drug seizures by the Mexican police have fallen significantly.
Nearly all of the most important Mexican narcotics traffickers
identified last year remain at large. The promised extraditions of
some Mexican drug suspects to the United States have not
materialized, and drug enforcement programs have been rocked by a
series of public conflicts between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as President Clinton embarks on a brief visit to Mexico
starting Sunday, his aides have neither despaired of such facts nor
spent much time analyzing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between cooperation and success,'' the
State Department spokesman, James Rubin, argued last week. While
their cooperation might not be having much effect on the problem,
he suggested, Mexican officials ``are cooperating more closely with
the United States at virtually every level than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   The fervor with which administration officials are praising
Mexico's record _ even before studying the assessments being
collected from various government agencies _ underscores how for
Mexico the yearly ``certification'' process has become more of a
joint public-relations campaign aimed at the Congress than an
objective appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about what Mexico has done,'' one administration
official said, speaking on the condition that he not be identified.
``This is about convincing the Hill that whatever Mexico has done
is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say their evaluation, which is expected
by the end of the month and mandated by a 1986 law for countries
where drugs are produced or transported, is particularly
counterproductive in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   To observe the law strictly and possibly impose the economic
penalties it contemplates, they argue, would be to place a
strategic and complex relationship at risk for just one of the many
interests that the United States has in Mexico. And Mexican
officials have done their best to underscore that risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to think what decertification would
provoke,'' Mexico's ambassador to the United States, Jesus Reyes
Heroles, said in an interview. ``The equilibrium that underlies our
relationship with the United States would be undone.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts of Mexican politics describe such warnings as
overblown. Moreover, aides to a half-dozen Washington legislators
who have played leading roles on the drug issue say Mexico's
decertification is unlikely anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The aides, speaking on the condition they not be identified,
said they expected a formal endorsement of Mexico's efforts from
the administration and then an energetic congressional effort to
override that endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   But they added that they see no clear sign that they will be any
more able to reverse the certification than they were last year,
when a Senate motion for disapproval gathered only 45 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of weariness with fighting the same battle over
and over,'' a Senate aide said. ``It gets old.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the administration note that although the Mexican
authorities have not made much headway against the drug mafias over
the last year, the establishment of elite anti-drug units within
the army and the federal police has led to closer working
relationships with the CIA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   But officials from each of those agencies challenge the
administration's public assertion that the Mexican authorities are
trying their best. Those officials contend that the obstacle to
success in Mexico is not so much the strength of the traffickers or
the inexperience of the police but the Mexican government's
unwillingness to fight corruption more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officers working with the military's special
anti-drug force, the Center for Anti-Narcotics Information, say
they believe that some of its efforts may have been compromised by
corrupt superiors, officials said. Three senior agents of an elite
Mexican police force trained by U.S. officials failed lie-detector
tests last year over questions about their contacts with drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The agents were moved out of the unit but remain in the federal
police.
</P>
<P>
   Drug investigations that have touched on several well-known
Mexican politicians and at least a dozen high-ranking military
officers have not yet led to any arrests, despite what U.S.
officials describe as strong evidence that some of the politicians
and officers have sought to protect traffickers in return for large
bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, officials say that on a series of
occasions over the last year, U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement
officials have provided their Mexican counterparts with information
on the whereabouts of powerful drug traffickers, only to have
Mexican agents mishandle the intelligence or wait for hours before
carrying out raids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give them houses, we give them phone numbers _ and nothing
happens,'' said a U.S. official. ``Cases go nowhere.''

</P>
<P>
   An embarrassing example of the problem will provide a backdrop
for President Clinton's meetings with President Ernesto Zedillo,
which are to take place in and around the city of Merida, on the
Yucatan peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the peninsula, in the state of Quintana Roo, U.S.
intelligence and law-enforcement officials have been working for
more than a year with elite Mexican forces to dismantle a major
drug-smuggling operation with headquarters in the resort city of
Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   In one debacle last spring, U.S. officials said, officers of the
military intelligence unit recognized two of the most important
traffickers in the Cancun organization, Ramon Alcides Magana and
Albino Quintero Meraz, but made no attempt to capture them.
</P>
<P>
   On other occasions, U.S. intelligence officials gave officers of
the military unit home addresses and telephone numbers for each of
the two traffickers. But again, officials said, opportunities to
arrest the pair were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the unit appeared to get an important break when
it captured Gilberto Garza Garcia, the trafficker who oversaw the
mafia's movement of cocaine shipments from Cancun up the gulf coast
to McAllen, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. and Mexican officials said that after negotiating with
the general who headed the military unit and promising to help him
trap Magana, Garza Garcia was placed in the custody of two
detectives from whom he escaped the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The general has since been reassigned, Garza has been recaptured
and the detectives have been under investigation since being found
with more than $20,000 given to them by the trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   The White House drug-policy chief, Gen. Barry McCaffrey,
suggested that such short-term failings should not distract the
United States from its ultimate goals for Mexico. And while he and
other White House officials have often tried to silence
law-enforcement agencies that are critical of Mexico's performance,
he did not hesitate to offer his own view on certification in
advance of the administration's deliberations on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we ought to do is look at U.S. national interests
in the long term,'' McCaffrey said. ``Do we think that partnership
with Mexico is important to us and is beginning to show signs of
substantial cooperation? My own advice'' to Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright ``is they should be certified.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials have undertaken a similarly aggressive defense
of their efforts, lobbying more intensively than ever in Washington
and spending $100,000 a month to hire three high-profile lobbying
firms to assist them in getting their message out.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials have also held out to U.S. officials the
possibility that they might yet deliver a spectacular, last-minute
blow in the drug fight, one that could erase questions on Capitol
Hill about their willingness to move against the mafias.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical U.S. officials have taken to calling this notion ``the
February surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   According to senior officials of both countries, the surprise is
that the Mexican authorities, who have long been investigating the
governor of Quintana Roo, Mario Villanueva Madrid, might move to
indict him on drug-related charges sometime after Clinton's
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva has repeatedly denied providing any support to the
drug mafia that has flourished in Quintana Roo during his
administration, but a Mexican federal judge last week denied the
governor's request for information about the investigation against
him.

 &HT;    Gingrich legacy filled with irony
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newt Gingrich was traveling and not available for
comment Friday when the Senate acquitted President Clinton of
offenses charged in two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   His Marietta, Ga., office would not say where he was or what he
was doing when Congress closed the final installment of Gingrich's
four eventful years as Speaker of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has slipped away from Washington so quietly that it is
almost a surprise to enter the speaker's offices and not see the
familiar T. rex skull that so intrigued him.
</P>
<P>
   His demise as speaker was swift, followed by months of tumult
that made Gingrich's orderly exit quaint by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   But before he left, Gingrich cast his final votes in favor of
Clinton's impeachment. And the signature on the transmittal letter
that accompanied the articles of impeachment from the House to the
Senate belonged to Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   It was his final official act as speaker, a farewell to a
bedeviling adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gingrich had been on the same political seesaw for
so long that their fortunes seemed inextricably and inversely
linked. Gingrich's rise came at Clinton's expense and his botched
legislative agenda in 1995 helped revive the president politically,
to cite just two examples.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clinton survives as president, while Gingrich profitably
works the lecture circuit.
</P>
<P>
   There are those, mainly Democrats, who trace Gingrich's downfall
to his support for the president's impeachment. They remember the
speaker's vow to a meeting of GOPAC, his one-time political
organization, that he would mention Clinton's behavior in every
speech and a round of Republican television commercials late in the
1998 congressional campaigns that broached Clinton's sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky and the lies he told to conceal
it.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats picked up five seats in the House in the November
election, cutting the GOP edge in the House in half and spurring
frenzied efforts by Republicans to replace Gingrich as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can joke and say it was Monica who brought Newt down.
But I think the whole thing did bring him down,'' said Rep. John
Lewis (D-Ga.), a Gingrich nemesis. ``If he had not been playing the
impeachment card, we would not have won the seats we won in
November and he'd still be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall Strahan, an Emory University political scientist who is
writing a book about Gingrich and other powerful speakers, said
that although Gingrich lay low during impeachment's final stages,
``Many people would agree he was its driving force.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans interviewed last week about Gingrich's role in
impeachment maintained that it ranged from minimal to nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Several pointed out that Democrats at one point accused Gingrich
of manipulating the process to inflict maximum embarrassment on
Clinton. A few weeks later, the same Democrats were pleading for
Gingrich to take command of a rudderless impeachment ship.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes that in the spring of 1998, Gingrich provided a
crucial morale boost to Clinton's foes when he began raising the
Lewinsky affair in his speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.) recalled, ``We were
in a leadership meeting and he said it was time to start talking
about criminal activity, not personal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The message was that Americans might recoil from a scandal about
consensual sex, but would take notice of accusations that the
president had broken the law.
</P>
<P>
   Still later, Gingrich suggested to a closed meeting of the
male-dominated House Republican membership that if Clinton had
groped Kathleen Willey, the one-time White House volunteer, and had
similar experiences with other women, then he could legitimately be
called a misogynist.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker, who frequently imposed his will on his GOP
colleagues, also allowed independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report
to Congress to be posted on the Internet, with no excisions of its
explicit sexual references.
</P>
<P>
   Yet once Starr's report was in Congress's hands, and the House
Judiciary Committee began its investigation, Gingrich said ``not
one word to us,'' said Rep. George Gekas (R-Pa.), a committee
member and one of 13 prosecutors in the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans portrayed Gingrich as, at best, a reluctant
impeachment warrior, uncomfortable with the subject matter, but
unable to resist calls to move ahead because of his own political
problems with social conservatives and his fear of alienating a
crucial component of the Republican constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was of two minds about impeachment and both showed
themselves,'' said Jack Pitney, a political science professor at
Claremont McKenna College in suburban Los Angeles. ``I think he
realized impeachment is a powerful weapon, but that it could
backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also was aware that Democrats would use his $300,000
penalty and reprimand for violating House ethics rules in their
counterattack, Pitney said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ironies Pitney identified is that Democrats used
Gingrich's real or perceived involvement in impeachment to raise
money for their own campaigns. ``Newt Gingrich 's unique place in
history is that he was a powerfully effective fund-raiser for both
parties at the same time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Linder, who served as chairman of the House Republican campaign
committee, seconded the notion that Gingrich said little about
impeachment in the waning stages of the campaign. He has denied
repeatedly, for instance, that Gingrich had anything to do with the
controversial campaign ads that mentioned the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Linder believes that Gingrich allies _ including GOPAC executive
director Rich Galen and political consultant Joe Gaylord _ feared
that the speaker would not receive proper credit for widely
anticipated Republican gains in last year's election. They spread
the story that Gingrich approved the ads, Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   Galen has denied any involvement and Gaylord has not returned
telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Linder is among many Republicans who discount impeachment's
impact on the election and instead blame the GOP's lack of a clear
agenda for turning off conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In this view, the congressional leadership's decision to agree
with Clinton on a $500 billion catch-all spending bill, which
contained money for a range of social programs and projects that
critics derided as pork, doomed the GOP at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not convinced that the base of the Republican party
stayed home because of impeachment. They stayed home because of the
budget deal,'' former Rep. Bob Walker (R-Pa.), a Gingrich
confidant, said. ``It was a strategic mistake that was not Newt's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's undoing was in his being party to an agreement that
blurred the lines between Republicans and Democrats, several
Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   The new speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), is in many ways
the antithesis of Gingrich. Not a polished orator, the former
wrestling coach has pledged to focus on the nuts and bolts of
running the House and leave the visionary thinking to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's what we need now, a plodder,'' Rep. Saxby Chambliss
(R-Ga.) said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to make sure that he was clear that the palace intrigue
that was often a part of the Gingrich years had passed, Chambliss
added, ``That's P-L-O-D-D-E-R.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's supporters also have sought to ensure that their man,
Time's Man of the Year in 1995, would be remembered for something
other than the controveries that marked his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Galen, in an e-mail file he regularly sends to reporters and
political junkies, got in a plug for his one-time boss Friday in a
comment on the legacy Clinton hopes to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``His legacy is having LOST the House in 1994, having prevented
the Democrats from winning it back in 1996 because of the way he
conducted his campaign, and being unable to take it back in 1998
despite it being all but placed in his hands,'' Galen wrote.
``Looked at another way, Clinton couldn't beat Gingrich in three
tries.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before Gingrich resigned his seat last month, his staff
produced a 21-page report on Gingrich's legacy that goes well
beyond the Contract with America, a balanced budget and welfare
reform. In florid tones, the report credits Gingrich for the rise
in the stock market, a drop in interest rates, creation of 7.5
million new jobs and Americans' ``renewed sense of optimism about
themselves, their families and their future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be little doubt that with the benefit of sober
reflection, Gingrich's name will rank with handful of speakers
whose strong hand, particularly in a time of weakened presidential
leadership, changed the course of the country for the better,'' the
report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney, the California political scientist, and Emory's Strahan,
took a more nuanced approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest part of his legacy came the day he took the gavel
because he played a huge role in ending 40 years of Democratic
control,'' Pitney said.
</P>
<P>
   Strahan said, ``His actual impact on public policy is pretty
hard to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he has removed himself from political life, many of
Gingrich's friends are certain that his hiatus is temporary.
Gingrich continues to raise money assiduously. His new political
action committee took in more than $200,000 in the last 45 days of
1998, an envious pace for any politician.
</P>
<P>
   And, in case there was any doubt that Gingrich has future
political designs, his staff's report on his legacy should make
clear that he does.
</P>
<P>
   It was titled ``an interim report, the Speaker of the House
years.''

LIBYA CLOSER TO HANDING OVER SUSPECTS IN PAN AM BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said early Saturday
that ``important progress'' has been made toward persuading Libya
to turn over two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan
American flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's office issued the cautiously optimistic statement after
Saudi Arabia and South Africa said in separate announcements that
what South Africa called a ``common understanding'' had been
reached by their envoys with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   Annan is now looking forward to the ``speedy conclusion of this
matter,'' according to the statement issued by his office.
</P>
<P>
   Though the diplomatic impasse has appeared to be on the brink of
solution several times before, Gadhafi has always balked. Hence,
the statements issued from Pretoria, Riyadh and the U.N.
headquarters in New York were hopeful but restrained.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials in Washington declined comment
Saturday , saying they were waiting for more information. But White
House officials remained skeptical, noting that Gadhafi had always
found reasons to pull back from a deal before.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the statement issued by the United Nations
suggested that a breakthrough had been achieved. It was released
after separate statements from Johannesburg and Riyadh and after a
meeting late Friday between Annan and Rihad Massoud, the deputy
chief of mission of the Saudi Embassy in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi and South African diplomats had asked Annan's help in
securing Libya's agreement to turn over the two Libyans for a trial
at The Hague, in the Netherlands, before a court of Scottish
judges. On Dec. 5, Annan had traveled to Libya and met in a desert
tent with Gadhafi to discuss the Libyan leader's reservations about
the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that Gadhafi had expressed concern about whether
the two Libyans would be treated and tried fairly, and whether the
United States would permit the lifting of sanctions against Libya
that have been imposed since 1992 in part for its failure to hand
over the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats said that the secretary-general assured the Libyan
leader that U.N. resolutions would be followed.
</P>
<P>
   According to a resolution adopted by the Security Council last
August, as soon as the Security Council is informed that the two
suspects have safely arrived in the Netherlands, sanctions against
Libya are to be ``suspended immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety days after that, the sanctions are to be formally lifted
when and if the Security Council is assured by the
secretary-general that Libya is no longer supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   A U. N. official said that United Nations lawyers are now
attempting to draw up a legal document describing the agreement and
understandings reached by the South African and Saudi envoys who
have met several times with the Libyan leader.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi
ambassador to Washington, and professor Jakes Gerwel, director
general of the office of the South African president, Nelson
Mandela, warned Gadhafi in Libya that the United States and Britain
were committed to stiffening the sanctions if Libya failed to turn
over the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, American officials had said that the United
States and Britain would press for an oil embargo and other stiffer
sanctions against Libya if Gadhafi did not comply with U.N.
resolutions calling upon Libya to turn over the suspects, Abdel
Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi was reported to be concerned about where the two men
would serve their sentences if convicted. Britain and the United
States insist that the men be jailed in Scotland, but Gadhafi had
expressed concerns about whether they would be safely treated in
Western jails.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, American officials said, some of the assurances
sought by Gadhafi had to do with placing U.N. monitors in the
prison where the men would be held in the event of a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has reacted harshly to American threats to expand or
stiffen sanctions if Libya fails to turn over the suspects. In a
statement issued by JANA, the Libyan news agency monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corp., the government in Tripoli said, ``Libya
will never accept any solution under the threat of sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 at the urging of the United States and Britain, the
United Nations imposed sanctions against Libya banning air travel
to and from the country and limiting the sale of oil equipment. The
sanctions have left the oil-rich desert country diplomatically and
physically isolated.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mainly tranquil and dry conditions are expected across the
nation on Sunday. No significant precipitation will fall east of
the Rockies, and sunshine will dominate the southern two-thirds of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The jet stream will retreat from the eastern states, and in its
place, high pressure will build along the Atlantic seaboard. The
morning will be very chilly in the Southeast and Florida with
freezing temperatures as far south as Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   A brisk wind will diminish in New England, but some clouds and
scattered flurries will remain. A storm developing well offshore
may bring clouds and flurries to Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   A rapid warming will occur from the Mississippi Valley to the
eastern Rockies. Strengthening winds from the southwest will
transport warm, dry air from northern Mexico toward the central
Plains. Record readings are possible in eastern Colorado, Kansas
and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and isolated showers will accompany a complex cold front
crossing the upper Middle West. A chilled Pacific air mass will
flow into the northern Rockies behind a cool front. Patches of
light snow will fall across Montana and along the west slopes of
the Wasatch and Uintas. Several inches of snow are possible.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure over Washington and Oregon will promote dry and
rather cool weather. Sunshine will be sparse along the northwest
coast. A disturbance approaching California will bring clouds in
the afternoon and perhaps a shower Sunday night. The Southwest
should stay bright and become warmer.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Quick Change
</P>
<P>
   It felt like early summer for half of Thursday night in Erie,
Pa. A balmy wind from the south boosted readings to near 70 degrees
until 3 a.m. on Friday. By 8:30 a.m., snow was falling and bursts
of heavy snow accumulated 2.1 inches during the day. This scenario
was repeated at many other locations in the Northeast on Friday as
a powerful cold front pushed to the coast. However, the chill
following this front was typical for the season. A century ago on
Feb. 13, readings fell below zero all across Alabama, perhaps the
greatest cold outbreak in the South's history.

 &HT;    Pulling away from image of 'Triple-A'
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If money can buy status, NASCAR has a million reasons
to believe it can change the perception of the Busch Grand National
racing series from Triple-A to major league.
</P>
<P>
   The Busch, NASCAR's ``other'' racing series considered the
stepping stone to Winston Cup, is getting a big marketing push in
1999 as the No. 2 racing circuit in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   That's Busch league, not bush league.
</P>
<P>
   The series has enjoyed tremendous growth in popularity,
attendance and prize money.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance has increased 286 percent during the past 10 years.
Sponsor Anheuser-Busch's contribution to the points fund has
increased from $150,000 in 1992 to $650,000 in 1998 to $1.5 million
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we developed plans for the Busch series, we knew we had a
valuable property that is much more than a feeder system to the
NASCAR Winston Cup series,'' said Brian France, senior vice
president of NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   While showcasing future Winston Cup stars, the Busch series has
offered something the Cup has not: close competition.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen different drivers won in the 31-race series last year.
Nineteen different drivers won the pole in the last 19 races.
Fifty-two drivers led at least one lap. The fastest qualifier and
the slowest qualifier have been separated by an average of .536
seconds, and the average margin of victory was 1.432 seconds from
first to second.
</P>
<P>
   The series had a huge range in experience and age: 17-year-old
Casey Atwood became the series youngest-ever pole-winner, and at
the age of 56 years and 10 months, Dick Trickle became the oldest
driver to win a Busch race with his victory at Hickory, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But there's this second-banana position that NASCAR is trying to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to position the series as the proving ground for the
Winston Cup series while emphasizing that in no way is the NASCAR
Busch series a minor league,'' said Kevin Triplett, a NASCAR
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because so many people are familiar with baseball, we refer to
Busch as a Triple-A series,'' Triplett said. ``In no way do we feel
that the Busch series is minor league. We've felt that way for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, a number of Winston Cup drivers feel the same way.
Mark Martin, Ken Schrader and Jimmy Spencer regularly run Busch
races, and this year defending Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon
will drive five races for a team he is starting with his wife,
Brooke, and his Cup crew chief, Ray Evernham.
</P>
<P>
   Randy LaJoie, a two-time Busch champion who has made brief runs
in Winston Cup, has seen first-hand the growth of the Busch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more money than there used to be,'' said LaJoie,
who won the Busch title in 1996 and 1997. ``I think that's what's
bringing Gordon back. Also it's a good series, otherwise people
wouldn't want to come here and race. And maybe these guys are using
it as a test for Sunday. With NASCAR's testing procedures now, any
track time you get is a bonus. The cars are getting very similar.
There are things you can do in a Busch car that can help you on
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   But LaJoie knows the series needs an image makeover.
</P>
<P>
   He has run several races in Winston Cup. ``I got recognized more
for running the Budweiser car than I did for winning two
championships,'' LaJoie said. ``The fans, I think, have followed
the Busch series the last couple of years, but they still ask you
'when are you going to drive NASCAR?' We do drive NASCAR. But the
fans really put your name with Winston Cup because that's the
elite, that is the upper echelon. But there's nothing wrong with
the Busch series.''
</P>
<P>
   While other drivers are leaving Busch for the upper echelon _
Buckshot Jones, Elliott Sadler, Kevin Lepage and Tony Stewart are
moving up to Winston Cup this year _ LaJoie, for one, has been
content to remain in Busch.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the involvement and the money Busch is putting in,
there's no reason you can't make a good living in the Busch
series,'' he said. ``I'm going to take my piece of that cake and
run with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trickle, the veteran, isn't shy about referring to Busch as the
proving ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard for a guy to go right to Winston Cup without
schooling himself,'' Trickle said. ``In order to run Winston Cup
some day you have to get a lot of seat time in cars that are close
to them. Busch is the closest thing to them. It's really a major
stepping stone for what is Winston Cup. It's the next notch under
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a place for drivers to compete, but more
importantly to marketing-savvy NASCAR, it's another vehicle for
sponsor involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start a Winston Cup race on Sunday, 43 cars,'' Trickle
said. ``Does that mean there's only 43 sponsors in this country,
only 43 drivers in this country? No, there's a lot of great drivers
out there, and you can't put them all into 43. This gives a second
43 drivers a chance to race. They need a place to race, and the
fans want to watch more than just Winston Cup.''

CECIL SMITH, 94, CALLED POLO'S BEST PLAYER EVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (bl)  
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1930s, when polo was a sport of the rich, a Texan named
Cecil Smith began a career that made him perhaps the greatest
player in the history of a game more than 2,000 years old. On Jan.
21, the onetime polo-pony wrangler died in Boerne, Texas, where he
had lived more than 30 years. He would have been 95 years old
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He started playing polo in 1924. By 1930, he was a spare member
on the U.S. international team. Then, starting in 1938, he began a
string of 26 years, 25 consecutively (1938-62), in which he was a
10-goal player, the sport's highest ranking and one achieved by
only 20 American-born players.
</P>
<P>
   He more or less retired from polo in 1967. Despite warnings from
his doctor, he continued to ride and train polo ponies at his
100-acre ranch in Boerne (pronounced Bernie). After hip-replacement
surgery, he kept riding because he considered it psychological if
not physical therapy. He played his last polo game at 83 and last
rode at 92.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, he told Polo magazine:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't ride very much any more, but I do ride a couple of
hours every morning. I haven't been able to ride much since my hip
operation several years ago. I think I would still be playing polo
if I hadn't had that. If I ever got where I couldn't ride, I don't
think I'd live very long.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born poor on Valentine's Day, 1904, on the Moss Ranch
near Llano, Texas, and learned to ride by age 3. As a youth, he won
roping prizes in rodeos and seemed destined for the $1-a-day life
of a cowpuncher.
</P>
<P>
   But at 20, he went to work for George Miller, a horse trader
from Austin who also trained polo ponies (they are really horses,
not ponies). Smith made a mallet from an old broom handle and
started practicing polo by hitting rocks and tin cans. As Miller
once observed, ``It was like learning to play baseball in a
railroad switchyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Smith would train up to 100 horses a year for four
months each, then ship them to California. Smith started playing
polo there with such celebrities as Will Rogers, Darryl Zanuck,
Walt Disney and Reginald Denny. Horses that didn't sell in
California were sent to Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Wayman, a 10-goal player in the 1980s, said the polo-pony
business could be lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days,'' he said, ``you could get $165 from the
government for a cavalry horse, which wasn't bad, but you could get
$300 for a polo pony. So those cowboys would get an old mallet and
they'd go out to the ranches, where they knew they could find
horses that were broke to the saddle. ... Then they'd swing the
mallet on them for a little bit, and the next day they'd be able to
sell them as polo ponies. ... The government would buy a lot of
them, but private players would buy them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Polo ponies were especially needed because of the game's intense
pace. It is played with four players to a team on a grass field 300
yards long and 160 yards wide. A game lasts six chukkers, or
periods, of seven and a half minutes each, and each player needs a
new horse every chukker.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Hubert Windshield (Rube) Williams were two of the many
cowboys who started selling polo ponies and then took up the sport.
Will Rogers, the humorist and a high-ranked polo player, told
Easterners what expert horsemen those cowboys were. Rogers was
there as the cowboys led a West team to victory over the supposedly
invincible East in 1933 in Lake Forest, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In the third and deciding game, Smith scored six goals as the
West won, 12-6. Tommy Hitchcock of the East, polo's most renowned
player, was held scoreless. Smith later said, ``I never enjoyed a
series any more than I did that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers enjoyed it, too. In his newspaper column, he wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the hillbillies beat the dudes and took the polo
championship of the world right out of the drawing room and into
the bunkhouse. And she won't go East in years. ... Poor old
society. They got nothing exclusive left. The movie folks
outmarried and outdivorced 'em, the common folks took their
cocktails, `near' society took to bridge. Now polo has gone to the
buckwheat belt.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, Smith led a United States team that toured England and
won five titles, including the King's Coronation Cup. He often
competed at the Meadow Brook Club in Westbury, N.Y., in major
tournaments that attracted up to 30,000 spectators, many arriving
on Long Island Rail Road special trains from Manhattan. Over the
years, his teams won the U.S. Open seven times, the Pacific Coast
Open seven times and the Monty Waterbury Cup four times.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 11 and 195 pounds, Smith seemed to play effortlessly.
As H.I. Brock wrote in 1934 in The New York Times Magazine, ``There
is certainly no flavor of Wild West rashness.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's era marked the American zenith of polo, a game invented
by Asiatic nomads and brought to the United States in 1872 by
Englishmen riding American horses. Mostly because of the high cost
of horses _ $12,000 to $15,000 for ordinary polo ponies and $25,000
to $40,000 for the best _ only 3,000 players are registered with
the U.S. Polo Association. The sport is popular in Argentina and
England and has received wide attention because of such celebrity
players as the Duke of Edinburgh and his son Prince Charles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Smith and his wife moved from San Antonio to Boerne. He
is survived by his wife of 64 years, the former Mary Miller of
Wading River, N.Y.; two sons who became ranked polo players,
Charles of Fort Worth, and Sidney of Boerne; two grandchildren and
a sister, Macy Janner of Llano, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   When the Polo Hall of Fame opened in 1990, six players were
elected on the first ballot _ Smith, Hitchcock, Harry Payne
Whitney, Devereux Milburn, Bob Skene and Stewart Iglehart. Smith's
citation read in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecil Smith was endowed with unquestionable talents both as a
horseman and polo player. With determination and fortitude, he
developed his abilities to perfection. Over the years, he played on
more fields with more players than perhaps anyone else in polo. He
has always been and still is the inspirational leader of the
game.'' &QL;

FROM CHINA, MORE CRITICISM OF A RULING BY HONG KONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In an escalating legal dispute between Hong Kong and
China, the Chinese government told Hong Kong's top legal official
Saturday that a landmark ruling on immigration by the high court
here violated the territory's constitution and ``should be
rectified.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on her return from a meeting in Beijing, Secretary of
Justice Elsie Leung said officials had told her the ruling by the
Court of Final Appeal was ``contradictory to the principles in the
constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, the court ruled that children born in China to
Hong Kong parents had a right to live in the territory. The
decision opens the door to tens of thousands of Chinese residents,
and it supersedes Chinese laws that make it very difficult for
mainland people to move here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leung did not say whether Beijing had formal plans to
overturn the decision. But her remarks have deeply alarmed lawyers
and pro-democracy leaders, who say the dispute with Beijing is a
litmus test of Hong Kong's judicial independence since its return
to Chinese rule 19 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds very bad for Hong Kong,'' said Margaret Ng, a
lawyer and member of Hong Kong's legislature. ``It seems like they
are saying, `We've heard your concerns, and we're going to go ahead
anyway.'''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has made no secret of its disapproval. Four Chinese
legal scholars harshly criticized the ruling the week after it was
announced, saying it was an attempt to place Hong Kong's courts
above the National People's Congress. On Monday, a Chinese Cabinet
official said it violated the Basic Law, the constitution that has
governed Hong Kong since it reverted from British rule.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the first time Beijing has officially alerted Hong
Kong's government to its desire to change the ruling. Ms. Leung was
sent to Beijing by Tung Chee-hwa, the chief executive of Hong Kong,
to discuss the jurisdiction of Hong Kong's courts and the
implications of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers here said that if Beijing overturned the decision, it
would ignite a constitutional crisis. Under the agreement between
Britain and China _ known as ``one country, two systems'' _ Hong
Kong is supposed to be a semiautonomous region within China, with
its own legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the Court of Final Appeal had tested that
principle by asserting that China could not pass rules that
contradicted Hong Kong's Basic Law. The Basic Law had guaranteed
residency to mainland Chinese children of Hong Kong parents. But
after the handover, the Beijing-appointed legislature here passed
new laws making it tougher for mainland Chinese to move to Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leung said she had told the Chinese officials that people in
Hong Kong feared that if Beijing mishandled this case, it would sow
doubts about the rule of law in this free-market bastion. She said
the officials had told her they would ``take into consideration the
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this is a problem within one country, they are confident
that the matter will be resolved satisfactorily,'' Ms. Leung said.
</P>
<P>
   To some people here, that seemed an ominous sign that Hong Kong
would bow to Beijing rather than fight for its judicial
independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this going to be resolved satisfactorily from our point of
view or their point of view?'' asked Martin Lee, a prominent
democratic leader. ``Because if it is resolved satisfactorily from
our point of view, Beijing will do nothing.''

EDITORIAL: AMERICAN FOOD FOR IRAN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution, a
spirit of moderation is growing among Iran's people and political
leaders. That has created an opportunity for repairing relations
with the United States that the Clinton administration has been
usefully exploring for more than a year. A recent Iranian request
to purchase large amounts of American grains and sugar offers a
timely and appropriate way to advance this reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   America's relations with Iran have been icy since radical
students seized Washington's Tehran Embassy in 1979 and held
diplomats hostage there for 444 days. Anti-American clerics remain
a powerful and repressive force in Iran's politics. But for
millions of Iranians, personal freedom and interchange with the
outside world are more compelling goals than theological purity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Iranians overwhelmingly elected a moderate cleric,
Mohammad Khatami, as president. Iran's Constitution gives him only
limited powers and he has faced fierce resistance from the ruling
clergy. But Khatami has skillfully used his popularity to expand
his influence. Last week he forced an overdue housecleaning of top
officials at the Intelligence Ministry. The agency has sponsored
international terrorism in the past and acknowledged that its
agents directed the recent murders of leading liberal intellectuals
in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has long been a grain importer and the United States used
to be a major source of its supplies. But since American export
restrictions were tightened in the early 1990s, Tehran has turned
to Australia and New Zealand for most of its imported grain. Last
September, a U.S. trading company acting on behalf of Iran
requested a waiver of U.S. export controls to buy almost 3 million
tons of grain and 400,000 tons of sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's economy has been hobbled by low oil prices and Khatami's
popularity could be threatened by continued privation. Large
American grain exports would assure the government ample supplies
of wheat to sell at subsidized prices, thus showing that Khatami's
more moderate foreign policy can pay domestic dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Better relations with Iran could provide Washington with an
important regional counterweight to Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration has rightly set three conditions for a
full return to normal relations. Tehran must abandon its nuclear
and other unconventional weapons programs, refrain from sponsoring
terrorism and not interfere with Mideast peace efforts between
Israel and Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   On the last two points, at least, there has been progress.
America should proceed cautiously with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But when there is an opportunity to reward and encourage
moderation without incurring serious risks, as in the case of the
food sales, Washington should seize it.  &QL;

DISCOVERED AT 2 AIRPORTS: SPARE RUNWAY CAPACITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Nev., Calif., Mich., Tenn., N.J.)  (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For 30 years, the Federal Aviation Administration has
rationed landing and takeoff slots to keep La Guardia and Kennedy
airports from being overwhelmed by airplanes. But last week the
Transportation Department, its parent agency, proposed phasing out
the limits over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Without them, and without new gates or runways, how will those
airports avoid chaos? The same way, FAA officials say, as the
airports in Las Vegas, Long Beach, Calif.; Pontiac, Mich., and
Memphis, all of which have more takeoffs and landings than La
Guardia or Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   None has ever had a federal limit on landing slots _ but none
has reached gridlock, either. All have airlines that have elected
on their own to limit traffic to no more than the runways can
handle, officials say. And these officials predict the same will
happen in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an economic decision for the airlines,'' said Ron Morgan,
the agency's director of air traffic. ``Basically, they're making
decisions based on when their customers want to fly vs. the amount
of delay that they historically receive. If they're getting
30-minute delays, and they have done that consistently for the last
60 days, chances are they are going to reschedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping a big jet waiting for takeoff costs hundreds of dollars
a minute in fuel, crew pay and lost revenue, airlines officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Flocke, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association,
the largest pilots' union, said that ``slots are primarily an
economic deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the FAA minimums for physical separation and time
separation are maintained, we don't care,'' he said. He added that
pilots were paid the same and that safety problems would arise only
if a jet burned too much fuel sitting on the runway or a delay was
so long that a flight crew's shift went beyond allowed limits.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity of gates will limit peak congestion, experts say.
``If they really have to have a 1 p.m. departure, 3:30 may be the
earliest they can get a gate,'' said James Buckles, the FAA's
assistant division manager for air traffic in the region that
includes New York.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the two airports run like clockwork now. Of 361,000
landings and takeoffs at La Guardia last year, nearly 25,000 were
delayed by 15 minutes or more, or 68 per 1,000 operations _ up from
49 per 1,000 in 1997, according to the agency's figures. At
Kennedy, there were 357,000 operations and 13,000 delays, or 36 per
1,000 operations, up from 18 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Delays are growing nationwide. The Inspector General's office of
the Transportation Department recently studied 2,115 domestic
routes to and from the 28 busiest American airports (which include
Newark, N.J., ranked No. 15, but not Kennedy, No. 31, or La
Guardia, No. 34), and found that the gate-to-gate time had grown
longer on 1,544 routes, or 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Taxiing accounted for 56 percent of the increase. Jeff Nelligan,
a spokesman for the inspector general, said of Kennedy and La
Guardia, ``These two airports, as well as Newark, have the highest
taxi-out times in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither Kennedy nor La Guardia is saturated all the time.
From the tower at La Guardia, it is obvious that the airport has a
great deal of spare capacity. There is almost always at least a
short line of planes: at 2:45 p.m. last Friday, eight were waiting
for takeoff, and the radarscope showed a similar number waiting to
land in a line spread out across about 40 miles of sky.
</P>
<P>
   But the morning's log sheet _ a form on a clipboard filled with
notations and looking like a baseball scorecard _ showed that the
airport had not reached its peak capacity of 75 landings or
takeoffs in any one-hour period that day. The highest number was
71, between 8 and 9 a.m. Traffic on Friday was down slightly
because of the pilots' sickout at American Airlines, but there are
always off-peak hours.
</P>
<P>
   The peaks at La Guardia are a rush of departures about 7 a.m.; a
slew of arrivals between 8 and 9 a.m., with another rush of
arrivals around 4 p.m., and a flood of departures again beginning
at 5. It all dies off by 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, which has seven and a half times the land area of La
Guardia, can handle arrivals on two parallel runways and departures
on a third runway if weather is good, for up to about 150
operations an hour. It suffers the same rate of reductions from
winds or rain or snow as La Guardia. Because so much of its traffic
is international, its peaks are matched to time zones on the other
side of the world, but current limits on takeoffs and landings
apply only in the afternoons and evenings.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has gotten better at managing planes: new displays at
controller work stations can show the location of every plane bound
for either airport, even if it is on the other side of the ocean or
the continent, and can count those due in any 15-minute period,
even those that have not taken off yet. And controllers can slow
planes down to keep arrivals at a manageable rate. But capacity has
fallen rather than grown in the last three decades because not much
new concrete has been poured and the mix of planes has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, we left three miles between airplanes,''
said Carmine W. Gallo, a traffic management officer at the New York
Terminal Radar Approach Control, the air traffic office, in
Westbury, that handles all traffic going in and out of all the
airports in the New York area. But now there is a separate category
_ ``heavies,'' like Boeing 747s, 757s and 767s _ that create such
powerful wakes that commuter planes must follow five miles behind
instead of three. So the interval between takeoffs must be longer.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots of some small planes will elect to take off right behind
a ``heavy'' and avoid the wake by climbing faster, but the
controllers are not allowed to suggest it.

CURTAIN FALLS ON MAPLE LEAF GARDENS AFTER 7 DECADES OF LORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ How do you change a light bulb in the National Hockey
League? Easy, hockey philosophers say. Bring the new bulb to Maple
Leaf Gardens and leave it at center ice. The bulb will screw itself
into the socket because the entire hockey universe revolves around
the Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Although the joke lampoons Toronto's hockey self-importance and
the widespread veneration of the league's oldest arena, the end of
the punch line was true Saturday night when the NHL's brightest
spotlight illuminated the Gardens for its final league game. As was
the case on opening night, in 1931, the Maple Leafs played the
Chicago Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Between those two games were almost seven decades of lore, much
of it glorious, some of it notorious. First came years of elegance
and triumph, when the Gardens, like the old Montreal Forum, was
likened to a church for Canada's secular religion. Conn Smythe, a
former military man, built the place and ruled it with an
authoritarian hand. Back then, his building housed his championship
teams and exuded Canada's distinctive patriotism. Later came
decades of decay, not in the building's infrastructure, but
throughout its spirit. By then the Gardens was controlled by an
eccentric robber baron, and the staff included a few employees who
brought upon it a scandal that will forever sully its reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Built of 750,000 yellow bricks and 77,500 bags of cement,
located appropriately on a street called Church, Maple Leaf Gardens
has 15,726 seats that rise steeply from ice level in sight lines
ideal for hockey. Typical of arenas of its era, it is built on a
human scale, with easy access from bustling downtown sidewalks.
Compared with the score of new 1990's arenas, the Gardens is what
hockey people call an ``old barn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The building itself is cement,'' said Pat Quinn, the coach of
the Leafs and a former Toronto player. ``But the people who have
passed through have made it a glorious place.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with hockey stars, Maple Leaf Gardens welcomed members of
British royalty, Muhammad Ali, four Beatles, one pope, various
politicians _ including Winston Churchill _ and all sorts of
sports. It was the site of the National Basketball Association's
first game: New York Knickerbockers versus Toronto Huskies, Nov. 1,
1946. In the 1950 Stanley Cup finals, the Rangers played two
``home'' games here because the circus evicted them from Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Maple Leafs will open the Air Canada Center, a
sparkling new arena appropriate for a booming city filled with
glittering buildings. With its 18,800 seats for hockey, not to
mention lots of luxury boxes, it will be in harmony with an
expanding league in the 21st century. But the last of the NHL's
``old six'' arenas from its gestational era will stand abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   If and when they tear it down, however, the Gardens will still
exist in the mind. For many, that is where it always has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of Canadians have never been in Maple Leaf
Gardens, but they have been in Maple Leaf Gardens in their
imagination,'' Ken Dryden recently told The National Post. ``They
have been there on radio. They have been there on television. And
they imagine what it is like.''
</P>
<P>
   Dryden, the former Montreal Canadiens goalie of the 1970s, was
critical of Leafs ownership and management in books he wrote during
the 1980s. Now, in less than two seasons as president of the Maple
Leafs, he has turned one of the league's worst teams into one of
its best.
</P>
<P>
   As Dryden indicated, the Canadians have experienced the Gardens
through ``Hockey Night in Canada,'' a Saturday night television
show that made the Maple Leafs the home team for English-speaking
fans from Newfoundland to British Columbia. Before television,
``Hockey Night'' came over the radio through the voice of Foster
Hewitt. If only in their mind's eye, fans could see the players of
Smythe's team, who wore over their hearts on their blue and white
sweaters _ not jerseys, in Canada _ the symbol that later became
part of the national flag.
</P>
<P>
   One who remembers is Peter Jennings, the ABC News anchor. He
recalled how his father, a journalist for the Canadian Broadcasting
Corp. took him to Leafs games and let him climb around in Hewitt's
famous ``gondola,'' a broadcast booth. Jennings also recalled how
the Gardens used to host religious revival meetings. They were in
tune, Jennings said, with the spirit of what was then a prim and
provincial city. Saturday night was hockey night, because blue laws
forbade Sunday games. `` `Toronto the Good,''' Jennings said,
recalling one of the city's old nicknames. ``Toronto the righteous.
Toronto the interminably boring.''

 TORONTO: interminably boring.''

<P>
   Another member of the live hockey audience then was Jim
Devellano, who bought his first season tickets for the 1958-59
season when he was 15 and the seats cost $1.50. Although he has
worked for other teams and is now the senior vice president of the
Detroit Red Wings, Devellano still has season tickets at the
Gardens, which now cost him $48 a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had usherettes in the low seats who wore white gloves,''
Devellano said. ``And the place was spotless. You could eat off the
floor.'' Smythe used to write letters to season ticket-holders
reminding the men to wear jackets and neckties. No beer was sold
until 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hockey game there was an event,'' Devellano added. ``They
had a band playing. They had a picture of the Queen at the end of
the building. Very patriotic guy, Smythe. You know, British Empire.
Before the games, the band would play `God Save the Queen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her Majesty even visited the place, in 1951, while still
Princess Elizabeth. Among the pictures in the corridor is one of
the princess, sitting next to a smiling Smythe. Beneath it Friday
was a hissing radiator, warming the old hallway on a chilly, gray
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Smythe started his NHL career with the Rangers when the New York
team was founded in 1927. But he left before the first training
camp because he could not get along with the management of the old
Madison Square Garden. The old Garden in New York was replaced by a
new one in 1968. The other rinks from that era, all closed or
demolished now, were the Forum in Montreal, the Detroit Olympia,
the Chicago Stadium and the Boston Garden. Gone, gone, gone,
memories of a time before corporations and banks leased the names,
before the sideboards and even the ice surface became cluttered
with advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs won their 11th and most recent Stanley Cup in 1967. By
then, the franchise and the sport were in transition. Smythe had
turned the team over to his son and other directors, including
Harold Ballard. The league began expanding. By 1971, Smythe and his
son were dead and Ballard gained full control, despite a stay in
prison for financial fraud against the Gardens. After his release,
Ballard ruled the building through the next two decades, until his
death in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   When European players became more numerous, Ballard insulted
them, including Swedish players on his own team. He refused to
allow touring Soviet teams to play on his ice, and he told his
management not to hire Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the stands, Ballard carved out an apartment and lived
there. Down near the ice, he sat with his pal, ``King'' Clancy, in
a private bunker that looked like a cave. Television cameras on
``Hockey Night'' showed him smiling or scowling as Leafs defeats
began to outnumber their victories. One biographer of Ballard wrote
of the owner's midnight ride on the Zamboni, in the nude, with
female companionship. Dryden, in a 1983 book called ``The Game,''
wrote of the difference between Smythe's era and Ballard's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a period piece, elegant, colonial Toronto,'' Dryden
wrote of Smythe's Gardens, ``perfectly, shamelessly preserved from
a time before glitter and spectacle came to the city, and came to
sports.'' Of Ballard's operation, Dryden said, ``A once great
institution, now shabby.''
</P>
<P>
   Another former hockey star, Red Kelly, played for the Leafs and
later coached them. Of the Ballard era, he once said, ``It was as
if a bunch of pirates has taken over.'' During the Ballard years,
critics nicknamed the team ``the Maple Laughs'' and called their
rink ``Make-Believe Gardens.'' But even the harshest did not
realize how shabby things really were.
</P>
<P>
   Those revelations began in 1997, about men who worked in the
Gardens and operated a sex ring that preyed upon boys, bribing them
with tickets and souvenirs. The incidents are alleged to have
occurred over three decades, mostly during Ballard's stewardship,
although no one has accused Ballard of complicity. One accused
perpetrator was convicted and is serving jail time; another, an
usher who used to guard the dressing room door, is currently on
trial. After the first victim spoke out, police took reports from
at least four dozen men who said they were victimized there during
their youth. The chief accuser committed suicide on Oct. 30, 1997,
by jumping off a downtown viaduct. Dryden, new in his job then,
called the man's family for permission to attend the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be unfair to define the building by its worst
chapters. Above and beyond all, it was a hockey rink, one cherished
even by today's athletes. Tie Domi, a Maple Leafs forward, said:
``Going to work there every day is quite the honor. I sit back and
say, `We are part of this shrine and this history and now it's
going away.'''
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Glenn Healy noted that the crowds, like most in Canada,
are quiet, so hecklers are more easily heard. Steve Thomas, another
forward, recalled his first day as a Leaf. ``I remember sitting in
the locker room,'' he said, ``looking down at my jersey and,
almost, I don't know, I don't want to be sentimental. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   His voice cracked, he quickly smiled, and then he continued.
``It was an amazing feeling. Growing up from when I was 6 years
old, following the Leafs, watching them on TV with my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wayne Gretzky of the Rangers, before his final Gardens
appearance this winter, tried to sum up his personal time trek at
age 38. His first visit, when he was 6, was with his grandmother.
They sat in the last row and Gretzky said he was entranced, not
leaving until the three stars were announced after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't replace a Maple Leaf Gardens,'' Gretzky said.
``We'll never recapture the atmosphere. It's a special place,
sacred.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Reds have good shot at vying in Central
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since being eliminated by Atlanta in the 1995 NLCS,
the Cincinnati Reds are an aggregate 18 games below .500, have
finished a combined 40 games out of first place and suffered the
ignominy of every Marge Schott punchline that Jay Leno has dished
out. The Big Dead Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a spring that finds Schott finally on her way out, the
Reds open camp this week with a lighter step. The arrivals of Greg
Vaughn and Denny Neagle have given the Reds a chance to improve
immediately. And in the tepid NL Central, a little improvement can
go a long way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry Larkin called me right away,'' Vaughn said after
arriving from San Diego, ``and said he was trying to get out of
there until he found out I was coming. Now, he's happy.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, an infield with Pokey Reese at second and Aaron Boone
at third is no knee-buckler to the rest of the league. And the Reds
are already shamelessly milking 1999 prospects for more than
they're worth. During the news conference welcoming Vaughn, general
manager Jim Bowden four times held up a placard for the TV cameras
with a phone number for ticket orders.
</P>
<P>
   But those seeking a darkhorse for postseason could do far worse.
Vaughn gives Cincinnati the cleanup hitter it has long lacked: No
Red has had a 100-RBI season in nine years. Neagle teams with Pete
Harnisch (14-7 last year) to anchor an improved rotation that
includes Brett Tomko and Steve Avery.
</P>
<P>
   And competition is strong enough in the field that four
positions are unsettled: Hal Morris and Sean Casey vying for first
base, Jeffrey Hammonds and Mike Cameron in center, Michael Tucker
and Dmitri Young in right and Brian Johnson and Eddie Taubensee at
catcher. Depth does not necessarily equal strength, but there is
more talent here than there has been in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   WELCOME TO SUDS CITY
</P>
<P>
   Bill Campbell, just hired on as Milwaukee's new pitching coach,
thought he had a problem with ear-wax buildup when told how many
complete games the Brewers threw in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two complete games? For the whole season?'' he asked. ``That
can't be right.''
</P>
<P>
   Those two games were the lowest total in National League
history. Campbell should also know that Brewer starters made it
through the seventh inning just 42 times and nine of those games
belonged to Jeff Juden, who was dumped in early August. What of
one-time ace Cal Eldred? He is coming off his second surgery in
four years and does not figure to break camp with the club.
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado right-hander Kevin Ritz, recovering from rotator-cuff
surgery performed last June 23, threw from a mound for the first
time last week but cannot predict if he will be able to pitch this
season. ... Trevor Hoffman, put off by the player exodus in San
Diego, has upped his contract demands. After nearly agreeing to a
three-year, $15 million offer after the season, he is now seeking
four years at $32 million, saying, ``If they can trade a 50-homer
guy (in Greg Vaughn), they can trade a 50-save guy.'' ... Former
Brave Paul Byrd opens Philadelphia's camp as a member of the
rotation, after a superb 5-2 record and 2.29 ERA in eight starts as
a Phillie. But suspicions abound. ``You don't pick up 20-game
winners off the waiver wire,'' manager Terry Francona said. . . .
Pittsburgh again asks Bill Mazeroski to come to spring training to
show the Pirates what a glove is for. The Pirates committed 95
infield errors last year, including 45 at shortstop. Mazeroski led
the NL in assists nine years and turned more double plays than
anyone in history, 1,706.

 &HT;    How to build an NBA champ
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The moves that could determine the viable championship
contenders were not necessarily the ones that brought the big
names. Talent wins in the NBA, but the clubs that understood the
value of acquiring complementary help are the ones that bear
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Cases in point: For all Michael Jordan did in carrying the Bulls
to six titles in eight years, there was a Horace Grant or a Dennis
Rodman to solidify things. With Magic Johnson's Lakers, he had Kurt
Rambis or A.C. Green. Larry Bird had Dennis Johnson with the
Celtics. Isiah Thomas' Pistons had Vinnie Johnson. When Houston and
Hakeem Olajuwon captured successive titles (1994, '95), there was
Robert Horry or Sam Cassell.
</P>
<P>
   This year, many teams added complementary help. But four clubs
picked up a star and the kind of unsung help that makes champions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Atlanta. The Hawks filled a need at small forward by signing
free agent LaPhonso Ellis. But the acquisition of backup power
forward Grant Long also was significant. Long's allow-no-layups
mentality and hustle give the Hawks a physical edge it has not had
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   He's a player who flourishes without needing the ball. He simply
goes and gets loose balls and rebounds. No doubt he pushes starter
Alan Henderson in practice and at times will challenge him for
minutes in games.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important is Long's tough-guy attitude, which
permeates the club. It is an incalculable intangible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Houston. Trading for Scottie Pippen elevated the Rockets to
bona fide challengers, but signing Antoine Carr away from Utah
could keep them there. When he gets healthy, Carr's playoff
experience, low-post scoring, rebounding and shot-blocking will be
big.
</P>
<P>
   With Utah, Carr helped drive the Jazz to successive NBA Finals
by relieving and playing alongside Karl Malone. At 6-foot-9, 260
pounds, Carr plays center and power forward. He's the kind of
veteran help greatly needed to back up Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles
Barkley _ both still capable, but both aging.
</P>
<P>
   _ Phoenix. It'll reveal itself one day that losing Antonio
McDyess to Denver was the best thing that could have happened to
the Suns, because they replaced him with free-agent Tom Gugliotta,
who is a better, more consistent all-around player.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet for run-and-gun Phoenix was inking former Chicago
Bull center Luc Longley. At times, he looked awkward and in the way
in the Bulls' rhythmic triangle offense. But he was the big banger
in the middle that was desperately needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have been a doughnut team for a long time. Longley
fills that void. Plus, if he was paying attention while riding
Jordan's coattails, he brings championship know-how.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sacramento. The Kings have the potential finally to rid
themselves of the perpetual-loser tag hung on them over the years.
That's the magnitude of power forward Chris Webber, who was traded
there from Washington for, in essence, guard Mitch Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   But the reason Webber stands to return to all-star form, and
Sacramento has playoff aspirations, is the signing of free-agent
center Vlade Divac. Webber seldom has played with a center who can
pass or who can play on the perimeter as Divac can. That gives the
skilled Webber inside room to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Divac has vast playoff experience, including the 1992 NBA
Finals with the Lakers. His skill, experience and unselfishness
will not make Sacramento the kings of the West, but he'll help them
rise.

 &HT;    Kings' Williams shining early at the point
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's early, yes, probably too early, to even get into
assessing the league's top rookie talent. But Sacramento point
guard Jason Williams has been so solid and so spectacular in his
first NBA week that he's hard to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   In four games going into the weekend, Williams outplayed No. 2
pick Mike Bibby of Vancouver and Phoenix all-star Jason Kidd,
scoring more than 20 points twice _ all the while doing so in
fashion that sparked memories of Isiah Thomas, Nate Archibald and
other ``small'' playmakers.
</P>
<P>
   That he is a flashy white player from West Virginia with an
inner-city game adds to the intrigue. And so, he has the nickname
``White Chocolate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Williams) is just so creative,'' Kings coach Rick Adelman
said. ``He's quick as a cat, tough as nails, and he's not cocky but
extremely confident.''
</P>
<P>
   He has another distinction. Williams is the only player in the
NBA to have thrown a touchdown pass to Minnesota Pro Bowl receiver
Randy Moss. Williams and Moss attended DuPont Junior High School in
Belle, W.Va., with Williams serving as quarterback and captain in
the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moss was the best everything I've ever seen,'' Williams said.
``He could do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the same could be said for Williams, who committed
to basketball only in high school. In college, he ended up getting
kicked off the Florida team for violating team rules, which later
was learned to be for smoking marijuana. So, it's a scary prospect
that Vernon ``Mad Max'' Maxwell plans to be a mentor of sorts for
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay away from all the B.S. because it's easy to get into in
the NBA,'' Maxwell said he told Williams, 23. ``I'm not going to
let him get into anything, because I've been there and done that.''
</P>
<P>
   And then some.
</P>
<P>
   CAN'T BEAT 'EM? BUY 'EM
</P>
<P>
   After the Charlotte Hornets cut rapper/producer Percy Miller _
better known as Master P one of his NBA clients made it clear that
his agent had other options. Not playing for other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he could go straight to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a year or so,'' Boston's Ron Mercer said, ``he might just
buy a team. I wouldn't put it past him.''
</P>
<P>
   With another profitiable yea, Miller could add to the $56
million he made last year with the release of his final CD and
producing several groups. But he loves the NBA and plans to stay
close to it through clients Mercer and Derek Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   BY THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   Here's a list of the top salaries that players will make after
losing three months of the season to the lockout. Seems that some
guys aren't hurting too much.
</P>
<P>
   1. Patrick Ewing, Knicks: $11.1 million
</P>
<P>
   2. Shaquille O'Neal, Lakers: $9 million
</P>
<P>
   3. David Robinson, Spurs: $8.9 million
</P>
<P>
   4. Kevin Garnett, Timberwolves: $8.4 million
</P>
<P>
   5. Alonzo Mourning, Heat: $7.88 million
</P>
<P>
   6. Juwan Howard, Wizards: $7.88 million
</P>
<P>
   7. Hakeem Olajuwon, Rockets: $7.77 million
</P>
<P>
   8. Scottie Pippen, Rockets: $6.6 million
</P>
<P>
   9. Larry Johnson, Knicks: $6.1 million
</P>
<P>
   10. Chris Webber, Kings: $6 million
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee guard Ray Allen. The rising star saved more than $3
million by negotiating his own six-year, $71-million contract
extension with the Bucks. Why use an agent when the system in place
dictates the maximum a player can receive?
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Charles Barkley. It took Sir Sap exactly two games to
berate a fan with expletives. In an otherwise successful campaign
to win back the fans, Barkley _ as usual _ comes off as vulgar.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTABLE
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I had Charlotte or the Dairy Queen in Sheboygan Falls.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Joe Wolf on his employment options when he signed with the
Hornets
</P>
<P>
   ``If losing means that we saved the season, traded off on a few
issues, protected free agency and most of the ``Larry Bird''
exception, then I can live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ NBA Players Association head Billy Hunter on whether his side
lost in the protracted lockout
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told myself that I was going to go work out hard, do it
and then see the scale and not see progress. Then I get low again
and feel like I'm wasting my time.''

 &HT;    Controversy over football dogs Auburn
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. _ To its loyal followers, Auburn _ both the town
and the university _ is not a location on a map but a place in the
heart. That is why the students, faculty, alumni and townspeople
who share this beloved space are often referred to as ``the Auburn
family.''
</P>
<P>
   But today the heart of Auburn is heavy and the family, to put it
charitably, is dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   When the school announced on Feb. 5 that it would pay $500,000
rather than play a football game with Florida State on Sept. 2, the
criticism of Auburn came quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The ACC called Auburn's actions ``reprehensible'' and suggested
that its members might not play the school in any sport in the
future. Newspaper columnists from New York to Los Angeles
challenged Auburn's institutional integrity. Talk shows questioned
the school's courage, suggesting that its battle cry of ``War
Eagle'' be replaced with ``War Chicken.'' Even the Wall Street
Journal weighed in negatively on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the nation this controversy will quickly disappear.
But for Auburn and its people, the Florida State flap is just the
latest in a string of embarrassing episodes brought about by its
football program.
</P>
<P>
   From the arrest last spring of wide receiver Robert Baker on a
cocaine possession charge, to the sudden and controversial
resignation of football coach Terry Bowden in October, to this
latest controversy, the students and supporters of this university
have been hammered with a litany of bad headlines over the past 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I talk to and the e-mail I receive basically ask
one thing,'' Lee Davidson, the editor of the Auburn Plainsman, the
student newspaper said. ``People just want to know when all this is
finally going to end.''
</P>
<P>
   On campus, there is resentment that the bad news created by the
football team continues to overshadow an impressive year in Auburn
athletics. The men's basketball team was 23-1 and ranked No. 3
going into Saturday's game with Alabama. The baseball team is
ranked in the top five. The women's basketball team is 18-5 and
headed to another NCAA Tournament. The swimming program is among
the best in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But around the state, the conversation about Auburn continues to
focus on a football program in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come to Auburn, you understand what the situation
is,'' said Casey Dunn, a senior catcher on the baseball team.
``They (football) put 85,000 people in the seats. We don't. I can't
complain about the way we are treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students are not as forgiving when they see the kind of
money being shelled out to fix football's self-imposed problems.
The $500,000 Auburn paid to Florida State could grow to $1.8
million if the ACC sues to recover lost television revenues.
Bowden's settlement with Auburn will pay him $620,000 in cash plus
other benefits. Two other former coaches, Pat Dye and Wayne Hall,
remain on the payroll (at over $100,000 each) for duties that are
vague at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spend money for football, for cleaning up football
messes, and we can't even get help for new wrestling mats,'' said
Chad Weaver, a sophomore on Auburn's club-level wrestling team.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest controversial episode also reopens an ongoing
discussion over who, exactly, is in charge of the Auburn athletics
department.
</P>
<P>
   David Housel, Auburn's highly-respected athletics director, has
been taking the lion's share of the heat over what he called ``an
institutional decision'' not to play the game with Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Auburn University President William Muse stepped
forward and said he supported Housel's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done the right thing because he's weighed all the factors
involved,'' said Muse. ``I have a great deal of respect for David.
I feel very strongly about him as a person and an administrator.''
</P>
<P>
   While Housel is the point man and receives strong support from
alumni, there is growing concern that the major decisions
concerning the school's athletics department are being made an hour
south of here, in the Montgomery offices of Bobby Lowder.
</P>
<P>
   Lowder, a multimillionaire banker, is without question the most
powerful man on the Auburn board of trustees and, say his critics,
is not bashful about using that power. He was the driving force
that brought Pat Dye to Auburn as head coach in 1981. He was
instrumental in hiring Bowden in 1993 and, if you believe his
critics, he was the man who told Bowden he would not be back in
1999, prompting the mid-season resignation. Lowder, contacted at
his office Friday, still denies he forced Bowden out.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that without Lowder's backing, both financial
and personal, Auburn would not have been able to lure Tommy
Tuberville away from Ole Miss to be its new coach. There has been
strong speculation on campus and around the SEC that Lowder
promised Tuberville last November that if he came to Auburn, he
would not have to play the Florida State game. Then Lowder left it
to Housel to do the dirty work.
</P>
<P>
   Lowder strongly denies that he had any hand in Auburn's decision
to pull out of the Florida State game.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the decision was basically made when Terry (Bowden)
resigned,'' said Lowder. ``Bobby Bowden (the Florida State coach)
said then he didn't want to play the game. In retrospect, maybe
that's when we should have done it. But David Housel's a nice guy
and he attempted to work through channels and get them (Florida
State) another opponent. But I agreed with it then and I agree with
it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowder denies that he is micromanaging the Auburn athletics
department and says his critics are a handful of academics who
don't like his management style, which he admits can be abrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a business worth about $10 billion,'' said Lowder. ``I
don't have time to manage the athletic department.''
</P>
<P>
   Some alumni, however, are growing increasingly uneasy with the
soap-opera that continues to surround this athletics program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an Auburn loyalist but I'm not a blind loyalist,'' said
Toby Propst of Atlanta, Auburn class of '57. ``I'm going to
withhold my judgement until I get all the truth and I haven't heard
it yet. But there are a lot of us who really wonder who's running
the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for nine months in the newspaper business, Housel has
spent the last 33 years on the Auburn campus. After graduating from
Auburn 1969, he worked his way from the athletic ticket office, to
sports information director, to athletics director in 1994. He is
the definitive ``Auburn man'' whose love of the university has
never been questioned, even by his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Housel's supporters feel he has been left out on a limb to take
the heat on issues like the Florida State decision and others that
are beyond his control. Given all the sins of the football program
over the past 12 months, they are afraid that Housel is going to be
offered up as a sacrificial lamb to calm the alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Both Lowder and Muse said Friday that they support Housel.
</P>
<P>
   Housel understands the concerns of the Auburn faithful and asks
for patience. He is convinced there are better days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand (why people are upset) because I want
something nice to happen to Auburn and the Auburn people deserve
it,'' said Housel. ``Obviously, we've taken some PR hits. We intend
to survive and carry on and go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning heals a lot of wounds and with Tuberville, Auburn should
win. The opening game of the 1999 season, now with I-AA Appalachian
State, is 201 days away. For Housel and others who love Auburn, it
can't come soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Auburn people are very passionate about their school and
they want to see the athletic program and the football team do what
they should,'' said Housel. ``That's one of the things that makes
this place special.''

 &HT;    Karl, Bucks try razzle-dazzle
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't bet against George Karl leading the Bucks into
the playoffs this abbreviated season. Karl's innovative style and
combustible personality always give his teams a chance for success.
</P>
<P>
   Karl's latest gimmick? In a victory over Charlotte, he played
Glenn Robinson at center against Derrick Coleman. Karl's
justification: ``It worked, didn't it?
</P>
<P>
   They're calling it the micro brew in Milwaukee and Robinson is
happy. ``It's given me a chance to work on a bigger guy, drive him
to the hole, maybe make my jump shot easier. It gives me a chance
to mix up my game offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   More good news for the Bucks was Ray Allen's decision to extend
his contract with them and the apparent agreement of point guard
Terrell Brandon to do the same, saying ``I'll take care of my
contract at the end of the year. The starting five other than
myself are under contract for three or four years. That's a plus
for the franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks now look a little better after the flip-flop draft
deal from 1996 when they gave up Stephon Marbury, but traded him
for the rights to Allen and Andrew Lang.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Allen paid Johnnie Cochrane $500 an hour to
negotiate his $70 million deal with owner Herb Kohl, the U.S.
senator.
</P>
<P>
   YOU HAVE THE TIME?
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson likes young Paul Pierce so much he's willing to
give him the watch off his wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him early in camp that if he wins Rookie of the Year,
I'll give him my Rolex watch,'' Anderson said. ``He's all revved up
about it. And every game I see him, it looks more and more like I'm
about to give it up, right?'' ... The Celtics not only beat Miami
108-101, they made an enemy of Pat Riley. After Terry Porter made
two free throws to get Miami within 104-99 with 10.8 seconds left,
Rick Pitino called a time out. As he and the Celtics were in their
huddle, Riley stood apart from his team and stared at them. Tim
Hardaway told Celtic players he and the Heat are going to remember
that time out. ... Boston's Dwayne Schintzius missed two games with
a broken nose, then re-broke it in warmups in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   PROBLEM SOLVED
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell's injury may give Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy
the opportunity to use him as the club's six man. Van Gundy was
considering that in pre-season. When Sprewell comes back from a
stress fracture in his right heel, he will need to play his way
back into the rotation, anyway. ... There was some outrage in New
York when the NBA rescinded Alonzo Mourning's opening-game
suspension stemming from a fight in the playoffs.
Mourning-antagonist Larry Johnson couldn't complain, though. The
league refunded about $80,000 it took from him after the incident.
... When the Nets' Jayson Williams shot 3-for-6 Thursday in a loss
to the Bucks, it ended two straight games without a hoop from the
center who broke his nose in Atlanta. He was 0-for-12 in that span.
</P>
<P>
   A DEARTH AT CENTER
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards are using a center-by-committee with three
offensively challenged players _ Terry Davis, Ben Wallace and Otis
Thorpe. That puts a lot of pressure on guards Rod Strickland and
Mitch Richmond. Washington wants to bring up Gheorghe Muresan, but
must wait at least two more weeks to see if Muresan is healthy
enough to even run down the court. Muresan had back surgery in the
offseason to relieve pressure from his spine. A fourth center,
Lorenzo Williams, is out for the season with stress fractures in
both feet.
</P>
<P>
   LAYUPS
</P>
<P>
   Life's a lot quieter on the road for the new Bulls, said
assistant coach Bill Cartwright: ``It was great. You just come in
and walk right to your room.'' ... After the Pistons beat the
Pacers, Detroit's Jerry Stackhouse was defiant. ``They haven't won
anything yet. The Pacers are just like us. Everybody acts like they
won it last year because Chicago is no longer in the fold.'' ...
Larry Bird also is unhappy with the Pacers. ``It's not good ...
when you start out like that.''

 &HT;    Barkley will delay surgery
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Make no mistake, Charles Barkley is hurting, but he
says he can deal with it. Swelling in his left knee convinced him
to get an MRI that revealed a partial tear of his medial meniscus.
Anti-inflammatory medication and some treatment should allow him to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the injury, Barkley has proceeded with business as
usual. Diagnosed on Tuesday, he went through the full shoot-around
Wednesday morning and played 36 minutes against the Kings, scoring
16 points with 16 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My knee is going to be sore,'' Barkley said. ``That's just
something I can't worry about anymore. It affects me, obviously. I
missed some shots I normally wouldn't miss because I can't explode
like I wanted to. But we made a decision to delay the surgery so I
can't complain about it. I just have to play through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said Dr. James Andrews of Hughston Clinic is among those
telling him to hold off on surgery. ``I'm going to try to play for
the next couple weeks and hopefully, I won't need surgery,''
Barkley said. ``I think I can play with the pain. I just want to
make sure it's not going to get worse. Pain I can
</P>
<P>
   deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   AW, POOR SHAQ
</P>
<P>
   Through Thursday, the Lakers are 33-21 with Shaquille O'Neal out
of the lineup, a .611 winning mark. With him in the lineup, they
are 87-28, .756. ``Nobody's going to feel sorry for us, not our
enemies, not our fans,'' Coach Del Harris said after O'Neal
suffered his latest injury in the second quarter of the Lakers'
victory over Denver on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's lower-stomach muscle pull is similar to common injuries
suffered by hockey players. Hawks assistant trainer Pete Radulovic,
who worked in that capacity for the L.A. Kings, says the only sure
fix is surgery.
</P>
<P>
   WARRIOR DISSENSION
</P>
<P>
   Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo had said before the season that he
thought depth would be the team's greatest strength. Instead, it's
a source of dissension.
</P>
<P>
   Center Erick Dampier, perhaps the least-vocal player on the
team, played only 20 minutes in a double-overtime loss to Dallas
and then played 21 against Seattle, then complained, ``I can't get
going by myself. The game is just starting. I've got to get in
there and break a sweat. In and out in five minutes, I don't think
you can get into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Delk, the team's most explosive scorer, played seven
minutes against Seattle. Jason Caffey, signed to a seven-year, $35
million contract, played 17 minutes. Donyell Marshall, last year's
starter at small forward, played six minutes, none in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   BETTYE FALK?
</P>
<P>
   Corliss Williamson lists Elbert Crawford as his agent. But every
decision goes through the Williamson &AMP; Son Janitorial Service in
Russellville, Ark. That's where Bettye Williamson presides as vice
president of the family-owned business. ``Mom is my real agent,''
Williamson says ``She's mom-slash-agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mom won't deny it. ``The paperwork still goes through me,'' she
said. ``My husband teases me all the time. He says, 'When are you
going to let him grow up?' I say, 'Never.'''
</P>
<P>
   A TRUE JAIL BLAZER
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers have a young forward named Art Long on the injured
list who fits with the team's Jail Blazer image. Long, 26, is a CBA
veteran with time in France, Argentina and Portugal. Last summer,
he served 27 days in an Ohio jail for violating probation after
reaching a plea bargain in a domestic-violence incident involving
his girlfriend while he was on academic suspension from
U-Cincinnati. He had also been on three years' probation for
selling marijuana to an undercover cop. But wait, Long and Danny
Fortson were arrested as disorderly and intoxicated and punching a
police horse. They were acquitted. Maybe the horse had it coming.
</P>
<P>
   LAYUPS
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Buss, on making Del Harris a lame duck by not giving him
an extension on his contract, which runs out this season: ``It's
not a problem with me.''

 &HT;    Falcons focus on re-signing Bradford, Burrough
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Like most NFL teams, the Falcons are moving
deliberately into the free-agent market, focusing first on
re-signing some of their own 11 unrestricted free-agent players.
</P>
<P>
   The first priority appears to be cornerback Ronnie Bradford, who
is considering a contract proposal by the Falcons after starting 10
regular-season games and the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford came to Atlanta before the 1997 season having starting
just 15 of 41 games in three years with Denver and one with
Arizona, and has proved to be perhaps the team's greatest bargain
of the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries to his ribs, left knee and shoulder caused him to miss
10 of 35 starts in two seasons. But despite modest athletic
abilities, he has surpassed expectations playing opposite Pro Bowl
cornerback Ray Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   In two seasons, Bradford has 91 total tackles, 25 passes
defensed and seven interceptions in 30 regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   His base salary was $300,000 in 1997 and $450,000 last season.
</P>
<P>
   In talks early in the season, the Falcons were willing to nearly
double his salary but only wanted to sign him through 2000.
Bradford and his agent, Peter Schaffer of Denver, are believed to
be seeking a three-year deal that averages at least $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Schaffer wants to know how the Falcons will use Bradford, but
the team is having a tough time saying. Meanwhile, several teams,
including Cincinnati, have inquired about his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronnie has an interest in returning to the Falcons,'' Schaffer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also want to re-sign four-year reserve defensive end
John Burrough, who played last season on a one-year, $397,000
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Despite modest career numbers of 102 total tackles and 1.5
sacks, Burrough is drawing interest from several teams.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta also has shown interest in re-signing starting strong
safety William White, who will be 33 next season. His age works
against him, especially considering free safety Eugene Robinson
will be 36, and White is somewhat one-dimensional, as the team
replaced him in passing situations.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and Omar Brown, who played in just two of 16 games, are
the only safeties under contract.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve safety Devin Bush, the team's 1995 first-round draft
choice, has scheduled visits to St. Louis, Pittsburgh and the Jets,
and agreed to visit Washington, Chicago and Cincinnati. He started
most of his first three seasons before serving as a backup in
Atlanta last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Falcons) told us (Friday) they want him back,'' Bush's
agent, David Levine, said. ``It's been a sizzling market for Devin.
He would return if (the circumstances) were right, but I think it's
a longshot.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta officials have not yet inquired about quarterback Mark
Rypien.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons allowed Rypien, 36, to keep half the $400,000
signing bonus they gave him last season before he decided to sit
out the season because of family illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves said last week the team could be interested in
a quarterback like Rypien.

 &HT;    NFL's '99 free agent crop thin
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For most of the first six years of free agency in the
NFL, too many personnel directors approached spring signing period
like those daredevil cliff divers of Acapulco: Jump first and deal
with the consequences later.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the market opened for business Friday, those general
managers were surveying the 1999 free-agent waters with
deliberation. Even franchises that would have been performing
free-agency half-gainers in other years were reluctant to stick
their toes in the surf this time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this talent pool, there is no deep end,'' Green Bay general
manager Ron Wolf said. ``In the last couple years, most teams have
gotten smarter and concluded you're better off retaining your own
best players. You don't win with free agents. The teams that regard
it as a panacea get into trouble year after year.''
</P>
<P>
   Most personnel directors spent the days before Friday trying to
re-sign their potential defectors. On Thursday alone, clubs either
re-signed or applied ``franchise'' designations to seven players
who otherwise would have been included in the
Journal-Constitution's annual rating of the top 30 unrestricted
free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Several general managers noted that 61 percent of the 84 players
originally selected for the Pro Bowl game are still with the team
that drafted them. Only 28 Pro Bowl players, or 33 percent, came to
their current teams as free agents. Miami coach Jimmy Johnson
emphasized that only four Pro Bowl players changed teams in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos, who are an exception,
include 12 former free agents and two players acquired in trades
among their 22 starters. The standard in free-agency often has been
set by teams such as Carolina, which spent a record $27 million on
free agents in '98 and won only four games, and Washington, which
paid $16.4 million for defensive tackles Dana Stubblefield and Dan
Wilkinson but still rated only No. 28 against the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how few players perform as well with their new
teams as they did with their old ones,'' Cincinnati coach Bruce
Coslet said.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis general manager Bill Polian said, ``First off, the
cost of signing a player is prohibitive. And second, you are
severely punished if you make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   One team that won't have to worry about salary-cap implications
is the expansion Cleveland Browns. The club spent just $18.06
million to acquire 37 players in Tuesday's allocation draft. Even
accounting for a rookie pool that probably will be in the $6
million range, the Browns are more than $30 million under the 1999
cap limit of $57.288 million.
</P>
<P>
   Team president Carmen Policy, whose cap manipulation with the
San Francisco 49ers was legendary, and director of football
operations Dwight Clark have made no pretense about their
intentions to corner the market. The Browns are hot on the trails
of such highly regarded players as defensive ends Chad Bratzke
(N.Y. Giants) and Derrick Alexander (Minnesota) and center Wally
Williams (Baltimore).
</P>
<P>
   ``They can go as high as they want to on a guy, blow everyone
else right out of the water,'' Giants general manager Ernie Accorsi
said.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans general manager Bill Kuharich said, ``The Browns can
drain the pool.''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns' bounty represents about one-fourth of the cap room
available in the league. The anticipated spending spree by a team
that some GMs joke should be called the ``Greens'' will further
deplete the pool already thinned by re-signings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every agent you talk to thinks he's taking his guys to
Cleveland, and every player you talk to has you believing he's on a
flight there tomorrow,'' Pittsburgh director of football operations
Tom Donahoe said. ``But they can't sign 400 players, you know?
Sooner or later, they run out of roster space or cap room.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Browns take five or six of the high-profile players out
of the market the effect might be an upgrading of lesser-talented
veterans. A quick survey on Friday indicated that some of the
players who were drawing the most early attention were veterans who
never have gone to a Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh strong safety and former Georgia Tech standout Lethon
Flowers already had six visits scheduled and turned down $2 million
a year to stay with the Steelers. The Falcons' Devin Bush, a former
starter used primarily as a nickel safety in '98, had at least five
teams inquire about him. Journeyman backup Rich Gannon of the
Chiefs, who has just 56 starts in 10 seasons, is the most ardently
pursued quarterback before signing with Oakland Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Teams will look at San Francisco wide receiver J.J. Stokes,
recall the colossal flop of former Dallas wide receiver Alvin
Harper a few years ago and back off. The 49ers vet has never been a
lead receiver and a team might be able to land just as good a
player, such as Washington wideout Leslie Shepherd, for a cheaper
price.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're seeing so far,'' agent Eric Metz said. ``The
midlevel players are the ones getting the early action.

 &HT;    NHL's `Jackie Robinson'
 &HT;    By Jeff Schutlz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NHL's march to the 20th century continues.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 13 blacks among the NHL's some-700 players this
season, including 10 currently on rosters. Folks, that represents a
record high.
</P>
<P>
   Racism? No. Although Willie O'Ree, the NHL's first black player,
in 1958, said he encountered racist remarks from fans and opposing
players on the ice, he never got the feeling from teammates he
wasn't wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call me the Jackie Robinson of hockey,'' said O'Ree, now
63, ``but I didn't have to put up with the racism Jackie put up
with when he was playing in the Southern states. Sure, some things
were said by some fans. But I was prepared for it. I was a black
boy living in a white area. Ninety-seven percent of my friends were
white. I was the only black on a number of the athletic teams I
played on. But hockey was my love.''
</P>
<P>
   Those last few words are seldom spoken by blacks in North
America, but O'Ree believes the situation is changing. He was in
Atlanta last week to help start the Atlanta Thrashers'
street-hockey program. Two dozen African-American youths held
hockey sticks and slapped around a ball at the Warren Boys &AMP; Girls
clubs, getting instruction from team officials and O'Ree, who is
the director of youth development for the NHL's diversity task
force.
</P>
<P>
   O'Ree was hired last year by commissioner Gary Bettman. Bryant
McBride, the NHL's vice president of business development, avoided
taking a shot at past league executives, such as former
commissioner John Ziegler, but he said, ``Gary Bettman wanted to
grow the league in all areas, at all levels. We saw Willie as an
important piece of that puzzle. The reason we're doing things like
this is to give kids the opportunity. If, as a byproduct, the Tiger
Woods of hockey comes along, wonderful. It would be the ultimate if
an inline skater from our program put on ice skates one day and
made it to the NHL. Imagine what would happen if we had that one
breakthrough player, a 6-3, 210-pound linebacker type who decided
hockey was on his radar. That would change the game.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Ree played with 11 teams in six leagues before retiring in
1980. Only 45 games in parts of two seasons (two in 1958, 43 in
1960-61) came in the NHL with Boston, who integrated before the Red
Sox did with shortstop Pumpsie Green in 1959. After his final game
with the Bruins in '61, 30 years passed before he heard from an NHL
official.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe that?'' O'Ree said. ``Thirty years after I left
the league, I get a call from a gentleman in the NHL in 1991, and
he invites me to the All-Star game in Chicago. I said, `Why do you
want me?' and he started talking about how I was a pioneer and all
that. So my wife and I went, and we had a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the NHL created a diversity task force, in part
to help at-risk kids get access to ice hockey. McBride felt the
program needed ``a culminating event,'' so he called O'Ree in La
Mesa, Calif., and asked if he would lend his name to an annual
All-Star game for 10- to 12-year-old boys and girls. The fourth
Willie O'Ree All-Star weekend will be held Feb. 27-28 in
Washington. The next step was up to Bettman, who hired O'Ree as a
league employee last February.
</P>
<P>
   There was a 17-year lapse between the first black NHL player
(O'Ree) and the second (Mike Marson with Washington). But O'Ree
sees promise, pointing to long-time goalie Grant Fuhr of St. Louis,
as well as young players like Boston's Anson Carter and Edmonton's
Mike Grier.
</P>
<P>
   None of them had to overcome the obstacles O'Ree did. The New
Brunswick native lost vision in his right eye at the age of 18 when
he was hit by a puck in the juniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor told me I'd never play hockey again,'' O'Ree said.
``But that doctor didn't know what my dream was.

 &HT;    Tampay Bay's Williams ready to bolt
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The pronouncement from former Georgia high school
football coach and insurance executive Art Williams that he will
sell the Tampa Bay Lightning if he can't bring in a partner soon
should not come as a great surprise. Aside from the Bolts'
projected financial losses of $20 million this season, Williams has
not dealt with the losing well. He fired general manager Phil
Esposito only two games into the season and has been bouncing off
the walls while Esposito's replacement, GM-coach Jacques Demers,
has preached patience with young players. Williams, who is used to
having total control and expecting quick results, increased the
Lightning's payroll and improved travel conditions, but the result
has been a seven-game losing streak and league-worst record of
11-37-4 going into Saturday's game against San Jose. The
near-20,000 seat Ice Palace is half empty for most home games.
Williams says he will keep the team if he can find an investor by
this summer. What he didn't say was that he hired an investment
firm in mid-December _ only seven months after purchasing the team
and Ice Palace for $117 million _ and didn't get a nibble for six
weeks. Many people think he already has decided to sell the team
and arena outright, even if at a loss. Williams admits he has
stayed away from home games, saying, ``I haven't been coming to
games recently for a simple reason _ this team broke my heart. ...
I couldn't have been happier the first month of the season _ then
the bottom fell out. I've been more upset with the constant losing
than all the money coming out of my wallet.'' But that has not sat
well with fans, one of whom told the Tampa Tribune: ``How does he
expect people to come out and support his team when he can't come
out and support it himself? Does he think he's the only one whose
heart is broken?'' Demers and assistant coach Rick Paterson blew up
at radio announcer Larry Hirsch in a staff meeting the other day
when Hirsch called the team ``a car with four dead tires'' and
suggested a return to two-a-day practices. No wonder Williams wants
out.
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina, still struggling at the gate, has hired Richard Petty
to do advertising spots going into next season. One commercial
depicts him driving a hot-rod Zamboni with forward Keith Primeau as
a passenger. ``I can't sell 'em on hockey, '' Petty said, ``but I
think I can slow 'em down enough so that, if they take a look at
hockey, they'll like it.'' . . . . Petr Nedved had 21 points in his
first 16 games as a Ranger but had only six points in the next 16.
... The potential sixth season in Pavel Bure's five-year, $47.5
million deal is at Florida's option. But there are incentives
within the deal that could switch it to Bure's option. He would
make $11 million in the 2004-05 season. ... Mario Lemieux made his
strongest statement yet about possibly heading a group to
purchasing the bankrupt Penguins, saying, ``We've been working
pretty hard the last couple of months to put some investors
together, not only to buy the team but to make sure it stays in
Pittsburgh.'' ... For what it's worth, Wayne Gretzky has the worst
plus-minus rating _ minus-14 _ on the Rangers' roster.

 &HT;    Thrashers close to sealing rink contract
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Contracts are still ``about a week away'' from being
signed, but Ice Forum president and founder Jack Burton
acknowledges that a deal to build the Thrashers their permanent
practice facility is close to completion. ``We're very glad to have
the Thrashers associated with us,'' Burton said. ``It's a great
match.'' The Thrashers will practice at the Ice Forum in Duluth,
one of four rinks owned by Burton. The facility currently has only
one sheet of ice, but Burton estimates that he will spend $3.2
million to build another rink and a 15,000-square-foot addition
that will house a locker room, training equipment and offices for
the team's coaches and general manager Don Waddell. The team's top
executives will keep their offices at CNN Center. Burton is
confident that the training facility and offices will be completed
by early August _ training opens Sept. 4 _ and the additional sheet
of ice possibly soon after. ``In the event the second sheet of ice
is not ready in time, they'll use the existing rink,'' Burton said.
Burton will recoup some of his investment with a long-term lease
with the Thrashers. He also said the deal will include ``some
promotional perks that are quite substantial,'' such as players
making personal appearances. ... Hoping to milk as much publicity
as possible out of the release of the team's jersey, the Thrashers
will unveil their togs at an event in March. Details have not been
completed. ... Before the start of a news conference the other day
to announce the team's street-hockey program at the Warren Boys and
Girls Club, an NHL official covered the ``Pro Player'' logo on
Willie O'Ree's polo shirt with black tape, so as not to upset
officials at Nike, the program's sponsors. ... Waddell is wearing
his new diamond-stuffed Stanley Cup ring, which is valued at
approximately $13,000. Waddell, who spent only one year with
Detroit, did not go to the White House with the Red Wings recently.
But he did go last year, when the team was honored for the title
the year before.RED LIGHT DISTRICT

 &HT;    Honeymoon (continued) in Nashville
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For a team that entered the weekend 11 games under
.500, things could be a lot worse in Nashville. The first of at
least three sellout crowds in a row watched the Predators lose to
Detroit the other night. Former Flames forward Curt Bennett said,
``I was at the game, and it was unbelievably loud, even though they
were losing.'' It doesn't hurt at the box office when consecutive
home games are scheduled against the Red Wings, the two-time
defending Stanley Cup champions; Pittsburgh, with Jaromir Jagr; and
the New York Rangers, with Wayne Gretzky. Just to add to the
goodwill with fans, the Predators announced they would not increase
ticket prices next season, although a price increase in a season or
two could end the honeymoon quickly. Nashville might be one of only
seven teams in the league to show a profit this season. On the ice,
the team sits near the bottom of the Western Conference standings
but remains within reach of a playoff berth. Forward Patrick Cote
said, ``I really can't imagine what that would be like. I know our
place would be absolutely rocking.''

<P>
   WILY COYOTES
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix officials are considering a plan to accept $10 million
in renovations at America West Arena rather than pursue a new home.
The arena, designed as a basketball-only facility, has
approximately 4,500 obstructed seats in a hockey setup. The
Coyotes' situation has become a source of irritation for Suns owner
and arena operator Jerry Colangelo, who lured the hockey team to
Phoenix from Winnipeg. Richard Burke has complained about lost
revenue and the poor ice quality at America West, putting more
pressure on Colangelo and the community to get something done.
Taxpayers have footed the bill for a new baseball stadium, and the
Arizona Cardinals have asked for a new stadium, so it might not be
the right political climate for the Coyotes to get a new venue
approved.

   Chicago general manager Bob Murray is mum on rumors that have
him dealing forward Doug Gilmour to Buffalo. The Blackhawks signed
Gilmour as a free agent for $18 million over three years, but
Gilmour is struggling, and the team is in last place in the Central
Division. ``Trade rumors are part of the game,'' Gilmour said.
``But if you're asking me, 'Did I ask for a trade?' _ no.'' ... San
Jose's Mike Ricci on the team's 10-game, 17-day road trip: ``We
started (the season with two games) in Japan, and now we have this.
Maybe our last five games should be in Russia.'' ... After going
0-59-10 in games they trailed after two periods, St. Louis won
consecutive games with third-period comebacks over Florida (5-4)
and Tampa Bay (5-4). ... Detroit is in the middle of five games
against teams with losing records. Good thing: The Wings are 6-16-1
against opponents that are .500 or better. ... From Edmonton center
Doug Weight: ``My first full year, I had 74 stitches in my face,
one for every point I had. I went home for Christmas and had (sets
of) seven, seven and eight stitches in my face. My mom looked at me
and said, 'I don't think you should go back.'''

NEW SEASON HAS MARTIN GUNNING FOR DAYTONA 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Most years, seven victories and 22
top-five finishes would have earned a Nascar Winston Cup
championship for Mark Martin. But it wasn't enough in 1998, when
despite having the best season of his career, he was the runner-up
to Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Compare Martin's finishes with Gordon's last year, and one
statistic jumps off the page. On the circuit's restrictor-plate
races (the high-banked oval tracks at Daytona and Talladega) Martin
saw his championship hopes snagged by poor finishes.
</P>
<P>
   In the races at Daytona, Martin lost valuable points, placing
38th and 16th; at two races at Talladega, he finished 23d and 34th.
Gordon, on the other hand, had top-five finishes in three of the
four races at those tracks on the way to winning his third title in
four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a brand new car, a brand new team last year and that
showed,'' said Martin, who was also the Winston Cup runner-up in
1990 and 1994. ``It wasn't our fault on the big tracks. We got
caught up in a few wrecks and broke a valve spring one time. But
we've made great gains on the car this winter. Every year is a
learning experience, an evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the green flag waves over the 41st running of the
Daytona 500, stock car racing's biggest event, and Martin, driver
of the Valvoline Ford Taurus, can get his season on track by
finishing up front on the 2.5-mile oval. He will roll off the
starting grid ninth while Gordon has the pole.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's 1999 season got off to a promising start last Sunday
when he drove down victory lane at Daytona for the first time in a
stock car after winning the Bud Shootout, a non-points race.
Martin's team owner, Jack Roush, hopes the recent breakthrough
victory is a sign of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Martin deserved to win that championship'' Gordon said,
referring to last year's points race. ``He had a great season. He's
done everything he has ever been asked to do. Maybe it's his
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But he added that you still don't want Martin to beat
you.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to getting his car in tune during the off season,
Martin's mind is more at ease now and so is his heart. Last August,
his father, Julian Martin, whom he was very close to, his
stepmother and half-sister were killed when their private plane
crashed. The accident occurred in the middle of a heated Nascar
season, and Martin didn't miss a race. He soldiered on, won races
and managed to be the only car to challenge Gordon late in the
season. ``It was a tough year in a lot of ways,'' Martin said,
lowering his head. ``It was hard on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he wonders how he was able to continue on with the
season after plane crash. But anyone who has spent much time around
Martin knows that he is unflappable, his focus intensifies when he
is faced with adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the curse of my personality,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who is 5-foot-6-inches tall and weighs 150 pounds, is
not your typical stock car driver. He is most different when it
comes to his physical fitness. Martin is one of, if not the,
fittest drivers in Nascar. No barbecue for him, he prefers bagels.
His days often begin with a strenuous workout. His regimented
routine calls for him to wake up a 5:30 a.m. and to be in bed by 9
p.m. That's why, even at 40 years old, Martin does not think twice
about driving in a Busch series race the night before he climbs
into his Winston Cup ride.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's strategy for winning his first Daytona 500 is to drive
hard, drive smart and pray that nothing breaks. Daytona is one of
two tracks where Nascar requires carburetor restrictor plates to
slow the cars to protect drivers and fans. But the devices rob the
engine of almost half of its horsepower and makes the field
unnaturally even, keeping the cars close, which means that wrecks
are a virtual certainty.
</P>
<P>
   The situation makes patience a necessity. If a driver steps out
of one of the drafts at Daytona without another car to help, he
might drop 15 positions instead of advancing.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt, who won last year's Daytona 500, will start
Sunday's race from the fourth spot, the same place he started last
year. Once again, he showed why he is one of the favorites by
dominating his 125-mile qualifying race on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The other favorites: Gordon, who starts his bid for a third
straight title and fourth in five years; Bobby Labonte, who
dominated the restrictor-plate races last season and was the
pole-winner and second-place finisher in the Daytona 500 last year
and won the other 125-miler on Thursday; Rusty Wallace, who was
strong last week; Dale Jarrett, who is a two-time winner here;
Earnhardt's teammate Mike Skinner; Gordon's teammate Terry Labonte,
Bobby's older brother; and Tony Stewart, who will make his first
career start from the front row.
</P>
<P>
   There is a $1 million bonus that can be won by Jarrett, Gordon,
Terry Labonte, Spencer or Mayfield, the top-five finishers in last
fall's Winston 500 at Talladega. If any of those five win the race,
they will collect the bonus plus the $1.1 million winner's share of
the record purse, which exceeds $8 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget Martin, whose car was fifth fastest in
qualifying last weekend. But not everyone is convinced that Martin
has the car to win. When listing who he thought should be favored
for Sunday's race, Jeremy Mayfield, Wallace's teammate, omitted
Martin. ``I'm not sure about Mark,'' he said. ``He's been fast this
week, but there are a lot of cars faster than him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do is give your very best,'' Martin said. ``In
racing, the result is uncontrollable. But the effort is
controllable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do it last year,'' Martin, shrugging his shoulders.
``I just hope we can be as blessed again and have the kind of
season we had in 1998.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: USING PHONY NUMBERS TO PUSH FOR TAX CUTS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Feb. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Just how high are taxes?
</P>
<P>
   Very high and rising rapidly, according to statistics being used
by senators pushing for big tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taxes are at their highest level since World War II,'' wrote
Paul Coverdell and Robert Torricelli, U.S. senators, in an Op-Ed
article in this newspaper last week. ``In 1997, the median income
for a two-earner family was $55,000, $22,000 of which went to pay
federal, state and local taxes. Adjusted for inflation, that is
triple the burden it was in 1955. In other words, families would
have had $13,000 more in annual income had the tax burden remained
constant.''
</P>
<P>
   Is all that true? The short answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is accurate, some badly distorted. The paragraph does
a much better job of illustrating how statistics can be abused than
it does of shedding light on tax burdens.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that tax collections have risen faster, on an
overall basis, than anyone expected. In fiscal 1998 total federal
tax and fee receipts were 20.5 percent of the nation's gross
domestic product, up from 18.4 percent in 1994 and the highest
since 1944, when the figure was 20.9 percent. Thus the first
sentence quoted above is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Why did tax receipts go up so rapidly? It was not due to changes
in the law. The last big tax increase was passed in 1993 and was
completely in place in 1994. The 1997 tax act actually cut taxes
for many, particularly families with children. The answer is that
the strong economy has increased tax receipts, and soaring stock
prices have pushed up capital gains and the taxes paid on them.
That surge explains the current budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   But how has that median-income family done? The senators' staffs
say they relied on a study by the Tax Foundation, a
Washington-based research organization. But that study is
questionable. Moreover, the senators distort its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The study assumes that all money taken in by the federal, state
and local governments came from individuals, whether payments were
made by people, companies or even ranchers who were not paying
taxes but simply leasing government land to let their cattle graze.
But while adding in taxes that people do not pay to their tax
burden, the study does not make similar adjustments to income.
</P>
<P>
   Consider one example. The study allocates corporate income tax
payments to shareholders as if they had paid the taxes out of their
own pockets. The taxes allocated to any shareholder are far greater
than the dividends that shareholder received. People who own a lot
of stock would be shown as paying taxes far in excess of their
income.
</P>
<P>
   Is that fair? ``It would be an exaggeration,'' conceded J.D.
Foster, the Tax Foundation's executive director and chief
economist, adding that he had never considered the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the Tax Foundation's income figures include capital
gains. But the tax-payment numbers do.
</P>
<P>
   One adjustment the Tax Foundation does make in calculating the
tax burden is to add to income the Social Security tax paid by
employers. That is proper, but it was ignored by the senators when
they quoted the median income figure for a two-earner family of
$55,000, which does not include the Social Security tax, and the
tax burden of $22,000, which does.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse is the senators' statement that the tax burden has
tripled. That is based on the Tax Foundation's conclusion that a
median family in 1955 paid $8,000 in taxes, adjusted for inflation.
Triple that and you get, more or less, $22,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Tax Foundation, to its credit, made no such statement. By
its calculations, the tax burden for such a family in 1955 was 27.9
percent, compared with 37.6 percent in 1997. That is an increase,
but it is far from a tripling. The latest figure, by the way, is
virtually unchanged from the 1985 level.
</P>
<P>
   How do the senators defend their numbers?
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Coverdell referred queries to Torricelli, whose
spokeswoman said the numbers were justified by the Tax Foundation
report.
</P>
<P>
   Just why 1955 is a good comparison year is not clear. But if one
wants to use it, remember that since then the government has
increased Social Security benefits substantially and begun the
Medicare system. People in 1955 who were helping to support aging
parents might have preferred the 1999 system.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether taxes should be cut when the government
is running a boom-induced surplus is a complicated one. Using
dubious numbers does not help the debate.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, watched the Dec. 19
House vote to impeach President Clinton, and the vicious partisan
brawling that preceded it, with a sense of foreboding. Christmas
was still six days away, but the holiday season ended for her as
she followed the House proceedings from the living room of her home
in the coastal town of Falmouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that Christmas was over that day,'' Ms. Snowe, a
moderate, recalled on Friday after the Senate found Clinton not
guilty of the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice brought
by the House. She voted against both articles.
</P>
<P>
   Like other members of the Senate, she knew that Clinton's
conviction and removal from office were unlikely. With other
members of the Senate, she began immediately searching for a way to
avoid the political horrors of the House while carrying out their
constitutional duty.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the House voted to impeach Clinton, Ms. Snowe sat
down to sketch out her goals for the impending trial in the Senate:
bipartisanship, dignity, adherence to historical precedent and a
quick and fair conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers and advisers wanted much the same thing
as the Senate leadership and moderates like Ms. Snowe _ plus, of
course, acquittal by the widest possible margin. They also were
determined to demolish the charges brought by the House and to
portray the entire exercise as illegitimate and nakedly political.
</P>
<P>
   In a Senate that cherished bipartisanship far more than did the
fractious House, the White House lawyers and political strategists
knew that they faced uncertain terrain. It was unclear going into
the trial whether the president could depend on the support of all
the Democrats, some of whom had harshly criticized his behavior,
but it was also more possible to fashion a defense that would
appeal to independent-minded Republicans like Ms. Snowe.
</P>
<P>
   But White House expectations in late December and early January
were low. One senior White House official said at the time that he
expected the president would ultimately be found not guilty, but
not until after a long and gruesome trial lasting as long as six
months.
</P>
<P>
   The third set of actors in the Senate drama _ the House
prosecutors _ had a wholly different agenda. They wanted a full and
extended trial, with testimony from dozens of witnesses, ending in
the removal of the president. But they, too, had little hope of
getting their way in the notoriously self-important Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were entering alien territory,'' said Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., who led the 13 Republican House ``managers'' who
presented the case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the major players achieved some of their goals. The
Senate as an institution emerged less bloodied by the process than
the House, and fewer nerve endings were left raw from the political
conflict. The trial ended on Friday with handshakes across the
aisle and promises to work together on issues of policy from Social
Security to military spending.
</P>
<P>
   The president was found not guilty but hardly vindicated. Even
his most effective advocate before the Senate, former Sen. Dale
Bumpers, D-Ark., had described Clinton's behavior as
``indefensible, outrageous, unforgivable, shameless'' as the
president watched on a small television in his private study off
the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecution team walked away with the fewest spoils.
Their wish list of witnesses was whittled down to three _ Monica
Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal _ and they appeared
on the Senate floor only as ephemeral two-dimensional figures on
television screens. The prosecutors managed to win only 45 votes to
convict the president on the first of two articles of impeachment
and 50 votes on the second. And they did little to repair the image
of the House Republicans as a group hellbent on embarrassing and
ejecting a popular president.
</P>
<P>
   None of the actors could claim victory after 13 months of
revelation and public revulsion. But the Constitution bore up well
under the strain, and the president and congressional leaders vowed
to try to forget the agony and the anger of the journey just ended.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a brief Rose Garden statement on Friday, called for
a time of ``reconciliation and renewal for America'' and indicated
he was prepared to forgive those who tried to get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, members traded congratulations on the floor and
said the trial might even have strengthened the institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we preserved the dignity of the Senate,'' said Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who voted to convict Clinton on both
impeachment charges. ``It ended as the founders intended it to.''
</P>
<P>
   Gathered with his prosecution team in the House Judiciary
Committee hearing room where the impeachment proceedings began last
fall, Hyde was bowed but not resentful. ``I have no regrets,'' he
said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone calls from jittery senators, haunted by the House
impeachment proceedings, followed Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the
majority leader, everywhere during the Christmas break. His cell
phone rang in the middle of the Cotton Bowl, where he sat with Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, at his side. It rang as he bounced
his baby granddaughter on his knee at his son's house. It rang in
the car, in the office and at home in Pascagoula, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Lott spoke so often to Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., the minority
leader, that the two practically had a hot line.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators insisted to Lott that they wanted a short trial
with no witnesses. Others wanted a full trial with live testimony.
All of them fretted about the impact on the Senate, and they
wondered if they could trust each other _ Republicans and Democrats
_ to keep it civilized.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., called an old friend, Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., and one of Lott's confidants, who was heading to
Hawaii with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you say anything, I know why you called,'' Lieberman
remembers Gorton saying. ``I was about to call you for the same
reason. We have got to start talking about how the Senate handles
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation was the genesis of a plan that would set the
tone of cooperation that Lott and Daschle hoped to establish.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The details were in flux, but almost everyone agreed on the
goal: preserving the dignity of the Senate. Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky., said, ``Having a sense that the outcome was not in doubt, it
fell in two categories: Honor the Constitution and do as little
damage to the institution as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lieberman-Gorton dialogue had the quiet assent of Republican
and Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The two, who talked five times a day over the holidays,
fashioned a plan that could perhaps avert a final vote on the
articles of impeachment by taking a test vote on the charges and
the evidence. The idea appealed to Lott, who found the idea of a
long trial with a slew of witnesses distasteful. ``He is a
realist,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate conservatives furiously rejected the proposal, and by
the time the new Senate reconvened the first week in January, the
plan was nearly doomed.
</P>
<P>
   At the first Republican caucus, conservatives refused to curtail
the trial in any way. ``People wanted a final vote on the articles,
even if it was a losing vote,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The trial would proceed, but first the two sides had to agree on
a framework.
</P>
<P>
   On. Jan. 7, a Thursday, Lott, Daschle and their lawyers tried to
work out a plan, but it foundered on the question of witnesses.
Republicans wanted the right to summon witnesses; Democrats wanted
none, or at most a sharply limited number.
</P>
<P>
   The next day 100 Democrats and Republican gathered in a
bipartisan caucus behind the closed doors of the ornate Old Senate
Chamber to salvage the process. Republicans were hoping the meeting
would soften Democrats, especially Daschle. Democrats were hoping
the conservative hard-liners would be moved by the history of the
moment and agree to their plan.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until the very end of the caucus that a
breakthrough occurred.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the two sides discuss their proposals for the
trial, Gramm stood up and called the two plans identical except for
the differences over witnesses. ``I rise today not as Massachusetts
man, or as a New Englander, but as American,'' Gramm said, quoting
Daniel Webster. He suggested that the Senate proceed with the
trial, postponing the question of which witnesses to call and how
many.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   With the liberal and the conservative in agreement, Lott seized
the moment. ``Let's put it in writing,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, in effect, put off the difficult question of witnesses
and began the historic proceeding with a unanimous 100-0 vote on
procedure. It was to be the last unanimous vote of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers and top political advisers were in a
grim mood on the morning of Dec. 19 as they gathered in the office
of John Podesta, the White House chief of staff. They knew that
later that day the House would approve two articles of impeachment
against the president, marking Clinton forever as only the second
American president to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   But they were not prepared for the announcement that morning
from Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., who was the Speaker-designate,
before the first vote was tallied. He was quitting his post and
leaving the House because of reports of marital infidelities,
Livingston said, and he urged the president to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The group in Podesta's office fell silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked,'' said one senior member of the president's
legal team who was present. ``I felt, Jesus, we're at a point where
we're eating our own. It genuinely scared me. I was shaking. The
whole thing seemed to me to be very, very mean and very unstable.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's men decided that something had to be done, and
quickly, to stop what they feared might become an avalanche of
calls for Clinton to follow Livingston's lead and resign, as
Livingston had himself suggested in his stunning remarks on the
House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, White House press secretary, bolted into the Oval
Office and asked the president what he wanted to say. According to
Lockhart's handwritten notes of the conversation, Clinton wanted
his spokesman to immediately issue a statement urging Livingston to
reconsider. ``He's a decent guy and doesn't deserve it,'' Lockhart
remembers the president's saying to him about Livingston. ``The
politics of personal destruction has to stop here,'' the president
added.
</P>
<P>
   The shock waves of the Livingston resignation spread far beyond
the West Wing of the White House and had a sobering effect on
members of Congress of both parties who might have been
contemplating calling for Clinton to step down in the aftermath of
the impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of the entire government unraveling, very few members of
Congress joined a clamor for Clinton's resignation. The president
had dodged one of the most potentially hazardous moments of the
entire impeachment battle.
</P>
<P>
   But still the trial lay ahead. Clinton's lawyers regrouped after
the impeachment vote and began to plot a strategy for defeating the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   There was agreement within both the legal and political councils
of the White House that they had botched the handling of the House
debate, underestimating the resolve of House Republicans and giving
insufficient attention to answering the legal charges raised by
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   They vowed not to make that mistake again before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we thought going into the trial was that we had to
aggressively make the case that the charges brought by the House
managers were a house of cards, and that's exactly what we did,''
said one senior White House official.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just before New Year's, the 13 House managers sat in the
Judiciary Committee conference room, which they had labeled ``the
War Room,'' with doughnuts and coffee spread across the oversized
table. They were almost giddy about their new role as prosecutors,
picturing an expansive courtroom drama, a full trial with witnesses
galore and fiery cross-examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Although almost everyone in Washington was predicting that it
would be impossible to garner a two-thirds majority to convict the
president in the Senate, Hyde and his colleagues had confidence in
their case. They were less certain of the Senate terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate did not want salacious testimony brought to its
hallowed chamber, the managers well knew. While the article of
impeachment charging the president with perjury was mired in the
lurid details of who touched whom and where, the managers, led by
Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., saw greater promise in the obstruction
case, the impeachment article that had drawn a weaker vote from
their House colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   They hoped to call 15 to 18 witnesses, a roster that included
the stars as well as the bit players: The videographer who had
taped the president's deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit, an
expert on sexual harassment, Secret Service agents, a judge and
even Dick Morris, the sometime presidential adviser. ``We were
being very generous in those days,'' Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn.,
recalled wistfully in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   But word came, indirectly and almost immediately, that Lott was
unenthusiastic about witnesses. He was even considering ending the
trial before a vote on the final articles, something being floated
in his caucus.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, Daschle kept the White House informed of
his strategy for handling the proceeding and keeping Democrats
united, but did not seek advice from the president or his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   He made it clear to Clinton that he should keep his distance
because any heavy-handed efforts to lobby senators would be seen as
tampering with the jury and would surely backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made mention of the fact at some point that I didn't want
calls made to senators,'' Daschle said on Friday. ``I just felt
there had to be some separation here and that lobbying in this case
would be unseemly, and they respected that. I don't know of one
call that the White House made to one senator.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they took Daschle's advice and
deliberately avoided inserting themselves into Senate
deliberations. But there was a constant stream of contacts between
top White House political aides under the direction of Steve
Ricchetti, the deputy chief of staff, and Daschle and his aides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also spoke frequently with a handful of Democratic
senators to ``take their pulse,'' as one aide put it. Clinton's
closest contacts were with Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey,
Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa and
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president wasn't disengaged or oblivious,'' said a senior
White House staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``Everyone knew what he thought and wanted. This wasn't a blind
date. But everyone knew this was out of our control. We were at
best in the back seat with someone else driving.''
</P>
<P>
   For the trial to be legitimate, the House managers insisted,
there had to be witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing the managers' case for witnesses at a bipartisan meeting
in one of Lott's suites, Hyde offered numbers from ``15 to 18.''
Sen. Joseph Biden, a D-Del., remembers feeling his jaw drop,
especially when the managers mentioned that they were thinking of
calling the five Jane Does _ women linked to the president whose
uncorroborated stories were not part of the public impeachment
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us in private thought it was even remotely possible to
do this,'' Biden said. His Republican colleagues agreed, for the
most part, and sent word to Lott.
</P>
<P>
   A second meeting followed, this time exclusively Republican, to
hammer home the point. Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, Sen. Arlen Specter
of Pennsylvania and Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio subtly suggested a
pared-back list.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson, one of the House managers, said the senators had a
firm position: ``You can ask for whatever witnesses that you want
to, but you are going to lose votes with some of the moderates if
you have an expanded list,'' Hutchinson recalls being told by
Senate colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The magic figure, Hyde said, boiled down to the famous ``pitiful
three.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Rogan, D-Calif., angrily suggested a protest.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't they just walk out of the Senate chamber, their legal
pads and files under their arms? He was talked out of it. Other
members were upset, briefly, with Hyde, believing he had acquiesced
too easily to the Senate's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   But as the managers debated who should make the final cut,
Senate Republicans privately worried whether any of the witnesses,
all of them presidential allies, would serve the House well.
</P>
<P>
   The first interview with Ms. Lewinsky was a success of a sort,
said Bryant, who had been chosen to preview her testimony because
he ``could be her father.'' Bryan found her chatty, open and blunt.
The prosecutors decided to depose her.
</P>
<P>
   But she was not nearly as open the second time around. She
measured her words carefully. Her lawyers nudged her when they
wanted her to clam up, Hyde said. ``I realized very quickly in the
deposition that it wasn't going to happen,'' he said. ``She didn't
tell her story like she could have.''
</P>
<P>
   After the constrained and careful testimony of Jordan and
Blumenthal, any hope for live witnesses vanished. The Senate had
seen the videotapes. They did not want to see anymore.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers saw their task was not simply to plant
reasonable doubt in the minds of the Senate jury, but to undermine
what one White House official called the ``unreasonable certitude''
of the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   And the lawyers did so, in excruciating and sometimes tedious
detail, pointing out the House managers' mischaracterization of
testimony or logical fallacies. David Kendall, the president's lead
private lawyer, obliterated one of the prosecutors' assertions when
he demonstrated that Jordan could not have taken steps to further
Ms. Lewinsky's job search after learning of his appearance on the
witness list for the Jones suit against the president. As Kendall
informed the Senate with delight, `` Jordan was high over the
Atlantic in an airplane on his way to Amsterdam'' when a federal
judge entered an order allowing Ms. Lewinsky to be called as a
witness and could therefore not have been aware of her status.
</P>
<P>
   But the impeachment trial was never solely about facts and dates
and inconsistent memories. It was a supremely political event as
well, and the White House had to manage that aspect of the case
while not appearing to be tampering with the president's jury.
</P>
<P>
   A pivotal moment came on Friday, Jan. 22. Lanny Breuer, a lawyer
in the White House counsel's office who has been one of the central
figures in the president's defense, was seated at the defense table
on the floor of the Senate when Lawrence Stein, the White House's
chief legislative lobbyist, slipped into the chamber and handed him
a note.
</P>
<P>
   The news was almost too good to be believed: Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., the influential custodian of Senate history and no friend
of Clinton's, was going to sponsor a motion to dismiss the
impeachment charges. Byrd had not earlier indicated how he would
vote on the charges. Byrd's defection would be a disaster for
Clinton; with his support for dropping the charges, the Democratic
front against conviction would remain solid.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer passed on the note to his colleagues at the defense table
_ Charles F.C. Ruff, Kendall, Greg Craig, Nicole Seligman and
Cheryl Mills. There were smiles of silent satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the beginning of the end,'' a senior White House
official said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it was. Although the Byrd motion failed 54-46 on Jan. 27,
only one Democrat voted with the Republicans. It was certain from
that point forward that the Republicans would never amass the 67
votes necessary to convict Clinton and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   To greater and lesser degrees, the three sides in this historic
impeachment trial _ the Senate, the House prosecutors and the White
House _ accomplished their missions.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, which never wanted an impeachment trial, was not
riven by bitter partisanship, like the House, thanks largely to
Lott's and Daschle's willingness to talk and compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that on occasions, I did some things that I
thought were fair to help him,'' Lott said, ``and I tell you that
he did some things for me that he didn't have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who held a last news conference in the Judiciary Committee
hearing room dominated by his oil portrait, said the House managers
had carried out their constitutional duty, even as most of America
wished they would go away.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the White House got what it wanted, a clean verdict
of not guilty. The president's lawyers had once feared that the
three witnesses would lead to their darkest nightmare, a
months-long trial. But Daschle's ability two weeks ago to secure an
agreement with Lott that calling any new witnesses would require
bipartisan support had virtually assured the witness list would end
at three.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lott-Daschle compromise showed that there wouldn't be any
new witnesses,'' a White House lawyer said. ``That was a huge
moment for us, a major turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, announcing the agreement on witnesses, said that the trial
would conclude no later than Friday, Feb. 12, ``barring some
bolt-of-lightning discovery that we don't now see.'' Lightning did
not strike. The depositions were taken, portions of the tapes were
shown, the Senate spent three days in secret deliberations, and on
Friday at 12:39 p.m. the last senator cast his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The End,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the former White House senior
adviser.

THORNE REPLACES MCCARVER 
 (DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although Tim McCarver will not call Mets games on
Channel 11 this season, Gary Thorne, his former Channel 9 partner,
will. Thorne will work with Tom Seaver, who is replacing McCarver,
and Ralph Kiner, who is expected to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with Tim was a treasure,'' Thorne said during a
conference call to announce his four-year contract. He said that
McCarver's dismissal, believed to be partly over the criticism he
delivered from the booth, ``won't change how I approach games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My obligation is to tell the truth,'' Thorne added. ``I have
to be honest. If it gets me in trouble, that's the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a warning to me? Maybe it is, but it won't have any
impact on me. I wish Timmy was back. He is a joy in my life. And
maybe when I'm finished working with Tom Seaver, I'll say the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorne said that he never saw Mets management chastise McCarver
for being critical, but he said that he had engaged Mark Bingham, a
team executive, in ``philosophical discussions'' about his
play-by-play role. ``I'm a journalist,'' Thorne said.
</P>
<P>
   McCarver is expected to join Channel 5's Yankee announcing team
on Tuesday. He will call about 42 of the station's 50 games.

NEW ZEALANDERS OMITTED AMERICA ONE SKIPPER ON THEIR REGATTA `A'
LIST  
 A BOAT SHOW WEEKEND IN MIAMI  
 ROLEX YACHTSWOMAN OF THE YEAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., R.I., Ga .,  Australia, France, Switzerland)   By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this time last year, Paul Cayard was being doused with
torrents of water _ fire hoses, he called it then _ that poured
over the decks of his round-the-world ocean racer, EF Language.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is in New Zealand, buoy-racing on his America One
training yacht. He has put to rest the dangers of sailing in the
Whitbread Round the World Race, which he won. But in its place, he
says he is confronted with the political backwash of racing for the
America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That fifth leg of the Whitbread was one of the most satisfying
times of my career,'' Cayard said during a recent telephone
interview from New Zealand. ``The Whitbread was a new challenge,
but our team of sailors managed to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're in Auckland for the America's Cup. We're here trying
to figure out the new race course, and the other competitors. But
it is sometimes frustrating, and a less glamorous job than what the
public sees.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayard is feeling the pressure of being one of the front-runners
in the America's Cup challenger trials, which begin in Auckland,
New Zealand, in October. But it is the Kiwis who are making sure
the tension does not abate any time soon. As the winner of
yachting's oldest trophy in a competition held off San Diego in
1995, New Zealand sailors have the hometown advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealanders have invited 4 of the 15 cup challengers _
and not Cayard _ to Auckland on March 1 for a week of unofficial
racing against the Kiwi defense team in two yachts used in the 1992
cup by New Zealand. It is the third rendition of a spring regatta
that is a test of sailing skills as opposed to new technology that
the New Zealanders have dubbed ``Road to the America's Cup.'' But
Cayard's team has never raced in it. Perhaps it was planned that
way, he says now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of political,'' he added. ``The first year, I really
wanted to do it, but they said they wanted to give new teams a
chance for the exposure. The second year, in 1998, I was invited,
but I was in the Whitbread and couldn't go. This year, I wasn't
invited.''
</P>
<P>
   Four other challengers have accepted this season: Prada, the
Italian team; Yaka France, one of two French cup teams; America
True, the San Francisco syndicate led by Dawn Riley, and Swiss FAST
2000, the first Swiss team in America's Cup history.
</P>
<P>
   As for Cayard, he will return to San Francisco on Feb. 28 with
two months of cup practice on One Australia, a yacht that competed
in the 1995 America's Cup trials. ``It's been good to be out
sailing and racing here,'' he said. ``We're seeing all the bits and
pieces coming together.'' Anchor's Aweigh in Four Days
</P>
<P>
   A Boat Show Weekend in Miami
</P>
<P>
   The annual extravaganza that has become the Miami International
Boat Show has four days left in an exhibition that began on
Thursday at the Miami Beach Convention Center. The show, which
includes Strictly Sail, the sailing arm of a mostly powerboat
display, ends on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,000 boats are being shown at three sites in the
Miami area, including the Biscayne Bay Yachting Center and the
Miamarina at Bayside Marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the attractions are a high-dive show, a casting pond
for fly fishermen and seminars on everything from solar power for
boats to buying a multihull.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen new boat designs are on exhibit, as well as
new gear, such as a rotary-power marine engine by Rotary Power
Marine Corp., and a new fiberglass skiff by Porta-Bote
International. It folds flat to four inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to broaden the base of people we talk to,'' Cathy
Johnston, the boat-show manager, said last week. ``We know what
regular boat buyers want. Now we have a campaign to show other
people how they can own a boat too.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolex Yachtswoman of the Year
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Alison, a 38-year-old sailor from Newport, R.I., received
her fifth Rolex Yachtswoman of the Year title in a ceremony on Feb.
5 at the New York Yacht Club. It is the highest national award in
the sport of yacht racing. Alison was honored for her 1998
victories in match racing and her status as a world keelboat
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Named as Rolex Yachtsman of the Year was Paul Cayard, who
received the honor for the first time. He was selected in large
part, said nominating officials, ``for becoming the first American
to win the Whitbread Round the World Race.''
</P>
<P>
   In winning her fifth title, Alison topped Ted Turner, the
cable-news entrepreneur and former America's Cup helmsman, who won
the Yachtsman of the Year title four times.  &QL;

PILOTS' SICKOUT BEGINS TO HAVE RIPPLE EFFECT

<P>
   Workers at American Airlines who belong to other unions appear
to generally support the pilots' union in its dispute with the
airline. But some say the flight cancellations are cutting into
their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Other workers worry that if the dispute continues much longer,
the airline may begin to lay people off. There have been no layoffs
so far.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots' sickout has led the airline to cancel as many as
half its scheduled flights for eight days. Some flight attendants,
who get a minimum paycheck each week but make more by putting more
hours in the air, say the cancellations have already begun to
reduce their wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't work a flight, I don't get the hours and I don't
get the higher pay,'' said one flight attendant at La Guardia
Airport in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first couple of days I supported them,'' she said.
But, she added: ``They have made their point. It's time for them to
go back. It's hurting me.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others interviewed, the flight attendant would speak only
on the condition that she not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Hedges, the president of the Association of Professional
Flight Attendants, said in a message on the union's telephone line
that its members had lost thousands of flight hours because of
cancellations. The union represents 20,000 flight attendants at
American.
</P>
<P>
   ``As painful as it is, it is out of our control,'' she said.
``We cannot and will not interfere in this dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants' union is in negotiations for a new
contract. Some flight attendants said the issues involved in the
pilots' dispute would affect their contract.
</P>
<P>
   One flight attendant said that if American was allowed to bring
in workers from its newly acquired Reno Air at wages lower than
those paid to workers at American, it would erode other unions'
contracts. And he said the outcome of the pilots' dispute would set
a precedent for those contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilots have the strength to do what they are doing,'' he
said. ``We don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Another worker, who performs maintenance on American's planes
and is represented by the Transport Workers Union, said his fellow
workers were worried that if the pilots' sickout continued, the
airline might begin laying off workers.

OUTDOORS: WHEN OYSTERS ARE MOST OF YOUR WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It offended my New England frugality, but earlier this winter I
paid $18 for a car tire inner tube that is used to help me gather
oysters.
</P>
<P>
   The tube floats the wire basket that is tethered to me as,
wearing chest waders, I rake the oysters from the bottom of a salt
pond. For decades I made do with battered, discarded inner tubes
scrounged from the local gas station. With my own patches added to
the many that already existed, I would get a season or two out of
them before they failed. On my first oystering expedition this
winter, the tube I was using lost most of its air in half an hour
and flipped upside down in three feet of water, returning its
precious cargo to the pond. That afternoon I bought the new tube,
telling myself that my next oystering foray would more than pay for
such unseemly profligacy.
</P>
<P>
   Winter is the time of the oyster for food gatherers in the
Northeast. Most hunting and fishing is over and the oysters are fat
and tasty having recovered from the rigors of spawning.
</P>
<P>
   On Tisbury Great Pond on Martha's Vineyard, where I do my
oystering, there is also a commercial fishery for them. The
commercial harvesters use dredges dragged behind outboard-powered
skiffs. The individual after a mess of them for family consumption
can use a potato fork or some rake-like tool designed especially
for the task.
</P>
<P>
   Although the wading oyster harvester can eventually fill his
basket on a dark and windy day, high noon, clear skies and smooth
water make the task much easier, enabling you to spot the quarry on
the bottom; otherwise you are simply probing blind, waiting to feel
the grating of shells against your rake. Good visibility also
enables you to pick out individual specimens rather than clusters.
On any natural oyster bed, there are many of the bivalves that have
perished for one reason or another. Some, their shells tightly
closed, look enticing but hold nothing but sand and mud. As you
become adept at oystering, you will be able to identify such
specimens on the bottom. Their shells tend to be several shades
lighter than those of their living counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Clustered oysters have to be separated when you bring them
ashore. A short board _ on which to rest the clusters _ and a
little billy club, perhaps the broken wooden handle of a hammer,
are needed for this. In our family, my partner, Ruth Kirchmeier,
accompanies me on my oyster forays, wandering along the pond shore,
watching birds and finding occasional animal tracks, including
those of deer, otters and muskrats. When I come ashore with my
first load of oysters, she sets about breaking up the clumps,
discarding those that are dead or too small, while I return to my
raking.
</P>
<P>
   With a little practice, you become adept at separating these
clusters, but every once in a while an oyster is broken. Ruth deals
with these broken oysters on the spot. Using her penknife, she
separates the meat from the shell and devours the critter and its
juices. In years past, we used to bring a bottle of
ketchup-horseradish sauce with us, but we finally decided that the
aroma of the salt pond and the moaning of the distant surf was
condiment enough.
</P>
<P>
   When the culling operation is complete, we return all the
discarded shells, including the diminutive live specimens, to the
water because future generations of oyster larvae need rough,
slime-free surfaces on which to fasten themselves. The shells of
their forebears are, under natural conditions, the usual anchoring
spots.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, one of my jobs was to smash the shells of oysters
that we gathered into small pieces to feed them to our chickens.
Now, sans chickens, we scatter the shells in our dirt driveway to
firm up the earth.
</P>
<P>
   We carefully place our culled oysters, deep side down, in a
separate container. They must be stored in that position so that
their life-sustaining liquid will not drain away. Packed in that
manner, covered with a damp cloth or an old towel that is
occasionally wetted, they will last for weeks if stored in a cool
spot. A root cellar would be ideal for this, but not many of us
have root cellars. An unheated room is good, and outside storage in
the shade works well unless the temperature is consistently below
freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Oysters will survive occasional below-freezing dips in
temperature, but if you have them outside and a protracted period
of bitter cold is forecast, you will have to take them inside. If
you keep them inside, you will, after a week or so, begin to detect
the odor of decay. Don't panic. It's not the oysters that are
dying, but the reddish-brown clam worms that _ at least in my
locality _ live in the outer portions of the oysters' shells.
</P>
<P>
   Much is made of the difficulty of shucking oysters, but any
reasonably dexterous person will be able to handle the needs of his
or her family after a few hours' practice. Hold the bivalve deep
side down and hinge away from you in your gloved left hand and
insert the oyster knife's thin, tapered, two-edged and blunt-nosed
blade between the bivalve's two shells about a third of the way up
from the hinge. Keep the thumb and forefinger of your right hand
close to the knife's point to minimize the chance of slipping and
stabbing yourself. Push and wiggle the blade a little and you'll
find a place where the blade will enter. Then, all you have to do
is shove the blade deeper and swing it back and forth to sever the
oyster's adductor muscle which is between the shells on the
opposite side. Slide the knife back toward the hinge and twist it
to free the upper shell from the lower.
</P>
<P>
   According to A.J. McLane's ``The Encyclopedia of Fish Cookery''
(Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1977), champion oyster shuckers can
for short periods of time open oysters at the rate of one every
three or four seconds. Such dexterity is beyond ordinary mortals.
I've been opening them for more than 60 years and I find that one
every 10 or 15 seconds is all that I can manage. There's no hurry.
Those that you don't open today will be good tomorrow, or even next
month. &QL;

ALASKAN TRIES TO OUTSKI EUROPEANS AT THEIR GAME  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Austria, Poland, Norway, Maine)   By JACK BELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he was a child growing up in Anchorage, Rob Whitney's
parents used to take him cross-country skiing. Kicking and
screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents would have to drag me out of the house,'' he said.
``I hated it with a passion.''
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, now 19 and the top American male junior skier,
practically lives on the frozen trails of North America and Europe.
Late last month against older and more experienced competition at
the Chevy Truck U.S. Championships in Rumford, Maine, he finished
seventh in the 10-kilometer classic race and sixth in the 30K
freestyle. His strong performance at the nationals earned Whitney
an invitation to the World Championships, Feb. 18-28, in Ramsau,
Austria, as part of the five-man American senior team.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Whitney has just finished competing in Saalfelden,
Austria, in the World Junior Championships, which ended last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm capable of making the podium at the juniors,'' the
eternally confident Whitney had said. That, however, did not happen
last week in Saalfelden. Whitney's best performance was in his
first race, the 10K classic, in which he finished seventh. He was
part of the 4 X 10K relay team that was a distant 15th last
Saturday. Then in his final attempt at ``making the podium,''
Whitney slumped to 20th in the 30K freestyle event, 2 minutes 41
seconds behind the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney (6 feet 2 inches, 195 pounds), who has taken a leave of
absence from the University of Alaska, Anchorage, to train
exclusively with his Polish coach, Zenon Babraj, finished eighth in
the 30K race at last year's junior championships in Switzerland. As
he has heard countless times since that race, it was the best
showing in cross-country skiing by an American male in the juniors
since Bill Koch finished third in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Koch went on to win an Olympic silver medal for the United
States in the 30K classical at the Innsbruck Games in 1976. He is
also credited with revolutionizing the sport when he developed and
popularized the skating style (now called freestyle).
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear that so much that it's beginning to get old,'' Whitney
said, referring to the inevitable comparisons with Koch. ``Sure
it's flattering, but it's also a lot of hype. You can't let it go
to your head.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a danger that a young skier with as much promise as
Whitney could be harboring hopes of challenging the likes of
Norway's Olympic dynamo Bjorn Daehlie in the world championships
while underestimating his peer group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that he will be looking past the juniors to the
seniors,'' said the U.S. Ski Team's cross-country manager, Luke
Bodensteiner, a past American Olympian and the author of the book
``Endless Winter.'' It was a concern that was confirmed by
Whitney's less-than stellar performance at the junior
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob is one of the best juniors in the world right now,'' said
Bodensteiner, ``and we hope that he shows it. Right now I believe
that any 19-year-old is too young to do well in the World Cup.
Simply for him to get into it and get used to competing against a
higher caliber of competition is useful. We expect some great
results from him heading to the 2002 Olympics, but really, I think
he needs to use that as a springboard to the 2006 Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Whitney's comments ooze with a refreshing innocence, a
sense that he has many years of success awaiting him on the world
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe there's a perception that we stink,'' Whitney said.
``That bothers me, but all I can do is show up and race. I
understand that cross-country skiing is not America's sport. Ninety
percent of the races and best racers are in Europe. It's a European
sport and we're pretty isolated. But to race fast you need to race
against the fastest racers. You need to get passed, get passed a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitney realizes that he is unlikely to make much of an impact
internationally, perhaps for years to come. That he has got to pay
his dues.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at least, he is no longer a reluctant skier. &QL;

   As two powerhouses of Jewish philanthropy, the United Jewish
Appeal and the Council of Jewish Federations, prepare to merge
within the next few months, the new entity said that it had chosen
Charles Bronfman, a Canadian billionaire, to be its volunteer
chairman. Bronfman, co-chairman of Seagram Co. and a prominent
Jewish philanthropist, will oversee the strategic direction for the
new group.
</P>
<P>
   The UJA and the Jewish federations, once viewed as a mainstay of
Jewish philanthropy, have come under sharp criticism in recent
years as being unresponsive to donors and uncreative in their
giving. While they still raise more than $1 billion a year, they
have struggled to convince Jews in the United States and Canada
that they are as relevant today as they were during the Holocaust
or the early days of Israel. Many large donors have chosen to
emphasize other causes or contribute through their own foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed to address these criticisms, the groups agreed last year
to combine forces. While the merger has not received final
approval, the reorganization appears to have the backing of the
United Jewish Appeal and the United Israel Appeal, which oversees
the money raised by the UJA for Israel, as well as the 189
federations that make up the council. The new entity will shift
decision-making power to the federations, which will select roughly
two-thirds of the new group's 120-member board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Donors in local communities will have more say over where the
dollars sent to Israel should be spent and whether a bigger share
of money should go to Jewish community-building at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Bronfman, a soft-spoken 67-year-old who has done
much of his own giving through his foundations, seems to be an
effort to reach out to both disaffected givers and loyal
supporters. Describing himself as an ``an encourager of change,''
Bronfman has been active in the groups without being a member of
the old leadership. ``I think there is a great opportunity for
rebirth, rethinking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture change has to happen because they are sitting in a
sea that is very unsettled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman was chosen by a 25-member nominating committee. ``
Bronfman is dedicated to Jewish affairs all over the world,'' said
Charles Goodman, chairman of the committee. ``It was a unanimous
and enthusiastic nomination.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Noting the difficulty of leading the board of a new nonprofit
organization, Goodman said that the committee was ``very grateful''
to Bronfman ``for his willingness to accept his role in the new
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his better-known brother, Edgar Bronfman Sr., 69, the
other co-chairman of Seagram, Charles Bronfman has not been among
the most vocal critics of the UJA and the Jewish federations. Edgar
Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress, has publicly
questioned the groups' agenda. He has argued that money raised
would be better spent on efforts to encourage a sense of Jewish
identity, through support of day schools or other means.
</P>
<P>
   The new group, which has yet to be named, has adopted a broad
mission statement. In addition to its traditional role in
supporting projects in Israel and overseas, the group states that
it will also try to help strengthen the Jewish people through
programs that foster Jewish renaissance and renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bronfman has strong ties to Israel as both an investor
and a philanthropist. He is chairman of three Israeli businesses:
Koor Industries, a diversified holding company; Claridge Israel, a
private investment company, and The Jerusalem Report, a biweekly
magazine. Last year, he teamed with another prominent Jewish
philanthropist, Michael Steinhardt, to establish Birthright Israel,
a program to help young Jews from anywhere in the world visit
Israel. Bronfman and Steinhardt each have contributed $5 million to
the program, which will also receive financing from the Israeli
government, local North American federations and other donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel has as much to offer us in our quest to be a Jewish
people as we have to offer them,'' Bronfman said. He also
emphasized the importance of the groups' historical work in
supporting the exodus of Jews from other countries to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Approached informally about a year ago, Bronfman said that he
only recently became interested in the position. Over the last six
months, Jeffrey Solomon, president of the Andrea and Charles
Bronfman Philanthropies, has been acting as a consultant to the new
group. Solomon had been a top executive with the UJA-Federation of
New York before he was recruited by the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   While Bronfman acknowledged that the new group faced a
significant challenge in proving its value and reaching out to more
Jews, especially younger ones, he was quick to emphasize the
positive. ``We are one of the most blessed generations of the
Jewish people,'' he said. ``Let's do something wonderful, and let's
do it together.''

 REJUVENATING THE HEART OF KANSAS CITY  (bl) 
 By JILIAN MINCER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Since 1984, the Ewing Marion Kauffman
Foundation has been providing funds for projects that support
early-childhood education, fight child and drug abuse and promote
entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   In January, it moved to its new midtown headquarters on a
37-acre campus bounded by Troost Avenue, Brush Creek Boulevard,
Rockhill Road and 48th Street. Its construction, along with
improvements on the four-mile Brush Creek corridor, have helped
spur development of a four-square-mile area.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the north-south thoroughfare has been a dividing
line between the mostly white, affluent neighborhoods to the west
and the predominantly poor, minority neighborhoods to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently little private investment has occurred east of
Troost Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   But as its 180 employees move into the foundation's new
headquarters, Kauffman Legacy Park, a dozen projects costing an
estimated total of $500 million are under way or about to move off
the drawing board on the east-west Brush Creek corridor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the best potential urban development sites in the
city,'' said Vicki Noteis, the city's director of planning and
development. ``Thinking east-west in Kansas City is breaking with
tradition,'' she added, noting that all the major arteries run
north-south.
</P>
<P>
   Residents, businesses and institutions in the area hope that as
projects like the Kauffman campus are completed, they will attract
other development to the area, which already includes most of the
city's major cultural, education and research institutions.
</P>
<P>
   These include the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, the Kemper Museum
of Contemporary Art, the University of Missouri-Kansas City and the
Midwest Research Institute. About 60,000 people live in the
adjacent neighborhoods that range from some of the city's most
upscale historic homes to low-income housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision is for a world-class cultural and research district
that is surrounded by healthy communities,'' said Robert B. Rogers,
chairman of the Kauffman Foundation. ``We chose this location
because we wanted to be as close to our client base as possible.
This is the heart of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the new development along the corridor can be attributed
to infrastructure improvements in the area, such as realingnment of
streets for better traffic flow and reconstruction of bridges.
</P>
<P>
   But by far the most significant improvement has been flood
control and beautification of the property abutting Brush Creek.
The city began this work more than 20 years ago after a flash flood
along Brush Creek and elsewhere in the city killed 25 people.
</P>
<P>
   The original plan was for flood protection only. However, in
1983 voters approved two half-cent sales tax increases to provide
funds for infrastructure projects in the city. The tax was renewed
in 1988 and now it generates about $30 million a year. The tax
expires Dec. 31, 2000, but city officials said that it was expected
to be renewed.
</P>
<P>
   About $90 million of the fund has been spent on transforming the
once muddy Brush Creek into a pastoral setting with bike trails,
fountains and parks. Roads along the creek have been realigned to
better accommodate traffic and bridges rebuilt with the area's
natural limestone.
</P>
<P>
   The public improvements are now helping to attract private
investment to the area. Among others, H &AMP; R Block, the
tax-preparation firm, is planning to open a service center in
September with about 120 full-time employees and 600 temporary
employees during the tax season. The 83,500-square-foot center
represents the first significant for-profit investment east of
Troost Avenue in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most significant project is the $125-million
Stowers Institute for Medical Research, which is across the creek
from the Kauffman Foundation. James and Virginia Stowers, who made
their fortune through their mutual-fund business, American Century
Cos., have created a $336-million endowment to run the nonprofit
Stowers biomedical research facility. The 600,000-square-foot
project is expected to open next year on the site of a former
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The builder of the new 37-acre campus on the other side of the
creek from the Stowers Institute, the Kauffman Foundation, was
established by Ewing M. Kauffman, founder of Marion Laboratories,
now Hoechst Marion Roussell, a pharmaceutical company. Kauffman was
also the original owner of the Kansas City Royals baseball team.
From the start, the foundation's emphasis has been on helping
adults and children gain greater self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Today the foundation, which has assets of about $1.5 billion,
provides funds totaling more than $60 million a year, primarily for
youth development and entrepreneurship programs. The Youth
Development Division provides funds for programs such as
child-abuse prevention and the training of early-childhood
educators, especially in inner cities. And the Kauffman Center for
Entrepreneurial Leadership was established to educate both children
and adults about business skills.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the foundation decided to build a new
headquarters was because much of its work involves holding
conferences and training sessions, and it regularly had to rent
space for these events.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many unusual features of the new 135,000-square-foot
facility is that about one-third of its space is a conference
center. The various rooms can accommodate as many as 200
participants. The conference center will be used for events
sponsored by the foundation as well as by the programs it finances.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston architectural firm of Kalmann, McKinnell and Wood,
which in 1961 won a national competition to design Boston's City
Hall, designed the foundation's new headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Kauffman Foundation sought neighborhood input in the design
of the two-story building because it is surrounded on the north by
historic homes. The architects blended it in with the natural
environment, using maple and stone in its structure.
</P>
<P>
   The building will also house the Muriel McBrien Kauffman
Foundation, named for the late wife of Ewing Kauffman. The
foundation supports organizations that make the arts more
accessible in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most unusual feature of the campus is that it is
designed to draw visitors to the area. The Ewing and Muriel
Kauffman Memorial Gardens, which are still under construction, will
include walking paths that lead from the Kauffman site to an
already existing landscaped mall to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Another unusual feature of the campus is that the state's
Department of Conservation plans to build on the northeast corner
an educational nature preserve that will include a pond, plantings
and hands-on learning centers for families and schoolchildren.

COMMENTARY: PUTTING TWO EDUCATIONAL RIVALS TO THE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERBURY, Conn. _ It's not that Waterbury hasn't tried to fix
its schools. It has mandatory summer school for students who fail.
It has a charter school. In three weeks, it will start Saturday
classes for failing students, with only 10 students per class. Next
year, it will create a magnet school. It even requires uniforms in
grade school and has a dress code _ no jeans or slouchy shirts _
for high schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing has worked. In an annual ranking of state school
districts based on student test scores, Waterbury was 161st out of
164. Only 47 percent of the city's 15,500 students scored at grade
level in reading, math and science.
</P>
<P>
   The school superintendent, Roger Damerow, said that such scores
had been explained away too easily and too often by blaming social
conditions in this old factory town: abundant poverty, many
immigrants who speak little or no English, little parental
involvement in schools and high student turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been using socioeconomic status as an excuse for years
but the politicians say it is not sufficient,'' Damerow said.
``Politicians say: `All kids are equal, so have at it. Get to
work.'''
</P>
<P>
   So in a gesture that is part desperation, part renewed
determination, the city has given an unlikely pair the chance to
run two new schools in what is probably the United States' first
teach-off.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation is that the groups, fierce enemies in the
education world, will try to outdo each other in a competition
whose only winners will be students.
</P>
<P>
   The first new school will open in the fall and be run by the
Edison Project, the private, for-profit company that runs 51
schools around the country, mostly in struggling school districts
like Waterbury. In 2000, another school will be handed over to the
very group that many critics love to hate as the embodiment of
sullen resistance to school reform: the teachers union.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came to us and said they wanted to bring Edison in
here,'' said Jack Cronan, president of the Waterbury Teachers
Association. ``And we said: `OK, give us parity. Let us show you
what we can do at our school.'''
</P>
<P>
   Each school will operate for five years. After that, the city
will try to figure out what worked, what didn't and what to do
next.
</P>
<P>
   Each school will have about 500 students, in kindergarten
through eighth grade. At the Edison school, students will get their
own computers and a longer school year. The union does not yet know
what it will do differently. It will not lengthen the school year,
Cronan said, but it might have a longer school day _ this from a
union that once filed a grievance over a plan to lengthen the day
by five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Waterbury Teachers Association tries, Cronan said,
it will show that for all Waterbury's school problems, the union is
not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone knows what the problems are. Hang around the Tinker
Elementary School on Highland Avenue at 2 p.m., when parents come
to fetch their children, and you will hear the voices of people who
are at wit's end about their schools. Like the city officials, they
care less about pinning blame than finding answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to the point where they feel they just don't have
the talent to do it themselves, and they have to go to the
outside,'' said Joe Ciccomascolo, a retired accountant, as he
waited for his granddaughter, Olivia Ann, a first-grader. ``It's so
hard to understand why we can't measure up on a state basis or on a
national basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Damerow said one answer might lie with the very gritty,
street-smart kids who are having so much trouble with school.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory is that any dummy can make it in the suburbs,'' he
said. ``Mom drives you to school in the station wagon, she picks
you up and drives you home, she makes you do your homework. Our
kids come out of places you wouldn't want to walk past at night,
and they face incredible difficulties just getting to school. They
have skills, and I'd like to find a way to apply them in the
classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Waterbury school officials toyed with the idea of bringing in a
private school operation five years ago, but the union howled and
the school board shelved the idea. Now the sense of urgency has
forced the city and its teachers into a truce. Even Cronan concedes
that the time has probably come to give the privateers at Edison a
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, maybe we do need them,'' he said. ``Something to knock
down that first domino.''

   Before Spring Training Opens, There Are Already Winners and
Losers
</P>
<P>
   Some teams improve by adding players. Others make themselves
better by getting rid of players. Addition by subtraction, Branch
Rickey called it. Then there are the New York Yankees, who hope to
prove that a team that won more games than any other in baseball
history can at least repeat as champions, if not match or exceed
that victory total, without making any changes.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees' pitchers and catchers have their first spring
training workout in Tampa, Fla., on Thursday and when the rest of
the World Series winners join them Feb. 23, they will not have to
introduce themselves to each other. They are the same guys who
dressed and played together last season.
</P>
<P>
   True, Tim Raines will not be there, but he is the lone
exception. Every other member of the post-season team will be back
in all the old familiar places. Bernie Williams, who seemed certain
to leave, stayed when the numbers after the dollar sign got big
enough. David Cone could have left for a bigger contract but
stayed. Joe Girardi, who was virtually gone as an expendable backup
catcher, is back.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Brian Cashman could have made some moves just to
keep the Yankees alert and prevent them from suffering a major
attack of complacency, but he opted instead to follow the policy
that says if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of repair work going on elsewhere this winter,
as some teams tried to improve themselves and others tried to mend
the holes that were created when players found new addresses.
</P>
<P>
   When spring training begins this week _ seven other teams
besides the Yankees will start on Thursday, the first day workouts
are permitted _ teams will get their first look at the changes they
made or were forced to make, or at how gaping are the holes that
were left by defections of free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles, the team which most desperately wants to
knock the Yankees from their lofty American League East perch, will
show up with half a new infield, first baseman Will Clark and
second baseman Delino DeShields (in place of Rafael Palmeiro and
Roberto Alomar); a new catcher, Charles Johnson, and a new threat
to the less than 5-month-old home run record.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Albert Belle, who brings to the home run haven of
Camden Yards a bat that blistered American League pitchers for 31
home runs in the Chicago White Sox's 76 games after the All-Star
break, a total that nearly matched the 33 that Mark McGwire hit in
St. Louis' 76 games after the break.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, the team which most desperately wants to knock the
Yankees from their lofty New York City perch, also open camp
Saturday with half a new infield, third baseman Robin Ventura and
second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo, as well as two-thirds of a new
outfield, Bobby Bonilla and Rickey Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   They retained Mike Piazza by breaking their bank to pay him a
subsistence wage, then traded their former catcher, Todd Hundley,
to Los Angeles, where the Dodgers shattered their even more
well-stocked bank to lure Kevin Brown and his World Series
tendencies north from San Diego and promised to spend whatever it
will take to reach the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, Mets and Dodgers were among the teams that appeared
to have the best off seasons. They will have to demonstrate that on
the field, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves, the longest-running division champions
(seven consecutive National League East titles), are another team
in that category. They bolstered their offense and defense by
adding second baseman Bret Boone and right fielder Brian Jordan
while sacrificing only a member of the strongest element of their
team, pitcher Denny Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Diamondbacks, starting their second season, are not
in the class of the Yankees and the Braves, but they engaged in a
frenzy of winter activity that got everyone's attention. They
bought a substantial part of their pitching rotation, signing Randy
Johnson, Todd Stottlemyre and Armando Reynoso, and got two-thirds
of a new outfield, Steve Finley and Luis Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Severe Winter for 4 Clubs
</P>
<P>
   For some teams, the winter has been a mean season. They are the
winners in the losers' bracket: the San Diego Padres, Chicago White
Sox, Boston Red Sox and Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals really do not belong in the other teams' class
because they already were a bad team. But the loss of Dean Palmer
(34 home runs, 119 runs batted in), Jose Offerman (.315) and Tim
Belcher (14-14, 234 innings) can only make them worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres executed one of the neatest tricks of the off season.
A few weeks after their World Series appearance against the
Yankees, they induced San Diego voters to approve funding for a new
ball park. Then in subsequent weeks they lost Brown, Finley and
third baseman Ken Caminiti, then traded Greg Vaughn, who hit 50
home runs for them last season, and pitcher Joey Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Like their National League champion predecessors, the Florida
Marlins, the Padres are a shell of their former self and could
return to last place, where they finished the year before they won
the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox _ who have not been the same since their owner,
with two months left in the 1997 season, pronounced them incapable
of contending for the division championship when they were only
three games from first _ suffered the loss of two of their three
best players. Belle bolted for Baltimore, and Ventura veered to New
York. That leaves Frank Thomas, who endured the worst year of his
career last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox played out the last act of the yearlong tragedy they
created with their No. 1 hero, Mo Vaughn. In that time, they never
made Vaughn an offer he could accept. But they did make Bernie
Williams an offer Vaughn would not have refused, only to prompt the
Yankees to raise their offer to Williams by nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So on the same day Vaughn signed with Anaheim, Williams
re-signed with the Yankees. A few days later Belle opted for the
Orioles, and the Red Sox lineup was barren. No big power hitter, no
big run producer, no threat.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Manager Watch
</P>
<P>
   Two new managers _ that is, two old managers in new jobs _ will
receive major attention this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Davey Johnson, a winner wherever he has managed but a loser in
his ability to keep a job, has been given the responsibility of
shepherding the nouveau riche Dodgers to the promised land of
high-spending teams. Jim Leyland has been given $2 million a year
in Colorado to work the magic that made the Rockies' fellow
expansion team, the Marlins, World Series champions in their fifth
year of existence.
</P>
<P>
   The other new managers are John Boles, who has replaced Leyland,
who had replaced him, and Larry Parrish, who begins his first
spring training with the Detroit Tigers, whom he managed on an
interim basis the final month of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Several managers begin spring training with a real or perceived
threat to their jobs. One is Bobby Valentine, who has expensive new
weapons in his arsenal and an obstacle to overcome: the Mets'
inability to gain the one victory in their last five games last
season that would have at least put them in a playoff for the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Baltimore is a disaster waiting to happen: Ray
Miller managed the highest-paid 1998 team to a losing record and
had better not do it again. Art Howe barely survived in Oakland
last season, and Tim Johnson has to regain credibility in Toronto
after he admitted concocting a tale about military service in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni Membership Grows  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some players will be missing when camps open. They are the
players who can begin active membership in the Major League
Baseball Players Alumni Association.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Molitor has retired after 21 years and 3,319 hits, eighth
most in major league history. Dennis Eckersley has retired after 24
years and a major league-record 1,071 games pitched. Dennis
Martinez has retired after 22 seasons and 245 victories, most ever
by a Latin pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   They are joined in their retirement by, among others, Joe
Carter, Jimmy Key, Terry Pendleton, Juan Samuel and Bob Tewksbury.
Lenny Dykstra, who because of injuries has not played since 1996
and played in more than 85 games only once in his last six active
seasons, has also officially ended his career.
</P>
<P>
   Six-Week Test for Wohlers
</P>
<P>
   The six weeks of spring training will be more critical for some
players than for others. Mark Wohlers, for example, should learn
whether or not he has a future in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers is the erstwhile, engimatic closer of the Atlanta Braves
who is trying to salvage his career. It had been a steadily growing
career until he encountered a loss of control and skills last
season. Thirty-three walks in 20 1/3 innings told the stunning tale
of a wicked fastball gone awry. The Braves will scrutinize the
appearances of Wohlers in exhibition games this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Fernandez of Florida (rotator cuff) and Kevin Appier of
Kansas City (shoulder) are two front-line starting pitchers who are
coming back from disabling injuries. If they show they are healthy,
they could be traded to teams that like to pay high salaries. The
Chicago Cubs also will be watching the elbow of Kerry Wood, who
burst onto the major league scene last season with an explosion of
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback of Todd Hundley from a serious elbow ailment is
foremost in the minds of the Dodgers. The Yankees will watch Darryl
Strawberry and his attempt to overcome colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Some other matters to watch: Will the Blue Jays trade Roger
Clemens, the Phillies Curt Schilling, the Brewers Fernando Vina?
Will Omar Vizquel accept the contract he signed and not create a
problem for the Indians? Will Edgardo Alfonzo make a satisfactory
transition from third base to second and advance the Mets'
wild-card cause?

O'GRADY YEARNS FOR MORE DAYS IN YELLOW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia, Ireland, France ,  Great Britain )  By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The good times keep rolling for Stuart O'Grady, who,
with the same enthusiasm that briefly lit up the somber Tour de
France last July, merrily rolls along with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing your name painted on peoples' faces and chests gives
you good motivation,'' O'Grady, a 25-year-old Australian, said with
his standard-equipment grin at the recent presentation of his
Credit Agricole bicycle team in Paris. The body art was on display
during the Tour Down Under, a four-day race last month in his
native Adelaide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a wicked atmosphere,'' he continued. ``The first
day we had 40,000 people at the race, with thousands along the road
every day. The hills were like the Tour de France, people eight
deep.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped, of course, that a hometown boy was wearing the yellow
jersey of the leader of the inaugural Tour Down Under, a race he
went on to win. ``In Adelaide, the last day, there were 60,000
people cheering me in the yellow jersey,'' he said. ``People in
Australia are really starting to take to cycling big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the credit goes to O'Grady, who spent three days last
summer in the authentic yellow jersey _ the one donned by the Tour
de France's leader _ and later won a daily stage in the race. His
reactions ranged from explosions of joy (``I've gone to
Disneyland!'') to indecipherable Australianisms ending in ``mate.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Tour floundered under the weight of a doping scandal,
O'Grady's exuberance reminded everybody how pure, how much fun, the
race could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that was heavily publicized back home,'' he said. ``Now
it's like being a pop star: You go to a restaurant or cafe and
people don't want to let you pay. You walk out and everyone starts
cheering. And it all started with the yellow jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most overnight sensations, O'Grady spent a long time
preparing for his big moment. ``At least three years, the first
three after I turned professional,'' he said. ``Last year, the
fourth year, everything just seemed to fall into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that, I had the Olympic medals and things like that,
but you don't get the same recognition. The Olympics are every four
years and people tend to forget about it after a year.''
</P>
<P>
   He was part of the pursuit team that won a bronze medal at the
Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996 and gold medals at the world
championships in 1993 and 1995; as an individual rider, he took a
bronze in the points race in Atlanta and another bronze in pursuit
at the 1995 world championships.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, O'Grady said he ``played soccer, athletics, squash,
everything'' before turning definitively to the bicycle at 13. He
comes from a cycling family, he explained, with a father who raced
on the road and track and uncles _ his mother's brothers _ whom he
described as competitive in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from the track to the road himself, he turned
professional in 1995 with the Gan team, based in France, which has
changed sponsors and become Credit Agricole. For his first three
years, O'Grady said, he was ``allowed to ease my way into the
program. If you come over and want to do everything in every race,
you'll just kill yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, before he headed into the three-week Tour de France,
he won the nine-day Prutour in Britain in early June. It was a
small stage race but a big boost. ``It was extremely important for
my confidence and maturing,'' O'Grady said. ``I had the pressure
on.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, in the Tour, everything fell into place. After he
finished a fine 24th in the 189-man field in the prologue in
Dublin, he was part of an eight-man breakaway on the fourth stage
and wound up third over all, a few seconds behind the leader.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, after he won two bonus sprints and finished third
in another, he received the yellow jersey, which he wore until Jan
Ullrich took it away half a week later in the first time trial. A
week after that, O'Grady won the stage into Grenoble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's your dream when you take up a sport to get to the
pinnacle,'' O'Grady said. ``I know it's going to be hard to please
everyone by doing it again. But it's like in the Tour: If you do a
good prologue and you're an attacking kind of rider and you try to
get in the breaks, things can happen. And last year they did
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What about this year? ``In '99 things have really kicked off on
the right foot,'' he replied, referring to the Tour Down Under.
``I'd be happy to do what I did last year for the rest of my life.
But now I'm going to look more seriously at some of the classic
races and some small stage races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every race I'll start may not be Alpe d'Huez,'' he said,
referring to the fearsome Tour de France climb. ``I'll rate myself
a chance and try to be competitive.'' &QL;

A SOUTH BRONX VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE CLICHE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Few urban areas have ever had a worse image than the
South Bronx in the 1970s, with hundreds of buildings abandoned,
stripped, burned and rotting. The neighborhood became a synonym for
disaster _ a warning, perhaps, of where cities might be heading.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't very long ago, but in parts of the South Bronx it
seems like another century. Where surreal decals of flower boxes
and window shades once adorned burned-out buildings, those derelict
structures have been renovated and real people with real
furnishings have moved in. The population is growing, not falling.
Artists, antique stores and other businesses, symbols of growth
rather than decay, are arriving.
</P>
<P>
   South of 169th Street, in the part of the South Bronx closest to
Manhattan, lie neighborhoods like Hunts Point, Mott Haven and Port
Morris, areas that were particularly stricken by abandonment and
crime. Now, many streets are unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
   Crime rates are significantly lower, and like many other urban
areas, parts of the Bronx are beginning to be transformed. In the
last 11 years, 57,000 units of housing have been built or
rehabilitated in the borough as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the residents would argue that no more
improvements are needed, the ascent of these neighborhoods is all
the more astonishing in the light of where they began. But the
area's image has still not recovered, and people who work and live
there say that visitors are still shocked at the extent of the
revival.
</P>
<P>
   On a two-block stretch of Bruckner Boulevard, a street
infamously immortalized by Tom Wolfe in his novel ``The Bonfire of
the Vanities'' as a threatening place, charming antique stores have
been popping up, and above them, renovated apartments rent for
$1,000 a month. The antique district also fills two blocks on
adjoining Alexander Street, and with a zoning change last year
allowing mixed commercial and residential uses, the value of the
buildings, available just a few years ago for less than $50,000,
has tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Over in Hunts Point, new houses and apartment buildings have
replaced the weeds that thrived in abandoned shells. On Manida
Street, where two-story, century-old town houses with rounded
facades survived the difficult years, a group of artists are living
and working to create a vital cultural life, through the Point
Community Development Corp., at Manida and Garrison Streets.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few months, the Point plans to take over 9,000
square feet of space in the nearby American Bank Note Building, a
windowed structure on Garrison Street with large, open interior
spaces and panoramic views of Manhattan. The space will be home to
the dance troupe founded by Arthur Aviles, a modern dancer who
performed for some years with Bill T. Jones. The Point also plans
to begin renting studio space in the building to artists.
</P>
<P>
   Within walking distance, a huge outpost of ABC Carpet and Home,
one of the most stylish stores in Manhattan, doubled its space
three months ago at 1055 Bronx River Ave. and began offering the
same kind of merchandise sold at its other stores, luxurious
sheets, antiques, and oriental rugs, but marked down between 30 and
90 percent. Some customers come from the South Bronx, but the vast
majority drive in from Westchester, Connecticut and New Jersey,
lured by easy access from the Bruckner Expressway, the Bronx River
Parkway or the Cross Bronx Expressway, and free parking.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the South Bronx, residential and commercial projects
are being built; loan rates are more affordable in the economy as a
whole, but even more important, banks are making loans at rates
comparable to those in other regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a risk penalty applied to people buying buildings in
the Bronx,'' said Harvey Rottenberg, a partner in NYMC Capital
Corp. in Manhattan, which lends money to businesses. Experienced
investors in commercial properties and multifamily buildings could
get money at competitive rates, he said, but many borrowers less
experienced and less able to demonstrate stable cash flow were
paying between one and five percentage points more on their loans.
</P>
<P>
   More private money began flowing to the Bronx about two years
ago, he said, when big national lenders looked at the borough
without prejudice and realized it had strong occupancy, retail and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we're surprised by the amount of business we're
seeing out of the Bronx,'' he said. In just one year, from 1997 to
1998, he said, his company's loans for investments in the Bronx
rose by 400 percent. The flourishing of the South Bronx, he said,
is part of the borough's overall economic improvement. In the South
Bronx, he estimated, his company lent almost $10 million last year,
for projects that included a live chicken market and a beverage
distributorship.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much activity that ``it is hard to walk two blocks
in either direction without seeing construction,'' said Neil
Pariser, senior vice president of the South Bronx Overall Economic
Development Corp., known as Sobro. Groups that have renovated
buildings taken over by the city for nonpayment of taxes are
running out of opportunities for that kind of renewal, Pariser
said. ``It is now difficult to find a space to convert,'' he said.
``You can't find a city-owned building that's vacant for rehab. We
don't have tons of buildings anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   With new housing established or under construction, the focus is
shifting to development of real estate for commercial and
industrial purposes. Opportunities offered by the Bronx will be
examined in a three-session seminar sponsored by the Steven L.
Newman Real Estate Institute of Baruch College beginning March 16
at the college.
</P>
<P>
   But many problems still remain in the South Bronx, including a
higher than average unemployment rate and a lower than average
income in most households. It is not in immediate danger of
becoming a chic area. Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, who
grew up in Hunts Point, jokes about the criticism from those who
fear gentrification in any guise.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The people who have moved into the new buildings of the South
Bronx, Ferrer said, ``are not folks that can even remotely be
described as the gentry.'' They are working people with household
incomes of about $55,000, with one member employed as, perhaps, a
secretary, and the other perhaps as a corrections officer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the vitality in the South Bronx is so unmistakable, and the
improvements so profound, that even though there is much to be
done, people who never expected to return have been lured back.
</P>
<P>
   People like Majora Carter, who is in the process of acquiring
the house on Manida Street where she now lives. Ms. Carter returned
to the neighborhood where she grew up in 1995, when she was getting
a master's degree in creative writing at New York University and
found there wasn't enough money for rent in Manhattan and tuition.
Because of the compatible people she found in the neighborhood,
artists, writers and others with a lot of energy and optimism, she
has decided to stay.
</P>
<P>
   It was, she said, something she could never have anticipated.
``The Bronx was burning,'' she said. ``I didn't want to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Also back is F. Maximo Soba, who works as a salesman in the
furniture section at ABC while he studies historic preservation at
Mechanics Institute in Manhattan. He never intended to return to a
place with such unhappy memories, he said, a place where his mother
suffered from drug addiction, contracted AIDS and died.
</P>
<P>
   He fled as soon as he could, he said, moving to Manhattan, to
Brooklyn, and eventually to Puerto Rico, where he ran a gallery and
store selling antique Spanish furniture. When the roof literally
caved in on the operation, he went back to his grandmother's home
in the South Bronx three years ago, to regroup.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Carter, he found the area so changed he decided to
stay, and last year moved into a town house floor-through on Manida
Street with three bedrooms that rents for $750 a month _ a price,
he said, that wouldn't even get him a studio in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some sections of Brooklyn, the South Bronx is not
overflowing with elegant old brownstones awaiting upwardly mobile
bargain hunters. Much of the housing originally constructed in the
South Bronx consisted of five-story walkups. A lot of the new
housing has been built with subsidies and is restricted to tenants
with relatively low family incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The vacancy rate in the South Bronx is very low. Apartments of
any kind are hard to find and tend to be passed around by word of
mouth, not advertising. But when they can be found, there are great
bargains, such as floor-through apartments in charming old town
houses, like Soba's, that on average rent for $750 a month.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of town houses, for instance, in Mott Haven
between 134th and 144th Street, as well as on Alexander Avenue
between 138th Street and 141st Street, many of them architecturally
charming and just one subway stop north of Manhattan. But they are
not frequently available for sale. Sid Miller, director of the
Haven Heights Group, a real-estate brokerage on East 138th Street
in Mott Haven, said that many town-house residents show no interest
in moving even though their properties are rising in value. This
week, for instance, he closed on a deal for a brownstone on East
138th Street that sold for $155,000, a typical price for a house in
relatively good condition with architectural details.
</P>
<P>
   Miller began selling real-estate in the South Bronx 10 years
ago, he said, thinking it would be the next hot area. The influx he
anticipated did not happen, in part because homeowners do not seem
interested in leaving, despite the ``scent of money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a comment often made about people who didn't flee the
South Bronx in the 1970s: They have hung on, and they don't plan to
go even if they have the means to do so. The Bronx is being
restored primarily by the people who lived through the grim time
when landlords were torching their own buildings for the insurance
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bronx at one point was ashes,'' said Delmas Vernon Cole,
the assistant director of Nos Quedamos, which in Spanish means ``We
are staying.'' His group, which is building housing for
middle-income people in the South Bronx, was created by residents
who successfully fought a city plan in the early 1990s to bulldoze
35 blocks east of Yankee Stadium. ``People stood up and created an
organization,'' he said. ``They decided to stay. That spirit alone
is pulling up the South Bronx,'' The changes in the neighborhood
are ``incredible,'' Cole said, but they are not yet reflected in
public perception. ``I think it is starting to change,'' he said,
``but when you say the South Bronx, it's still a very negative
image.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cole, a lifelong South Bronx resident who received a
bachelor's degree from New York University and a master's in urban
planning from Harvard, it isn't just a place that nearly burned to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember another Bronx,'' he said, ``before the Cross Bronx
Expressway. I remember beautiful neighborhoods where people knew
everybody. It was an ethnically mixed and diverse neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   But then the massive highway construction that broke established
communities apart helped spark a process of urban decay, Cole said,
followed by a middle-class exodus to places like Co-op City, in the
north Bronx, and the suburbs beyond. ``By the end of the '70s you
could walk six blocks in any direction and you wouldn't see a
light. It was like being in a ghost town,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that housing has been built, and filled, he said, the place
needs the services that attract and keep the middle class, such as
good garbage collection, good schools, good parks and good air.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A small but appealing commercial strip lies around Bruckner and
Alexander, in the southernmost part of the South Bronx, where
antique dealers and artists have moved in. The first ones arrived
about seven years ago, but more are coming all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Tillery, who opened Tigris &AMP; Euphrates at 79 Alexander St.
last June, said that business in her antiques store has been
``fantastic.'' She imagines the area eventually being like
Greenwich Village, or Soho. ``It has that potential and flavor,''
she said. To speed it along, she said, she hopes to open an Italian
restaurant in her building. ``People are looking for things to eat
when they come over,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the development in the area has been pushed by Sobro,
which plans to work next on the revitalization of the south side of
Bruckner so it resembles the restored blocks on the north side.
Annual commercial rents vary, but the average in that area is
probably between $15 and $20 a square foot, Pariser said. ``We need
food,'' he said. ``We need cafes. And I think we're going to have
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it doesn't have any of the amenities of the Village or
SoHo, the antique district does have a key advantage: It is
incredibly geographically convenient. Although the expressways that
were cut through the Bronx may have destabilized neighborhoods,
they now make it easy for people to shop there. Denise Cruz,
co-owner of the Custom Design Studio, an upholsterer that has been
at 47 Bruckner Boulevard for four years, said that customers come
from Westchester and Connecticut as well as Manhattan because
transportation is so easy.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Chapman, the senior executive vice president of ABC Carpet
and Home, said that customers come to his store from everywhere in
the region and that the South Bronx's central location could make
it a fertile area for development by big outlet stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picture a Secaucus here,'' with its outlet stores, he said.
Chapman, a native of the South Bronx, said that security is good in
the area, and he is dismissive of those who fear crime there.
``I've had more cars stolen in my New York location,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As in other parts of the city, businesses benefit from a general
drop in crime. Detective Robert Butler, a community affairs officer
for the 41st Precinct, which includes Hunts Point and Longwood,
said that both drugs and prostitution still exist, but less so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot better now than it used to be,'' Butler said,
better even than just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The different feeling about crime shows up in all kinds of ways.
Josephine Infante, executive director of the Hunts Point Economic
Development Corp., said that businesses in the area's industrial
park never used to put signs out because they figured they would be
stolen. Now, she said, ``everyone puts out signs.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the area around Bruckner and Alexander stands out as a
retailing oasis, the enclave over at Hunt's Point is one of
artistic ferment. It is drawing people who grew up in the
neighborhood as well as people from outside.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Trattner, who teaches metal sculpture at the School of
Visual Arts in Manhattan and lives on the Lower East Side, was
working on a sculpture at the Socrates Sculpture Park in Queens
when she heard that the people at the Point were looking for
artists to work on a sculpture garden at the Hunts Point Avenue
subway stop on the No. 6 line. She built ``Pipe Dreams'' for them
in a space at the Point, and after it was erected she decided to
stay on, renting an outdoor studio space from the Point and
offering blacksmithing workshops to children in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   She finds the place supportive and invigorating. ``I have this
automatic community here of people who have an interest in my work
and are encouraging,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has talked to her artist friends about her work, but when
she says she is working in the Bronx, she said, ``they say, `Oh,
that's so far.''' It takes her about 50 minutes to get there from
the Lower East Side, she said, but somehow, to people in Manhattan,
the area is psychologically much farther away.
</P>
<P>
   And in one way, she said, it is very different _ a way that is
beneficial. ``I feel like I've found a haven here,'' she said.
``Partly, it is the actual cityscape up here. Things are more
spread out. You have a sense of the sky. And there's so much
excitement up here. People are hungry for invention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Point recently bought its building from Max Blauner, who
also owns the old American Bank Note Company building on Garrison
Street between Tiffany and Barretto, which covers 365,000 square
feet and is six stories at its tallest point. It is only half
occupied, mainly by companies in the textile business. The Point
and Blauner have nearly reached agreement for the Point to rent the
9,000 square feet, partly for Aviles' dance company and partly to
be sublet to artists in increments of 400 square feet for $375 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Lipson, executive director of the Point, said he had also
just received $12,000 in grants to develop a business plan to open
a Latin jazz cafe and club at the corner of Garrison and Hunts
Point Avenue, in a lovely building with a semicircular facade
typical of the area. Since it began five years ago, the Point has
nourished a number of business and artistic enterprises, including
a theater, hip-hop classes and a partnership with the International
Center of Photography that offers classes to local children and
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Still, progress in the amenities that make a neighborhood more
than just housing can be tough, and is uneven.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Torres is the director of the visual arts program at the
Longwood Art Project at 965 Longwood Avenue, between Beck and Kelly
Streets, an area distinguished by a number of historic homes as
well as a new Police Athletic League building. The center has been
offering free working space to artists, and organizing shows, but
financing has become too difficult to obtain, and people have been
reluctant to travel to shows in the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The center's last exhibition in the space will start Feb. 27.
Beginning in June, it will become a cyber gallery and will provide
computers so local artists can make and show work on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Rivera, a Bronx native and a real-estate lawyer with an
office in the Throgs Neck section, said that young, upwardly mobile
black and Hispanic residents, like their counterparts with other
ethnic backgrounds, still gravitate to Manhattan, to neighborhoods
like Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, Rivera said, is to make the South Bronx, so close
to Manhattan, more appealing to a large range of people. The area's
renewal, he said, has been mostly of the ``meat and potatoes
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, ``lifestyle and social opportunities have to catch
up.''

COMMENTARY: IOC NEEDS REFORMS TO SURVIVE  
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Note at end provides author identification.) 
(rk) 
 By DAVID F. D'ALESSANDRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It seems to be the way the world works: Every
government that forgets about the people who give it power and,
instead, concentrates on keeping its secrets, keeping its perks,
maintaining its rituals and preserving its own hide, eventually
implodes.
</P>
<P>
   It happened to Louis XVI, and it happened to the Soviet
Communist Party. Now, it's happening to the International Olympic
Committee. Day by day, the IOC proves itself to be more and more
incapable of rising above the corruption scandal surrounding it and
further and further from the honesty and openness that the Olympic
Games represent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, our concern at John Hancock is so profound that, if the
IOC cannot or will not clean up the mess in which it finds itself,
we will refuse to run any of the $20 million in advertising we had
budgeted for the televised broadcasts of the 2000 Games in Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the company plans to remove the Olympic rings from its
stationery and billboards if the situation is not resolved. John
Hancock pays about $40 million every four years to sponsor the
Games. Perhaps the IOC will only do the right thing when it
understands that its revenues as well as its reputation are in
peril.
</P>
<P>
   When the news broke in December that the Salt Lake City bid
committee allegedly bribed IOC members during the bidding process
for the 2002 Games, many of us involved with the Olympics were
initially heartened by the IOC's response.
</P>
<P>
   One of its most respected members, Dick Pound, investigated the
IOC's conduct in Salt Lake City, and he produced a thorough and
creditable report. Releasing Pound's findings on Jan. 24, Juan
Antonio Samaranch, the president of the IOC, said exactly what
needed to be said: ``We are resolute in our determination to root
out the improprieties and to ensure that this never happens
again.''
</P>
<P>
   That resolve wound up being tested almost immediately. On Jan.
22, the Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates revealed
that he had promised payments of $35,000 each to two IOC members
from Kenya and Uganda for their national sports federations just
hours before the critical vote for the host city of the 2000 Games
was cast.
</P>
<P>
   Although allegations were coming out of the woodwork about other
cities' efforts to win the Games, Sydney's case was especially
clear-cut. There was a definite intent to influence the outcome of
the selection process: Coates said he decided ``I wasn't going to
die wondering why we didn't win.'' Coates also revealed that the
payments were made contingent on Sydney's winning. And Sydney did
indeed win by just two votes.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 2, one day after the Australian Olympic Committee
admitted it could not account for $10,000 given to the Kenyan IOC
member's personal foundation, the IOC abruptly cleared Sydney of
any wrongdoing, calling the eleventh-hour payments ``perfectly
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible not to wonder what the IOC means by the word
``correct.'' Over in Lausanne, Switzerland, the IOC also seems to
be confused about the word bribery. According to the dictionary, it
is ``the act of influencing the action of another by corrupt
inducement,'' and the behavior of the Sydney bid committee appears
to fit this definition pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   The press may be right when it compares the IOC to royalty. The
IOC is like a royal family, one in which the cousins have been
marrying each other so long it's no wonder that their ideas of what
means what are a little daft.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the really interesting part: the IOC came to the
conclusion that all was well in Sydney weeks before a fact-finding
mission Samaranch had promised even took place, without even an
attempt at a formal investigation, without making Sydney's bid
documents public, and without talking with sports officials in
either Kenya or Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC also closed the books in the wake of mounting evidence
that the payments in question were nowhere near the wildest example
of Sydney's generosity. According to published reports, in order to
curry favor with another IOC member, the Australians spent $160,000
transporting seven horses to Mongolia. Guess the horses refused to
fly coach.
</P>
<P>
   The fig leaf the IOC is hiding behind in its refusal to
investigate the Sydney case is fooling no one. It has sent a letter
to all bid committees for the 1996 to 2006 Games, asking them if
they are aware of any corruption.
</P>
<P>
   This is like sending a letter to the proverbial fox in the hen
house asking, ``Would you mind telling us how many chickens you
have eaten?'' Then, if the fox sends back a polite note, ``None,
thank you,'' you issue a public statement exonerating the fox.
Incredible.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is not the zealous pursuit of corruption that
the IOC promised, but a classic cover-up. Here was the perfect
opportunity for the IOC to prove that it sincerely intended to
reform. Instead, it looked its own transgressions in the eye and
then retreated, shamelessly. This retreat lacks courage, lacks
leadership, lacks integrity, and falls well beneath the Olympic
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's cravenness became even more embarrassing last week,
when Sydney itself took the high road. Michael Knight, president of
the Sydney Olympic Organizing committee, called in the former
auditor-general of South Australia for an independent review of its
bid.
</P>
<P>
   The current leadership of the IOC is running out of chances. The
IOC has called a special session in March, and if it does not adopt
radical reforms, it will have lost any remaining shred of
credibility. If it is to survive, the IOC's reforms had better
include the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ First, an admission that it is incapable of investigating
itself. Samaranch calls the Olympic movement a ``family.'' If this
is so, let's stop pretending that a family can investigate family
and, instead, bring in some impartial professional auditors to do
the work. The IOC should immediately call on the governments of bid
countries or the United Nations to investigate Olympic bidding
practices and other alleged improprieties. It should cooperate
fully with these investigations, rid itself of anyone who has
abused the Olympic ideals and replace those who attempt to
rationalize or disguise impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, it's time to create an IOC membership that will make
the IOC accountable to the world community, one made up of
representatives appointed by every member country of the United
Nations. This is considerably different from the IOC's idea of
worldwide representation _ every member nominated by Samaranch and
appointed until age 80.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, the host city selection process must be permanently
changed so that the IOC membership at large never again has the
opportunity to visit, vote on and shake down the cities vying for
the Games. And Olympic athletes must become far more involved in
the host-selection process. On Friday, The Times reported that the
IOC may scrap its plans to reform this process because of
objections from the membership. Hopefully, the IOC leadership will
not be so weak because retreat on this point would be unforgivable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fourth, the IOC should demand that its members disclose all
gifts received in their capacity as delegates, including plane
tickets, free hotel accommodations and meals, as well as any income
they or their families derive, directly or indirectly, from any
association with the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fifth, an immediate search should begin for Samaranch's
successor, even though his term extends to 2001. We are not calling
for Samaranch's resignation at this time; we're simply recognizing
that it will take time to find the best possible candidate to
replace him whenever he leaves. Athletes, sponsors, news media and
national sports federations should participate in this search.
</P>
<P>
   If the IOC is incapable of making these changes, it is time for
the Olympic movement to look for new leadership, within the IOC or
outside the organization. More is at stake here than the pride and
arrogance of a few people in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember that there is a major difference between the IOC
and a monarchy. In a monarchy, the little people serve the pleasure
of the royals; Olympic athletes, on the other hand, do not train
and sacrifice their whole lives to serve the self-appointed
sovereigns of the IOC Indeed, the IOC's only reason for being is to
serve the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, the current leadership of the IOC has turned the
Olympics into an enormous popular success that has allowed the
Games to command billions of dollars from corporate sponsors and
broadcasters. And the IOC has used these tremendous resources to
support sports at the grass roots level around the world.
</P>
<P>
   However, the lethargic pace of the IOC in rooting out corruption
and its abrupt about-faces as to what constitutes corruption are
hurting every constituency it serves _ the corporate sponsors who
write the big checks, the broadcasters who write even bigger
checks, and the athletes in places so poor they cannot even afford
a team uniform or a pair of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   All of us depend on a public that believes the Olympic Games are
higher, purer, and more noble than any other sporting event in the
world. Though it doesn't happen very often, the interests of the
poorest athlete and the richest corporation are exactly the same
here: we all want the Olympic Games to stand for an integrity that
can't be bought. They have no value to any of us if they don't.

AT HOME: PAYING OFF CO-OP SHARE LOANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Co-op shareholders, like home buyers, usually borrow
money to purchase their apartments. And just like homeowners, they
must also make sure to tie up any loose ends that may remain when
they pay off their loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole series of things to watch out for when you
pay off a share loan,'' said Arthur Weinstein, vice president of
the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with mortgages, he said, share loans are usually
``secured loans'' _ meaning that in addition to giving the lender a
promissory note for the amount of the loan, a borrower also
provides the lender with a lien against the borrower's property.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the lien are specified in a document known as the
security agreement. Unlike homeowners, who pledge real estate as
security for their loans, co-op shareholders instead pledge stock
certificates showing the number of shares allotted to their units
as well as their proprietary leases.
</P>
<P>
   As with home mortgages, Weinstein said, co-op security
agreements are filed in the public records to inform prospective
purchasers of the presence of the outstanding loan and the lien it
imposes on the property. Rather than being ``recorded'' like a
mortgage, however, the lien created by a share loan is evidenced
instead by filing with the county clerk a legal document known as a
UCC-1 Financing Statement.
</P>
<P>
   The UCC-1, Weinstein explained, is a form promulgated under the
provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, a federal law that
governs certain commercial transactions. Like a recorded mortgage,
he said, a filed UCC-1 form provides public notice of the lender's
security interest in the borrower's property.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements of many lenders, however, go beyond having only
the filed UCC-1 form as security for a share loan. In fact,
Weinstein said, lenders typically demand actual, physical
possession of both the original stock certificate and a duplicate
of the borrower's proprietary lease bearing original signatures.
Moreover, he said, lenders will also insist upon receiving what is
known as a ``recognition agreement'' from the co-op itself.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Greenstein, another Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that the
recognition agreement, which is signed by the borrower, the lender
and the co-op corporation, commits the co-op not to cancel the
stock or the lease or to allow additional financing without the
consent of the lender.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also requires the co-op to notify the lender if
the borrower fails to make monthly maintenance payments. That
provision is significant for co-op lenders, Greenstein said,
because a co-op lien for unpaid maintenance charges takes
precedence over the lien of the lender. The recognition agreement,
he explained, gives the lender the opportunity to make payments on
behalf of a defaulted borrower to prevent the co-op from
foreclosing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Greenstein said, co-op lenders will typically require
two other documents _ a signed stock power and a signed assignment
of the proprietary lease, which give the lender the right to
transfer the shares and lease into its own name or the name of a
third party. Both documents become operative only if the borrower
defaults on the loan and the bank forecloses under the security
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Greenstein said, with most co-op share loans there
will be at least eight separate loan documents required and held by
the lender: the promissory note, the security agreement, the UCC-1,
the original stock certificate, a duplicate proprietary lease with
original signatures, a stock power and assignment of proprietary
lease, and the recognition agreement. Most of them, he said, should
be accounted for when the loan is paid in full.
</P>
<P>
   As with a mortgage, Greenstein said, a share loan can be
satisfied in a number of ways _ it may be paid in full over the
full term of the loan, paid early in a lump sum from the borrower's
own funds, or paid early in a lump sum out of the proceeds of a
sale of the apartment or a refinancing of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how or when the loan is satisfied, Greenstein said,
the borrower should insure that the lender returns at the very
least the promissory note, the stock certificate, the proprietary
lease and the stock power and assignment of lease. The lender
should also provide the borrower with what is known as a UCC-3
Termination Statement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The UCC-3 terminates the UCC-1,'' Greenstein said, adding that
for that to happen the UCC-3 form must be filed in the same
government office that the UCC-1 was originally filed. Moreover, he
said, borrowers should make sure that all of the information on the
UCC-3 matches exactly the information contained on the original
UCC-1.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Racht, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that it was not
unusual for borrowers who pay off their share loans to receive a
UCC-3 form from their lender and then fail to file it. It is also
possible that the UCC-3 form prepared by the lender contains
incorrect information and cannot be used to terminate the UCC-1.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, Ms. Racht said, that could create problems when
the shareholder wants to sell the apartment because the original
lien will still be reflected on the records. Such problems can be
magnified significantly, she said _ with accompanying time spent by
lawyers dealing with the situation _ if the original UCC-3 form is
lost by the shareholder or if the original lender has gone out of
business or cannot be located.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Racht said, it is for that reason that it is
imperative for a borrower who has paid off a share loan to receive
and safely file the original promissory note, the stock
certificates and the proprietary lease. It is also useful, she
said, to request the return of the original security agreement _
marked ``canceled'' _ and the original ``recognition agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The note and security agreement, she said, can be used to prove
that the loan has been paid. The stock certificates and proprietary
lease, she said, will be required at the time of sale. And the
recognition agreement, Ms. Racht said, could be useful if the co-op
has not reflected the payment of the loan on its books.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Ms. Racht said, shareholders who take out home equity
loans or lines of credit need to be particularly vigilant with
regard to UCC-1 liens. In most cases, she said, home equity lenders
will file UCC-1 Financing Statements when a loan or line of credit
is established. As a result, she said, it is necessary for
borrowers who pay off their equity loans or cancel their lines of
credit to insure that the lender provides them with a UCC-3
Termination Statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can really be a big problem,'' Ms. Racht said. ``Because
you can end up with a UCC-1 lien sitting out there for an equity
line of credit you haven't even tapped.''

REVISITING A KILLING: MANY DETAILS, BUT A MYSTERY REMAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NY-SUSPECT-AFRICANS, NY-SUSPECT-BULLETS) 
 (bl)  
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When four plainclothes police officers arrived for
work in the Bronx at 9:30 p.m. 11 days ago, the mission of their
late-night tour was as clear as the evening sky.
</P>
<P>
   They were members of the Street Crime Unit, assigned to patrol
the 43rd Precinct in an unmarked car, keeping a wary eye out for
crimes in progress, people with illegal guns and a rapist who had
terrorized 44 women.
</P>
<P>
   But less than three hours later, the officers' lives would be
capsized, an unarmed West African immigrant would be dead at their
feet and the often strained relationship between the Police
Department and the city's many minority groups would again be as
tense as a trigger finger.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of perhaps no more than 10 seconds, investigators
believe, the officers fired a fusillade of 41 shots at Amadou
Diallo, a 22-year-old street peddler, killing him and raising a
series of questions about how an unarmed man with a spotless record
came to be gunned down in the doorway of his apartment building in
the Soundview section.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many of those questions remain unanswered because the
officers have yet to speak to investigators and detectives have yet
to find anyone else who witnessed their initial encounter with
Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   The largest of those questions _ and one that even police union
officials have been unable to answer _ is what could explain the
explosive barrage of bullets unleashed against what many neighbors
have described as a thoroughly mild-mannered man.
</P>
<P>
   But through a review of official police documents and interviews
with law enforcement officials, lawyers for the officers, and
neighbors of Diallo, the broad outlines of what occurred on Wheeler
Avenue in the early morning hours of Feb. 4 can be discerned.
</P>
<P>
   That night, less than two hours after driving their maroon Ford
Taurus off Randalls Island, where their unit's headquarters are,
the officers responded with several other patrol cars to a report
of an officer needing assistance, just blocks from the shooting
scene. In that incident, an officer had been injured around 11 p.m.
when he fell down the stairs of a building at 1261 Boynton Avenue
while trying to arrest two youths on assault and drug possession
charges.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they arrived, however, their lawyer said, the
suspects had been arrested, so Officers Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll,
Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy resumed patrol. Although as
white men, the officers did not blend in with the largely minority
community they were in, they were dressed unobtrusively in gray and
black sweatshirts, blue jeans and sneakers. McMellon also had on a
baseball hat.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, which remains unclear, at 12:40 a.m. the
officers drove down Wheeler Avenue, a one-way street of two-story,
red-brick homes where Diallo lived. A witness has told the Bronx
district attorney's office, which is leading the investigation,
that while parking his car before the shooting he spotted Diallo in
the vestibule of Diallo's building at 1157 Wheeler Ave. and saw
Diallo peering up and down the street, as if he was waiting for
somebody.
</P>
<P>
   That witness was not there when the shooting started, police
officials said, so it remains unclear just what about Diallo caught
the officers' attention. The officers' union lawyer, Stephen Worth,
has said the officers believed that Diallo fit the generic
description of the rapist for whom they were looking.
</P>
<P>
   The officers double-parked and McMellon and Carroll started up
the stairs to Diallo's building, while Murphy and Boss trailed
behind. All had their badges out, Worth said, and all identified
themselves as police officers.
</P>
<P>
   But Worth said Diallo appeared to have a problem understanding
and responding to the officers' shouted commands. Diallo's friends
have disputed the notion that he had a problem understanding
English. At some point in the encounter, according to Worth's
account, the officers believed that Diallo was reaching for a gun
and, believing their lives were in jeopardy, opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was hit by 19 of the 41 bullets fired at him; 11 of them
struck his legs, and one hit his right arm. The other seven struck
his torso. His body fell back against the wall of the vestibule and
slid to the floor, where it was found, propped up at the waist in a
slouched sitting position, investigators said. Near his body
investigators found a beeper and his wallet, police officials said,
which are perhaps the items he was reaching for when the police
fired. In his pants pocket were his house keys.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear which of the officers shot first, although a
person who has heard the officers' account of the events that night
said there is no disagreement among them over which of them first
began shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators estimate that the closest officers, McMellon and
Carroll, fired at Diallo from the building's stoop, perhaps at a
distance of 5 to 12 feet. One spent shell casing was found inside
the vestibule near Diallo's body, but investigators believe it may
have been kicked there in the shooting's chaotic aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   The city medical examiner's office has declined to say whether
any powder burns were found on Diallo's body, which would indicate
that he was shot at very close range.
</P>
<P>
   Police have traced at least three of the bullets that hit Diallo
to the guns of McMellon, Carol and Boss. They have yet to trace a
bullet that struck him to Murphy's gun, although the ballistic
tests are still being conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The most puzzling question to be answered is whether any factor,
aside from panic, prompted the officers to fire so many times. So
far, three possible theories have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The first theory is that the officers may have mistakenly
believed they were being fired on because some of their own bullets
appear to have ricocheted off the wall. One of the officers, Sean
Carroll, has turned in a pair of pants that he says he was wearing
that night which have a small hole in one leg, possibly created by
a wayward bullet, a person close to the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A second theory being advanced is that Diallo did not fall down
immediately upon being shot because the bullets passed so quickly
and cleanly through his body, leading officers to continue firing.
</P>
<P>
   A third theory holds that the other officers may have become
confused when McMellon fell back on the stairs during the shooting,
and believed he had been hit. The officer suffered a fractured
tailbone in the incident. His colleague, Carroll, also said after
the shooting that he had hurt his right knee, left foot and neck,
although it is not clear how.
</P>
<P>
   When the shooting ceased, several witnesses have reported that
the officers appeared distraught, apparently after realizing that
Diallo had no gun. One police supervisor said Boss appeared ``dazed
and teary-eyed'' as he sat in the back of a police car after the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could not speak and just indicated with a hand gesture that
he was OK,'' a police official said, speaking on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have said that none of the officers made
statements about what occurred at the scene and they have not been
questioned since. Barry Scheck, a lawyer for the Diallo family,
said Saturday that he found it discomforting that New York
officials do not do more to question officers immediately after
fatal shootings, before they have a chance to coordinate their
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every other city in America, when a shooting like this goes
down, the officers are asked, `What happened, man?''' Scheck said.
</P>
<P>
   But Worth said officers in shootings that are investigated as
criminal matters are never questioned here because no officer under
scrutiny would be careless enough to disregard his constitutional
right to avoid self-incrimination or agree to be interviewed
without his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``To suggest that police officers should be brought into the
stationhouse and somehow attempted to be questioned is ludicrous,''
he said. ``These are police officers who advise people of their
constitutional rights on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the officers were taken to the emergency room at
Westchester Square Hospital in the Bronx, where they waited for
approximately four hours to be treated, according to members of the
hospital staff. In addition to the orthopedic injuries reported by
McMellon and Carroll, some of the officers were suffering from
trauma, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the officers became upset that they were being
forced to wait so long to be seen by a doctor and lodged a
complaint with the hospital's administrators. A spokesman for the
hospital, vice president Lisa Nenner, declined comment on the
incident.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   TORONTO _ Corine Oakley kept fussing with the satellite dish
outside her Cleveland home last week, turning and twisting to no
avail. She went back inside and tried the remote again. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 10 years, she could not watch her son's
games on television. On the screen and in spirit, Charles Oakley
had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to change my dish around, go to the cable company or
do something,'' she said. ``Some days, I hate to talk to Charles,''
she added. ``He sounds so low. He just stays in his hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley still receives the pro-rated balance of his $10 million
salary and gets to play basketball for a living. But he never
dreamed the final years of his career would involve high-fiving a
Raptors' mascot and watching his 20-something teammates fold in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The power forward who never wanted to leave Madison Square
Garden returns to New York on Tuesday night. He brings not only the
tenacity and grit that endeared him to Knick fans the past decade,
but also the resentment that comes with being traded from a
contender to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't leave on bad terms, I didn't trade myself,'' Oakley
said. ``Maybe they should announce my name and then call Ernie out
there and ask him if he has anything to say,'' he said, referring
to Ernie Grunfeld, the Knicks' team president and general manager
who made the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months after he was dealt to Toronto for Marcus Camby, the
subject remains an open wound for Oakley. In reflecting on it and
his career in New York, he was candid about his feelings about his
former teammates, management, the future of the Knicks and his
gradual adjustment to playing for an expansion franchise. From
Grunfeld to Patrick Ewing, no one was spared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the talent around him gets better,'' Oakley said
of Ewing. ``I don't know if he needs to take less shots or what.
But something in his game needs to change for them to be a better
team. Over the years, he's always been the main focus. Can he
accept somebody else getting the spotlight? The more he can accept,
the better off the team will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Knicks' new acquisitions, he added: ``When a lot of guys
need the ball, it's hard to gel. Larry trying to sacrifice, Allan
need the ball, Sprewell need it, Patrick need it. Then you get a
Dennis Scott. All he does is shoot 3's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many of those new guys have playoff
experience. You got to look at that, too. I know Dennis Scott went
to the finals. He didn't hit a shot, I think.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, who will be a free agent after this season, is still
undecided about his future, so much so that he isn't sure whether
to buy or rent. For now, he occupies a corner suite of a posh,
Victorian-style hotel near the Raptors' new arena in downtown
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   An open box of Frosted Flakes rested on the television console.
A pair of briefs hung over the TV. Eighteen pairs of dress shoes _
from Mauri to Pablo De Marco _ were strewn around the front room.
Always the fashion plate, Oakley had two clothing racks brought in
to hold 70 or so of his designer suits. More overburdened than
anything being wheeled around the Garment District, the two racks
stand on opposite sides of his bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Miniature speakers connected to his compact disc player anchor
both ends of an ornate fireplace mantle. A crystal chandelier and a
mahogany china cabinet occupy the room, too. It's an odd fit, as if
the National Basketball Association's king of grunt work was
awkwardly thrust into a Merchant and Ivory screenplay, alongside
Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different,'' Oakley said. ``All they talk about is
hockey, hockey, hockey. The money is different. They say Toronto is
like New York, but I haven't been out.''
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, Oakley was the consummate socialite. One night
after a game, he would stop by Cafe 31 next to the Garden. Other
nights, he would hold court at the Shark Bar on the Upper West
Side. In Toronto, he watches CNN, checks his stocks and telephones
his friends to take the pulse of New York and reminisce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great time my 10 years,'' Oakley said of his tenure in
New York. ``I know I had ups and downs and people might not always
like the way you do things. But deep down inside, I gave my best
every night. That's all I could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't go out there and try to shortcut it. Some nights, I
didn't get double-figure rebounds, but I'd try to do something
else. You always got to work. It's all about work. You ain't doing
one thing, do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, Oakley already has made his mark with the
Raptors. In four games, he's averaging 9 points and 8 rebounds. He
bought his teammates T-shirts that read ``Strictly Business'' the
first few days of training camp. To make sure he was not acquired
to babysit, Oakley and the veteran center Kevin Willis met with
Coach Butch Carter before the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were about the business of basketball and not about the
business of taking care of young guys and letting them run the
place,'' Carter said. ``I assured them that there would be a dress
code on the airplane and no extra people allowed in the locker
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley said, ``It's a job, not a day-care center.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, he's the same old Oak. Beyond the banging inside,
he still tries to get away with a few behind-the-back passes and an
ill-advised shot or two during the course of a game. He humors his
teammates by knocking rookies down and telling them in very abrupt
terms to get back up.
</P>
<P>
   But the trade has made the calluses pile up faster than the
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to be respected,'' he said. ``I had a run-in
with Ernie and Checketts,'' he said of Grunfeld and Dave Checketts,
the Garden president. ``It wasn't a respectful conversation, so
that gave me some hints and views about life and issues, about,
`Don't let anyone ever know your hole card.'''
</P>
<P>
   He compared the Garden's corporate structure to a seedy
back-room card game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like playing poker,'' he said. ``You see somebody
standing around a table, and you never know why he's standing
around. Sometimes, he's trying to look at your hand. You're
watching a Western movie and they're playing cards, and people
standing around. You never knew who's playing together.''
</P>
<P>
   His brutally honest comments, he said, did not always mesh well
with an image-consumed franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, all I tried to do was show them my respect,
this and that,'' he said. ``We sat down at midseason. Sometimes,
they didn't want to hear the truth. They'd be like, `We know this,
but we don't want anyone else to know.' They always try to control
what you say in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Never fully elaborating, he said: ``Some things were said in a
conversation with us that I thought wasn't the proper thing that
should have been said. Even though I didn't let it stop my
performance on the court, I always knew that anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Corine Oakley drove five hours north from Cleveland to be with
Oakley's sister, Saralene, last Tuesday night to see her son play.
Sitting in her seat at Maple Leaf Gardens, she recalled the
Grunfeld family visiting her Cleveland home during the All-Star
Game in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him, `Would you ever trade Charles?' while he was
eating the food I cooked for him and his family. Ernie said, `Oh,
no, we'll never trade Charles.'''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley was in Virginia on draft day last June, having a good
time with friends. He had heard rumors, but had not received the
call from Grunfeld until about 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `What?' He said, `We wanted to get younger,' and I
said, `You ain't gotta say nothing to me. Bye.'''
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld tried to further explain the trade, but Oakley
interrupted, recalling that he said: ``If I'm traded, I'm traded.
I'm no longer your commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley said their next exchange came during a face-to-face
encounter at John Starks' annual golf outing in September. When
Grunfeld approached Oakley and his friends at a table, Oakley
refused to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you want to shake my hand?'' Oakley asked. ``You just
traded me. You shouldn't even want to deal with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers said Grunfeld left shaken and disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld said he does not remember the specific conversation
with Oakley's mother and added: ``We had tremendous respect for Oak
and what he did for the franchise. It's never easy to trade a
player, especially a player you have a long history with. But
that's part of the business. There may be a handful of guys that
have never been traded in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing said: ``He's a great player. I miss him and I wish he was
still here.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Corine Oakley. While she concedes that her son was lucky
to play for the same team for 10 years, Corine, like a lot of
people at the Garden, misses seeing Charles in a Knicks uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will be missing Oakley in other ways, too. For the
last decade, Oakley brought his teammates home at least once a year
to eat his mother's cooking. Corine would even alter the menu,
making string beans with turkey because Ewing did not like pork.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard one of the Knicks players ask, `Is Mrs. Oakley going
to cook for us when we go to Cleveland?''' Corine Oakley said.
</P>
<P>
   She smiled ruefully and shook her head. ``I don't think so.'' &QL;

MAYOR SAYS OFFICERS' NEW AMMUNITION WILL BE SAFER
</HEADLINE>
   (With NY-SUSPECT-AFRICANS, NY-SUSPECT-INQUIRY) 
(jw) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Saturday that the Police
Department would issue hollow-point bullets to officers in the
coming months, adding that the decision was based on a concern for
public safety.
</P>
<P>
   These bullets, which differ from regular ball ammunition in
their ability to expand greatly on impact, cause greater injury to
people they strike but are less likely to pass through a body and
hit bystanders. In July, the department first announced that its
40,000-member force would be issued the new ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to the conclusion a few months ago after studying it
very carefully that hollow-point bullets would actually be safer
than the bullets that were being used,'' said Giuliani, joined by
Police Commissioner Howard Safir at a City Hall news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether it was prudent to issue officers bullets that
cause more serious injury, Safir said studies comparing the two
types of ammunition had found that fatalities were about the same.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as reporters peppered Giuliani and Safir
with questions about the Feb. 4 killing of Amadou Diallo, an
unarmed street peddler who was shot by four officers from a street
crimes unit who were patrolling in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have long complained that ball
ammunition, like that used by New York City police officers, has
less stopping power than hollow-point ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Most municipal and federal law enforcement agencies have already
switched to hollow-point ammunition, and the New York City Police
Department began testing several different brands last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't happy with the performance of the first brand, then
we tried another,'' said Marilyn Mode, a department spokeswoman.
``We expect to have delivery within the month and everything should
be fully implemented within six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of getting the officers to the shooting
range to get qualified to shoot the new ammunition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who favor replacing ball ammunition point out that with
conventional bullets, an officer must fire more bullets to bring a
suspect down and that the ball ammunition can pass through a
suspect or ricochet, sometimes hitting unintended targets. The
officers who killed Diallo fired 41 times, leaving several holes in
the wall of his apartment building vestibule before he slumped to
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the department's plans to switch to hollow-point
bullets said the mayor's announcement was merely an attempt to
defuse criticism of the officers' use of extraordinary firepower in
the Diallo case.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the overriding criticisms coming from the Diallo
shooting was the number of shots fired,'' said Norman Siegel,
executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. ``With
the change to hollow-point bullets, they are attempting to make the
argument that you won't have to fire 41 shots any longer. You will
have to fire less times to take a person down.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel added that the mayor and police commissioner should be
concentrating on the weapons training that officers received and
how they were taught to interact with people on the streets. ``Cops
should not see every young African-American man they pass as a
profile for a criminal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said he and representatives of the NAACP Legal Defense
and Educational Fund had asked state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer
to create a special police misconduct legal unit within his office.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The office would monitor complaints of police brutality,
maintain a database that tracked patterns of reported and confirmed
acts of police misconduct, and would develop a team of
investigators that could help district attorneys when prosecuting
police misconduct cases, Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, Diallo's family joined the Rev. Al Sharpton at
the headquarters of his National Action Network in Harlem for his
weekly radio broadcast and a rally.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton reiterated his call for Giuliani to suspend or arrest
the four officers who shot Diallo, and he announced a series of
gatherings and protests in the coming weeks, starting with a
motorcade to Newark International Airport in New Jersey on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's body is being flown home to Guinea in West Africa for
burial.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton also announced that the Diallo family would set up a
foundation to finance scholarships for African students studying in
America and to support families victimized by police brutality. He
said he would make the first donation, of $500.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's parents, uncle and cousin spoke briefly at the rally.
``I miss my cousin, I miss my friend,'' Neneh Kallay, 24, said.
``All I ask is justice.'' As Diallo's mother nodded, Ms. Kallay
said, ``I know wherever he is, he's smiling down on us _ he's
saying, `Thank you, thank you very much.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The mother of Patrick Baily, who was shot and killed by Officer
Kenneth Boss in Brooklyn in October 1997, spoke at the rally. Boss
is one of the four officers who shot Diallo; the shooting of Baily
is still under investigation by the Brooklyn district attorney's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had done something when my son was killed,'' Evadine
Baily said, ``this kid would still be alive today.''

 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton announced Saturday that he would
send nearly 4,000 troops to Kosovo to defend the ``national
interest'' as part of a NATO peacekeeping force, provided the
ethnic Albanians and Serbs who are warring there strike a peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has a national interest in achieving this peace,''
Clinton said. ``If the conflict persists, there likely will be a
tremendous loss of life and a massive refugee crisis in the middle
of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the parties have made little progress during peace talks
in France, despite pressure from NATO to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But in the event of an agreement, the Clinton administration and
its European allies want to have a force ready to move swiftly into
the area, a formerly autonomous enclave in southern Serbia, on the
border with Albania. Ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo are demanding
independence from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Senate found him not guilty on charges of
perjury and obstruction of justice, the president used what is
often a low-key forum for perfunctory policy ruminations _ his
weekly radio address _ to announce a decision that has been in the
works for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement was timed to strengthen the hand of
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who flew on Saturday to
Paris to meet with representatives of the Serbs and Kosovo
Albanians, as well as with European foreign ministers who are
overseeing the peace negotiations under way in Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   But White House aides also expected Clinton's announcement to
draw concentrated news coverage and commentary to compete with
lingering musings over the trial.
</P>
<P>
   In his radio address, Clinton argued that the prospect of U.S.
participation in the NATO force would give ``both sides the
confidence to lay down their arms.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that the NATO mission, which is expected to include
28,000 troops in all, ``be well-defined, with a clear and realistic
strategy to allow us to bring our forces home when their work is
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been consulting with members of Congress
to secure their support for the mission, but it has taken the
position that it does not need formal congressional approval to
send troops. Clinton said Saturday that he would make his ``final
decision'' to send troops ``in close consultation'' with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent Republicans have voiced support for such a
mission, but others have raised concerns, some of which were echoed
by Pentagon officials until late last week. They worried that the
mission could drag on indefinitely, at high cost, and embroil U.S.
soldiers in what amounts to a civil war over ethnic grievances that
have roots dating back to the 14th century.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that he would not send troops unless the
Serbs and Kosovo Albanians agree to the force and demonstrate that
they will implement the peace agreement. That agreement, he said,
``must provide for an immediate cease-fire, rapid withdrawal of
most Serbian security forces, and demilitarization of the
insurgents.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for NATO peacekeepers on the ground in Kosovo to
enforce an armistice, the ethic Albanians are being asked to give
up demands for independence and accept autonomy, officials said. As
the president showed himself once again focused on his job on
Saturday, he also signaled that he is willing to put his robust
political approval ratings to the test on a potentially risky
military mission in a place unfamiliar to most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he had learned from the conflict in Bosnia,
where a bloody conflict raged for years before the United States
brokered a still-fragile peace agreement and dispatched troops to
enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bosnia taught us a lesson,'' the president said. ``In this
volatile region, violence we fail to oppose leads to even greater
violence we will have to oppose later, at greater cost.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that in the case of Kosovo, the violence could spread
to Albania and Macedonia, and reignite the conflict in Bosnia. ``It
could even involve our NATO allies, Greece and Turkey,'' Clinton
said. ``If we wait until casualties mount and war spreads, any
effort to stop it will come at a higher price under more dangerous
conditions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under the current NATO plan, Kosovo would be divided into zones
overseen by a peacekeeping force that would be overwhelmingly
European. In Bosnia, by contrast, the NATO-led force is dominated
by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1989, Kosovo was an autonomous region within the old
communist Yugoslavia, and ethnic rivalries there had been subsumed
for decades under the tough doctrine laid down by communist
Yugoslavia's founder, Josip Broz Tito.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also the cradle of Serbian nationalism, revered by
many Serbs as the site of their most holy Orthodox monuments and a
1389 battle that marked the start of their centuries-long struggle
to preserve that faith during rule by the Ottoman Turks.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic used the cause of Kosovo to whip up
his campaign to carve a Greater Serbia from the collapse of
communist Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's Albanians, who make up about 90 percent of the
province's estimated 2 million people, responded with a campaign of
nonviolent civil disobedience, creating a completely parallel
system of schools and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   As Yugoslavia disintegrated with a war, first in Slovenia and
then in Croatia and Bosnia, Kosovo was viewed by diplomats and
military specialists as the ultimate flashpoint.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, local police and special military units sent by the
Serbian government in Belgrade began a violent campaign to crack
down on the Kosovo Liberation Army, a rebel force that had
abandoned the Kosovo Albanians' previously peaceful tactics and
decided to fight for independence.
</P>
<P>
   A threat last fall of NATO air strikes has muted but not ended
the violence. On Saturday a bomb exploded outside a
government-owned bank in a southern Kosovo town, injuring nine
people, according to The Associated Press. No one immediately
claimed responsibility.

<P>
   As cities prepare to sue the gun industry for not taking steps
to keep their products out of criminals' hands, critics of the
industry are building an argument that gun makers began making more
powerful handguns to make up for stagnant sales and that these guns
quickly became popular among criminals.
</P>
<P>
   While the marketing innovation increased the gun makers'
profits, the critics contend, it also helped account for the rise
in homicides in the 1980s and the greater seriousness of gunshot
wounds in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The latest and most detailed addition to the argument is made by
Tom Diaz, a former congressional expert on handgun control, in his
book, ``Making A Killing: The Business of Guns In America,''
published last month by the New Press. Over the last decade, gun
makers have found that what would sell best are higher-caliber,
more rapid-fire pistols that can be easily concealed, Diaz writes,
and that by designing such pistols they have gotten gun lovers
addicted to more powerful weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun industry has deliberately enhanced its profits by
increasing the lethality _ the killing power _ of its products,''
writes Diaz, now a senior policy analyst at the Violence Policy
Center in Washington, a research and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   This argument may become part of the case against gun makers, as
a growing number of cities contend in lawsuits that the
manufacturers concentrated on making their handguns more deadly
rather than incorporating new safety devices. Some of the cities
say the gun makers have data showing that their products were being
sold in ways that increased their chances of ending up in the hands
of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   An example of this kind of accusation was made in a lawsuit
brought in Brooklyn on behalf of victims in seven shootings against
25 gun manufacturers. In a jury verdict returned on Thursday in
U.S. District Court, 15 of the arms makers were found negligent and
nine were held liable for damages. The gun manufacturers were
accused in the suit of oversupplying stores in Southern states that
have lax gun laws, knowing that some of the guns would be bought by
people in New York City who would resell them to criminals and
juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   Five cities have sued the gun makers: New Orleans, Chicago,
Miami, Atlanta and Bridgeport, Conn. Cities planning to file such
suits soon include Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles
and Gary, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz has built on the work of Dr. Garren Wintemute, an emergency
room physician and director of the Violence Prevention Research
Program at the University of California at Davis, who reported that
the new generation of semiautomatic handguns introduced in the
1980s led to an increase in the number of wounds in gunshot victims
and made people shot by handguns more likely to die.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Feldman, the executive director of the American Shooting
Sports Council, a trade association, said that Diaz was drawing a
faulty conclusion from a normal business practice. ``Just like the
fashion industry, the firearms industry likes to encourage new
products to get people to buy its products,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   The gun manufacturers should not have to worry that their guns
are becoming more deadly or be more likely to cause worse wounds,
Feldman said. ``I don't think that enters into our calculations,''
he said. ``If the gun has more stopping power, it is a more
effective weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Feldman said, ``We design weapons, not for the bad
guys, but for the good guys.'' If criminals happen to get their
hands on a gun, it is not the manufacturer's fault, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could design a gun for the bad guy, they would all shoot
backward,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in pistols that are more deadly began with a shift
in design from revolvers, which generally hold six rounds, to
faster-firing semiautomatic pistols with larger magazines capable
of holding 10 or more rounds of ammunition, Diaz argues. The next
step was the introduction of higher-caliber ammunition, moving from
the older and smaller .22- or .38-caliber pistols to the larger
9-millimeter or .40-caliber handguns.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the gun industry introduced yet another change,
producing very small, lightweight pistols known as ``pocket
rockets,'' which are easily concealed, but have more firepower than
older handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sanetti, a lawyer for Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co., the largest
manufacturer of all types of guns, said that his company's
largest-selling handgun continued to be revolvers and that it did
not manufacture the new small-size handgun.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Diaz says that the gun industry was led to its
strategy of innovation because demand for its traditional products
_ rifles, shotguns and revolvers _ had slowed as the number of
Americans who hunt began to decline and the end of the military
draft reduced familiarity with guns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, there were 14 million hunters in America, down from
20.6 million in 1975, according to the United States Fish and
Wildlife Service. Surveys by the agency have shown that hunters
tend to be white males in rural areas, a shrinking proportion of
the population. From 1989 to 1996, the overall sales of rifles,
shotguns and handguns declined to 3.8 million from 4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   While there was no ``smoking gun'' memorandum that proved gun
manufacturers intended to increase sales by making their handguns
more deadly, Diaz says, those statistics were behind the gun
makers' strategy of innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry might have chosen to develop safer firearms,''
Diaz contends in the book, like guns with child-resistant safety
locks, ``but gun-industry executives deliberately chose to take
exactly the opposite direction.'' The new handguns have proved
``more suitable for use in crime,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, new research has found that more than 90
percent of the increase in homicides from 1985 to 1993 involved
crimes with handguns, said James Alan Fox, dean of the college of
criminal justice at Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   In those same years, Diaz said, the number of pistols made by
United States gun manufacturers increased by 92 percent and deaths
by handguns jumped 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wintemute said that although there were no national figures
available, statistics from hospitals in Chicago, Washington and
Philadelphia in the 1980s showed a sharp rise in the number of
patients admitted for the treatment of gunshot wounds who had more
than one bullet wound. In addition, from 1986 to 1992, the
proportion of handgun homicides in those cities involving
semiautomatic pistols rather than revolvers jumped to nearly 50
percent from about 10 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As another indication of the trend, Wintemute said, although
there has been an overall decrease in shootings since 1993, ``there
has been an increase in the percentage of people who get shot who
die as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   As criminals were able to purchase the new class of
semiautomatic pistols with larger magazines, police forces also
began switching from revolvers to pistols for protection, Diaz
said, and then the gun makers introduced higher-caliber bullets,
which he says led criminals and the police to go to more potent
ammunition.

PORT AUTHORITY STRUGGLES TO KEEP 2 SHIPPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Md.)  (bl) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Executives of the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey are scrambling to prevent two shipping lines that transport
billions of dollars' worth of cargo through the harbor from moving
to Baltimore, even as New York and New Jersey are locked in a
bitter struggle over subsidies intended to keep them here.
</P>
<P>
   Sea-Land Service and Maersk Line, whose sprawling operations at
the Elizabeth Marine Terminal in New Jersey handle a quarter of all
the container cargo moving through the port, have threatened to
move to Baltimore, which has a harbor with deeper channels and has
offered subsidies that would cut their costs by tens of millions of
dollars. The two carriers, which together have about 1,000
employees and a $100 million payroll, rejected the Port Authority's
last offer in September.
</P>
<P>
   Top commissioners at the Port Authority, Lewis Eisenberg of New
Jersey and Charles Gargano of New York, are to review a new
proposal from the carriers on Tuesday; that may lead to talks that
will narrow the gap between New York and Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations have taken on increasing urgency because
Sea-Land's long-term lease in Elizabeth expires at the end of the
month and Maersk's leases expire over the next 16 months. The two
companies, which have an operating alliance, say they will make a
final decision in March on whether to build a hub port for North
American trade in Baltimore or greatly expand the one at the
Elizabeth Marine Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains unclear whether New York and New Jersey can forge
a united front to deal with Sea-Land and Maersk. The leases have
become entwined in the disputes between the two states about the
Port Authority. New York, which has taken a tougher stance with the
companies, contends that New Jersey has long received too much of
the agency's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has emerged as the port is poised to invest billions
of dollars in new construction and deeper channels to accommodate
the huge hulls of a new generation of container vessels. The
changes are aimed at tripling the port's cargo volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an absolutely crucial issue,'' said H. Claude Shostal,
president of the Regional Plan Association, a private planning
group for the two states. ``We risk losing a significant portion of
the shipping industry to Baltimore and Halifax, Nova Scotia. We'd
better get serious about retaining this business or we're going to
see a serious economic engine weakened.''
</P>
<P>
   New York and New Jersey diverge in their approaches to the
negotiations. Fearing that the departure of Sea-Land, a unit of the
CSX Corporation of Richmond, and Maersk, owned by the Danish
conglomerate A.P. Moller, could prompt other defections, New Jersey
Gov. Christie Whitman and her representatives at the Port Authority
have been more willing to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fierce competition in the industry, Sea-Land has said
it cannot afford the rent proposed by the Port Authority, which
would jump immediately from about $19,000 an acre annually to
$36,000 and rise to $106,000 over the life of a 29-year agreement.
Governor Whitman is now assembling a package of tax breaks and
other incentives to sweeten the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gargano has taken a harder line with the companies, which his
supporters say are unlikely to relocate because much of their cargo
is destined for the New York metropolitan region. According to one
Port Authority official, the rent proposal rejected by Sea-Land and
Maersk already had a hefty subsidy built into it, because the Port
Authority would be spending $456 million more on dredging and
bulkhead improvements than it would get back in rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those companies are bluffing,'' the official said. ``This is
supposed to be a negotiation. But New Jersey has practically
written them a blank check.''
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority officials say that Hanjin, the giant Korean
shipper, has signed an agreement with the authority to build its
own terminal in Elizabeth and at a higher rent than is now being
proposed for Sea-Land.
</P>
<P>
   David Shuman, a transportation consultant with R.L. Banks &AMP;
Associates who has worked with Baltimore, shares some of Gargano's
skepticism about the companies' true intentions, particularly after
Vice President Al Gore announced in January that the federal
government would provide 75 percent of the costs of a five-year,
$733 million dredging project in New York Harbor. The announcement
addressed the most important demand by Maersk, which is building a
fleet of deep-hulled ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's announcement was devastating news for us,'' Shuman
said. ``Our sense was that it's New York's to lose and the other
ports were being strung along.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tommy Tomsen, president of Maersk, insisted that his company
was not using Baltimore as a bargaining ploy. ``We're not
bluffing,'' he said. ``Baltimore has developed a real alternative.
This decision could go either way.''
</P>
<P>
   James White, executive director of the Maryland Port
Administration, acknowledged that every port on the Eastern
Seaboard that competed for Sea-Land and Maersk ``wondered whether
they were serious.'' But, he said, their proposal to build a
335-acre facility at the Dundalk Marine Terminal has won the
attention of the company's executives.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   New York's stand has alarmed some politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to New York Gov. George Pataki, Assemblywoman
Elizabeth Connelly of Staten Island complained that New York's
``take it or leave it'' approach with the carriers was threatening
jobs at the Howland Hook container port on Staten Island, as well
as in Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority, said he was
concerned about the loss of jobs. ``We're making every effort
possible to accommodate Sea-Land and Maersk,'' he said. ``But there
are limits.''
</P>
<P>
   James Devine, general manager for Sea-Land in Elizabeth, said
the Port Authority was unfairly seeking to recover the cost of
dredging the harbor from the carriers. Instead, he said, those
costs should be borne by both states. ``They're coming at us for
the historic pollution and siltation of the New York harbor,'' he
said. ``That's what's driving the costs to untenable levels.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the negotiations did not get off to an
auspicious start in the spring of 1997 with an incident that was
either a misunderstanding or a signal that both sides should be
ready to play hardball. During an outing at the Fiddler's Elbow
golf course in New Jersey, a Sea-Land executive, Nick Taro,
welcomed the new executive director of the Port Authority, Robert
Boyle, saying the two men would be seeing a lot of each other at
the upcoming lease negotiations. According to shipping industry
executives, Boyle responded: ``There won't be any negotiations.
We'll give you a price and you'll sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority executives do not dispute the remarks, but they
now say that Boyle thought Taro was referring to another, unrelated
maritime issue.
</P>
<P>
   After months of fruitless talks, Sea-Land and Maersk issued an
invitation to other East Coast ports to bid for their business.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Maersk highlighted the need for dredging in New York
Harbor by bringing into Elizabeth the Regina Maersk, the largest
ship ever to steam into the harbor. Maersk explained that much of
the massive ship's cargo had to be unloaded in Halifax before it
could navigate the relatively shallow channels in New York. The
message was clear: if New York and New Jersey wanted the carriers
to stay put it had better find the money to dredge the harbor for a
new generation of super ships.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the lease has become a bargaining chip between
New York and New Jersey. If New Jersey wants help for the maritime
industry, New York wants additional funds for new airline terminals
at Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to satisfy New Jersey,'' said a senior New York
official, ``then we need something, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Verplanck, president of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce,
took a dim view of the disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' she said, ``is that while they're duking it
out on minor issues, we may see a major shipping industry literally
go south.''

EX-CONGRESSWOMAN WILL BECOME SOCIAL SECURITY COUNSEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (bl) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Barbara Kennelly, the newly retired U.S.
congresswoman, found running for governor last fall a grim chore
but always beamed when congressional votes took her back to her
beloved Washington. Tuesday, she starts a new job there promoting
the passage of President Clinton's plan to insure the solvency of
Social Security, and the glow is back.
</P>
<P>
   Chatting this week in her home here just four blocks from the
governor's mansion, which nevertheless remained far out of reach as
she struggled to evict Gov. John G. Rowland, Mrs. Kennelly, a
Democrat, said the offer from the White House came as a surprise,
but the position seems suited to her fervor for legislation and her
16 years of friendships on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Already, she is talking about her new job in the argot of
legislative ``sausage-making'' and invoking the longtime former
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, where for eight
years she was the only woman. ``That's what it's all about _ to get
enough votes,'' she said. ``I learned it under Danny Rostenkowski:
it doesn't matter how good your legislation is if you can't get it
out of committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly had been courted by several corporate boards, and
was offered a teaching position at one of her alma maters, Trinity
College in Hartford. ``It would have been a nice life, but I'm not
ready for that yet,'' she said. ``You just can't go as fast as I
was going and work as hard as I worked, and then drop it. So now
I've got to go back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Her landslide defeat in November seemed an unfitting final
career entry for Mrs. Kennelly, who has spent most of her 62 years
feasting on politics, first as the daughter of John Bailey, who was
chairman of both the Connecticut and national Democratic parties,
and later as the wife of James Kennelly, who was speaker of the
Connecticut House of Representatives. Then she took up the family
business, as a Hartford councilwoman and later as secretary of
state. It all ended so fast.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of a recent phone conversation, when asked whether
she was on another line, she replied bluntly, ``I only have one
line these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, her title will be counselor at the Social Security
Administration, and she will make $125,900, a bit less than a
member of Congress but more than the governor. She has taken the
job for a year and thinks it should be clear by then whether the
president's plan will pass. ``If things are moving still, of course
I'll stay for a second year,'' she said. ``But if it's not going to
happen, why?''
</P>
<P>
   Word of Mrs. Kennelly's awkward campaign style, which was
typified by the afternoon when a rally about health care flopped
and she kept telling puzzled reporters it was ``a honey of a day,''
were a mystery to people who knew her in Washington, where she was
a respected and skilled back-room operator. ``The last couple of
months were rough, just keeping going,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after the election, Mrs. Kennelly has achieved such
a clinical distance from her 28-point loss to Rowland that she is
almost eager to offer an armchair autopsy, and said she would do
the same in private sessions with Democrats who are thinking of
running statewide. ``I'll be happy to tell them about all the
mistakes I made,'' she said cheerily.
</P>
<P>
   The main lesson, she said, is that people get most of their
political information from television commercials and polls. ``If
you don't have the money lined up, don't bother,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly had never had a tough congressional race, and
admits she was utterly unprepared to challenge a popular incumbent.
She said she had thought that if she were willing to run, the
Connecticut Democratic Party would rush to help her. Instead, she
said, she found herself struggling alone to hire staff members and
raise money. ``The naivete, really, is stunning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the election, she retreated to a childhood friend's island
home off Vero Beach, Fla. She played golf every day, then returned
to Hartford, her lifelong home, to close her campaign office. She
had finished shuttering her Capitol Hill office by the time she was
called back for the Dec. 18 debate and the Dec. 19 vote on
impeaching the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was good for me,'' she said. ``It let me go back, and I
saw everybody, so it's over. You say your good-byes _ closure,
really.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly was still the vice chairwoman of the House
Democratic Caucus and helped run the impeachment strategy meetings,
but she was one of the few Democrats who did not go to the White
House after the House voted to impeach Clinton. ``They acted like
it was over,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was her final vote. She thought she was gone for good. She
said she was honored when the University of Connecticut, in Storrs,
asked to house her papers, and she shipped 82 boxes. A freight
service filled the basement of her home here with the photographs,
awards and statuettes from her suite in the Cannon House Office
Building. On Wednesday, her desk arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Heading back to Washington, one of her first chores will be
house hunting: she passed along her longtime apartment to her 1st
District successor, Rep. John Larson. ``I'll be all right,'' she
said. ``I've got friends.''

SUBURBS TAKE PRECAUTIONS AGAINST 2000 COMPUTER FLAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLEY STREAM, N.Y. _ In the millisecond that 1999 turns into
2000, the heat in the village hall will stay on and the lawn
sprinkler system will stay off.
</P>
<P>
   Both are governed by newly installed computerized timers, and
will not be affected by the so-called millennium bug, said Vincent
Ang, the clerk of this Long Island village. Officials also replaced
the village's 15-year-old mainframe computer. Total cost of
compliance: $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Across Long Island, municipalities and businesses are checking
their computers for date-related problems. Nassau County government
alone is expected to spend millions to make sure welfare checks go
out and traffic lights keep working.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how fearful some people are about the approach of
the new millennium,'' Ang said of the Year 2000 problem. ``But
every night on the news we get bombarded with some possible new
tragedy, like the crash of the stock market. It's like the world's
going to come to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But whatever happens, at least I know we're ready,'' he said
about his village of 30,000. ``We've got our new computer system up
and running, and we've installed some new gears in our official
clocks for stamping village records. The gears weren't anything
high tech, but it was still a part of becoming Y2K compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the shorthand for making sure computers will work
properly next year. To save space and memory, many older computers
and programs were designed to specify dates using only the last two
digits of a year. That could cause them to confuse 2000 with 1900.
</P>
<P>
   ``This oversight may even force a computer system to shut down
entirely,'' said Murray Schwartz, a lawyer with Meyer, Suozzi,
English &AMP; Klein who addressed the legal and insurance issues raised
by the problem at a recent seminar in Melville.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possible ramifications have been linked to everything from
commercial Armageddon to the muffled bang of a wet firecracker,''
he told the group. ``And while the answer may lie somewhere in
between, its scope and effect may depend importantly upon measures
taken over the next 11 months.''
</P>
<P>
   While the federal government has so far spent more than $50
billion upgrading its computers, Nassau County government has spent
about $40 million, said County Legislator John Canning, who is
chairman of the Committee on government Service and Operations.
</P>
<P>
   Canning said the county began planning for the changeover in
1994, but still had much to do, especially in the Department of
Social Services, with its many cases involving welfare, Medicaid,
and child support payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're already tracking payments into the next century,'' he
said. ``But since they are not yet entirely Y2K compliant, they've
gone back to pen and paper.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also some lingering concern about the county's 680
computer-operated traffic lights. ``They're running tests on them
now,'' Canning said. ``All we need is countywide gridlock on the
first day of the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Nassau and Suffolk County report that their emergency 911
telephone systems are ready. However, Detective Lt. Kevin Caslin,
spokesman for the Nassau County Police Department, said that 300 of
the department's 600 personal computers were still under review.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're already at least five years old, long past the three
to four years they were expected to last, so we're hoping for new
replacements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses, some with only one personal computer and very
limited budgets, are also taking precautions. Paul Forchelli, a
partner in a Goodyear tire and auto service shop in Oyster Bay,
said that even though Goodyear had provided him with a computer
that keeps track of his customers and inventory, he will not be
taking any chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come December, I'm making printouts of everything,'' he said.
``For years, I used to put everything down on cards and file them
away by hand. I may go back to the old system for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the precautions being taken, Forchelli, Canning,
Schwartz and Ang all said they planned to spend New Year's Eve at
home with close friends when 2000 arrives. They do not plan to
travel, especially in planes or elevators.
</P>
<P>
   But they attach no cosmic significance to the change in the date
and do not fear a physical end to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it,'' said Ang, ``it's pretty presumptive
of us to think that just because we put a time and date on
something, we've got it right.''

IN A RELIGIOUS MODEL, SEEDS FOR A CHARTER SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Rev. Floyd Flake walks into Allen Christian
School, which he founded 17 years ago, the reception he gets is not
exactly divine, but it is a bit better than that accorded most mere
mortals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, Reverend Flake,'' a class of first graders
eagerly chants, jumping from their seats, instantly recognizing the
tall man with the mustache whose formal portrait hangs next to his
wife's in the school lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning,'' Flake replies, pausing midstride just long
enough to ask, ``Did you do your homework?''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Christian School, a stone's throw from Kennedy
International Airport, is the model for the charter school that
Flake, the former congressman from Queens, wants to create in the
same corner of southeast Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Flake, the senior pastor of the Allen African Methodist
Episcopal Church, is the best known of a handful of inner-city
ministers in New York City who hope to get charters from the state
under the law approved in December, and to create a new model for
secular public education inspired by the values of the neighborhood
church.
</P>
<P>
   The Allen school is unapologetically Methodist, with children
participating in daily sessions of ``praise and worship.'' But
those who believe that his larger agenda is religious, Flake said,
misunderstand his leadership and the role of many black churches in
New York City and across America. The role, he said, is building
community, saving lives and giving children hope for the future as
much as any religious creed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to diminish me,'' Flake said. ``Why reduce me to
just a preacher?''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of a charter school is that it is public, financed by
the taxpayers, yet independent of the Board of Education, Flake
said. So it would bridge the gap between those who can pay the
$3,500-a-year tuition charged by Allen Christian School and those
who cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ministers are not the only ones who want to start
charter schools. Wall Street businessmen, teachers, parents and
civic groups have also expressed an interest, and so has New York
City Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew. Of Flake, Crew said last week,
``I will meet him in the marketplace of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping into the Allen school is like stepping into a quaint
photograph from the 1950s. Every classroom features a long list of
homework scribbled in white chalk on a green board. Teachers sit
behind wooden desks at the head of the class, and most students
have been neatly arranged in rows rather than in the small groups
common in many schools today. Posters of historic figures, looking
stiff and distant _ Rosa Parks, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr., George Washington, George Washington Carver, John F. Kennedy,
President Clinton _ have been tacked to the walls of hallways and
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell who is rich and who is poor at Allen
Christian School. The 480 boys and girls, from prekindergarten to
eighth grade, have surrendered fashion to uniforms: yellow shirts,
blue slacks, ties or neckerchiefs and plaid jumpers. And race is
irrelevant; there are no white students, although Flake said there
are some of mixed race. There are no white teachers or
administrators either, although there is a Filipino, a Cambodian
and a Honduran on the teaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Some charter schools _ notably in North Carolina _ have been
accused of resegregating the schools. Flake scoffs at the notion
that any school he started would resegregate New York City's
schools. ``You cannot be more segregated than the public school
system,'' he said dryly. In the New York City school system, just
16 percent of students over all, and 2.4 percent in his corner of
Queens, are white.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rationale for fighting a fight about something you
can't change,'' Flake said. ``The best integration, quite frankly,
is a good quality education.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The school has a computer lab, connected to the Internet. In
third grade, all children begin studying Spanish. They learn to
play the recorder. There are two music teachers, a performance band
and a jazz ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of lowering expectations out of fear that some children
will not be able to meet them, the school keeps up a steady
drumbeat of pressure and encouragement _ letters home to parents
and tutoring after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Mrs. R.,'' one letter from a teacher to a parent begins.
``Jordan needs to come to school with his pencils sharpened. He
spent 20 minutes this morning sharpening them. He did not do his
journal work, and he was late copying his homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Corey Harewood, a 13-year-old eighth grader, goes to a teacher's
house with four other students after school to be tutored in math
so he can keep up his 85 average. ``She feeds us,'' he adds
enthusiastically, talking about milk and cookies, not math
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get free Spanish tutoring,'' pipes up his friend Raymond
McGill.
</P>
<P>
   These are teachers, Flake said, who earn $17,500 to $28,000 a
year. The public financing for charter schools, he said, would
allow him to compete with the $45,000 average of public school
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In the second grade, 7-year-old Darnique ticks off a few pithy
observations about learning at Allen Christian: ``If we talk, we
get a lot of homework. We learn to carry the one. We get hard
words. If we get bad grades, we have to do it all over.''
</P>
<P>
   A big blue banner in the lobby blares, ``In the Pursuit of
Excellence.'' But slogans are common in public schools, too. Almost
unheard-of are the lists, posted behind glass, of students who have
met the challenge, scoring high enough on tests to make the
principal's list, the honor roll or the merit roll, in descending
order.
</P>
<P>
   The school, Flake said, has not tried to reinvent its curriculum
or to substitute Bible studies for reading, writing and arithmetic.
Rather, it uses the state curriculum that many public schools
simply ignore, he said. In the fifth grade, children are reading
``The Prince and the Pauper,'' in the sixth grade, ``Animal Farm.''
One day last month, the third grade took a weekly spelling test,
while Faith Mack's second-grade students reviewed what they had
learned about Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it mean, `overthrow'?'' asked Ms. Mack, a tall,
thin, stern teacher with a smile she tries to suppress, passing out
oversize dictionaries to three of the children. ``Why did Mandela
feel that there was such unfairness?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to have a passbook to travel to where you want to
get,'' said Kenneth, a solid, serious-faced boy.
</P>
<P>
   Free-associating, Andrena, the clear beads in her ponytail
rattling, wondered, ``Why didn't Martin Luther King become
president?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to his life?'' Ms. Mack replied tactfully. ``He
had a short life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be president,'' Andrena insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Test scores tell a provocative story. When they are very young,
the children at Allen score the same on average as those in the
surrounding public schools: about 76 percent of third graders score
at minimum competency on the state reading test. But by sixth
grade, a gap has opened, with 89 to 95 percent of Allen students
scoring at minimum competency over the last four years, compared
with 65 to 79 percent of students in the nearby public schools in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't spend eight hours a day proselytizing,'' Flake said.
``We teach everything the public schools are teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Allen Christian School does offer its share of religion.
Most of the students do not belong to his church, Flake said, but
they all join in ``praise and worship'' when the bell rings every
day at 8:40 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   One Tuesday last month, Ms. Mack picked three children to lead
the session. Taking their places on a well-worn burgundy rug, they
stood facing the rest of the class of 17. Darnique thrust a black
Bible high into the air with all the strength in her spindly arms
and led the class in the first of several pledges, this one to the
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pledge allegiance to the Bible, God's holy word,'' the
children began.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the familiar pledge to the United States flag, hanging
over Darnique's right shoulder. Then the pledge to the Christian
flag, hanging over her left shoulder: ``I pledge allegiance to the
Christian flag, and to the Saviour for whose kingdom it stands. One
Saviour, crucified, risen and coming again, with life and liberty
to all who believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they recited the pledge to their school, beginning, ``I
am a unique and gifted individual, made in the image of God,'' and
ending, ``I will let nothing keep me from my destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The pledges over, the children clapped, danced and sang a medley
of songs, from ``Lift Every Voice'' to ``Kumbaya.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a session lively enough to shake the morning cobwebs out
of any second grader's eyes, and if transferred to a public school,
to alarm more than a few civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
   Flake said that, if allowed to start a charter school, he could
relegate religion to before or after school and meet the
constitutional requirements of separating church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Founding a public school, said Flake, who just turned 54, is the
logical next step in a 23-year career as a minister, whose church
has grown to 10,000 people from 1,400, and as a congressman. Before
resigning from Congress in 1997, he brought millions of dollars in
state and federal money into his district, developing, owning,
managing or controlling 26 blocks of housing, health services, a
charter bus company and strip malls.
</P>
<P>
   Just as his church has taken over underperforming retail strips,
chasing out the drug dealers, so he wants to reinvent failing
public schools in the image of Allen Christian.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a hustle,'' Flake said. ``School is part of what
we do.''

   WASHINGTON _ rights all stalled.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Democrats may be more inclined to stall than pass a
lot of bills. The party needs to pick up seven seats in the House
to regain the majority it lost in 1994. With the polls now in their
favor, they may not want to give GOP leaders much to crow about
heading into the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to fight the interests of the minority in
not wanting us to get anything done,'' Blunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democrats will be tempted to pass bills if Republicans
meet them more than halfway, said Thomas Mann, a congressional
scholar with the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, he said, will be pulled between their agenda and
the need to improve their image by showing that they can work with
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a complex set of motivations out there,'' Mann said,
``and what emerges from that is anybody's guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The clock is ticking. With the 2000 presidential race already
heating up, most experts suggest that Congress will soon be tied up
in political maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a window until July or August,'' said freshman Rep.
Dennis Moore of Kansas, a Democrat. ``After that, it's finished.''

H&AMP;R BLOCK TO BUY NEW ENGLAND MORTGAGE BANKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ H&AMP;R Block Inc. said Friday it is buying
Assurance Mortgage Corp. of America, New England's largest
independent mortgage banker, for $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, which is expected to be completed before
Block's fiscal year ends April 30, will increase Block's nationwide
mortgage lending strength by about one-third and significantly
expand the company's ability to make conventional and
government-backed mortgage loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any given time, more than a million of Block's 15 million
customers are looking for a mortgage, and our goal is to be able to
respond to that need,'' said Frank L. Salizzoni, Block's president
and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based Assurance Mortgage, which last year closed $1.3
billion in mortgages nationwide, is the second mortgage lender
acquired by Block, of Kansas City. The other lender, Option One
Mortgage Corp., of Santa Ana, Calif., originates about $1.9 billion
in loans annually. Block bought Option One in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Option One specializes in non-conforming mortgages, which is
what the lending industry calls loans to borrowers whose credit
histories or financial circumstances prevent them from qualifying
for traditional mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Assurance Mortgage deals primarily in
conventional loans, which are traditional mortgages that Fannie
Mae, Freddie Mac and other institutional investors repackage as
mortgage-backed securities for sale on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   These conventional mortgages also are sometimes called
conforming loans because they meet Federal Housing Administration
or Veterans Administration standards for federally backed insurance
against defaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providing conventional and government mortgages is one more
piece of the financial program we are building at Block to become a
financial partner to our customers,'' Salizzoni said.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 60 percent of the potential borrowers who might turn
to Block for mortgages would qualify for conventional loans, which
generally feature lower interest rates and monthly payments than
unconventional loans, estimated Herbert Buchbinder, a senior vice
president and analyst at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The company must use brokers to make those conventional loans
now, but won't need to after the transaction is completed,
Buchbinder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good strategic accretive acquisition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Block's bid to become a financial services partner for clients
has led Block during the past several months to buy a financial
planning firm as part of a drive to eventually offer those
services, along with mortgages, at its approximately 9,000 U.S. tax
services offices.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the company also began buying regionally dominant
traditional accounting and consulting firms around the U.S. to
expand into that financial services realm.

LAWMAKERS TO STRIVE TO PUT ASIDE HARD FEELINGS, CONFRONT ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite the inevitable bitterness and bad blood
left over from the impeachment battle, members of Congress now are
pledging to get down to the business of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Expect some cooperation and an initial burst of legislative
activity, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am optimistic,'' said Republican Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri,
the House's chief deputy whip. ``I think the desire to move on with
a post-impeachment agenda is going to be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the issues that will loom large and how they
might fare in the upcoming year:
</P>
<P>
   - Social Security: This may be too huge and complex to solve in
a year, but headway could be made before 2000 elections interfere.
</P>
<P>
   - Taxes: Conservative Republicans earlier called for a sweeping
10 percent cut in income taxes. President Clinton and Democrats
want smaller changes, such as focused tax credits or tightened
business loopholes. Moderate Republicans and Democrats may hold the
key, asking for elimination of the code's built-in marriage tax.
</P>
<P>
   - Medicare: This is the other entitlement program, one that
needs budgetary infusions or reform quickly.
</P>
<P>
   - Military preparedness: This is an easy winner for both sides.
The only questions are how much fresh cash, and for what? Missile
defense, pay raises and improved benefits for the troops,
recruitment incentives and new jet fighters, for starters.
</P>
<P>
   - Education: This was a big number in Clinton's State of the
Union laundry list. Republicans may be ready to approve school
improvements, but will work to eliminate big government
interference.
</P>
<P>
   - Managed health care: Democrats thought they had a hot issue in
a ``patient's bill of rights'' measure last year. Look for them to
try again, while the GOP will work to limit government oversight.
</P>
<P>
   But one might ask, how can they work together after all the
impeachment bitterness?
</P>
<P>
   Behind the upbeat talk are two overarching political factors.
Republicans, who continue to fight deteriorating poll numbers, will
want to prove that they can do more than obsess over the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meantime, will want to upgrade a badly tarnished
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be and this must be a time of reconciliation and
renewal for America,'' he said Friday after his acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas said the impeachment
ordeal had ``really intensified the willingness of both sides to
work together.''
</P>
<P>
   That hopeful outlook isn't shared by all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans want to retain Congress, and Democrats want to
take it away in 2000,'' said Marshall Wittmann, director of
congressional relations with the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it in movie terms, we'll have a short period of
Shakespearean love followed by the thin red line.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Republican lawmakers in particular have begun
churning out press releases on topics ranging from Social Security
to taxes to Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   The president himself has stimulated much of the
anything-but-impeachment talk, showing interest in a range of
poll-tested issues, including Social Security, one of thorniest
topics around.
</P>
<P>
   His Jan. 19 State of the Union message may have launched the
issues parade. Criticized by some Republicans for discussing 77
issues in 77 minutes, the president announced initiatives on health
care, education, crime, trade, the environment and campaign-finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very good chance that Congress will have a very
productive next year or 18 months,'' said former Democratic Rep.
Jim Slattery of Kansas, now a Washington lobbyist. ``I think he'll
be bending over backward to find a bipartisan coalition in the
Congress that he can work with.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked on NBC whether he could work with Clinton, House Speaker
Dennis Hastert responded: ``Absolutely. He's the president of the
United States. And, you know, the Congress, if they want to get
anything done, has to work with the president.''
</P>
<P>
   But others expect Clinton to struggle. Complicating the picture
is Clinton's reported vow to seek revenge on GOP House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Jack Danforth, a Missouri Republican, said the
scandal had forever undermined Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that for the next two years we will have a weak
president,'' Danforth said. ``Weak presidents don't accomplish
much.''
</P>
<P>
   But aiding Congress will be one of the cardinal rules of Capitol
Hill: Holding a grudge is a big mistake. A lawmaker who is an enemy
on one issue could become a badly needed ally on another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Congress has an ability to compartmentalize second only to
the president,'' said former Democratic Rep. Alan Wheat of
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Will that translate into major accomplishments?
</P>
<P>
   Although Social Security grabbed the most headlines after the
president's State of the Union speech, lawmakers acknowledge that
reaching a consensus on such a divisive issue is tricky. The
president's call to invest part of Social Security funds in the
stock market was met with GOP criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a program of such magnitude and personal importance that
just working through the differences takes more than can be done in
one short session of Congress,'' said Wheat, now a Washington
government relations consultant.
</P>
<P>
   With big budget surpluses coming, Republicans are insisting on a
large tax cut. Democrats, though, bridle at that notion. They
suggest that tax-cut money won't be there once Social Security,
Medicare and other issues are addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Other divisive topics: A patient's bill of rights, an increase
in the minimum wage, the size of the defense budget and an increase
in the deduction for health insurance for the self-employed.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, traditional differences between the parties might
prove to be as big a roadblock as any bad blood over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, those differences led to gridlock. A series of
high-profile bills on taxes, campaign finance and patients' rights
all stalled. MORE

COURT TO DECIDE ADOPTION DISPUTE INVOLVING MIXED-RACE CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Just weeks after Maya's birth, her mother
decided that the mixed-race infant should be adopted by a white
professional couple in Columbia, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Maya, now 3, calls the couple Mom and Dad. But whether she stays
with them is a matter for the courts to decide.
</P>
<P>
   The little girl's African-American aunt in Maryland won custody
rights in October, a decision by a Jackson County judge in Kansas
City. Last week the Columbia couple asked a state appeals court in
Kansas City to allow them to keep the girl.
</P>
<P>
   The case has implications beyond a custody dispute. The fight
for Maya's future raises questions about whether birth parents can
choose adoptive parents, what rights relatives have, and what role
race plays.
</P>
<P>
   Maya's case stands apart from other disputes involving white
adoptive parents and black family members. Those almost always
involve adoptions through state agencies and courts, which choose
the adoptive parents. But Maya's adoption was arranged through a
private agency, and her mother chose the adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is very unusual _ it embodies questions we're
struggling with across the board,'' said Madelyn Freundlich,
director of the Evan Donaldson Adoption Institute in New York, an
adoption advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost unheard of for a judge to allow a relative to adopt
a child after the biological parents have selected someone else,
Freundlich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It raises questions about the finality of adoption,'' she
said. ``It raises questions about whether any decision holds at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Maya, she remains with the Columbia couple as they await
the legal outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Maya's biological mother is white and her father black. She went
to live with the Columbia couple when she was 8 weeks old.
</P>
<P>
   Facts about her adoption dispute came to light Wednesday in
arguments before the appeals court in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel reported that Bill Clark and Marta Nolin
are psychologists for the state and have been married for more than
a decade. They also have an adopted 6-year-old boy who is
African-American and American Indian, and Maya is closely attached
to him. Clark and Nolin strive to make the children aware of their
racial and ethnic heritage.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of dispute is Denise Adams-Hill, a single,
divorced attorney from Potomac, Md. She is the sister of Maya's
biological father and has been estranged from her brother for
years.
</P>
<P>
   She filed for adoption on July 30, 1997, and Jackson County
Family Court Commissioner John F. Payne agreed. Later, a Family
Court judge approved the decision.
</P>
<P>
   At the appeals court hearing this week, Adams-Hill's attorney,
Gerald McGonagle, read his client's plea: ``I am her family, and I
understand what she will be faced with when she is growing up. I
understand who this child is.''
</P>
<P>
   McGonagle read a statement by Clark in which Clark said he and
his wife would raise Maya like she was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals judge asked McGonagle if race was the main issue.
</P>
<P>
   McGonagle replied, ``The issue is what is best for this child.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanford P. Krigel, attorney for the Columbia couple, said race
clearly was a big part of the case.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals judge asked if any Missouri law required judges to
approve private adoptions in which the mother chooses who will
adopt. Krigel said judges routinely side with the mother's decision
but could cite no law requiring judges to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Krigel also argued that it's wrong to ignore the three-year bond
Maya developed with Clark and Nolin. ``My clients are the only
parents Maya has ever known.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked the judges to allow his clients to adopt Maya, or
return the case for retrial before a different commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Krigel argued that Payne erred by not allowing the testimony of
Kris Probasco, a social worker expert on child attachment, and of
Rod Adams, Maya's father.
</P>
<P>
   Probasco, who also operates an Overland Park, Kan., private
adoption service, said in an interview that removing Maya now could
cause her lifelong problems with trust and relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, Maya's father, said in an interview that Maya belongs in
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and Nolin declined to comment after the hearing.
Adams-Hill did not return repeated telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Both Missouri and federal law forbid denying an adoption solely
on the basis of race. Yet race can be considered in deciding what
is best for a child, and experts differ on that point.
</P>
<P>
   At trial last year, each side in Maya's case called a national
expert on transracial adoption. Though neither testified, they
granted interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Rita J. Simon, of American University in Washington,
is a professor of law, justice and society who supports transracial
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's data says transracial adoption served the child's
best interest,'' she said. Children in such adoption cases grow up
healthy and well adjusted, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said numbers alone show why white parents are needed to
free black or biracial children from state foster care.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 percent of 100,000 children cleared for state
adoption in the United States are African-American, but
African-Americans make up only 12 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Ruth McRoy, of the University of Texas at Austin,
argues that transracial adoption can leave children with an
identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't place white children with black families, and there's
a reason for that,'' she said. ``To be raised by a biological
relative is a good alternative if at all possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Greater efforts in recent years have resulted in more
African-American children being placed in homes of the same race,
McRoy said.
</P>
<P>
   In Maya's case, the appeals court promises a quick decision.

VIETNAM WAR VETERAN MAKES PEACE WITH FORMER ADVERSARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In 1964, Roger H.C. Donlon, then a captain
with the Army's Special Forces, went to war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He led a 12-man Special Forces team assigned to advise several
hundred South Vietnamese troops at a remote base camp near the
village of Nam Dong.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 2 a.m. on July 6, a Viet Cong battalion reinforced
by North Vietnamese Army regulars attacked the outpost. It was the
first such combined assault on an American base.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments the camp's mess hall, command post and dispensary
were in flames. The incoming fire was constant, the mortar barrage
deafening.
</P>
<P>
   Hour after hour, the guerrillas emerged from the darkness to
charge the barbed-wire perimeter of the camp.
</P>
<P>
   As the camp exploded around him, Donlon, wounded in the stomach
and the shoulder, crawled from position to position, firing
constantly while encouraging and deploying his men.
</P>
<P>
   And then, he wrote later, ``a tremendous blast went off in my
face. I could hear myself screaming as I sailed through the
air....Strangely, I didn't want (my scream) to end. When it ended,
I was certain I'd be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   When he regained consciousness moments later, he was doubled
over in pain. Still, he dragged himself through the camp, carrying
ammunition, bandaging the wounded and directing fire at the
attacking troops.
</P>
<P>
   The battle ended when American reinforcements arrived at dawn.
Two members of Donlon's team were dead, along with an Australian
adviser, 55 South Vietnamese soldiers and 250 Viet Cong.
</P>
<P>
   In December, still recuperating from his wounds, Donlon went to
the White House to receive the Medal of Honor. He was the first
soldier fighting in Vietnam to win the award. His men won two
Distinguished Service Crosses (posthumously), four Silver Stars,
five Bronze Stars and nine Purple Hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, when the United States withdrew from the war,
Donlon was among those who mourned deeply and never expected to
return to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993 he did return, unarmed and on a very different
mission. He was, in fact, one of the first American veterans to
return. He was among a delegation sponsored by People to People
International, a cultural and education exchange program based in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways,'' Donlon said recently, ``my life has shifted
from being a warrior to seeking reconciliation with a former
adversary.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps without knowing it at the time, Donlon outlined the
later course of his life at a luncheon in the late 1980s. Asked
what he would do if he met the man who led the attack at Nam Dong,
Donlon responded:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I guess I would commend him for the courage his men
displayed and offer my sympathies for those he lost. And then I
would shift the conversation to the future and ask about his
current dreams and aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the Army in 1989 _ he's now 65 _ he settled
in Leavenworth, Kan., and joined the board of People to People
International. And members of that organization eventually
suggested that he could play a vital role on a path-breaking
journey to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a lot of soul-searching over that one,'' Donlon said
last week. ``And I finally decided it was something I wanted to do.
It was time to start a healing process.''
</P>
<P>
   In his recently published autobiography, Beyond Nam Dong, Donlon
described the anxiety he felt on the day he returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the plane began its descent into Hanoi,'' he wrote, ``the
hair on the back of my neck started to prickle...most of us felt we
would not be welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   But his fears ebbed as a coterie of Vietnamese officials warmly
greeted the delegation and presented Donlon's wife, Norma, with a
dozen roses.
</P>
<P>
   At a reception in Hanoi, Donlon spoke of his desire to visit a
rural cemetery where many of the South Vietnamese soldiers he once
led are buried.
</P>
<P>
   His hosts shook their heads. There is no such place, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But Donlon's tour guide, a former Viet Cong officer, said
privately that he would see what he could do.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, on a visit to Hue, Vietnam's old imperial
capital, the guide went to Donlon's hotel and said he would drive
him to the isolated graveyard near Nam Dong.
</P>
<P>
   They left early the next morning and drove for three hours
through the mountains. When they arrived at the abandoned cemetery,
Donlon walked across a grassy field picking wildflowers to lay on
the weed-choked graves of his men.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of villagers gathered around him, and he explained that
in America people sometimes joined hands when they prayed. He then
bowed his head and reached out, not knowing what would happen. In a
moment he felt a hand grip his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up,'' he wrote, ``and the entire group was linked
together. The seed of reconciliation had been planted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What a remarkable thing,'' said Bob Ulin, a retired Army
colonel and longtime friend of Donlon's. ``I have friends who say
they could never go back. But Roger did, because he believes that
the men we fought were soldiers like us, serving their country like
us. That's something many veterans have not come to grips with.''
</P>
<P>
   Ulin's perception is shared by other Vietnam veterans in this
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger Donlon has set an important example for us,'' said Henry
Laurent, a retired Special Forces sergeant who lives in Tonganoxie,
Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting older now, and time is running out for us to
make peace with what happened there.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Donlon went again to Vietnam. On that visit he met a
former officer who had helped plan the Nam Dong attack. Together
the two men returned to the old battle site.
</P>
<P>
   ``He even helped me tote in a big wreath,'' Donlon said. ``And
he arranged to have some of his men (former troops) clean up the
cemetery. MORE

MEDICARE NEEDS BALANCE TO SUCCEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: If Medicare benefits are ever extended to cover
prescription drugs, it will prove disastrous unless accompanied by
complementary reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever those reforms may be, they must abandon Medicare's
one-size-fits-all coverage. The escalating proliferation of
treatment alternatives demands that Medicare keep pace with medical
science. Therefore, the most basic reform of all must give
beneficiaries autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   As the system now exists, it tilts unfairly toward beneficiaries
needing surgery and care-intensive hospital stays. For those whose
ills are manageable with prescription palliatives, Medicare falls
woefully short.
</P>
<P>
   Given the medicinal and scientific discoveries that have led to
increasing supplies of miracle drugs, Medicare has become an
economically irrational arrangement. Although drugs might sometimes
be preferable options from both financial and medical standpoints,
the rational choice often dictates going with more heroic, risky
and expensive treatment because it is covered by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is to find a way to cover all reasonable treatment
regimens without accelerating the bankruptcy of a system already in
serious financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Any such solution demands limits. Medicare isn't exactly
open-ended as far as benefits are concerned, but neither is it
subject to traditional budget restraints. Medicare's budget is
whatever a year's worth of valid bills amount to. The stewards of
its finances try to keep income and outlays in balance, but if
claims exceed revenue, they must be honored if made in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   The necessity of limits is what makes autonomy imperative.
Autonomy gives senior citizens the opportunity to assess their own
situations and choose coverage plans fitting their particular
needs. We know this is possible because it's the cornerstone of
private insurance.
</P>
<P>
   How would the concepts of autonomy and limits complement each
other? That would be for the insurers to figure out. Government as
insurer hasn't done a very good job of creating disciplines that
restrain demand for a good for which the demand is theoretically
infinite.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, corporate insurers have been relatively
successful at balancing the interests of those who pay the
insurance bills, the insured and the care providers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration seems to want to cover prescriptions by
tapping the anticipated revenue surpluses of the next 15 years.
Under this plan, though, drug coverage would be just one more
expensive demand appended to an already overburdened system.
Meantime, the surpluses may prove illusory.
</P>
<P>
   A federal advisory commission, on the other hand, also wants
prescriptions covered but would reorganize Medicare to put the
insurance function into the hands of private companies. The
commission proposes a fixed annual payment from government that
Medicare enrollees could use to shop for their own coverage. This
approach marries the concepts of beneficiary autonomy and financial
limits, which are critical to Medicare's future salvation.
</P>
<P>
   This is not something many seniors will be comfortable with, but
any other approach risks a status quo that is unsatisfactory and
unfair to many and becoming more so all the time.

AT KENYON COLLEGE, THE DYNASTY THRIVES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Guam, Calif.)   (jw) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAMBIER, Ohio _ Jim Steen, the swimming coach here at Kenyon
College, faces the usual recruiting obstacles of remote private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you say, `Come to Gambier, pay $30,000 and let me beat
the bejesus out of you for four years and you'll be good'?'' he
mused before a recent practice. ``We say that all we're looking for
is someone smart, rich and talented, or smart, poor and talented,
or smart, middle class and idealistic and talented.''
</P>
<P>
   Steen has found them all in staggering abundance. If they did
not arrive accomplished, they likely were once they had been
coached by the 49-year-old Steen, the small-college composite of
John Wooden and Doc Counsilman.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon is tucked away on a one-mile wooded strip of Gothic
buildings about 40 miles north of Columbus. It is known for
nurturing the talents of the actor Paul Newman and the writer E.L.
Doctorow, but it also has earned a reputation as a swimming
dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Under Steen, the men's team has won 19 consecutive Division III
national championships and the women's team has won 15 in a row.
Both are records for all National Collegiate Athletic Association
competition. Not bad for a liberal arts haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like winning,'' Athletic Director Robert Bunnell said.
``We're not embarrassed by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon occasionally loses regular-season meets, some to Division
I teams. The men even failed to win the conference meet two years
ago. What sets the Kenyon teams apart from other teams is what they
do when the competition is at its keenest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that amazes me is how fast his kids swim at the end
of the year,'' said Matt Liddy, the head coach of Wright State, a
Division I school in Dayton, Ohio, that lost to Kenyon in a recent
meet.
</P>
<P>
   Steen treats the dual meet season as the preseason, saying his
swimmers have only so much psychic energy. They produce ordinary
times during most of the year and blossom in time for the
conference meet.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, he cajoles and commands in a dry soprano voice that
cuts through the splashing. In an interview, he is a swirl of
energy, rising and sitting, pacing and pointing.
</P>
<P>
   The swimmers said he was the consummate motivator, pushing
buttons and playing father-confessor. Katie Varda, a senior who is
a six-time NCAA event champion and one of 60 athletes under Steen,
was struggling with career concerns recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day he pulled me out of the water,'' she said, ``and asked
me, `What's going on?' I ended up totally bawling my eyes out.''
</P>
<P>
   Steen's daughter, Sarah, a sophomore distance freestyler who was
coached by her mother at the local high school, admitted that she
sometimes joins the complaints about her dad's methods.
</P>
<P>
   And Lloyd Baron, a sophomore freestyle sprinter, said: ``Every
once in a while there are situations where you kind of roll your
eyes and you go, `Oh, this again' or `This drill again.' But when
you get results at the end of the season, you think, `I guess he
was right.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the men and women won 11 of 20 events at the NCAA
meet, and the men broke four Division III records. The Lords'
200-yard freestyle relay recorded the seventh-fastest time in all
divisions. The school has an Olympian, Darrick Bollinger, a junior
from Guam, and the reigning Division III female swimmer of the
year, Marisha Stawiski, a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Through a phone network and word of mouth from swimming alumni,
the school is able to recruit good athletes who are great students.
</P>
<P>
   Even by those standards, though, Baron has unusual credentials.
A high school all-American, he is a chiseled 6 feet 6 inches and
200 pounds and has a condor-like wingspan.
</P>
<P>
   He said ignoring Division I scholarship offers was no sacrifice,
considering the improvement he would make under Steen.
</P>
<P>
   The coach validated his faith. By the end of last season, Baron
was swimming faster than all but four of the 14 sprinters who were
faster than he was in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon has been so dominant that Steen took a sabbatical in 1995
and '96 to evaluate his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to explain my success,'' he said. ``Is it luck or
what?''
</P>
<P>
   Visits to the Olympic training center and the University of
Southern California inspired a revelation of sorts. Steen witnessed
coaches with different styles simply coaxing the most out of their
athletes _ just as he had done.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches who visit Kenyon are often left scratching their heads.
The five-lane pool is no better than a parks-and-recreation
complex. The workload, though demanding, is not revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   But a look into the agenda of the full-time assistant coach,
Arthur Albiero, reveals a program that thrives on details. Albiero,
with clicker in hand, counts the strokes of each swimmer during
races and logs all the results into a computer so he and Steen can
figure out the best balance between a swimmer's stroke length and
frequency. Coaches also record every training session from the day
a swimmer arrives on campus.
</P>
<P>
   If a swimmer is showing excessive fatigue, coaches sometimes
draw a blood sample to measure lactic acid buildup. Steen also
invented a pulley contraption called a Power Rack that builds
stroke-specific muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon, which has a $100 million endowment, has a bargain in
Steen. The swim team's operating budget is $34,658, according to
school records. Many swimmers pay their way at an annual
semester-break training session in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Although by its very nature the winning streaks have created
pressure, Baron said he would not be devastated if Kenyon did not
win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Steen even said one of his goals was to have a team lose the
national championship and bounce back to win it again the following
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a team than can swim better than us,'' Stawiski
said, ``I give them all the credit in the world.''

 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The police sketches of wanted suspects frequently
bear a striking resemblance to someone with two eyes, two ears, a
nose and a mouth. Sometimes they look like just about everybody.
</P>
<P>
   The four police officers from New York City's elite Street Crime
Unit who fired the barrage of 41 shots that killed an unarmed West
African immigrant earlier this month were carrying such a sketch, a
rendering of rapist who had been terrorizing a Bronx neighborhood
and for whom they were searching.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old victim, Amadou Diallo, was shot in the doorway
of his apartment in the Soundview section of the Bronx at 12:45
a.m. on Feb. 4. A lawyer for the officers said they mistakenly
thought Diallo had a gun. He did not have a gun; nor did he have a
criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the controversy that swirled around the shooting
concerned the aggressive tactics of the police unit _ which prowls
the darkened city streets in unmarked cars and rough clothes,
hoping to pounce on criminals _ the incident also raised questions
about just how useful police sketches really are.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, sketches are often made with sophisticated computer
software that gives options for various facial features, and some
have proved to be enormously helpful in identifying suspects. But
the sketches or computer-generated photographs are still only as
good as a victim's recollection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty with a sketch is that it's based on eyewitness
information which can be fallible and imprecise,'' said James Alan
Fox, dean of Northeastern University's College of Criminal Justice.
``Because it's based on eyewitness recall, it's subject to error.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims are usually ``fearful and stressed,'' Fox added, which
can affect the descriptions they give to police sketch artists.
``It is a rendering of what people remember, and these
recollections are often flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Geberth, a retired New York city homicide detective who
is the author of the definitive textbook in the field, ``Practical
Homicide Investigation'' (CRC Press, 1996), was similarly cautious
about the use of the composite sketches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to go out there with some of the sketches I've seen,
I'd be laughing,'' he said, recalling his own investigative
experience in the Bronx. ``Some of them look like not everybody,
but nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   And when they look like almost everybody, there is a danger that
police officers can go after the wrong person, as apparently
happened in the case of Diallo. That problem can be compounded by
differences in race between suspects, victims and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran detectives said the best use of the sketches was not in
trying to match someone on the street with a drawing, but in
showing it while canvassing a neighborhood for leads.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that someone acquainted with the suspect will
recognize some feature of the drawing _ a distinctive jaw line,
perhaps, or a mustache _ and provide some detail _ a name, a
regular hangout _ that could enable detectives to take their
investigation further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tool, like anything else,'' said Geberth, who also
stressed the difficulty with eyewitness accounts, pointing out that
forensic evidence was much more important in tying a suspect to a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that while the sketches could be a useful tool, ``they
can be counterproductive if people feel it's more reliable than it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They might fit lots of people who are innocent,'' he added.
``Or they may be wrong, and the real perpetrator might not look
like that at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use a composite sketch to go around a neighborhood
where someone may have operated or committed a crime and see if
some one recognizes him. It can provide a lead. But it takes much
more than that, some form of corroboration to turn someone into a
suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the sketch the officers in the Bronx were carrying,
Inspector Michael Collins, a police spokesman, said: ``I don't know
that it looks like everybody. It might look like lots of people.''
</P>
<P>
   By the weekend, the suspected rapist whom the police were
seeking when they encountered Diallo 10 days ago had not been
caught.

   NEW YORK _ The police sketches of wanted suspects frequently
bear a striking resemblance to someone with two eyes, two ears, a
nose and a mouth. Sometimes they look like just about everybody.
</P>
<P>
   The four police officers from New York City's elite Street Crime
Unit who fired the barrage of 41 shots that killed an unarmed West
African immigrant earlier this month were carrying such a sketch, a
rendering of rapist who had been terrorizing a Bronx neighborhood
and for whom they were searching.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old victim, Amadou Diallo, was shot in the doorway
of his apartment in the Soundview section of the Bronx at 12:45
a.m. on Feb. 4. A lawyer for the officers said they mistakenly
thought Diallo had a gun. He did not have a gun; nor did he have a
criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the controversy that swirled around the shooting
concerned the aggressive tactics of the police unit _ which prowls
the darkened city streets in unmarked cars and rough clothes,
hoping to pounce on criminals _ the incident also raised questions
about just how useful police sketches really are.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, sketches are often made with sophisticated computer
software that gives options for various facial features, and some
have proved to be enormously helpful in identifying suspects. But
the sketches or computer-generated photographs are still only as
good as a victim's recollection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty with a sketch is that it's based on eyewitness
information which can be fallible and imprecise,'' said James Alan
Fox, dean of Northeastern University's College of Criminal Justice.
``Because it's based on eyewitness recall, it's subject to error.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims are usually ``fearful and stressed,'' Fox added, which
can affect the descriptions they give to police sketch artists.
``It is a rendering of what people remember, and these
recollections are often flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Geberth, a retired New York city homicide detective who
is the author of the definitive textbook in the field, ``Practical
Homicide Investigation'' (CRC Press, 1996), was similarly cautious
about the use of the composite sketches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to go out there with some of the sketches I've seen,
I'd be laughing,'' he said, recalling his own investigative
experience in the Bronx. ``Some of them look like not everybody,
but nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   And when they look like almost everybody, there is a danger that
police officers can go after the wrong person, as apparently
happened in the case of Diallo. That problem can be compounded by
differences in race between suspects, victims and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran detectives said the best use of the sketches was not in
trying to match someone on the street with a drawing, but in
showing it while canvassing a neighborhood for leads.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that someone acquainted with the suspect will
recognize some feature of the drawing _ a distinctive jaw line,
perhaps, or a mustache _ and provide some detail _ a name, a
regular hangout _ that could enable detectives to take their
investigation further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tool, like anything else,'' said Geberth, who also
stressed the difficulty with eyewitness accounts, pointing out that
forensic evidence was much more important in tying a suspect to a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that while the sketches could be a useful tool, ``they
can be counterproductive if people feel it's more reliable than it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They might fit lots of people who are innocent,'' he added.
``Or they may be wrong, and the real perpetrator might not look
like that at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use a composite sketch to go around a neighborhood
where someone may have operated or committed a crime and see if
some one recognizes him. It can provide a lead. But it takes much
more than that, some form of corroboration to turn someone into a
suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the sketch the officers in the Bronx were carrying,
Inspector Michael Collins, a police spokesman, said: ``I don't know
that it looks like everybody. It might look like lots of people.''
</P>
<P>
   By the weekend, the suspected rapist whom the police were
seeking when they encountered Diallo 10 days ago had not been
caught.

RODMAN WEIGHS LAKERS' OFFER

<TEXT>
<P>
   A deal for Dennis Rodman to join the Los Angeles Lakers was
still in place Saturday, but the 37-year-old forward had not
decided whether to accept, a sports executive with knowledge of the
Lakers' plans said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were offering Rodman, the National Basketball
Association's seven-time rebounding champion and the league's most
flamboyant player, the veterans' minimum salary of $1 million _
prorated to about $600,000 for the lockout-shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   John Black, the Lakers' director of public relations, told The
Associated Press on Saturday: ``We have not signed him. We have
nothing to report.''
</P>
<P>
   If Rodman joined the Lakers, it could set in motion other roster
changes over the next month. The Lakers are prepared to send two
starters, Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell, to Charlotte for Glen
Rice, J.R. Reid and B.J. Armstrong. Rice is expected to miss the
first 20 to 25 games of the season while he recovers from elbow
surgery.  &QL;

CONNECTICUT PUSHED TO THE LIMIT BY SETON HALL

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It was not supposed to be this much of a
skirmish for Connecticut. Not like this. The second-ranked team in
the country, Connecticut expected to cruise into Continental Arena
on Saturday, solve Seton Hall's slowdown tactics and continue to
dream the bigger dreams the Huskies have for March. But the Pirates
got in their way in a big way. Well, for 36 minutes they did.
</P>
<P>
   Playing without Shaheen Holloway, its starting point guard and
best player, Seton Hall made the Huskies sweat, helped force them
into their worst shooting performance of the season and almost
shocked Connecticut. The Huskies averted a major upset, but only
with a late rally that secured the 53-48 victory. Then Connecticut
exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   On a day the Huskies missed on all 14 shots they attempted from
3-point range and shot a brutal 33.3 percent, they displayed just
enough fortitude and veteran grit to beat an undermanned team. The
Huskies played poorly, and even missed six of their eight free
throws to keep the game tense in the final minute, but they did
survive.
</P>
<P>
   With all five of their starters scoring at least one basket, the
Huskies outscored the Pirates by 15-4 to finish the game and sneak
away with the victory. The Huskies (22-1 over all, 13-1 in the Big
East) could not wait to complete this game, a sloppy contest in
which Seton Hall (12-12, 6-9) stayed feisty and stayed in the game.
Kevin Freeman had 13 points to top the Huskies, while Richard
Hamilton added 12 and Khalid El-Amin, 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to defeat a team like Connecticut this late in the
season, a team like ours has to play a perfect basketball game,''
Seton Hall Coach Tommy Amaker said. ``I thought we came close, but
it wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Pirates, one of the plays they will
vividly remember involved Ty Shine, the freshman point guard who
was filling in for Holloway. With the score even at 44 and less
than four minutes left, Shine inexplicably tripped over his own
feet as he tried to bring the ball across halfcourt. Ricky Moore
scooped up the free ball, raced in for a layup and was fouled. He
completed the 3-point play to put the Huskies in front, 47-44. The
Pirates never regained the lead.
</P>
<P>
   That did not mean Seton Hall lacked opportunities. Rimas
Kaukenas (21 points) rimmed two 3-point shots, which would have
tied the score at 51, and Chuck Moore missed the front end of a
one-and-one seconds later to give Connecticut possession with the
51-48 edge. After Ricky Moore missed two free throws to give Seton
Hall another life, Shine's runner in the lane rolled out.
</P>
<P>
   The deliberate pace that Seton Hall enforced for a good portion
of the first half was successful at the outset of the second half.
The Huskies, who entered the game averaging 80.6 points, wanted to
run the ball and use the advantage they had in athleticism, but the
Pirates played aggressive defense and were methodical on offense.
The Huskies were so flustered, they missed their first 10 shots of
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   While Connecticut is assured of being in the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament and is fighting for one of the four
prestigious and critical No. 1 seedings, Seton Hall is trying to
stay on the post-season radar screen. The Pirates are a long shot
to reach the tournament and need to keep their record above .500 to
at least have a chance at qualifying for the National Invitation
Tournament. So while both teams had motivation Saturday, the
Pirates might have been more desperate.
</P>
<P>
   With less than 10 seconds left in the first half, El-Amin was
bottled up near the free-throw line by Chuck Moore. El-Amin finally
tossed up an off-balance jumper that touched the front of the rim,
hit the back and dropped through the basket as time expired to trim
Seton Hall's lead to 28-27. But El-Amin still banged his fist on
the press table because it had been a frustrating 20 minutes for
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin's last-second struggles epitomized the struggles the
Huskies endured after it looked as if they had buried the Pirates
early. With just over eight minutes left in the first half, Amaker
called a timeout after a 16-2 run by the Huskies gave them a
seemingly comfortable 22-12 lead.
</P>
<P>
   During the sluggish stretch, the Pirates went 12 straight
possessions in which they made seven turnovers, sank one of five
shots and scored a mere 2 points. If the Huskies had not been so
frigid from the field (0 for 8 from behind the 3-point arc and 13
for 34 over all in the half), they could probably have sent Seton
Hall's fans home early. Even with Hamilton starting for the second
straight game, Connecticut could not make shots consistently.
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut's failure to put Seton Hall away and,
presumably, Amaker's timely lecture helped the Pirates resuscitate
themselves and play like a different team. They weathered
Connecticut's trapping defense as both Chuck Moore (7 points) and
Kaukenas (5 points) nailed 3-pointers, and the Pirates unleashed a
14-1 run of their own to make the score 26-23. Surprisingly, the
Pirates led by 1 at the half and were alive until the last minute
of the game.

(lb) 
 By TIM GOLDEN with CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Clinton administration weighs its annual
evaluation of Mexico's cooperation in fighting illegal drugs, U.S.
officials admit privately that by most statistical measures, the
Mexican record looks especially bad this year.
</P>
<P>
   Drug seizures by the Mexican police have fallen significantly.
Nearly all of the most important Mexican narcotics traffickers
identified last year remain at large. The promised extraditions of
some Mexican drug suspects to the United States have not
materialized, and drug enforcement programs have been rocked by a
series of public conflicts between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as President Clinton embarks on a brief visit to Mexico
starting Sunday, his aides have neither despaired of such facts nor
spent much time analyzing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between cooperation and success,'' the
State Department spokesman, James Rubin, argued last week. While
their cooperation might not be having much effect on the problem,
he suggested, Mexican officials ``are cooperating more closely with
the United States at virtually every level than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   The fervor with which administration officials are praising
Mexico's record _ even before studying the assessments being
collected from various government agencies _ underscores how for
Mexico the yearly ``certification'' process has become more of a
joint public-relations campaign aimed at the Congress than an
objective appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about what Mexico has done,'' one administration
official said, speaking on the condition that he not be identified.
``This is about convincing the Hill that whatever Mexico has done
is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say their evaluation, which is expected
by the end of the month and mandated by a 1986 law for countries
where drugs are produced or transported, is particularly
counterproductive in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   To observe the law strictly and possibly impose the economic
penalties it contemplates, they argue, would be to place a
strategic and complex relationship at risk for just one of the many
interests that the United States has in Mexico. And Mexican
officials have done their best to underscore that risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to think what decertification would
provoke,'' Mexico's ambassador to the United States, Jesus Reyes
Heroles, said in an interview. ``The equilibrium that underlies our
relationship with the United States would be undone.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts of Mexican politics describe such warnings as
overblown. Moreover, aides to a half-dozen Washington legislators
who have played leading roles on the drug issue say Mexico's
decertification is unlikely anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The aides, speaking on the condition they not be identified,
said they expected a formal endorsement of Mexico's efforts from
the administration and then an energetic congressional effort to
override that endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   But they added that they see no clear sign that they will be any
more able to reverse the certification than they were last year,
when a Senate motion for disapproval gathered only 45 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of weariness with fighting the same battle over
and over,'' a Senate aide said. ``It gets old.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the administration note that although the Mexican
authorities have not made much headway against the drug mafias over
the last year, the establishment of elite anti-drug units within
the army and the federal police has led to closer working
relationships with the CIA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   But officials from each of those agencies challenge the
administration's public assertion that the Mexican authorities are
trying their best. Those officials contend that the obstacle to
success in Mexico is not so much the strength of the traffickers or
the inexperience of the police but the Mexican government's
unwillingness to fight corruption more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officers working with the military's special
anti-drug force, the Center for Anti-Narcotics Information, say
they believe that some of its efforts may have been compromised by
corrupt superiors, officials said. Three senior agents of an elite
Mexican police force trained by U.S. officials failed lie-detector
tests last year over questions about their contacts with drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The agents were moved out of the unit but remain in the federal
police.
</P>
<P>
   Drug investigations that have touched on several well-known
Mexican politicians and at least a dozen high-ranking military
officers have not yet led to any arrests, despite what U.S.
officials describe as strong evidence that some of the politicians
and officers have sought to protect traffickers in return for large
bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, officials say that on a series of
occasions over the last year, U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement
officials have provided their Mexican counterparts with information
on the whereabouts of powerful drug traffickers, only to have
Mexican agents mishandle the intelligence or wait for hours before
carrying out raids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give them houses, we give them phone numbers _ and nothing
happens,'' said a U.S. official. ``Cases go nowhere.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   An embarrassing example of the problem will provide a backdrop
for President Clinton's meetings with President Ernesto Zedillo,
which are to take place in and around the city of Merida, on the
Yucatan peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the peninsula, in the state of Quintana Roo, U.S.
intelligence and law-enforcement officials have been working for
more than a year with elite Mexican forces to dismantle a major
drug-smuggling operation with headquarters in the resort city of
Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   In one debacle last spring, U.S. officials said, officers of the
military intelligence unit recognized two of the most important
traffickers in the Cancun organization, Ramon Alcides Magana and
Albino Quintero Meraz, but made no attempt to capture them.
</P>
<P>
   On other occasions, U.S. intelligence officials gave officers of
the military unit home addresses and telephone numbers for each of
the two traffickers. But again, officials said, opportunities to
arrest the pair were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the unit appeared to get an important break when
it captured Gilberto Garza Garcia, the trafficker who oversaw the
mafia's movement of cocaine shipments from Cancun up the gulf coast
to McAllen, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. and Mexican officials said that after negotiating with
the general who headed the military unit and promising to help him
trap Magana, Garza Garcia was placed in the custody of two
detectives from whom he escaped the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The general has since been reassigned, Garza has been recaptured
and the detectives have been under investigation since being found
with more than $20,000 given to them by the trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   The White House drug-policy chief, Gen. Barry McCaffrey,
suggested that such short-term failings should not distract the
United States from its ultimate goals for Mexico. And while he and
other White House officials have often tried to silence
law-enforcement agencies that are critical of Mexico's performance,
he did not hesitate to offer his own view on certification in
advance of deliberations that will be overseen by Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we ought to do is look at U.S. national interests
in the long term,'' McCaffrey said. ``Do we think that partnership
with Mexico is important to us and is beginning to show signs of
substantial cooperation? My own advice'' to Albright ``is they
should be certified.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials have undertaken a similarly aggressive defense
of their efforts, lobbying more intensively than ever in Washington
and spending $100,000 a month to hire three high-profile lobbying
firms to assist them in getting their message out.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials have also held out to U.S. officials the
possibility that they might yet deliver a spectacular, last-minute
blow in the drug fight, one that could erase questions on Capitol
Hill about their willingness to move against the mafias.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical U.S. officials have taken to calling this notion ``the
February surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   According to senior officials of both countries, the surprise is
that the Mexican authorities, who have long been investigating the
governor of Quintana Roo, Mario Villanueva Madrid, might move to
indict him on drug-related charges sometime after Clinton's
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva has repeatedly denied providing any support to the
drug mafia that has flourished in Quintana Roo during his
administration, but a Mexican federal judge last week denied the
governor's request for information about the investigation against
him.

EVEN GRETZKY GETS THE BLUES   WHEN THE TEAM STRUGGLES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Mich., Tenn. Pa, Mo., Ill., Canada)  By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It finally sounded as if the Rangers' struggles were
getting to Wayne Gretzky on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about it and prepare for it,'' an obviously miffed
Gretzky said after the Rangers' 3-1 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes
at Madison Square Garden. ``It's not one guy, it's not two guys.
It's the whole team. And it's always the same way. We take three or
four penalties in the first period, fall behind by a goal, and then
spend the rest of the night fighting for our lives. It's not good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   With the defeat, the Rangers (20-25-7) fell to 12th place in the
Eastern Conference. They remained just 6 points out of the eighth
and final playoff spot, but trailed four teams for a post-season
berth with 30 games to go.
</P>
<P>
   Six of those games come in the next nine days, beginning Sunday
afternoon at the Garden against the two-time defending Stanley Cup
champion Detroit Red Wings _ a tough assignment for any team,
especially one that is now a season-low five games under .500.
</P>
<P>
   It should be even tougher for the Rangers, who are 3-8-0 in
their last 11 games and who have lost five of their last six games
at the Garden, where they are now a game below .500 for the season.
They are now 45-64-25 over the last two seasons _ since Mark
Messier was pushed aside by team management and departed for
Vancouver, leaving Gretzky as the Rangers' marquee star.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gretzky and Messier, who is currently out four to six weeks
with an injured knee, have seen better days; Vancouver is in 12th
place, too, in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky's comments Friday night were delivered, as usual, in
muffled tones. But regardless of the volume, the tone might have
been Gretzky's strongest all season. The message was one of
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just keep giving games away,'' Gretzky said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the Rangers cannot score with any regularity.
Brian Leetch tallied the team's only goal on Friday night, to
extend his goal-scoring streak to 3 games after he had gone a
career-high 23 without one. And Todd Harvey, who was playing for
the first time in 11 games, assisted on the early third-period
goal.
</P>
<P>
   But that was it. Gretzky had a disgusted look on his face for
most of the evening. Rangers Coach John Muckler double-shifted the
38-year-old center for much of the second period, to no avail. With
five minutes left in the period and the Rangers only trailing by a
goal, Gretzky was reduced to lifting one arm in premature
celebration on a shot of his that Carolina goalie Arturs Irbe sat
on before it could reach the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible,'' Gretzky would later say of the Rangers' play
at the Garden. ``I think we should all be extremely embarrassed by
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' fans certainly were. They booed the home team off
the ice after the second and third periods. But the Rangers'
struggles are not reserved for home-ice alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been no advantage wherever we've been,'' Leetch, the
team's captain, said. ``Obviously, we haven't had any advantage,
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Now come games against Detroit at the Garden, and then in
Nashville, on successive nights. Then it's back to the Garden for
contests against Montreal on Wednesday and Pittsburgh on Friday,
before a two-game swing to Edmonton and Calgary next Sunday and
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that stretch is over, the Rangers could find
themselves out of the post-season chase for the second time year in
a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuses, losses, we can't have them now,'' said Leetch. ``We
need a win.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a start.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Beukeboom is doubtful for Sunday's game. He suffered a
minor concussion when he was kneed in the back of the head by
Martin Gelinas in the second period of Friday night's loss. The
Rangers have listed Beukeboom as day to day. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers need scoring. On Friday, they acquired some grit
instead. That is what Neil Smith, the Rangers president, obtained
in Eric Lacroix, whom he obtained from Los Angeles for Sean Pronger
in an exchange of forwards who are still looking for their first
goals of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Rangers sent a pair of defensemen, Jeff Finley and
Geoff Smith, to the St. Louis Blues for future considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling was that we had a number of players like Sean and
that is why Sean was not getting into our lineup,'' Smith said of
Pronger, who had been acquired by the Rangers earlier this season
in the deal that sent Aleksei Kovalev to Pittsburgh for Petr
Nedved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have Brent Fedyk, Manyy Malhotra and a couple of
other guys, sort of our good, checking forwards. One of the things
we don't have in our lineup are more people like Todd Harvey and
Adam Graves, players that crash and use the physical part of the
game. With Lacroix, I thought I could add a physical player and a
better scorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix, said Smith, had requested a trade. Earlier this season,
he had been traded from Colorado by his father, Pierre. In 34 games
this season with the Avalanche and Kings, Lacroix had one assist.
Last season, though, he did notch 16 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers Coach John Muckler said that Lacroix would likely skate
on a line centered by the rookie, Malhotra. As for a more
established scorer, the Rangers are thought to be interested in
Doug Gilmour, should the Blackhawks move the veteran center before
the trading deadline.

THE RETURN OF SEIKALY BOLSTERS NETS' HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Next to Kerry Kittles, he was the most
impressive player at the New Jersey Nets' training camp. He ran the
court like a small forward, scored in the post over the gifted shot
blocker Jim McIlvaine, and made Jayson Williams work extra hard for
rebounds. According to his coaches and teammates, Rony Seikaly was
playing great, giving the Nets their first scoring center since
Derrick Coleman was traded three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then, during an evening practice Jan. 24, Seikaly and the
excitement he had generated came tumbling down on Chris Gatling's
foot. Hours later, the 6-foot-11-inch Seikaly was found to have a
sprained left ankle. Now, after three weeks of inactivity, he is
back, expected to play in Monday's game at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   With the Nets reeling after losing three of their first four
games, Seikaly will be looked to for a much-needed scoring boost
off the bench. A 15-point scorer throughout his 10-year career, he
should help the Nets improve on their woeful scoring average of
85.3 points per game, a figure nearly 12 points lower than last
year's Eastern Conference-leading average of 99.6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rony is something else on that post,'' Williams had said
before Seikaly was injured. ``He's out here killing people.
McIlvaine is supposed to be one of the top two or three best shot
blockers in the league, and they're going at it pretty good and
he's getting his shot over McIlvaine.''
</P>
<P>
   Seikaly, who rehabilitated his ankle by sitting in a hyperbaric
chamber, was in uniform for Thursday's sobering 95-75 defeat at
Milwaukee, but Coach John Calipari chose not to use him. Seikaly
had not yet completed a full practice with the club, and Calipari
wanted to make sure he was ready before throwing him into the
raging fire that is National Basketball Association post play. ``I
got dressed to play, so if he would've called my number I would've
played,'' Seikaly said after the game, noting that his ankle was
fine. ``But I guess it'll be a lot better now that I'll have three
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   After workouts Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Seikaly should be
there to spell Williams, or play alongside him, in the battle with
Miami's Alonzo Mourning. Before the injury, Calipari had been
experimenting with a lineup that included Williams, Seikaly and the
6-10 Keith Van Horn.
</P>
<P>
   With a starting five that is among the smallest in the league,
Calipari knows the importance of having a big unit available when
necessary. Without Seikaly, the only way for the Nets to go big was
by playing Williams and McIlvaine together. But neither player is
much of a scorer from the low block.
</P>
<P>
   Seikaly's return will give the Nets an alternative look, one
that Calipari and Williams had raved about during camp. Seikaly's
scoring ability should draw attention and enable Williams to roam
for offensive rebounds and put-backs. Defensively, Williams, who is
more than an inch shorter than Seikaly, will still guard the
centers, since Seikaly's mobility allows him to cover most power
forwards.
</P>
<P>
   And since both Williams and Seikaly run the court well, the
bigger lineup will not hinder the Nets' running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say big team, it's not really a slow team,'' Seikaly
said. ``We're a quick big team because Jayson and I can beat any
centers down the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is back, the Nets are hoping Seikaly, who averaged
16 points and 11 rebounds as Miami's starting center from 1988 to
1994, will remain healthy. Since joining the club in a trade with
Orlando on Feb. 19, 1998, he has been more recognizable in street
clothes than in shorts and sneakers _ a bone contusion in his right
foot limited him to nine games with the Nets last season.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   The Nets are hoping that their starting point guard, SAM
CASSELL, who sprained his right ankle during a 36-point, 9-assist
performance in the season opener, will be able to play Monday.
Without him, the Nets' offense has been horrible, shooting just 38
percent from the field and averaging 78 points per game. Both
Cassell and his backup, ERIC MURDOCK, who has a strained left
groin, are listed as questionable.

Oakly during a news conference in Tornoto after being traded to the
Raptors by the Knicks in 1998. The power forward who never wanted

Hampshire Christian Coalition dinner earlier this month. The
aftershocks of impeachment are already being felt by politicians

the highway to a little church that was not his own.
</P>
<P>
   On that sun-flamed afternoon in June, Peacock slipped into the
overflow crowd outside the Jasper church and mourned twice over.
</P>
<P>
   He joined in the collective grief for James Byrd Jr., a black
man dragged to an unthinkable death a few days earlier, allegedly
by three white men. He also ached for his own son.
</P>
<P>
   Peacock, a sad-eyed, stooped woodsman of 67, had a son who also
died on a lonesome stretch of road in the Piney Woods near Jasper.
The body of the black teen-ager was found in a ditch on Nov. 5,
1977, just eight miles from where Byrd's body was left last June.
Police say Ray Peacock, 18, was killed when a white teen-ager named
Rocky Phelps accidentally hit him with his pickup; the Peacocks say
it was murder motivated by race.
</P>
<P>
   The teen's death shows how accusations of racism, proven or not,
can poison relationships and twist lives. For 21 years, the Peacock
and Phelps families have been haunted by the death. And whether
Peacock's death was planned or accidental, it is, like Byrd's, a
part of the legacy of racial division in Deep East Texas, a
pine-covered section of the state where the Ku Klux Klan still
maintains a presence.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Peacock's late-night death has come to symbolize the racial
mistrust that can fester when a black person is killed under
unusual circumstances. After Byrd's slaying last summer, local
blacks began to talk openly about Ray Peacock's death and others
they said had been ``swept under the rug'' over the years.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a Jasper jury will begin to hear testimony in the
first trial of a suspect in Byrd's gruesome dragging death. Many
people will be watching for signs of how race relations have
changed in the years since the Peacock family was left with hearts
full of racial mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   CROSSING OVER
</P>
<P>
   Ray Peacock got noticed a lot.
</P>
<P>
   He wore a dazzling hot-pink suit to his prom at Burkeville High
School in Newton County. He had a red Mustang when no other black
male student had a car. He was senior class president and vice
president of the student council in an integrated class where
blacks were the majority. He had a black girlfriend, but white
girls slipped him covert love letters that he hid in a bedroom
drawer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am white as day, and you, black as night. ... This is why
our secret must be kept on highest star,'' one girl wrote. ``The
world's just not ready, so we deny going steady.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Peacock graduated in 1977, when racial segregation was
outlawed yet persistent enough to divide a simple ritual such as
voting on the most popular couple for the school yearbook. One
white couple and one black couple were always chosen _ and
photographed _ separately.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed dating _ known locally as ``crossing over'' _ was not
accepted in Deep East Texas then, and Cecil and Theresa Peacock
believed their children would be in danger if they crossed
courtship's color barrier. They warned their six children away from
interracial romance.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Ray Peacock left home for college in Beaumont.
He returned every weekend to the family's small wooden house in
Shankleville, a rural community in Newton County founded in 1867 by
two ex-slaves named Jim and Winnie Shankle. Ray Peacock was a
descendant of the Shankles, who are honored on a state historical
marker for the powerful love that inspired Jim to walk 400 miles
and cross the Mississippi River to find Winnie after she was sold
to a Texan.
</P>
<P>
   On one of Ray Peacock's visits home, someone phoned the Peacock
home to say the family's cows were wandering loose on a nearby
two-lane highway, Texas 87. Ray Peacock volunteered to round up the
cows and drove off in his Mustang. It was sometime before 10:30
p.m. on Nov. 5, 1977.
</P>
<P>
   About 11:30 p.m., his car was found on the grassy shoulder. The
headlights were on, the emergency lights blinked, the driver's door
stood open, and music played from the tape deck. A deputy found Ray
Peacock's body about 225 feet from the car, face down with no
apparent wounds, according to a sheriff's report.
</P>
<P>
   That night, two white youths came forward to say their pickup
had hit somebody in the foggy darkness. The 18-year-old driver,
Rocky Phelps, said he and his younger brother had turned around and
looked for a body along the road but didn't see anyone. Scared,
they drove to their uncle's house.
</P>
<P>
   Racial tension flared immediately after Peacock's body was
discovered. The first call Newton County Sheriff Wayne Powell got
was from an unidentified woman who demanded to know what the
sheriff planned to do about the white man who had killed a black
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there was no doubt going to be a problem over it
because of the way it happened,'' said Powell, who is white.
</P>
<P>
   He said Peacock had pulled off the road and parked his car on
the shoulder facing oncoming traffic, a dangerous position. Phelps
was startled to see the headlights of Peacock's car pointing toward
him through the fog. Anticipating a collision, Phelps swerved. But
he veered toward the headlights, passing in front of Peacock's
parked car and avoiding the Mustang's open door. As he came around
the Mustang, the pickup hit Peacock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a bad freak accident,'' Powell said. ``The family
was upset about it, but there was no (criminal) offense committed.
The boys were just as innocent as they could be.''
</P>
<P>
   That explanation was too outlandish for the Peacock family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so far-fetched that even a child would wonder why, or
have questions about it,'' said Theresa Peacock. ``Why would you go
to where the lights are instead of staying on the highway?''
</P>
<P>
   The Peacocks say there are other discrepancies in the official
account of Ray Peacock's death. None of the family's cows was found
loose that night. The sheriff's department report says no wounds
were found on the body, but the autopsy report says the teen-ager
had a broken back and multiple abrasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was foul play,'' said Jasper NAACP founder Booker T.
Hunter, who helped the Peacock family comb through mud and grass
the morning after Ray Peacock died to look for clues to his death.
``He was killed. That's all there was to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorie Coleman, a black mortician in Jasper who handled the
funeral, also rejects the official account of the death.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no scars, bruises, contusions or anything on (his)
face, on his arms or elbows _ which is inconsistent with being hit
by an automobile,'' Coleman said. ``I've picked up numerous victims
hit by automobiles. Once a car hits a body, that body is going to
land, and there will be some cuts and bruises.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have been scarred up, bruised and cut up.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, many people in the area believe Ray Peacock was
castrated. That question was settled when Theresa Peacock went to
the funeral home and said she wasn't leaving until she saw her
son's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``People came and told us they cut his private parts out, but
they didn't,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled the sheet to check because that was something I
wanted to know personally,'' she said. ``I went from the top of his
head to the bottom of his feet. I knew he didn't have any scratches
on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Powell said he insisted on a county-financed autopsy,
which concluded that Ray Peacock died of a severed aorta and a
broken back ``due to massive blow from behind, typical of being
struck by motor vehicle with a high front, such as pickup truck.''
</P>
<P>
   But the county autopsy raised more questions for the Peacocks
than it answered because they insist they saw no wounds on the
teen-ager's body. And the cranium was not examined, said Coleman,
the funeral home director. The family and Coleman tried in vain to
obtain a second autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People and the Peacock family to protest the death fizzled
because few people were willing to publicly challenge the official
ruling that it was accidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a racial thing, and we didn't have enough people,''
Cecil Peacock said. ``They said, `We got to live here.' There's one
thing I've learned about crime. You've got to have someone in your
corner.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes his son was lured out of his house that Saturday
night by white youths angered by his friendships with white girls.
``A lot of people said he met a white girl down there, and these
white males were already down there waiting. They mobbed him,''
Cecil Peacock said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Rice, a political science professor who is director of
the Race and Ethnic Studies Institute at Texas A&AMP;M University, said
discrepancies can fuel charges of racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of things are sort of brushed aside,'' he said of
the family's questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You end up having two camps (one black, one white), and no one
is able to prove beyond a shadow of doubt exactly what happened,''
said Rice, who is black. ``So, since proof is hard to come by,
there will always be doubt as to really what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   A FAMILY'S TRAUMA
</P>
<P>
   The death of Ray Peacock turned his family upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very life-changing event for all of us,'' said his
sister Venetia, who was1 when he died. ``It affected us deeply. It
changed our whole entire family.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional stress hit Cecil Peacock the hardest. He had a
history of anxiety problems, but the trauma of his favorite son's
death in a racially charged atmosphere overwhelmed his ability to
cope in the everyday world, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped working. He woke at odd hours and roamed his
property. Sometimes he took to chopping wood and wouldn't stop
until all the hedges were cut down.
</P>
<P>
   He carted junk home and left it all over the yard. Trucks, cars,
scrap metal, clothes, boxes, appliances, car parts, tires and more.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Peacock tried in vain to move the junk away from the
front yard. ``I just had to throw up my hands,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her voice cracks and catches even today as she remembers how her
three young daughters were teased to tears because they lived in a
junkyard.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was rough,'' she said. ``Children would tease them and call
their father a junkyard dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Peacock says he had a nervous breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought every white man in Newton County was my friend until
that happened'' to his son, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Cecil Peacock was unable to work, Theresa Peacock's
earnings as a janitor became the family's only income.
</P>
<P>
   Now 64, Theresa Peacock still sweeps schoolroom floors, cleans
blackboards, empties trash cans and scrubs bathrooms. In many ways,
the job gave her a respite from the unpredictable quirks of her
tormented husband.
</P>
<P>
   Church gave Theresa Peacock the emotional strength to go on
after her son was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the only thing I could really rely on,'' she said.
``I really didn't have any trust in the whites after it happened.
It just made me more frightened around them. The only thing that
really kept me going was reading my Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was completely afraid to go anywhere,'' she said. ``I didn't
go anywhere by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Her two oldest sons already had left home when Ray Peacock was
killed, leaving the girls, ages 11, 8 and 6, at home to absorb the
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a childlike feeling that things were coming apart, that
nothing was right and everything was just wrong,'' said Venetia
Peacock, the eldest daughter, now 32.
</P>
<P>
   The world got smaller and smaller for the growing Peacock
sisters. Their parents allowed them to leave home for few places
except school and church. Friends were scrutinized by their
parents, and dating boys was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother basically picked my junior prom date,'' said Venetia
Peacock, who lives in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   She has worked for several nonprofit groups that provide social
services to low-income families because of a personal ``need to
stick up for the underdog,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At night, she studies for a master's degree in business. She
hopes it will help her gain a management position so she can be a
more powerful voice for people unable to help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   She has never given up questioning what happened to the brother
whom she adored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a thread that you weave through fabric,'' she said.
``It's stuck on my life in every way,'' she said. ``It's probably
affected all of us in how we think about fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like this happens, you really have to work
twice as hard not to blame a whole race of people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   THE DRIVER'S PAIN
</P>
<P>
   The white man who drove the pickup that authorities say killed
Ray Peacock is now a traveling oil well driller with an 18-year-old
child of his own. He is uncomfortable speaking about that night 21
years ago and says he is still haunted by his actions behind the
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell Mr. Cecil (Peacock) that I'm still about as upset
about it as he is,'' Phelps said. ``Not a day goes by that I don't
think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelps said he was trying to avoid a head-on collision on a
foggy roadway, and didn't realize he had hit a person until his
younger brother told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that we'd hit a person, and we turned around, and
we couldn't see nobody. So, naturally, we were scared to death, so
we went back to my uncle's house and then called in (to the
sheriff's office),'' Phelps said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing racial about it,'' he said. ``The blacks are
what made it controversial. The first thing they done was call in
the NAACP, and it was a racial thing and everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelps said his life, too, was changed forever by Ray Peacock's
death. The uproar was so overwhelming that Phelps stayed out of
school at the request of school officials, who also instructed his
brothers and cousin to stay home. Phelps never went back to school.
He dropped out and moved in with his grandmother in New Iberia,
La., and began working in the oil fields. He didn't move back to
Newton for seven years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Phelps says times have changed and blacks and whites
coexist peacefully in Deep East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are any racial deals, either way,'' he
said. ``I mean, I see these white girls going with these black boys
in school, and the same vice versa, and there ain't nobody doing
nothing or saying nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't approve of it, but it's not my business,'' he said.
``But I don't approve of a white girl going with a Spanish guy
neither. That's me. I just don't believe in mixing races.''
</P>
<P>
   A TOLL OF RACISM
</P>
<P>
   Experts on race are not surprised that the Peacock family and
Phelps still feel like victims of their circumstances more than two
decades later. The emotional toll of such racially tinged incidents
can be debilitating, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that's really the untold story of the impact of
racism, particularly on those who suffer from racism,'' said Rice,
the A&AMP;M race institute director. ``The psychological long-term
impact is tremendous and quite intense, and one never forgets the
kind of treatment, the kind of behavior that they were exposed
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if racism is only perceived, he said, the effect would be
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have experienced really traumatic effects of racism,
it becomes embedded within you,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering doubts and resentments about deaths like Ray Peacock's
make efforts to change the dynamics of race in Deep East Texas all
the more difficult after a shocking incident like Byrd's death.
Even before then, blacks and whites in Deep East Texas had settled
into a subtle, unspoken code of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is smooth ``as long as the black man stays in his
place and doesn't buck the system,'' said Coleman, the Jasper
mortician. ``Every small town has a system.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks who gain political and economic power learn not to
challenge the unspoken code of subordination, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're singing the songs that the good ol' boys want to hear.
`Yes.' `OK,''' he said. ``It will probably always be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   But a task force created by Jasper's black mayor, R.C. Horn, has
taken the lead in trying to bring change. At meetings over the past
few months, local blacks came forward to tell personal stories of
racist slights, and white residents apologized for using slurs or
being dismissive toward blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, the mayor's task force agreed to tear down one
of Jasper's oldest symbols of segregation. A 163-year-old fence in
the city cemetery that divided white graves from black graves,
including the plot where Byrd is buried, was removed during a
ceremony of reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things need to go much further than that,'' Rice said. ``That
was just symbolic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people in that part of Texas who are making an effort
to try to promote positive race relations,'' said Bill Hale,
executive director of the Texas Human Rights Commission, which
combats employment and housing discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``You still have a significant number of people who want to
keep blacks in a white-defined role, said Hale, who is white.
``That means they want blacks to stay in their place. So it's a
very mixed kind of situation. It switches back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Diggles, who as director of the Deep East Texas Council
of Governments is one of the most prominent blacks in the area,
argues that the Byrd slaying should not be considered a symbol of
local racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``That murder could have happened in other parts of the
country,'' Diggles said.
</P>
<P>
   Diggles' Council of Governments is working to alleviate poverty
by trying to obtain economic development grants and to attract
business to the area, which has been hit in recent years by the
closing of lumber mills, hospitals, and furniture and door
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate of blacks is more than double that of
whites in the region, but Diggles says racism is not the reason.
``The average wage and salary disparities are probably a reflection
upon starting from behind and trying to catch up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he sees less segregation and more social mingling of
races, especially among the young. Lots of interracial children are
growing up in the area, and he said there is ``an enormous amount''
of mixed dating.
</P>
<P>
   But just because mixed dating is more prevalent, that doesn't
mean it's accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Diggles said some local school officials have asked him to
conduct sensitivity workshops on interracial dating ``for those
people who don't know how to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   MEMORIES OF A SON
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Peacock didn't display any photographs of Ray Peacock
for nearly -- decade because her husband couldn't bear to see them.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the most striking picture in their living room is a
large painting of Ray Peacock modeled after his high school class
photo. Photographs of all six Peacock children fill the walls of
the small room, where a wood stove and an Army blanket nailed over
the door keep out the winter dampness.
</P>
<P>
   The Peacocks cherish their son's high school yearbook and memory
scrapbook, where the secret love letters from white girls were
found tucked among the pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only wish things could be different, you know?'' one letter
says. ``I mean, oh man, everything could be so neat! And we
wouldn't have to hide what we feel inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter is not signed, but Theresa Peacock learned that a
white girl wrote it after she painstakingly matched the handwriting
to a good-luck tribute inside her son's yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was the last to know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And she might be the last ever to be convinced that her son's
death was a simple roadway accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``God in heaven would have to come down from heaven and tell me
that,'' Theresa Peacock said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge in Dallas cited the union representing American
Airlines pilots for contempt Saturday and fined it at least $10
million for ignoring his back-to-work order, as the pilots'
continued sickout stranded tens of thousands of passengers on a
busy holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall said the fine could ultimately
be far more than $10 million because it was intended in part to
reimburse American for the losses it had suffered from the weeklong
sickout. American estimates that the job action has cost it more
than $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   As the labor dispute dragged on, airline terminals grew even
more crowded and passengers' tempers grew shorter as their anger at
the pilots mounted.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, lawyers for American, the nation's second-largest
airline, asked Kendall to hold the pilots in contempt and to issue
``a coercive fine'' for failing to end the sickout despite his
Wednesday order directing them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing written ruling, Kendall said, ``Unfortunately, the
radical element that appears to be in control of the Allied Pilots
Association seems determined to fly American Airlines into the side
of the mountain, taking themselves, the company, their co-workers
and their customers with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered the union to deposit $10 million with the
court on Tuesday pending his determination at a Wednesday hearing
of the level of damages American had suffered because of the
sickout.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall also found the union's president, Richard LaVoy, and its
vice president, Brian Mayhew, to be in contempt, stating that they
had acted only half-heartedly in telling pilots to end the sickout
following his Wednesday order.
</P>
<P>
   He directed LaVoy to deposit $10,000 with the court and Mayhew,
$5,000, although he suggested that these amounts as well as the $10
million deposit were ``much less than the probable actual damages''
that would be ordered.
</P>
<P>
   After the judge's ruling, several union leaders emphasized that
they were emphatically telling pilots to return to work. But other
union members said the rank and file was debating how to respond,
with some hard-liners suggesting that they continue their sickout
to pressure American in the union's dispute over the airline's
acquisition of Reno Air, a small carrier serving the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a split right now,'' said one pilot on the sick list,
who spoke only on the condition that he not be identified. ``Some
hard-liners are saying stay the course; others are saying it's time
to go back to work to support the union but fight the battle in
other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Several pilots said they might support a fallback strategy, a
refusal to work overtime _ a move that would be less disruptive
than a sickout, but would still force American to cancel some
scheduled flights.
</P>
<P>
   American said at 7:30 a.m. Saturday that about 2,100 of its
pilots had called in sick, down slightly from Friday, but still
enough to cause the airline to cancel more than one-third of its
2,250 scheduled flights Saturday. At midday, American said the
number out sick had dropped to 1,700, representing about one-fifth
of the airline's 9,200 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that 845 flights were canceled Saturday,
down from 1,102 on Friday. The airline also announced that more
than 400 flights scheduled for Sunday would be canceled and more
than 200 flights Monday would be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict grew out of American's purchase in December of Reno
Air. American has said that it intends to merge Reno Air, which has
25 planes and 300 pilots, into American's much larger network, but
that it will take as long as 18 months to refit Reno Air's planes
and retrain pilots at both carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But the union contends that American is violating a fundamental
clause in its contract, which requires that all flying at the
airline and any of its subsidiaries be performed by members of the
pilots' union. The pilots have voiced concern that American may
transfer some of its flying to pilots at Reno Air, who are paid
about half as much as American pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Many pilots also say that they are worried that if the union
does not make a stand now, it will have set a dangerous precedent
if American acquires an even larger airline in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The union has demanded that the company immediately raise the
Reno pilots' pay to the level of American pilots _ a move the
company estimates would cost $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is this court's view that a minor labor dispute has been
transformed into nothing more than a shakedown,'' Kendall wrote in
his ruling. ``Even though it may indeed be more economical for
American to cave in and pay, in the long run if you pay extortion
today, you typically have to pay it tomorrow. When the pitch is
`pay us what we want or we will cost you more,' it is the type of
negotiation one usually sees when doing business with one of the
five families in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides said Saturday that they hoped to resume
negotiations within days.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the Friday hearing, Kendall frequently scoffed at the union's
leaders when they insisted that they were doing everything possible
to persuade their members to return to work. He said he found it
especially disturbing that 12 of the union's 18 board members had
called in sick that day.
</P>
<P>
   But LaVoy, the union's president, repeatedly told the judge that
he was doing his utmost to get the pilots to end their sickout.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's hearing, the union stepped up the urgency of its
messages calling on pilots to return to work. The union updated its
telephone message and its World Wide Web site on Friday night to
carry a statement by LaVoy, who said: ``I want to make a personal
plea to all of our pilots. The association's leadership needs your
help in complying with Judge Joe Kendall's order. We need to get
this airline back up and running at full capacity, and we need to
do so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kendall said the union's efforts to tell pilots to return to
the cockpit were too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's hearing, union representatives estimated that it had
about $38 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   In a stern warning, Kendall's ruling, said, ``If the activity
and consequent damages continue, when all the dust clears, all the
assets of the union, including their strike war chest, will be
capable of being safely stored in the overhead bin of a Piper
Cub.''
</P>
<P>
   At O'Hare International Airport outside Chicago Saturday
morning, Del Dooling, 43, a tired, unshaven salesman from
Riverside, Calif., was so angry about the cancellation of his
Friday flight to San Juan that he vowed never to fly American
Airlines again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service has been wretched,'' he said. ``It's just
horrible. Everything is going wrong.'' Dooling added that in his
view the pilots should face a harsh penalty for defying the judge's
order. ``It should be prison and a big fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Miami International Airport, Gertrudis Gonzalez, 21 a student
from Managua, Nicaragua, complained about being stranded for more
than a day because her Friday morning flight home was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went hungry, they gave us nothing to eat,'' she said. ``We
were left wondering along the passageways.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute forced passengers, travel agents and American
service representatives to show a lot of resourcefulness. Standing
in the American terminal Saturday morning at Kennedy International
Airport, Patrick Reed, a plumbing wholesaler from Albany, N.Y.,
complained about the cancellation of his flight from New York to
Vancouver. But he managed to make alternative arrangements on a TWA
flight to Chicago and then a Cathay Pacific link from Chicago to
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   While relieved about his rerouting, Reed remained angry at
American's pilots, saying, ``I think the pilots have long since
made their point, and they're being very selfish.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kendall issued his ruling, the airline issued a statement,
saying, ``Regrettably, this illegal job action left American with
no options other than canceling thousands of flights with little or
no notice, which caused great hardship to tens of thousands of
travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline added that it hoped to regain public confidence.
``But before we can do that, we need to restore our operations and
take care of our passengers,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts expect that American will suffer long-term damage,
despite pledges by some angry passengers never to fly the airline
again. ``Consumers have the attention spans of monkeys,'' said
Michael Boyd, an aviation consultant in Evergreen, Colo. ``They
just forget real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Fare reductions and other incentives will draw passengers back
once a settlement is reached, he said. ``When American does fly,
they are really pretty good at it,'' he added. ``It is a
high-quality airline. They are going to get a pretty fast
response.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines was grounded for three weeks in September
after its pilots went on strike. The carrier suffered steep losses
through the end of the year, but has recently seen its traffic
return to normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term damage,'' Boyd said, referring to American, ``is
the continuing shattering of trust between the airline and its
pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots group, which is not part of the AFL-CIO, has received
little support from other unions or from its main rival, the Air
Line Pilots Association, from which it split three decades ago.

   COXNET FOCUS 0212: In a move expected to spark a new partisan
battle in Congress, President Clinton wants the federal government
to authorize $22 billion in bonds to build new schools and repair
old ones, issuing tax credits to those who buy them. The debate on
school construction also is being fueled by a 1996 federal report
that showed 60 percent of American schools need significant
repairs. (Monroe, Cox Washington Bureau)

   IMPEACHMENT FOLLOWUPS

<P>
   CLINTON-NEXT _ WASHINGTON _ Now that the impeachment cloud has
been lifted, how effectively can President Clinton govern? He'll be
a lame-duck president facing an opposition-led Congress, and his
poll numbers may drop without anti-impeachment sentiment to prop
them up. Still, Clinton may find politically bruised Republicans
willing to meet him more than halfway on policy. (Deans, Cox News

   BLACKWHITE-JASPER _ On a lonely stretch of road outside the
EastTexas town of Jasper, a black man dies a mysterious death late
one night. His broken body is found in a ditch. The suspects are a
couple of young white men in a pick-up. The black man's family
believes the white men lured him to the fog-shrouded road so they
could castrate him and beat him. Jasper, Texas 1998? No, it all
happened in 1977, a bigoted time when a black teen in East Texas
could lose his life for dating a white girl and no one would be
punished. We trace the modern history of East Texas race relations

   BUSH-IMPEACH _ AUSTIN _ The impeachment is over. Bill Clinton is
still in office, to the chagrin of many Republicans. Yet, a
Republican with possible designs on the office, Gov. George W.
Bush, has stayed way out of the fray. Why? How has that helped/hurt
him? How has the impeachment affected the timing of his
announcement for the office? Will the GOP experience with Clinton
inoculate Bush against prying into his ``young and irresponsible''
days? Or will it redouble efforts to dig up dirt on him? A look at
how impeachment politics intersects with presidential politics in
2000. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman).

   SALTLAKE _ SALT LAKE CITY _ Frank Zang misses the simple joy of
flipping through the morning paper and sipping a cup of coffee. His
quiet ritual has turned into a daily test of nerves. ``I have to
admit,'' says Zang, a media representative for the Salt Lake
Olympic Committee, ``I cringe each morning when I walk out to get
my newspaper, thinking about what might be greeting me.'' Zang has
plenty of company. The bloodletting has persisted for months in
Salt Lake, threatening to sap the color from city's Olympic facade,
drip by drip. The ongoing Olympic scandal has been excruciating for
a city that has historically extolled the virtues of hard work and
clean living. Instead of celebrating the three-year milestone to
the start of the Games this week, Salt Lake has had to face a
jarring 300-page report that accuses top officials of making covert
payments to IOC members, providing extravagant gifts and trips,
then concealing their actions. (Hannigan, Atlanta

   WWII-MERCHANTMARINE _ BRUNSWICK, Ga. _ It was the middle of the
night of April 8, 1942 when a gigantic explosion shook this port
town and lit up the black Atlantic sky like the Fourth of July.
John Henderson, then 11 and now a physician, remembers it well. A
German submarine had just torpedoed the USS Oklahoma, killing 22
men. All of the bodies were identified, except four that were
burned beyond recognition. Now, a Brunswick group made up of former
Merchant Marine sailors has finally identified the four, and is
raising money for a bigger monument to mark their common grave.
Rep. Jack Kingston is trying to have the four awarded the
Distinguished Service Medal, and helping the Brunswick group track
down relatives of the long-dead sailors. It's a little known fact
about World War II that the Merchant Marine suffered more
casualties, per capita, than any other branch of service. It's
little known for a reason - Washington didn't want the public to
know that 10 times the number of ships sunk at Pearl Harbor went
down within sight of East Coast cities - several near Brunswick.
We'll tell the story of these men, what happened to them, talk to
people who remember hearing the explosion, and others, to Merchant
Marine vets who are now demanding their due. Illustrate with photo
of a small marker, headlines from the Brunswick papers, photos of
the site where this ship went down, etc. Hopefully we will have
mugs of the four men, now that they have been identified. And we'll
try to talk to members of their families who were simply told their
loved ones had been lost at sea. (Hendrick, Atlanta

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge in Dallas cited the union representing American
Airlines pilots for contempt Saturday and fined it at least $10
million for ignoring his back-to-work order, as the pilots'
continued sickout stranded tens of thousands of passengers on a
busy holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall said the fine could ultimately
be far more than $10 million because it was intended in part to
reimburse American for the losses it had suffered from the weeklong
sickout. American estimates that the job action has cost it more
than $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   As the labor dispute dragged on, airline terminals grew even
more crowded and passengers' tempers grew shorter as their anger at
the pilots mounted.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, lawyers for American, the nation's second-largest
airline, asked Kendall to hold the pilots in contempt and to issue
``a coercive fine'' for failing to end the sickout despite his
Wednesday order directing them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing written ruling, Kendall said, ``Unfortunately, the
radical element that appears to be in control of the Allied Pilots
Association seems determined to fly American Airlines into the side
of the mountain, taking themselves, the company, their co-workers
and their customers with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered the union to deposit $10 million with the
court on Tuesday pending his determination at a Wednesday hearing
of the level of damages American had suffered because of the
sickout.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall also found the union's president, Richard LaVoy, and its
vice president, Brian Mayhew, to be in contempt, stating that they
had acted only half-heartedly in telling pilots to end the sickout
following his Wednesday order.
</P>
<P>
   He directed LaVoy to deposit $10,000 with the court and Mayhew,
$5,000, although he suggested that these amounts as well as the $10
million deposit were ``much less than the probable actual damages''
that would be ordered.
</P>
<P>
   After the judge's ruling, several union leaders emphasized that
they were emphatically telling pilots to return to work. But other
union members said the rank and file was debating how to respond,
with some hard-liners suggesting that they continue their sickout
to pressure American in the union's dispute over the airline's
acquisition of Reno Air, a small carrier serving the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a split right now,'' said one pilot on the sick list,
who spoke only on the condition that he not be identified. ``Some
hard-liners are saying stay the course; others are saying it's time
to go back to work to support the union but fight the battle in
other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Several pilots said they might support a fallback strategy, a
refusal to work overtime _ a move that would be less disruptive
than a sickout, but would still force American to cancel some
scheduled flights.
</P>
<P>
   American said at 7:30 a.m. Saturday that about 2,100 of its
pilots had called in sick, down slightly from Friday, but still
enough to cause the airline to cancel more than one-third of its
2,250 scheduled flights Saturday. At midday, American said the
number out sick had dropped to 1,700, representing about one-fifth
of the airline's 9,200 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that 845 flights were canceled Saturday,
down from 1,102 on Friday. The airline also announced that more
than 400 flights scheduled for Sunday would be canceled and more
than 200 flights Monday would be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict grew out of American's purchase in December of Reno
Air. American has said that it intends to merge Reno Air, which has
25 planes and 300 pilots, into American's much larger network, but
that it will take as long as 18 months to refit Reno Air's planes
and retrain pilots at both carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But the union contends that American is violating a fundamental
clause in its contract, which requires that all flying at the
airline and any of its subsidiaries be performed by members of the
pilots' union. The pilots have voiced concern that American may
transfer some of its flying to pilots at Reno Air, who are paid
about half as much as American pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Many pilots also say that they are worried that if the union
does not make a stand now, it will have set a dangerous precedent
if American acquires an even larger airline in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The union has demanded that the company immediately raise the
Reno pilots' pay to the level of American pilots _ a move the
company estimates would cost $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is this court's view that a minor labor dispute has been
transformed into nothing more than a shakedown,'' Kendall wrote in
his ruling. ``Even though it may indeed be more economical for
American to cave in and pay, in the long run if you pay extortion
today, you typically have to pay it tomorrow. When the pitch is
`pay us what we want or we will cost you more,' it is the type of
negotiation one usually sees when doing business with one of the
five families in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides said Saturday that they hoped to resume
negotiations within days.

</P>
<P>
   In the Friday hearing, Kendall frequently scoffed at the union's
leaders when they insisted that they were doing everything possible
to persuade their members to return to work. He said he found it
especially disturbing that 12 of the union's 18 board members had
called in sick that day.
</P>
<P>
   But LaVoy, the union's president, repeatedly told the judge that
he was doing his utmost to get the pilots to end their sickout.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's hearing, the union stepped up the urgency of its
messages calling on pilots to return to work. The union updated its
telephone message and its World Wide Web site on Friday night to
carry a statement by LaVoy, who said: ``I want to make a personal
plea to all of our pilots. The association's leadership needs your
help in complying with Judge Joe Kendall's order. We need to get
this airline back up and running at full capacity, and we need to
do so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kendall said the union's efforts to tell pilots to return to
the cockpit were too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's hearing, union representatives estimated that it had
about $38 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   In a stern warning, Kendall's ruling, said, ``If the activity
and consequent damages continue, when all the dust clears, all the
assets of the union, including their strike war chest, will be
capable of being safely stored in the overhead bin of a Piper
Cub.''
</P>
<P>
   At O'Hare International Airport outside Chicago Saturday
morning, Del Dooling, 43, a tired, unshaven salesman from
Riverside, Calif., was so angry about the cancellation of his
Friday flight to San Juan that he vowed never to fly American
Airlines again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service has been wretched,'' he said. ``It's just
horrible. Everything is going wrong.'' Dooling added that in his
view the pilots should face a harsh penalty for defying the judge's
order. ``It should be prison and a big fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Miami International Airport, Gertrudis Gonzalez, 21 a student
from Managua, Nicaragua, complained about being stranded for more
than a day because her Friday morning flight home was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went hungry, they gave us nothing to eat,'' she said. ``We
were left wondering along the passageways.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute forced passengers, travel agents and American
service representatives to show a lot of resourcefulness. Standing
in the American terminal Saturday morning at Kennedy International
Airport, Patrick Reed, a plumbing wholesaler from Albany, N.Y.,
complained about the cancellation of his flight from New York to
Vancouver. But he managed to make alternative arrangements on a TWA
flight to Chicago and then a Cathay Pacific link from Chicago to
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   While relieved about his rerouting, Reed remained angry at
American's pilots, saying, ``I think the pilots have long since
made their point, and they're being very selfish.''
</P>
<P>
   After Kendall issued his ruling, the airline issued a statement,
saying, ``Regrettably, this illegal job action left American with
no options other than canceling thousands of flights with little or
no notice, which caused great hardship to tens of thousands of
travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline added that it hoped to regain public confidence.
``But before we can do that, we need to restore our operations and
take care of our passengers,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts expect that American will suffer long-term damage,
despite pledges by some angry passengers never to fly the airline
again. ``Consumers have the attention spans of monkeys,'' said
Michael Boyd, an aviation consultant in Evergreen, Colo. ``They
just forget real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Fare reductions and other incentives will draw passengers back
once a settlement is reached, he said. ``When American does fly,
they are really pretty good at it,'' he added. ``It is a
high-quality airline. They are going to get a pretty fast
response.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines was grounded for three weeks in September
after its pilots went on strike. The carrier suffered steep losses
through the end of the year, but has recently seen its traffic
return to normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term damage,'' Boyd said, referring to American, ``is
the continuing shattering of trust between the airline and its
pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots group, which is not part of the AFL-CIO, has received
little support from other unions or from its main rival, the Air
Line Pilots Association, from which it split three decades ago.

 &HT;    Bush story `yet to be written,' but character, leadership makes
him presidential front-runner, supporters say
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   And now, like trailer-park residents after a tornado, the
residents of Political America are sifting through the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Like natural disasters, this man-made one will leave a trail of
wounded and worse. It also will leave some to benefit from the
misfortune of others.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is: Who benefits most from the wreckage of a
hyperpartisan sex-and-lies scandal?
</P>
<P>
   How about a guy who preaches bipartisanship but can boast about
topping an unprecedented sweep for his party last year?
</P>
<P>
   How about a guy who bemoans the ``if it feels good, do it''
morals of the '60s but acknowledges enjoying a similar phase?
</P>
<P>
   How about a guy who can lay claim to the Washington outsider
label despite being a president's kid?
</P>
<P>
   Is this guy lucky or what?
</P>
<P>
   Critics say George W. Bush's luck began sometime around birth
when he began a life of privilege. His lucky streak certainly
continued when Bill met Monica.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the nonrunning front-runner, it all ads up to an
enviable position, according to political pros, professors and
practitioners who are becoming increasingly confident he will run
for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a crossroads in our system of government and faith
in our political system is at an all-time low,'' said the members
of Congress who last week formed the Draft Bush 2000 Committee.
``Governor Bush is the only one equipped to restore that faith in
our government institutions and our core American values through
his compassionate conservative beliefs and limited, constructive
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the impeachment fracas, Bush positioned himself just
beyond the fringe, damning Clinton's conduct but declining to say
whether it merited removal from office. Others in the presidential
race _ notably Dan Quayle and Steve Forbes _ sided with the
throw-the-bum-out crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Bush stuck with a safe line, potentially offensive only to the
farther-to-the-right Republicans who embraced the removal effort as
something of a holy war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's over with,'' he said Friday after Clinton was
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if acquittal was the right decision, Bush ducked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision was made. And that's the good news. It's off our
TV screens, hopefully, and we can look forward,'' he said, clinging
to a position of nonengagement that one Democratic critic predicted
will come back to haunt him in presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impeachment trial was begun by the radical right influence
in the Republican Party,'' said Texas Democratic Chairwoman Molly
Beth Malcolm, who does not believe Bush is presidential material.
``I hope Governor Bush is embarrassed how members of his own party
have acted. Those same radical righters don't trust George Bush,
and they are very likely to turn their hypocritical
self-righteousness on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a move evidencing no tolerance for anyone who didn't
side firmly with senators who voted to convict, Christian Coalition
Executive Director Randy Tate said acquittal meant ``children now
have the lesson that lying, cheating and breaking the law are
permissible on the pathway to success.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Bush backers believe the entire impeachment episode
will fade quickly from the public psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short run,'' said one, ``the Republicans are behind the
eight ball, because this is not a popular place to have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Opinsky _ an adviser to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the
only probable presidential candidate who cast a vote Friday _ said
it's too early to judge the effect on Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some time before people outside of Texas
have a clear understanding of what he stands for on a presidential
level,'' Opinsky said. ``I do think that character does still
count. People want a president they can be proud of. That's a
message that will be lasting out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky is sure that his guy _ who voted for conviction on both
the perjury and obstruction of justice articles _ passes moral
muster. But ``a lot of the Bush story is yet to be written,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush continues to decline to offer details of his ``young and
irresponsible'' past. He acknowledges drinking too much but won't
say if he used illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to talk about my private life,'' he said last
week. ``I said it's irrelevant to the future. I've made mistakes. I
learned from my mistakes, and it's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was, Bush insists it was nothing Clintonian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a loyal husband, a dedicated dad and a governor who
brought integrity to the office I've held,'' he said. ``People may
not agree with every decision I've made. I think they've agreed
universally that I've treated the office with respect and
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas Legislature, leaders from both parties said there
is no downside of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this helps Bush. He is well thought of. He has high
morals. He is a big family man, a real Christian,'' said Midland
Rep. Tom Craddick, a longtime leader of House Republicans. ``I
think the bottom line is: That's what the people really want.''
</P>
<P>
   Craddick said voters will be interested in candidates' personal
pasts _ not so much out of prurient interest but out of a desire to
avoid another prolonged event like Starr's Clinton inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a little difference between being married and
being single,'' Craddick said of the contrast between what Clinton
did and what Bush might have done.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Gallego of Alpine said
Bush scored points by steering clear of the fray, a move that
separates him from congressional Republicans, who ``will look like
they were interested in ostensibly a dirty little street fight that
didn't get anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the governor has really distanced himself from a lot
of that, and it wouldn't be a factor,'' said Gallego, who backs Al
Gore for the job but believes Bush would be a good president.
</P>
<P>
   From a vantage point near the border, political scientist Jerry
Polinard of the University of Texas-Pan American in Edinburg sees
Bush potentially benefiting from an electorate both forgiving and
eager to avoid examining personal foibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have a general expectation that whoever seeks
office will not bring the baggage Clinton brought with him. And we
are willing to forgive and forget things 20 years ago, maybe 10
years ago,'' Polinard said. ``When the people voted in '92, they
knew Clinton had a zipper problem. I don't think we're going to be
quite that generous in the upcoming cycle. We expect somebody of
decent character. Not a saint, but not someone who brings to the
table a background that raises serious questions.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, a state awaiting its first Bush sighting of
the season, political science professor Dale Kuehne of St. Anselm
College said he sees voters viewing the field with a new focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are looking for depth, somebody who can engage their
souls,'' Kuehne said. ``We've gone to a different level of
disillusionment from Watergate. The world has changed. It is not
enough to just not be Bill Clinton and to be against taxes. They
want somebody who can help them re-create a nation for the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who will pitch himself as that somebody if he gets into
the race, got the word on the Clinton acquittal Friday when he
walked into aide Joe Allbaugh's office, where a muted TV was tuned
in to history.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened?'' Bush asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got acquitted. Both articles,'' Allbaugh told Bush, who
showed no immediate reaction to the news that means he probably
would have to run against an incumbent vice president, not an
incumbent president, if he enters the race.
</P>
<P>
   Allbaugh, a veteran of three presidential campaigns and the kind
of dad not happy about having his 11-year-old daughter ask him
about oral sex, believes the country needs his boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be a great president. I hope he runs,'' Allbaugh
said. ``There is such a thirst for leadership. He understands the
definition of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   On other TVs around the country last week, another Texan with
intimate knowledge of how the governor's office works predicted
Allbaugh will get his wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is going to be the nominee because he's the only
one they've got,'' ex-Gov. Ann Richards, the woman who helped
launch Bush's political career, said on Larry King Live.

 &HT;    Border counties push for Marshall Plan
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas border counties have long come to Austin
with hat in hand, only to be neglected by legislators and pushed
around in the political trenches by more powerful regions. They
haven't helped things, they admit, by bickering among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But now border leaders say their infighting is over, they are
working together for the first time, and they are ready to crank up
their new unified voice in this year's legislative session as they
push for a Border Marshall Plan modeled after the U.S. effort to
rebuild Europe after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   This Marshall Plan, suggested by a powerful Republican state
senator, would build up the state's most disadvantaged area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle cry has to be 'It is our turn. It is our time,'''
state Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville, said at the coalition's
first meeting in November. ``I am tired of the border being treated
like we are a bad stepchild.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliveira spoke to a crowd of hundreds of border leaders packed
into an Austin hotel ballroom. The event took on the air of a pep
rally, as one speaker after another repeated their theme: Stick
together and we can win.
</P>
<P>
   The featured speakers were Gov. George W. Bush and the
lieutenant governor-elect, Rick Perry, giving his first speech
after the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the border region of the state of Texas succeeds, Texas
will succeed,'' Perry told the applauding crowd. ``You're going to
receive the credit, you're going to receive the attention, you're
going to receive the respect you deserve as long as I am lieutenant
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   On their way to sweeping statewide offices, the Republicans had
courted the Democratic strongholds on the border like never before.
And border leaders say the GOP's newfound interest in their growing
population is just one reason they believe the stars are lining up
in their favor as the Legislature begins its work again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no question that the focus is on the
border,'' said El Paso County Attorney Jose Rodriguez. ``Today I
think we're finally on the verge of breaking out of that status
we've been in. Our numbers are growing, the electoral power is
there, (state leaders) recognize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry and House Speaker Pete Laney obviously recognized it.
Laney put border lawmakers in charge of five committees, including
the powerful Ways and Means Committee that Oliveira chairs, and
border representatives also landed five seats on the powerful House
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, meanwhile, created the Special Committee on Border
Affairs, headed by Sen. Eddie Lucio (D-Brownsville).
</P>
<P>
   Before the session began, border leaders' most important move
was to bury old rivalries to form the Border Infrastructure
Coalition, which brought mayors and county judges and economic
development gurus to the same table to push a meat-and-potatoes
agenda in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The group wants a bigger chunk of state job training dollars to
help them attack unemployment rates that top 25 percent in places,
tax credits to reward businesses that create jobs on the border,
and a larger cut of state highway dollars to help them handle the
surge in cross-border traffic since the North American Free Trade
Agreement took effect five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They are trying to make the rest of the state realize that
what's good for the border is good for the rest of the state, that
a better-trained border labor pool means more companies moving to
Texas, that less congestion in Laredo means goods flow faster to
Austin and other cities to the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest battle is in the hearts and minds of Texans,''
said state Sen. Elliot Shapleigh (D-El Paso). ``Until Dallas, Dumas
and Denton see their picture in that border crossing and their
future economy in Mexican trade, we can't get the investment in
infrastructure and work force training.''
</P>
<P>
   They have found an important ally in a Waco Republican: Sen.
David Sibley, chairman of the Senate Economic Development
Committee, who toured several border areas after the last
legislative session to gather information for a report on the
state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley saw the area's nagging problems, but he also saw its
potential. And he said his visits convinced him that something had
to be done now: a border Marshall Plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an area of the state that's devastated, not by war but
by neglect,'' Sibley said. ``They don't need another program, they
don't need more welfare benefits down there. What they need is
infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibley said the state has to make a long-term commitment to the
border. Everything can't be done at once, he said, but if the state
injects steady investment in the right places _ job training and
highways being two good examples _ Sibley said the border ``has the
ability to be the leader in prosperity 20 to 30 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Laredo), one of the border lawmakers on
the House Appropriations Committee, said he and others hope to
funnel money to the border by changing the formulas that determine
how much goes where.
</P>
<P>
   By giving more weight to things like unemployment rates, welfare
dependency, education level and income, Cuellar said, the state
could make sure money gets to where it's needed most. That would
help not just border communities but also other struggling areas
across the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, members of the new coalition say they will keep
pressing. ``Too many times what happens is that they pit one of us
against another on the border,'' said Rep. Pete Gallego (D-Alpine).
``Not anymore. It's our turn.''

 &HT;    African-American oral history leaves behind powerful legacy
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _
</P>
<P>
   The Navy sent me back to Hampton, (Va.), where I became
personnel officer. I was the only black man within 500 miles in a
naval officer's uniform ... And a goodly number of those sailors
just didn't want it to happen, as evidenced by this young man who
walked up in front of my face in Newport News one day, my wife and
my daughter to my side, put his fingers to my face and said,``You
black son of a ... I never thought I'd see one of you, and I hope I
never see another one.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Centerville resident
</P>
<P>
   George Cooper, 82
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, not so long ago, when many black Americans
were discouraged or flat-out prevented from reading and writing.
When they died, they left behind no diaries or letters, no written
accounts of their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   But they did leave stories.
</P>
<P>
   Oral history, spoken memories passed through generations, left a
powerful legacy among blacks even after literacy became widespread.
It has produced the chronicles that never made it into textbooks,
recollections that form an identity.
</P>
<P>
   In acknowledgment of that tradition, the Dayton Daily News is
presenting the stories of four black octogenarians, told in their
own words. Over the next four days, they will share their
remembrances of the Depression, World War II and the civil rights
movement, as well as the quiet setbacks and victories of everyday
life.
</P>
<P>
   The series follows Centerville resident George Cooper, 82;
Jefferson Twp.'s Ellen Lee Jackson, 87; Yvonne Walker-Taylor, an 82
year-old Wilberforce resident; and Ned Wood, 85, of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper and Wood grew up in humble surroundings in the rigidly
segregated South. Walker-Taylor, the child of a minister, was
reared in middle-class comfort. Jackson spent much of her childhood
and later life on Dayton's west side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a wonderful thing to tell of your heritage, where
you were born and how you came along,'' said Jackson. ``I think
it's nice to let people know, because a lot of children now, they
don't realize how things were back in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Such personal tales have become a field of intense interest
among historians and other academics, who realize that immense
chunks of the past have yet to be unearthed. These missing pieces
can't be found in a library or a computer database. This history
lives only in people's minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of history doesn't tell the real story,'' said Sue
Taylor, an assistant professor of anthropology at Howard University
who has recorded oral histories since the 1970s. ``I think it's
extremely important to collect all that information before the
people are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Most cultures depend on memory to preserve their pasts, but few
have found it more vital than black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Slaves frequently were not permitted to learn to read or write.
Teaching them could be against the law. Even after emancipation,
discriminatory laws often kept segregated black schools in a dismal
state, if they existed at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't write, nor could you read in most cases. You were
forbidden to do that,'' said Marlese Durr, assistant professor of
sociology at Wright State University. ``The only way stories could
be passed down was orally. In retelling that story, you can
remember every nuance, every name.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, oral history sustained tales that many wanted to
forget.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 200 years, it was common wisdom among blacks that
Thomas Jefferson fathered children with his slave, Sally Hemings.
Most historians, depending heavily on written records, rejected
that belief.
</P>
<P>
   But last year genetic tests linked Jefferson with a descendent
of Hemings. The oral account, many converts now believe, was true.
</P>
<P>
   The case, however, also highlighted the weaknesses of oral
history. While the tests strengthened the account of Jefferson's
relationship with his slave, they also refuted one black family's
long-held claim that they were kin to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Yet overall, Durr said, academics are confident of the
definitiveness of oral history.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think it's pretty accurate, because some of the key
things are still there, such as names and dates,'' she said.
``There are usually two or three storytellers, so people can
authenticate it because the details are similar.''
</P>
<P>
   Recording the oral history of older relatives gained new
popularity after the 1977 television series, ``Roots,'' the
exploration of a black family's journey from slavery to freedom. It
remains a favorite tool among the history-minded in the Miami
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-1990s, Cityfolk, a traditional arts and music
organization, conceived the Dayton Stories Project, in which 1,200
people gathered in small clusters to share accounts of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two groups that we focused on were the Appalachian and
African-American communities initially,'' said Marilyn Shannon, who
headed the project. ``There are a lot of similarities between those
two communities. One is the oral tradition of passing down
knowledge through storytelling rather than written means.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Annie Bonaparte of the Innerwest Community Development
Corp. began an oral history project among the teen-agers and
seniors of West Dayton. It continues today.
</P>
<P>
   Bonaparte said the teens ask their elders about their lives,
discussing everything from their relationships with their parents
to the types of clothes they wore. The answers, she said, satisfy
more than curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about who they are, where they came from, pride and
dignity, and teaching our kids to remember,'' Bonaparte said.
``It's about respect. It's about all of those things we say we want
our kids to know.''

 &HT;    Drastic changes on horizon
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _
</P>
<P>
   Editor's Note: The following dialogues were culled from
extensive sit-down interviews with each individual. Reporter John
Keilman conducted the tape-recorded interviews and edited
dialogues. Extended versions of these interviews can be accessed by
visiting our online partner at www.activedayton.com
</P>
<P>
   THE STORY THUS FAR: George Cooper, after a childhood of
near-total segregation, has received a college degree and become a
sheet metal instructor in Wilberforce. Ellen Lee Jackson, who grew
up in West Dayton, has taken a job as a stock girl in a clothing
store, though her race has precluded her from the more prestigious
position of saleslady. Yvonne Walker-Taylor has received a master's
degree in English and returned to the Miami Valley, where she
helped desegregate a Xenia movie theater. Ned Wood, a young man
from rural Georgia, has moved to Dayton to take a job at
Frigidaire.
</P>
<P>
   But for everyone, life is about to change drastically. World War
II is under way.
</P>
<P>
   ELLEN LEE JACKSON: My husband went into the military, but he
only stayed three months because of his health. He didn't make it,
but the next two brothers under me went. Joseph W. Lee went into
the Air Force. He never went any farther than California. Wallace
Lee went into the Army and went to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Did he survive? Very much.
</P>
<P>
   YVONNE WALKER-TAYLOR: There were dozens of men I knew who were
drafted. Oh my God. All of my classmates, some of my ex-boyfriends
that I dated when I was in college. One of the students in the high
school went overseas today and tomorrow he dead. His first name was
Mark. Oh, there was sorrow around when Mark died.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE COOPER: I went back to Hampton, where we were training
metalsmiths for the Navy. By that point, I was old enough to
rationalize that if I worked in a defense industry, I was indeed
making a contribution to the country. And I would much prefer doing
that than to go into the service.
</P>
<P>
   I literally did not want to go in the service. I had an
impression that the service was very, very restrictive. And that
you had to do anything that they said to do. That sort of concept
just sort of rubbed me the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   I had gone to Hampton with the promise of being kept out of the
service. But while I was on this job, maybe a couple of years
later, the commanding officer said, ``I can't do any more. You've
got to go in. But you will not be sorry. As a matter of fact, I
think you might be pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   He never would tell me what he had in mind. What he had in mind
was officer candidate school.
</P>
<P>
   NED WOOD: I went to Fort Sill, Okla. I was in an artillery unit.
It was segregated. The Army was segregated all through the war. It
wasn't until the late 1940s that they integrated.
</P>
<P>
   We were treated fairly good. But they lured a lot of the blacks
into battle where they would be slaughtered, heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
   I was in the quartermaster service, though. We took supplies to
the fighting forces.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: I thought the men should enlist. I thought they should
go. I thought if you were an American you did what you were
supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: The white folks' war. That's what it was. That's
how it went down. But you still were struggling for recognition and
freedom; therefore, to do a Muhammad Ali was just out of the
question. You're not going to refuse to go. You're gonna go because
that's the way to prove that you're glad you're in America.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all of this did not make you sorry you were an American.
You're glad you're an American, but you just hated the fact that
the white folks never gave you a chance to participate in a good
life. You had to fight for everything.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: I don't know who made the detailed decisions, but they
made the decision that they would pull 16 guys out of the service,
from the ranks of the enlisted men, and send them up to Great
Lakes, Ill., and start them through officer training.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't really know what our orders said until we got there
and were in the barracks, and discovered that here we are, 16 black
guys, and were supposed to go into Officer Candidate School.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, there were approximately 100,000 black sailors.
The first night we were together, we said, ``Now, here we are.
We're here to be tried and tested. And what happens to us is going
to determine the fate of black participation at the officer level
for decades to come in the United States Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   We represented thousands of black sailors, each one of us did.
That's an awesome responsibility, if you take it seriously. If
George screws up, he ain't screwing up just for George. He's
screwing up for a hell of a lot of other people.
</P>
<P>
   Because the country as a whole didn't want it. Not just the
Navy, the country didn't want it. Because at that point in time, we
were still very much a segregated society.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: The war was just about over when we got there. We landed
in Liverpool on New Year's Eve, 1944. The Englishwomen met us. We
weren't supposed to go out because one of the soldiers died from
meningitis. We were supposed to be quarantined. We didn't pay
attention to that. We ran out of there.
</P>
<P>
   There was a man shortage, because most of the men between 18 and
45 were all in the service. The women didn't have any men, so they
were real vulnerable. We started keeping company with them.
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't have been a possibility in the South. No way, uh
uh. No. But it wasn't a hard transition. We were glad!
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: We did pretty well out here with the rationing. I
remember even getting nylons some way and those were key items. I
think our dietary demands precluded any suffering or want. We ate
things that white folks didn't like most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: We pledged that we would either sink or swim together.
We were going to make the damn thing work, or we would all fail
together. There were 16 of us in the class. They commissioned 12 of
us and made one a warrant officer.
</P>
<P>
   It hurt him so that he didn't make it, until a year later he
committed suicide. He didn't make it because of grades. The other
three, nobody knows why they didn't make it. We have finally
decided amongst ourselves that the Navy intended to do 12. They
said, ``We'll put 16 in and four will drop out.'' And when the four
didn't drop out, they stuck with the 12.
</P>
<P>
   The commanding officer at Great Lakes at that time was a General
Armstrong, who was the son of the founder of Hampton Institute,
where I had went to college, and obviously had ties to the
institution. Under normal circumstances, when a class would go
through training, you'd have a commencement exercise, the whole 9
yards. We never had that. We were called in individually, and
handed our certificates over a desk from the CO. and a handshake,
then back to the barracks where you get your orders.
</P>
<P>
   So I walked in and he said, ``Cooper, you're what we call a
hell-raiser in the Navy.'' I said, ``Sir, I haven't even been on
report since I've been in the Navy. I don't understand what you're
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, don't you remember in your young life you getting in a
fight with a white boy down in Washington, N.C.?''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``Yes, sir. If that's what you call being a hell-raiser,
I'm a hell raiser. He called me a nigger on the wrong day, and we
went at it.''
</P>
<P>
   That obviously had to be someplace in the record, in my
personnel folder. Because the FBI, we subsequently discovered, went
back to the time each of the 16 of us were born. The FBI had
records on us that were half a book.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think what was in his mind ever adversely affected me in
the service, because we were immediately transferred out of there,
and each of us went our separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: I just loaded and unloaded trucks. Most of the time I rode
with the driver. I was his helper. I didn't do much loading or
unloading. I was kind of slick.
</P>
<P>
   One part of England we were stationed in was called Birmingham.
The white soldiers, they wanted the pubs to be segregated. They
didn't want the blacks in the same one they were in. So one of the
guys came back to camp and told the sergeant, and the sergeant blew
the whistle and called everyone out to attention. He told us,
``Right face and forward march,'' and we marched down to the pub.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much of a fight. One Southern guy said, ``You know,
if we were down home we wouldn't be in the same place.'' This guy
grabbed him by the collar and said, ``You're not down home now!''
</P>
<P>
   Pow! He hit him and the guy slid down, like a snake sliding down
on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the pub was going through with the segregation. It
was an exclusive place with music and dancing and microphones. He
suggested that we go upstairs and the white soldiers stay
downstairs. We went upstairs and got on that microphone and started
crooning. All the women came up to where we were, left the white
soldiers down there.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: The Navy sent me back to Hampton, where I became
personnel officer. I was the only black man within 500 miles in a
naval officer's uniform. If you are familiar with Tidewater, Va.,
it's nothing but Navy. They build the ships in Newport News, which
is right around the corner. The Norfolk Naval Base is right across
the water. Everywhere you go, there's Navy. So a black officer in
that situation stuck out like a sore thumb, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   And now, as always, there are good people and bad people in this
world. Decent people and not so decent people in this world. And a
goodly number of those sailors just didn't want it to happen, as
evidenced by this young man who walked up in front of my face in
Newport News one day, my wife and my daughter to my side, put his
fingers to my face and said, ``I never thought I'd see one of you,
and I hope I never see another one.''
</P>
<P>
   He was going to beat me or I was going to beat him that day,
because he said this in front of my wife and baby. But Peg put her
hands on my shoulder and said, ``George, it's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: After we went to France, they took us way out to rest up.
We were supposed to get rested up and get ready to go to Japan. We
were supposed to go to the Pacific. But instead of us resting, we
went to Paris. I was in Europe nine months.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: I got married in 1941. My husband was
substituting in the Air Force. I went down to Tuskegee with him in
1941.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the 332nd and he did 61 missions over Italy
and all of that good stuff. We were right on the military base. We
had these long, connected houses and maids that came in and
cleaned. He was a captain, a real big shot, you know, and we had
everything that you could want to eat from the PX.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: As personnel officer, I had to sign your leave request,
whether it's normal, sick, whatever. If I had trouble with you on
the base, I had the authority to call you in for captain's mast.
That's where you are brought on the carpet. We raise hell with you
and hand out punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But I would say to one of my yeomen in the personnel office,
``When John gets ready to go on leave, for whatever reason, you
send him in to see me.'' And I would bring you into my office like
we're talking here now, with the idea in mind that by the time you
left my office, you would perceive of me as being a human being and
not a black son-of-a-bitch. It worked most of the time. I'm sure it
did not work all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: When the war ended, a few people felt things were
going to change for black people, but the average person knew
better. They knew that that wasn't going to do it because when our
fellows came back, the prejudice was just as great to the black men
in uniform as it was to the black men not in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: You could get jobs more often at that time. And there
was a lot of black people that had businesses on Fifth Street.
There was a lot of restaurants and clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Things were better there after the war.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: When my husband got out of the war, we moved to
Boston. Then I lived in Europe for a year, lived in Germany. That's
where he was stationed.
</P>
<P>
   I left Germany in 1953 or 1954 and went back to Boston. Then, my
father died in 1955 and I was about to divorce this guy anyhow. So
we got a divorce and I moved back to Wilberforce to be with my
mother. She was in a house by herself.
</P>
<P>
   Then I started teaching in the college.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: When we got back to the states, we had 60 days to go back
to work. I went back to General Motors/Frigidaire, where I had been
working before.
</P>
<P>
   They interviewed me and I had gotten everything but the ID. A
guy told me, ``You can have the same job, same rate.'' Seventy-nine
cents. That was top pay. I said I'd be back tomorrow. I didn't even
get my ID.
</P>
<P>
   So I left and went to Universal Inn and started working for 95
cents an hour. In 30 days, I got another 10 cent raise.
</P>
<P>
   They went on strike at Frigidaire very soon after that.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: We stopped through Dayton and made a headquarters here
with some friends. I was questioning about what he did for a
living, because he was really living well. He said, ``Well, if you
really want to know, get up in the morning and come to work with
us.'' I did that. What we did was go in and clean a house.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fairly big-size house. We washed all the walls, the
woodwork, the carpet, the whole house, in one day.
</P>
<P>
   When we come back home, we were sitting around the table having
dinner, and he said, ``I'll make you a proposition. If you come out
here, we'll work together, and I'll sell you half of this
business.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point in time, my thinking was beginning to tell me that
in higher education we were doing more in the business of teaching
people how to make a living than teaching them how to live. I was
disgusted to the point that I said, ``This may be an opportunity
for me to get out of education.''
</P>
<P>
   I took a half-year's leave of absence from Hampton Institute and
came to work with my friend. And I never left.

 &HT;    Search for Ohio 9-year-old continues
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The donut shop was open, but there was no sign of
a waitress.
</P>
<P>
   A concerned customer phoned police, and thus began the search in
1971 for 20-year-old Leorra Rose Looney of Lakewood, Colo. Her nude
body was found three days later, dumped in a field. She had been
raped, strangled and shot.
</P>
<P>
   The murder remained unsolved for several years, until a
thumbprint lifted from a coffee cup in the donut shop ultimately
put her killers, Sherman McCrary and Carl Taylor, in prison.
</P>
<P>
   That case taught a young cop named James O'Dell how to run a
methodical investigation over the long haul. Today, as Kettering
police chief, O'Dell said he's trying to apply the same principles
to the probe into the disappearance a week ago today of 9-year-old
Erica Baker.
</P>
<P>
   While Erica's fate remains unknown, O'Dell sees parallels with
the investigation of Looney's death.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, O'Dell was a young officer whose mentor was
then Lakewood Police Chief Pierce Brooks, the famed detective who
had previously cracked the brutal Los Angeles cop killing
chronicled in Joseph Wambaugh's 1973 book ``The Onion Field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The message to me from Chief Brooks (in the Looney case) was
`leave no stone unturned,''' O'Dell said in an interview Friday
with the Dayton Daily News. ``That's what we've tried to do here
(in Erica's case) _ be very purposeful, patient, exact.''
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's conclusion of the exhaustive but fruitless
five-day search for Erica by members of the Miami Valley Urban
Search and Rescue Task Force, police are ``switching into a
full-gear investigative mode,'' O'Dell said. By Friday, Kettering
police had already logged 1,200 manhours on the case and checked
700 leads. They are now prioritizing and checking the hundreds of
leads that remain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite hundreds of calls to a tip line, police acknowledge they
still have no physical evidence or eyewitness accounts to help them
find Erica, who vanished about 4 or 4:30 p.m. last Sunday. She was
last seen walking her dog near the retention pond behind the
Kettering Recreation Complex by a couple who later found the dog
dragging his leash outside of nearby Kettering Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   Erica, a third-grader at Indian Riffle Elementary School, and
her brothers had returned home from a weekend visit with their
father, Greg Baker, 33, of Huber Heights, at about 3 p.m. Her
mother, Melissa ``Misty'' Baker, 31, of Kettering, agreed to let
her walk the dog about 3:30. Misty Baker said she grew worried when
Erica didn't return after a couple of hours. She reported the girl
missing about 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dell decided to go to the scene personally when he learned of
the situation about an hour later. It didn't sound like a runaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case when I heard her age and there was a dog with
her, bells started going off,'' O'Dell said. ``I said, 'I'm going
on this one.'''
</P>
<P>
   There were 50 or 60 citizens on the scene who wanted to help.
``People want to help. If you don't give them something to do,
they'll do it themselves,'' O'Dell said. Despite ``tremendously
good intentions,'' he said, volunteers can divert police attention
from immediate investigative tasks. Volunteers eventually were
enlisted to circulate fliers about Erica's disappearance to homes
and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Kettering police Capt. David Woolf, who is in charge of
day-to-day operations in the investigation, said officials didn't
want civilians _ or even police who weren't specially trained in
search-and-rescue techniques _ to join in the search, because they
didn't want to risk tainting a crime scene or overlooking anything
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only get one shot at this,'' Woolf said. ``It's very
heartwarming to see our community coming together, but we wanted to
get a highly experienced team.''
</P>
<P>
   After an initial search last Sunday night by local police and
fire officials, the Miami Valley Urban Search and Rescue Task Force
took over the search Monday morning. Officials decided to drain the
retention pond, fearing Erica may have fallen in.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kettering pond yielded nothing, and the search spread
out to cover targeted areas _ woods, fields, old barns and
outbuildings _ in a 150-square-mile area in a seven-mile radius of
the recreation complex. Up to 100 specialists from as far away as
Cleveland joined the search throughout the week, along with 16
canine units, rangers on horseback and helicopter crews. Rangers
also searched the Five Rivers MetroParks' Germantown Reserve, after
park maintenance crews found a Winnie the Pooh sweatshirt
resembling the one Erica wore when she disappeared. The family said
the shirt was not Erica's and Friday's search of the park turned up
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Kettering's 20 detectives are being augmented by 30 or so
detectives from the Dayton, Centerville and Beavercreek police in
checking leads. O'Dell said police departments from the Miami
Valley and beyond have offered assistance. ``This is kind of like
when there's a death in the family and the neighbors call and ask
if they can bring food.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Dell even called the South Carolina cop who served as
spokesman during the Susan Smith case, for advice on how to deal
with the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Just last August, O'Dell attended a seminar on missing children
sponsored by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children
in Washington, D.C., which outlined investigative protocols and
suspect profiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting there last August thinking, `Never in Kettering,
Ohio,''' O'Dell said. ``Lo and behold, here it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The seminar stressed the importance of quick action when a child
goes missing _ ``it's key to have the mindset of `time is our
enemy,''' O'Dell said. ``The more time that goes by, the less
chance the person will be returned safely.''
</P>
<P>
   National statistics show children often know their abductors.
Police spokesmen have said Erica's relatives have been cooperative
and are not suspected in her disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Dell said ``the rule of good investigation is, everybody's
a suspect. I like the words President Reagan used for
investigations: Trust, but verify.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he's still hoping police will get a tip that will solve
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most crimes are solved,'' he said, ``not by brilliant police
work, but because somebody for whatever reason _ courage, fear,
guilt _ comes forward with information.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Christmas was still six days away, but the holiday
mood evaporated on Dec. 19 for Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, as she
watched the House of Representatives vote to impeach President
Clinton. From her coastal home in Falmouth, she felt a sense of
foreboding as she viewed the vicious partisan brawling that
preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that Christmas was over that day,'' Ms. Snowe, a
moderate, recalled on Friday after the Senate, and she herself, had
found Clinton not guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice. She
knew, too, that the Senate could not allow such a spectacle in its
dignified chambers.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers and top political advisers were also in
a grim mood on Dec. 19 as they gathered in the office of John
Podesta, the White House chief of staff. They were anticipating the
vote that day that would mark Clinton forever as only the second
American president to be impeached, and they were determined to
make a new assault on the charges. But they were not prepared for
the bombshell that came first: the announcement that Rep. Robert
Livingston, R-La., who was the Speaker-designate, was leaving the
House because of reports of marital infidelities, and that
Livingston was urging the president to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked,'' said one senior member of the president's
legal team who was present as the group fell silent. ``I felt,
Jesus, we're at a point where we're eating our own. It genuinely
scared me. I was shaking. The whole thing seemed to me to be very,
very mean and very unstable.''
</P>
<P>
   The third set of actors in the Senate drama _ the 13 House
managers who presented the case against the president _ were in a
different mood over the holiday season. Just before New Year's,
they gathered in the Judiciary Committee conference room, called
``the War Room,'' to plan the prosecution. They were almost giddy
about the new role as prosecutors as they pictured a full trial
with witnesses galore, fiery cross-examinations and, finally, the
removal of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The three major players had differing objectives going into the
trial, and all achieved some of their goals. The senators, who
wanted a short and dignified trial, emerged less bloodied by the
five-week proceeding than the House. The president, after his
lawyers made a far more aggressive defense than they did in the
House, was acquitted by a wide margin but hardly vindicated. And
the managers made their defiant stand for principle but gained not
even a simple majority for their charges and did little to repair
the image of House Republicans as hellbent on embarrassing the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The House prosecution team walked away with the fewest spoils.
Their wish list of witnesses was whittled down to three _ Monica
Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal
</P>
<P>
   None of the actors could claim victory after 13 months of
revelation and public revulsion. But the Constitution bore up well
under the strain, and the president and congressional leaders vowed
to try to forget the agony and the anger of the journey just ended.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a brief Rose Garden statement on Friday, called for
a time of ``reconciliation and renewal for America'' and indicated
he was prepared to forgive those who tried to get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, members traded congratulations on the floor and
said the trial might even have strengthened the institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we preserved the dignity of the Senate,'' said Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who voted to convict Clinton on both
impeachment charges. ``It ended as the founders intended it to.''
</P>
<P>
   Gathered with his prosecution team in the House Judiciary
Committee hearing room where the impeachment proceedings began last
fall, Henry Hyde, R-Ill., was bowed but not resentful. ``I have no
regrets,'' he said quietly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   GOING TO TRIAL
</P>
<P>
   The telephone calls from jittery senators, haunted by the House
impeachment proceedings, followed Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., everywhere during the Christmas break. His cell
phone rang in the middle of the Cotton Bowl, where he sat with Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, at his side. It rang as he bounced
his baby granddaughter on his knee at his son's house. It rang in
the car, in the office and at home in Pascagoula, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Lott spoke so often to Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle,
D-S.D., that the two practically had a hot line.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators insisted to Lott that they wanted a short trial
with no witnesses. Others wanted a full trial with live testimony.
All of them fretted about the impact on the Senate, and they
wondered if they could trust one another _ Republicans and
Democrats _ to keep it civilized.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., called an old friend, Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., and one of Lott's confidants, who was heading to
Hawaii with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you say anything, I know why you called,'' Lieberman
remembers Gorton saying. ``I was about to call you for the same
reason. We have got to start talking about how the Senate handles
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation was the genesis of a plan that would set the
tone of cooperation that Lott and Daschle hoped to establish.
</P>
<P>
   The details were in flux, but almost everyone agreed on the
goal: preserving the dignity of the Senate. Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky., said, ``Having a sense that the outcome was not in doubt, it
fell in two categories: Honor the Constitution and do as little
damage to the institution as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lieberman-Gorton dialogue had the quiet assent of Republican
and Democratic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The two, who talked five times a day over the holidays,
fashioned a plan that could perhaps avert a final vote on the
articles of impeachment by taking a test vote on the charges and
the evidence. The idea appealed to Lott, who found the thought of a
long trial with a slew of witnesses distasteful. ``He is a
realist,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate conservatives furiously rejected the proposal, and by
the time the new Senate reconvened the first week in January, the
plan was nearly doomed.
</P>
<P>
   At the first Republican caucus, conservatives refused to curtail
the trial in any way. ``People wanted a final vote on the articles,
even if it was a losing vote,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The trial would proceed, but first the two sides had to agree on
a framework.
</P>
<P>
   On. Jan. 7, a Thursday, Lott, Daschle and their lawyers tried to
work out a plan, but it foundered on the question of witnesses.
Republicans wanted the right to summon witnesses; Democrats wanted
none, or at most a sharply limited number.
</P>
<P>
   The next day 100 Democrats and Republican gathered in a
bipartisan caucus behind the closed doors of the ornate Old Senate
Chamber to salvage the process. Republicans were hoping the meeting
would soften Democrats, especially Daschle. Democrats were hoping
the conservative hard-liners would be moved by the history of the
moment and agree to their plan.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until the very end of the caucus that a
breakthrough occurred.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the two sides discuss their proposals for the
trial, Gramm stood up and called the two plans identical except for
the differences over witnesses. ``I rise today not as Massachusetts
man, or as a New Englander, but as American,'' Gramm said, quoting
Daniel Webster. He suggested that the Senate proceed with the
trial, postponing the question of which witnesses to call and how
many.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   With the liberal and the conservative in agreement, Lott seized
the moment. ``Let's put it in writing,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, in effect, put off the difficult question of witnesses
and began the historic proceeding with a 100-0 vote on procedure.
It was to be the last unanimous vote of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   DEALING WITH IMPEACHMENT
</P>
<P>
   As they sat that December morning in Podesta's office, the
president's men decided that something had to be done, and quickly,
to stop what they feared might become an avalanche of calls for
Clinton to follow the lead of Livingston and resign, as he had
himself suggested in his stunning remarks on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, bolted into the
Oval Office and asked the president what he wanted to say.
According to Lockhart's handwritten notes of the conversation,
Clinton wanted his spokesman to immediately issue a statement
urging Livingston to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a decent guy and doesn't deserve it,'' Lockhart remembers
the president's saying to him about Livingston. ``The politics of
personal destruction has to stop here,'' the president added.
</P>
<P>
   The shock waves of the Livingston resignation spread far beyond
the West Wing of the White House, and had a sobering effect on
members of Congress of both parties who might have been
contemplating calling for Clinton to step down in the aftermath of
the impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of the entire government unraveling, very few members of
Congress joined a clamor for Clinton's resignation. The president
had dodged one of the most potentially hazardous moments of the
entire impeachment battle.
</P>
<P>
   But still the trial lay ahead. Clinton's lawyers regrouped after
the impeachment vote and began to plot a strategy for defeating the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   There was agreement within both the legal and political councils
of the White House that they had botched the handling of the House
debate, underestimating the resolve of House Republicans and giving
insufficient attention to answering the legal charges raised by
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   They vowed not to make that mistake again before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we thought going into the trial was that we had to
aggressively make the case that the charges brought by the House
managers were a house of cards, and that's exactly what we did,''
said one senior White House official.
</P>
<P>
   THE WAR ROOM
</P>
<P>
   Although almost everyone in Washington was predicting that it
would be impossible to garner a two-thirds majority in the Senate
to convict the president, Hyde, who led the 13 House prosecutors,
had confidence in their case.
</P>
<P>
   He was less certain, however, of getting his way in the
notoriously self-important Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were entering alien territory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate did not want salacious testimony brought to its
hallowed chamber, the managers well knew. While the article of
impeachment charging the president with perjury was mired in the
lurid details of who touched whom and where, the managers, led by
Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., saw greater promise in the obstruction
case, the impeachment article that had drawn a weaker vote from
their House colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   They had hoped to call 15 to 18 witnesses, a roster that
included the stars as well as the bit players: The videographer who
had taped the president's deposition in the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct lawsuit, an expert on sexual harassment, Secret Service
agents, a judge and even Dick Morris, the sometime presidential
adviser. ``We were being very generous in those days,'' Rep. Ed
Bryant, R-Tenn., recalled wistfully in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   But word came, indirectly and almost immediately, that Lott was
unenthusiastic about witnesses. He was even considering ending the
trial before a vote on the final articles, an idea being floated in
his caucus.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   HANDS OFF BY THE WHITE HOUSE
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the trial, Daschle kept the White House informed of
his strategy for handling the proceeding and keeping Democrats
united, but did not seek advice from the president or his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   He made it clear to Clinton that he should keep his distance
because any heavy-handed efforts to lobby senators would be seen as
tampering with the jury and would surely backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made mention of the fact at some point that I didn't want
calls made to senators,'' Daschle said on Friday. ``I just felt
there had to be some separation here and that lobbying in this case
would be unseemly, and they respected that. I don't know of one
call that the White House made to one senator.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they took Daschle's advice and
deliberately avoided inserting themselves into Senate
deliberations. But there was a constant stream of contacts between
top White House political aides under the direction of Steve
Ricchetti, the deputy chief of staff, and Daschle and his aides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also spoke frequently with a handful of Democratic
senators to ``take their pulse,'' as one aide put it. Clinton's
closest contacts were with Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey,
Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa and
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president wasn't disengaged or oblivious,'' a senior White
House staffer said. ``Everyone knew what he thought and wanted.
This wasn't a blind date. But everyone knew this was out of our
control. We were at best in the back seat with someone else
driving.''

 &HT;    Little E takes 14th after metal-twisting weekend
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ We interrupt this all-Earnhardt weekend
for a Little E update. Dale Earnhardt Jr. made it to his hauler
Saturday afternoon without crashing into anything.
</P>
<P>
   He'd already done enough damage out on the track and pit road.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend so far dominated by his father, Dale Sr., Little
E seemed to have trouble staying out of the way of his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, he opened defense of his Busch Grand National
points championship with a 14th place finish in the Napa Auto Parts
300 at Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   His car was damaged when he was caught up in the second accident
of the day on lap 78 that involved eight wildly-spinning cars. His
bigger problem was the car's transmission, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sat back early in the race, riding in the back just staying
out of trouble,'' Earnhardt said. ''We missed a couple of wrecks by
doing that. Then everytime we'd get our track position like we
needed, the thing wouldn't go into third gear. So we'd lose a lot
of spots on restarts. That was disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We finally got up to second, and the 35 (Lyndon Amick) car
broke a tranny or missed a shift and paused for a moment. I tried
to keep from hitting him. I got into him a little bit, didn't spin
him out, but the 44 (Terry Labonte) had nowhere to go and he punted
me and turned me around. I didn't think we got hit hard right there
at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Little E spent the weekend listening to the sound of metal
twisting. He crashed early on Friday and was eliminated from the
IROC race, prompting his father to say, ''It looked like to me his
plan was to run wide open until he hit something.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in the last Busch practice Friday, Little E bumped into
Curtis Markham on pit road, causing enough damage to his car to
require a backup.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went off into the corner and Michael Waltrip was pulling
out of the pits or was riding real slow, waiting on the pack. I
thought I could go between him and the guy in the 29 car. The 29
car wasn't abreast of the situation so I probably shouldn't have
stuck my nose in there. I should have backed off. I mean, it's
practice. We had a fast race car. We probably shouldn't have even
been on the race track. It's just a mistake on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides he knows a good body shop. Long as my guys don't mind
fixing them,'' Earnhardt said, ''I don't mind getting in there.''
</P>
<P>
   CASEY GETS BATTERED
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Casey Atwood won't forget his first Busch car race, after
wrecking and tumbling upside down on the last lap.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure it wasn't a big deal,'' Atwood said. ''I was just
trying to stay right behind (Randy) LaJoie and get a good run and
wait for the last lap. We come out of (turn) 4 and I'm sure he
(Andy Hillenberg) was just trying to push me along. You bump draft
a little here, and he kind of caught it the wrong way and turned me
sideways. I felt myself sliding on the roof for a little while and
then it tumbled back up and took a few more hits. I'm just real
happy nobody hit me when I was upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   A FAMILY TRADITION
</P>
<P>
   Adam Petty didn't duplicate his father Kyle's feat of winning
his first Busch race. But Adam's sixth-place finish was impressive
enough, considering he started 21st and challenged for the lead in
the last five laps.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had to race at this place every weekend I don't know if
I'd be a race car driver,'' Petty said. ''It gets pretty hairy
sometimes going three wide up there in turn 3 and coming out of
there in turn 4, it gets kind of tight. The good lord was with us
all day long, kept us safe and we're heading to Rockingham, man.''
</P>
<P>
   A LITTLE SPEED
</P>
<P>
   Chad Little's No. 97 Ford recorded the fastest lap, 46.789
seconds or 192.353 mph, in the final Winston Cup practice Saturday
for today's Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Labonte was second at 192.217, Bobby Hamilton third at
192.189, Steve Park fourth at 192.168 and Jeremy Mayfield fifth
fastest at 191.706. Pole-sitter was 10th fastest at 191.233.
Earnhardt's final practice best was 14th at 191.115.
</P>
<P>
   A POPULAR PICK
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt seems to be a popular choice in the garage area to win
today's race. Earnhardt had a stellar Speed Weeks, finishing 10th
in last week's first-round qualifying and then winning both
Thursday's Gatorade 125-mile qualifying race and Friday's IROC
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say Earnhardt is the guy to beat,'' owner Larry McClure
said. ``He wins the 125, the Clash and IROC or whatever he gets
into, (but) then he stumbles in the 500. Last year was different.
He's a strong horse again.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Earnhardt also is the favorite of his owner,
Richard Childress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale is my favorite pick,'' Childress said. ``We've got one of
the very best race cars we've ever brought down here. We've got a
car we haven't had to touch or work with a lot. I feel like if we
can get a little bit of luck to go with it, we can win
back-to-back.''
</P>
<P>
   Added driver Sterling Marlin: ``The No. 3 car (Earnhardt's) is
the favorite. His stuff will fly. I'll be he's got 20 more
horsepower than the closest guy to him. His stuff runs good. His
car drives good and he has more power than anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte also says Earnhardt's black Monte Carlo is the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Earnhardt is the favorite for Sunday,'' Labonte said.
``He was the quickest that I practiced with out there by a long
shot. I think he's got the fastest car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``LET'S GET IT ON!''
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre was the grand marshal
of Saturday's Busch race. Rather than using the traditional,
``Gentlemen, start your engines,'' he screamed, ``Gentlemen, let's
get it on!''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first race, and I'm already finding out how big
this whole NASCAR circuit is,'' Favre said. ``Growing up in
Mississippi, I always thought that football was No. 1, but when
people found out I was starting the Daytona 500, no one wanted to
talk about Super Bowls or how we were going to do next year. They
wanted to talk about how I could get them tickets to get in the
pits.''
</P>
<P>
   Favre, the honorary starter for today's race, will join driver
Dale Jarrett in owning a Busch Grand National team, to be driven in
selected races by Kenny Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the garage were Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Derrick
Thomas and NFL Hall of Famer Jim Brown, who will join Willie Lanier
and Bill Futterer in forming Celebrity Motorsports, a group that
plans to enter Winston Cup racing in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Cubs third baseman Gary Gaetti, who owns a Busch team
with major-league players Pete Schourek, Hal Morris and Andy Benes,
also was in attendance. Their car, driven by Bobby Hillin Jr.,
finished fifth.
</P>
<P>
   SUPERSTITIONS
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's lucky penny glued to the dashboard _ he got it from
a little girl in a wheelchair last year during a Make-A-Wish
Foundation benefit, and then went out and won his first Daytona 500
_ isn't the only superstition on race day.
</P>
<P>
   Childress won't carry any $50 bills in his wallet on race day,
and he doesn't eat peanuts on pit row. Larry McReynolds, crew chief
for Mike Skinner and the No. 31 car, once got a ``lucky'' acorn
from his daughter, which he kept in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept that acorn the rest of the year until it was pretty
much nothing but crumbs,'' McReynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   Car owner Robert Yates tries to find the same parking space at a
track if his car won there the year before, and he never backs his
car into a parking space.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said if you're backing in, all you're worried about is
leaving and I don't plan on leaving early,'' McReynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like driver Labonte, don't believe in superstitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought this new Brickyard 400 Monte Carlo pace car,''
Labonte said. ``I picked it up and got it back to the shock and
somebody asked me what number it was. I couldn't find the number,
but when I looked on the dash, it was No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left the next day to go to Richmond (Va.) and ended up
winning the race, so I knew then there wasn't anything to this
superstition stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   LUCKY FOURS
</P>
<P>
   McClure, owner of the No. 4 Chevrolet of Bobby Hamilton, likes
his luck going into today's race. Morgan-McClure has already had
three Daytona 500 wins _ Ernie Irvan (1991) and Marlin (`94 and
`95).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won it with Irvan and it was the second race he'd won,''
McClure said. ``We won it with Sterling and it was the first race
he'd won. Now, we're going to win it with Bobby. He's won three
races, two (at) Rockingham and one (at) Phoenix. So he's going for
his fourth win in the No. 4 car and we're going for our fourth
Daytona 500.

<P>
   WITNESSES
</P>
<P>
   For the trial to be legitimate, the House managers insisted,
there had to be witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing the managers' case for witnesses at a bipartisan meeting
in one of Lott's suites, Hyde offered numbers from ``15 to 18.''
Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., remembers feeling his jaw drop,
especially when the managers mentioned that they were thinking of
calling the five Jane Does _ women linked to the president whose
uncorroborated stories were not part of the public impeachment
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us in private thought it was even remotely possible to
do this,'' Biden said. His Republican colleagues agreed, for the
most part, and sent word to Lott.
</P>
<P>
   A second meeting followed, this time exclusively Republican, to
hammer home the point. Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, Sen. Arlen Specter
of Pennsylvania and Sen. Mike DeWine of Ohio subtly suggested a
pared-back list.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson, one of the House managers, said the senators had a
firm position: ``You can ask for whatever witnesses that you want
to, but you are going to lose votes with some of the moderates if
you have an expanded list,'' Hutchinson recalls being told by
Senate colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The magic figure, Hyde said, boiled down to the famous ``pitiful
three.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif., angrily suggested a protest: Why
didn't they just walk out of the Senate chamber, their legal pads
and files under their arms? He was talked out of it. Other members
were upset, briefly, with Hyde, believing that he had acquiesced
too easily to the Senate's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   But as the managers debated who should make the final cut,
Senate Republicans privately worried whether any of the witnesses
would serve the House well.
</P>
<P>
   The first interview with Ms. Lewinsky was a success of a sort,
said Bryant, who had been chosen to preview her testimony because
he ``could be her father.'' Bryant found her chatty, open and
blunt. The prosecutors decided to depose her.
</P>
<P>
   But she was not nearly as open the second time around. She
measured her words carefully. Her lawyers nudged her when they
wanted her to clam up, Hyde said. ``I realized very quickly in the
deposition that it wasn't going to happen,'' he said. ``She didn't
tell her story like she could have.''
</P>
<P>
   After the constrained and careful testimony of Jordan and
Blumenthal, any hope for live witnesses vanished. The Senate had
seen the videotapes. They did not want to see anymore.
</P>
<P>
   THE LEGAL STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers saw their task was not simply to plant
reasonable doubt in the minds of the Senate jury, but to undermine
what one White House official called the ``unreasonable certitude''
of the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   And the lawyers did so, in excruciating and sometimes tedious
detail, pointing out the House managers' mischaracterization of
testimony or logical fallacies. David Kendall, the president's lead
private lawyer, obliterated one of the prosecutors' assertions when
he demonstrated that Jordan could not have taken steps to further
Ms. Lewinsky's job search after learning of his appearance on the
witness list for the Jones suit against the president. As Kendall
informed the Senate with delight, ``Mr. Jordan was high over the
Atlantic in an airplane on his way to Amsterdam'' when a federal
judge entered an order allowing Ms. Lewinsky to be called as a
witness and could therefore not have been aware of her status.
</P>
<P>
   But the impeachment trial was never solely about facts and dates
and inconsistent memories. It was a supremely political event as
well, and the White House had to manage that aspect of the case
while not appearing to be tampering with the president's jury.
</P>
<P>
   A pivotal moment came on Friday, Jan. 22. Lanny Breuer, a lawyer
in the White House counsel's office who has been one of the central
figures in the president's defense, was seated at the defense table
on the floor of the Senate when Lawrence Stein, the White House's
chief legislative lobbyist, slipped into the chamber and handed him
a note.
</P>
<P>
   The news was almost too good to be believed: Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., the influential custodian of Senate history and no friend
of Clinton's, was going to sponsor a motion to dismiss the
impeachment charges. Byrd had not earlier indicated how he would
vote on the charges. Byrd's defection would be a disaster for
Clinton; with his support for dropping the charges, the Democratic
front against conviction would remain solid.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer passed on the note to his colleagues at the defense table
_ Charles F.C. Ruff, Greg Craig, Nicole Seligman, Cheryl Mills and
Kendall. There were smiles of silent satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the beginning of the end,'' a senior White House
official said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it was. Although the Byrd motion failed on a 54-46 vote
on Jan. 27, only one Democrat voted with the Republicans. It was
certain from that point forward that the Republicans would never
amass the 67 votes necessary to convict Clinton and remove him from
office.
</P>
<P>
   THE TURNING POINT
</P>
<P>
   To greater and lesser degrees, the three sides in the historic
impeachment trial _ the Senate, the House prosecutors and the White
House _ accomplished their missions.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, which never wanted an impeachment trial, was not
riven by bitter partisanship, like the House, thanks largely to
Lott's and Daschle's willingness to talk and compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that on occasions, I did some things that I
thought were fair to help him,'' Lott said, ``and I tell you that
he did some things for me that he didn't have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who held a last news conference in the Judiciary Committee
hearing room dominated by his oil portrait, said the House managers
had carried out their constitutional duty, even as most of America
wished they would go away.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the White House got what it wanted, a clean verdict
of not guilty. The president's lawyers had once feared that the
three witnesses would lead to their darkest nightmare, a trial of
months. But Daschle's ability two weeks ago to secure an agreement
with Lott that calling any new witnesses would require bipartisan
support had virtually assured the witness list would end at three.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lott-Daschle compromise showed that there wouldn't be any
new witnesses,'' a White House lawyer said. ``That was a huge
moment for us, a major turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, announcing the agreement on witnesses, said that the trial
would conclude no later than Friday, Feb. 12, ``barring some
bolt-of-lightning discovery that we don't now see.'' Lightning did
not strike. The depositions were taken, portions of the tapes were
shown, the Senate spent three days in secret deliberations, and on
Friday at 12:39 p.m. the last senator cast his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The End,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the former White House senior
adviser.

 &HT;    LaJoie stays ahead of calamity
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ It's one of them racing deals: Stay far
enough ahead of the field and you probably won't get caught up in a
calamitous wreck.
</P>
<P>
   That was Randy LaJoie's simple strategy Saturday to win the
demolition derby otherwise known as the 41st NAPA Auto Parts 300 at
Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   LaJoie won the Busch Grand National season opener under caution,
a fitting situation for an afternoon of spectacular wrecks. Four
separate accidents eliminated 11 cars. None was hairier than the
end-over-end crash on the last of 120 laps that destroyed rookie
Casey Atwood's car and finally settled the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood, running neck and neck with eventual second-place
finisher Jeff Green, got bumped from behind by Andy Hillenburg and
went skyward, landing on his roof, sliding down the track and onto
the grass and flipping four more times. He was only shaken up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the 27 (Atwood) and the 32 (Green) were going to
gang up on me,'' LaJoie said. ``I was just going to make that thing
as wide as all these white walls. I was watching and they got side
by side and allowed me to get away. I ... come off (turn 4) and
seen Atwood get turned around. I was just looking at the starter to
see if I was catching the yellow and the white. I could have swore
I did, but Jeff Green was still coming so I kept getting after
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was one of the crazier races he'd experienced,
LaJoie said, ``It started yesterday afternoon at `happy hour' (when
eight cars damaged each other in last-practice wrecks.) It was not
a pretty sight. You know, these race cars don't cause the
accidents, the drivers hitting each other cause the accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   LaJoie, driving a Chevrolet, led four times for 61 laps,
including the last 19. But he may have won the race at the halfway
point, when Johnny Benson, in the No. 26 Chevrolet, brought out a
caution flag after hitting the wall. That turned out to be a
crucial yellow for LaJoie, who was about to fall a lap down because
of problems with his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the deal,'' LaJoie said. ``We had a left rear tire
come loose and I picked up a bad vibration. Mark (Reno, his crew
chief) said, `You've got to bring it in.' I thought I was going to
get wrecked on down the backstretch trying to get out of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come in and said, `Aw, the spotter said they're coming out
of (turn) 3, the caution's coming out. I don't think the leaders
took the caution.' We had to get after it to beat the guys back to
the line. It was Johnny Benson that did bring out the caution. He
might have won us the race.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been easy for LaJoie, the Busch series champion in
1996 and 1997, to feel like the forgotten old man here. All the
interest seemed to be in the new crop of Busch drivers who just
happen to have relatives in the business. Adam Petty (Kyle's kid,
Richard's grandson) was the most notable of the rookies, finishing
sixth after challenging for the lead with five laps to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good, they're real good,'' LaJoie said. ``I'm sure I'm
going to be chasing them more than they're going to be chasing me.

EARNHARDT APPEARS TO HAVE THE HORSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Two-time Daytona 500 champion Sterling
Marlin knows what it takes to reach Victory Lane at the 2.5-mile
Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   And Marlin says defending race-winner Dale Earnhardt has the
43-car field covered in his bid to repeat in NASCAR's Winston Cup
season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stuff will fly,'' said Marlin, referring to Earnhardt's
No. 3 GM Goodwrench Service Plus Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``I'll bet
he's got 20 more horsepower than the closest guy to him. His stuff
runs good.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, a seven-time Winston Cup champion, will start fourth
in the 43-car field after winning a record 10th consecutive Twin
125-mile qualifying race on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt also got the nod from native Texan Terry Labonte,
whose 0-for-20 futility streak in the Daytona 500 now is one year
longer than Earnhardt's infamous drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnhardt was the quickest that I practiced with out there by
a long shot,'' said Labonte, driver of the No. 5 Kellogg's Chevy.
``Nobody could even pull up on him good in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry McReynolds, Earnhardt's crew chief when he won last year's
Daytona 500, also placed ``The Intimidator'' at the top of his
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 3 car has stayed covered up this week more than it has
been uncovered \Rduring practice sessions\S. That's probably a bad
sign for the competition,'' McReynolds said. ``They're very
confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt ran only five laps during yesterday's final Happy Hour
practice with a top speed of 191.115 mph. He was 14th overall.
Labonte's speed of 192.217 mph was second-fastest to Chad Little's
192.353 in the No. 97 John Deere Ford Taurus.
GORDON HAS HOT WHEELS
</P>
<P>
   Three-time and reigning Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon will
pace the field from the pole position today. And Gordon, the 1997
Daytona 500 champion, says his race car is a rocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a fast race car,'' said Gordon, who qualified the
No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevy at 195.067 mph last
weekend. ``I think we've got the combination to win the Daytona 500
_ the best I've ever had _ and I think we've got an even stronger
team than we had last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon posted a top speed of 191.233 mph during the final
practice, placing him 10th overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys are getting beat up out there \Rby ill-handling
cars\S,'' Gordon said. ``My car is not beating me up. To me,
restrictor-plate racing is an equalizer, but I do feel like we've
got the best car we've ever had here for the Daytona 500.''
WHOM DO YOU TRUST?
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Marlin, who won this race in 1994 and 1995 in the No. 4
Kodak Chevrolet, will start 17th and immediately begin looking for
a drafting partner he can trust. Marlin has a ready-made pal in
Sabco Racing teammate Joe Nemechek. But Marlin plans to hook up
with a driver from the rival Ford Taurus camp as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to work with Mark Martin, if I can,'' said
Marlin, driver of the No. 40 Coors Light Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
``When he tells you something, he usually does it. The rest of them
ain't nothing but a bunch of thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-time Daytona 500 winner Dale Jarrett and crew chief Todd
Parrott have decided not to cut any deals to get to the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to be hard-nosed about this, but if we don't
make a deal with anybody, then nobody can say anything about us,''
said Jarrett, driver of the No. 88 Quality Care/Ford Credit Taurus.
``We'll work with whoever we can to get us to the front. Then it's
every man for himself.''
FAVRE JOINS JARRETT
</P>
<P>
   Brett Favre's new-found involvement in NASCAR will go beyond his
duties as honorary starter of today's Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Bay Packers quarterback became an equity partner in
Winston Cup star Dale Jarrett's Busch Grand National Series team
during the racing off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the partners announced that Jarrett-Favre Motorsports
and primary sponsor Rayovac Batteries plan to make their BGN debut
during the Coca-Cola 300 at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth on
March 27.
</P>
<P>
   The team will enter 14 of 32 events this season, with Jarrett
scheduled for three races and Robert Yates Racing teammate Kenny
Irwin Jr. booked for 11. They will campaign the No. 11 Rayovac Ford
Taurus, which will be powered by engines provided by Yates.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, whose NASCAR stock rose after he won his first Craftsman
Truck Series race on TMS' 1.5-mile trioval in June 1997, is
scheduled to drive the car in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Favre, who also served as grand marshal for yesterday's BGN NAPA
Auto Parts 300 season-opener, is attending his first NASCAR races
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I've talked to said if you go to one race, you're
hooked,'' Favre said. ``I'm going to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett has operated his BGN team since 1982. When he decided to
cut back on his schedule in the series, he approached his
stablemate about taking over the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something interesting to do,'' said Irwin, the 1998
Winston Cup Raybestos rookie of the year. ``It's going to be a lot
more on my schedule, but like Dale said, the more \Rtrack\S time
the better it's going to be. And hopefully, now I can get some
tickets to some Packers games.''
INJURY UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   Two drivers injured in wrecks during the Discount Auto Parts 200
Goody's Dash Series race underwent successful surgery at Halifax
Medical Center on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Weaver of Shelby, N.C., had a rod placed into his left leg
to repair a fractured tibia. Doctors also discovered a stable neck
fracture in Weaver's second vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   George Crenshaw of Lakeland, Fla., had surgery to repair a
fracture of the right femur. Doctors placed titanium rods in the
injured area. He suffered no other injuries.
LAST WORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've seen here the last couple of days is a lot of pretty
wild driving. And it's made me really think about the part of
getting through the race with the car in one piece.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeff Burton, on preparing for today's NASCAR Winston Cup

THE DIALOGUE: BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, SENATORS SPOKE PLAINLY AND
POINTEDLY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Deep within the Senate's secrecy, resounding beyond
the boilerplate of printed statements submitted for history, the
impeachment jurists of President Clinton had their say as well in
some plain-spoken language of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must remember that the fooling around was between
consenting adults, both of them sexually experienced,'' Ernest
Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, noted in his avuncular drawl,
speaking for himself, not his speechwriter, in the closed-door
company of his Senate peers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the folksiest of lawmakers, Hollings relaxed and honored
the trial court by employing that simpler term _ ``fooling around''
_ never used in the impeachment articles nor in the luridly
detailed accusations of the criminal prosecutors who pursued the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Such human glimpses of the senators' hidden deliberations have
been hard to come by. But as the closed trial proceedings were
further documented on Saturday in The congressional Record, some
began appearing in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing right now why I had to make my money selling
frozen peas,'' Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., a food wholesaler,
confessed, playing the humble businessmen agog at all the
constitutional lawyering going on about him.
</P>
<P>
   As senator after senator arose and gravely tolled the morality
stakes of the issue, from self-government to their own proud
procreation, Frank Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, could not
resist some ribbing of his fellow jurists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Chief Justice, it seems to be a prerequisite to speak
today for senators to indicate the number of grandchildren each
has,'' he began. ``I am proud to say Nancy and I have 11, but I
won't indulge you with naming each of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., scored those members with
``soap opera'' proclivities who regularly ``ran pell-mell'' to the
waiting television cameras during trial recesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit right there in the back row 15 feet from the
cloakroom,'' he noted of his desk quite near the exit doors. ``But
at each recess, by the time I walk to the cloakroom and glance at
the TV, some of my colleagues have already sprinted somewhere else
to be in front of the cameras. As you know, I used to be on the
U.S. Olympic Team, and I tell my speedy friends _ you could have
made the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the needed resorts to humor, a sense of the struggle in
the verdict deliberations clearly comes through, even when speakers
rambled beyond the Constitution. They grieved in midtrial at the
death in an auto accident of the Senate's beloved legislative
clerk, Scott Bates.
</P>
<P>
   ``His absence should serve as a reminder that although we have
been totally engrossed in this issue for far too long, there is
life outside of these doors,'' declared Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.
Ms. Murray told of sharing the sidelines with Scott when their
daughters played soccer games in nearby Virginia. ``There are
friends to be hugged, kids to be educated, parents to take care
of,'' Ms. Murray emphasized before the impeachment court.
</P>
<P>
   For all the learned citations of the founding fathers culled by
dedicated staffers for the prepared speeches, the emerging trial
record seems richer when senators just got up and ruminated a bit
about their own histories as courthouse practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I tried cases, I learned from a man named Sid Balick,''
said Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware. ``He used to say at
the outset to the jury: `Keep your eye on the ball. The issue is
not whether my client is a man you would want your daughter to
date, a man you would invite home to dinner. The issue is, did my
client kill Cock Robbin? Period.'''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., could be counted on for a
sonorous recitation of anonymous verse from memory. ``Mr. Chief
Justice,'' he began:
</P>
<P>
   I think my country sinks
</P>
<P>
   beneath the yoke, It weeps, it bleeds,
</P>
<P>
   And each new day,
</P>
<P>
   a gash is added to her wounds.
</P>
<P>
   But Byrd's classicist's taste seemed no match in the record for
another well-read senator, Byron Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota,
who touched closer to the carnival spirit of the yearlong ordeal.
``Mark Twain once said, with tongue in cheek, that `the next best
thing to a lie is a true story no one will believe,''' Dorgan
reminded the chamber. ``Well, this sorry chapter in our rich
history embraces both. Lies, yes! And truth that is almost
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians who must sift through the carefully reasoned
contentions in yards of prepared verdict decisions would do well
not to overlook the aside of wonderment when Sen. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore., oratorically pinched himself. ``I had a lot of far-fetched
dreams as a boy,'' he said. ``But never once did I dream that I
could serve with all of you on the floor of the U.S. Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The pain of the task, not the honor, was underlined by Charles
Grassley, Republican of Iowa, when he recounted a sorry note he
received from a school principal about an assembly devoted to
American heroes. It included an ``Attitude Is Everything'' video,
and at the first sight of Clinton, Grassley said, ``the entire
student body _ ages 11 to 14 _ snickered.''
</P>
<P>
   While the trial was of the president, some of the senior
politicians could not resist including their track records in the
record. Jesse Helms noted, as he so often does, that he was ``the
first Republican directly elected to the U.S. Senate by the people
of North Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was hardly deferred to by Blanche Lincoln, Democrat
newcomer from Arkansas, who, in her first speech to the Senate,
introduced herself ``as the youngest female senator in the history
of our country, as a farmer's daughter raised on the salt of the
earth with basic Christian values, and as a young mother whose
first priority in life is my family and the well-being of the world
that they live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Another freshman, John Edwards, Democrat of North Carolina, rose
and confidently told Chief Justice William Rehnquist that he was
putting aside his prepared remarks to speak from the heart. In
first praising the judge, Edwards recalled the last time he had
seen Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were leading a sing-along at the Fourth Circuit Judicial
Conference,'' the senator ad-libbed. ``I thought it might be a good
idea for this group.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice, no slave to the official record himself, got
a laugh when he shot back: ``A healing device.''

CLINTON PROPOSES US MILITARY ROLE IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton, finally free from a yearlong partisan
domestic crisis, turned his attention Saturday to foreign policy
controversies that appear likely to spark renewed battles with the
Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced he will send up to 4,000 American troops to
the Serbian province of Kosovo if the warring parties there reach a
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers have argued they must approve the deployment of
US military units, which would become part of a 28,000-member NATO
peacekeeping force composed mostly of units from Britain, France,
Germany, and other European nations. The White House rejects that
congressional view out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he anticipated a confrontation over the issue on Capitol
Hill, the president prepared for a quick visit Sunday to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The trip seems certain to generate debate on that nation's war
on drugs, which many members of Congress condemn as inadequate and
which provokes an annual dispute between the White House and
Congress over whether Mexico should be financially penalized for
taking inadequate measures.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used his weekly radio address to give a brief history of
the fighting in Kosovo between Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
rebels seeking independence for the province. And he asserted that
only a US presence can assure the combatants that the terms of any
peace agreement will be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this volatile region, violence we fail to oppose leads to
even greater violence we will have to oppose later, at greater
cost,'' the president said. Saying that ``America has a national
interest'' in achieving a settlement, he added: ``If the conflict
persists, there likely will be a tremendous loss of life and a
massive refugee crisis in the middle of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between Serb and Albanian delegations began in
France a week ago, after the United States and other Western
nations threatened NATO airstrikes if the two sides refused to
meet. The talks appeared to be stalled Saturday as the Serbian
government's representatives awaited instructions from Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on how to reply to a plan drafted by
Washington for ending the bloody Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright arrived in Paris
Saturday to assess the progress of the talks and to try to nudge
them forward personally beginning Sunday. Given the past
intransigence of the Serbs, and of some Albanians' expressed intent
to accept nothing less than full independence, a resolution is far
from certain.
</P>
<P>
   But if an agreement is ultimately reached, a senior American
official told reporters in Washington Saturday, an initial group of
Marines could arrive in Kosovo just 10 days later.
</P>
<P>
   The official said US Army troops, either from bases in Europe or
the United States, would follow. The vanguard force would come from
the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which is aboard Navy ships
already in the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Sending American soldiers into a conflict as violent as the one
in Kosovo could lead to problems, particularly if US forces suffer
injuries or deaths. Even before a US soldier is deployed, however,
Republican lawmakers have served notice they will oppose US
involvement in the southern Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   In a preview of the fights Clinton faces, GOP members of the
House International Relations Committee insisted last week that the
War Powers Act mandates congressional approval before any American
soldiers are sent into harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about the constitutional process and whether
it's a vital national interest to devote such a large portion of
our military capabilities to keeping the peace at two places in the
Balkans,'' said Representative Doug Bereuter, a Republican of
Nebraska, noting that Clinton has already deployed peacekeeping
troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have conceded that an American deployment in
Kosovo will be far riskier than the one in Bosnia. About 60,000
NATO troops, including 20,000 Americans, went to Bosnia in December
1995 as part of the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton was unable to fulfill his vow to bring home the
Americans within a year, the US presence has fallen to less than
7,000, NATO's overall strength has dropped to 30,000, and the force
has generally been viewed as effective.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Pickering, the undersecretary of state for political
affairs, responded at a committee hearing that there was ``ample''
precedent for an administration deploying troops without
permission. To which Tom Campell, a California Republican, shot
back: ``Previous constitutional violations do not justify a
subsequent one.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual debate over American certification of Mexico as a
partner in fighting drug trafficking has been equally acrimonious,
and this year's discussions could prove testy given the hard
feelings engendered on both sides by a year of impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The president is due to report by March 1 on whether 30 nations,
including Mexico, have made sufficient progress in trying to
eradicate the production and distribution of drugs. A lack of
certification can result in economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, this country's second-largest trading partner by some
measures, has never received a failing grade. But the debate each
year is highly charged. Congress can overturn the president's
decision with a majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton spent some of Saturday
reading materials in anticipation of his trip to Mexico. Even with
the controversy over drug certification looming, he presumably can
use the visit to show that he is relaxed in the wake of his
impeachment trial, and ready to continue working on the diverse
affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent in the foreign affairs arena, by far, is the
decision to send troops to Kosovo. If they are deployed, the
American official said Saturday, the peacekeepers would be headed
by a British general in charge of NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction
Force.
</P>
<P>
   The chain of authority runs through the alliance's command for
southern Europe, headed by a US Navy admiral, and finally to the
Supreme Allied Commander Europe, US Army General Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his radio address, cited historical precedent for US
intervention in Europe. ``World War II taught us that America could
never be secure if Europe's future was in doubt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he tried to blunt criticism that the United
States might not be able to resist inserting itself into every
trouble spot that appears around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``America cannot be everywhere or do everything overseas,''
Clinton said. ``But we must act where important interests are at
stake and we can make a difference.''

A RELIEVED CLINTON PREPARES FOR TRIP TO MEXICO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The story around some circles in Mexico City went
like this: When one high-level government official heard several
weeks ago that President Clinton was coming to Mexico, his first
reaction was, ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   His second was, ``Will he still be president?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the latter question is yes, of course, after the
US Senate voted Friday to acquit Clinton of impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   And that might help answer the Mexican official's first
question. A relieved but contrite Clinton will arrive in Merida
Sunday for a quick visit that will probably do more to help begin
rebuilding his tarnished presidential image than it will to break
any new diplomatic ground in relations with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, US and Mexican officials say the daylong visit between
Clinton and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, the eighth between
them, will cover topics such as immigration, the North American
Free Trade Agreement, and the struggle to fight the flow of drugs
across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a good personal relationship, and they know it's
important to keep fluid communication on bilateral issues,'' said
David Najera, a Zedillo spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides also recognize the visual and symbolic value of
having the president and first lady basking in the Yucatan sun only
days after Clinton survived an embarrassing attempt to remove him
from office. In addition to a few meetings Monday, the president
and Hillary Rodham Clinton are expected to make a quick trip to
some of the area's popular Mayan ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no huge issues looming on the immediate horizon,''
said John H. Coatsworth, director of the David Rockefeller Center
for Latin American Studies at Harvard University. ``This would be a
good time for them to shake hands, smile, visit ruins, and tell
their aides to keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Zedillo last met in New York City in June, during a
special UN conference on drugs. But the two have spoken regularly
since then by phone, Najera said, to discuss the growing economic
worries in Latin America and how to better coordinate recovery
efforts in Central America after Hurricane Mitch plowed through the
region last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Because bureaucrats from Mexico City and Washington regularly
consult with one another on a variety of topics, government
agencies routinely handle questions of commerce, immigration, and
law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there are prickly issues between the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans grumble that Washington's certification process, in
which the president and Congress annually determine which countries
have cooperated in drug-eradication efforts, is unfair and
patronizing.
</P>
<P>
   The Zedillo administration has made great efforts over the last
month, in anticipation of Clinton's visit and perhaps of the
certification debate, to demonstrate its commitment. Those efforts
have included a recently unveiled $500 million program over the
next three years for new airplanes, radars, and other drug-fighting
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican law enforcement agencies have also seized more than 260
tons of marijuana over the last four weeks. Nevertheless, US
authorities continue to argue that Mexico has failed to adequately
stem the tide of drugs coming from South America or to stop the
growth of powerful new cartels that have sprouted along the
US-Mexico border and in the state of Quintana Roo.
</P>
<P>
   There are also some unresolved disputes between the countries
over aspects of the 5-year-old free-trade agreement that links the
United States, Mexico, and Canada. For months, Mexican officials
have objected to the American ban against allowing Mexican
transport trucks across the border.
</P>
<P>
   US officials have also expressed concern over Mexico's economy
in light of the Brazilian economic crisis and the falling price of
petroleum, which forced the Zedillo government this year to impose
one of the country's most austere budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides acknowledge that a worsening economic situation in
Mexico would probably lead to more immigrants who try to enter the
US illegally. That is also a worry for Mexican human rights
officials, who have recently accused US border authorities of
mistreating migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials and experts say, it's unlikely that any major
new pacts will be signed during the visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a working meeting for a relationship which has matured
over the years,'' said Najera. ``There may be some symbolic aspects
as well, but I think this is a meaningful visit for both
governments.''

LETTING THE QUALIFIED SPEAK OF JOCKS, JESUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Randall Cunningham, forever a wayward quarterback in the NFL,
was also a self-described wayward person until he found his answer
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Lord.
</P>
<P>
   During a sensational career revival in Minnesota, Cunningham
referred to himself as a quarterback on fire, but he didn't
necessarily mean a hot passing hand. Randall was talking about the
``Holy Spirit.'' And he spoke constantly and feverishly on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' he said the week of the NFC championship game, ``the
media doesn't care to hear it. You are here for football. I see
what happens when I bring it up. You guys close your notebooks, or
you click off your mikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider me among those guilty as charged. Religion on the
sports page makes me squirm, probably because I'm not qualified to
deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Jocks and Jesus, however, have become a mushrooming partnership
over the last few years. It involves all sports, but for no
particular reason I can think of, the biggest impact has been in
NFL locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Eugene Robinson scandal broke in Miami some 24
hours before the Super Bowl kickoff, I openly sneered, and I wasn't
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Here was one of those high-profile, jocks for Jesus prophets
caught looking for love in all the wrong places. Busted by Miami
vice, Robinson became an immediate disgrace to his family, his
team, and himself. His career as an NFL safety was winding down
anyway, but this probably ended it, and should have.
</P>
<P>
   Fraud and hypocrite _ that was my brand on Robinson. But there
it is again _ the unqualified passing judgment.
</P>
<P>
   In these cases, including the mystery conversion of Deion a year
ago, my best solution is seek immediate advice from those who live
the life.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, let John Weber explain it.
</P>
<P>
   Weber is an Arlington resident, an ordained minister and the
unofficial chaplain for the both the Rangers and Cowboys. For
years, he has worked the locker room and the clubhouse, and as I've
said before, the respect he has with the jocks is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good man.
</P>
<P>
   Weber, by the way, also is aligned with the national religious
group, Athletes in Action, the same organization that had bestowed
its Bart Starr Award on Robinson some 10 hours before he was
arrested in Miami. The award is given for high moral character.
</P>
<P>
   The joke, as it turned out, was not just on Robinson and the
Atlanta Falcons, but it also involved Athletes in Action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that my work, going into the locker rooms and
speaking to the guys, was not made easier by this tragic event,''
said Weber. ``This can be presented as an example of how sin is a
subtle enemy. But it's one of the worst kind of examples, because
of what this did to Eugene and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do live in a skeptical, cynical world today, and there's no
doubt that's where the backlash comes over this kind of incident.
It will feed the fire on the question about just how sincere any of
us are, including the athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   While Weber was not in Miami for the Bart Starr Award
presentation, he knows Robinson and has heard him speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, Eugene had made a great positive impact on many
people, including his teammates, who spoke so highly of him even
after the arrest. But I talk often of the ripple effect a high
profile athlete can have in society. The only problem, however, it
works both ways _ the ripple can be good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess would be this is not the first time this had happened
with Eugene. Doing that the night before a Super Bowl wouldn't
suggest it's a first-time decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``So with this tragic decision, comes the need for Eugene to pay
very close attention to his life, including professional help. I
would only hope and pray he can hold his life together.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber said one of his favorite quotes is ``a man by himself is
in bad company.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was Robinson, driving that rental car down Biscayne
Boulevard in Miami on a Saturday night. He was alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can find it in my heart to forgive Eugene, certainly,''
added Weber. ``And so will our group. It was an embarrassment for
Athletes in Action, but I feel most terrible for Eugene and his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person man does not generally question is himself. We
see our pursuits as noble. But for all the skepticism and cynicism
created by this act, each of us would be better served by taking a
closer look at ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   With John Weber, the notebook is never closed when religion
mixes with sports. /

THEY'RE ALL IN PURSUIT OF GORDON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH Fla. _ Jeff Gordon won't be happy with anything
less than a fourth Winston Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Moore would be happy just to find a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin wants the title that eluded him when he finished
second to Gordon in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Falk wants to finish in the top 25 in points.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett has won 14 races the last three seasons, and
finished in the top three in points each year.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Marcis has won five races in a career that began in 1968,
and hasn't finished in the top-20 in points since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, Martin and Jarrett drive for the elite teams on the
Winston Cup circuit. They have the combination of talent, resources
and experience to be contenders week in and week out.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, Falk and Marcis are among the also-rans, owners and
drivers that are short of money, technology or personnel.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1999 season begins today with the Daytona 500, only a
handful of teams appear to be legitimate contenders for the
championship. A few others are a threat to win on any given
weekend. The majority of the cars that make up the field are little
more than brightly colored, high-speed revolving billboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win a race, you've got to focus on a single event,'' said
Robin Pemberton, Rusty Wallace's crew chief. ``To be able to pull a
championship off, you've got to have the resources and the manpower
to continue the same assault week after week. A smaller team can
have one great effort, one great battle, but the teams with more
resources can go into battle every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon drives for one of those teams. So do Martin and Jarrett.
As the season progresses, those three drivers once again are
favored to battle for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton and Wallace also are considered contenders. If
everything falls into place, Bobby Labonte and Jeremey Mayfield
might have a shot. Perhaps Dale Earnhardt can recapture the old
magic.
</P>
<P>
   A few more drivers _ Mike Skinner, Ken Schrader, Terry Labonte _
have the ability to win a race.
</P>
<P>
   However, most of the 59 cars that attempted to qualify for the
Daytona 500 have absolutely no chance to run for a championship,
and very little chance of even winning one of the 34 points-paying
races. Last year 11 drivers combined to win the 33 races, and only
five won more than once.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston Cup circuit is a lot like major-league baseball.
There are a lot of talented players in the big leagues, but few
teams have the capability of getting to the playoffs and winning
the World Series. There are a lot of talented drivers piloting
stock cars, but few teams have what it takes to compete for the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of those drivers that are in those cars, even though
they are good race car drivers they may not have the total package
to win,'' Jarrett said.
`A BIG SPORT'
</P>
<P>
   The teams that have the total package are the equivalent of
baseball's big-market clubs, the ones with the revenues to afford
the best players. The rest are the equivalent of the small-market
teams with the tiny payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, Martin and Jarrett drive for big-market owners Rick
Hendrick, Jack Roush and Robert Yates. Burton also works for Roush.
Wallace and Mayfield drive for the joint effort owned by Roger
Penske and Michael Kranefuss. Labonte drives for Joe Gibbs, and
Earnhardt for Richard Childress.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the owners and teams that have the resources to hire
the best crew chiefs, engineers and technicians. They can afford
the state-of-the-art technology, and employ the people who know how
to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big sport now,'' Moore said. ``If you don't have the
money to hire the high-tech people, the engineers and stuff, to go
along with a good race team you're going to be in trouble. It takes
a lot of money to go racing in Winston Cup. It takes cubic dollars
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, the 73-year-old car owner who is one of the pioneer's of
the sport, lacks a major sponsor and doesn't have the money. While
the large, multicar teams on the circuit have over 200 employees,
Moore has five.
</P>
<P>
   Not even his legendary ability to make cars go fast can make up
for that deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what to do, but it takes money,'' said Moore, who
failed to get his car into the Daytona field.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Yates Racing has money. Jarrett's team made good use of
it in the sport's off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a lot of hours in the wind tunnel,'' Jarrett said.
``We cut the body off the car after being in the wind tunnel and
built it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The wind tunnel gives teams invaluable data about the car's
aerodynamics, data they can use to shave difference-making tenths
of seconds off lap times. The wind tunnel is something Joe Falk can
only dream about.
</P>
<P>
   Falk owns the No. 91 Chevrolet driven by Steve Grissom. He also
lacks a primary sponsor so he puts Little Joe's, his own auto
dealership, on the side of the car.
</P>
<P>
   The dealership is lucrative, but doesn't make enough money to
allow Falk to compete with the big boys. He said he spent $3.5
million last year in a sport where it takes about $5 million to
field a team good enough just to finish in the top 25 or so in
points. The top team's budgets approach $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   So for Falk, the wind tunnel is a mere pipe dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Penske group, I think they've got 60 or 70 hours of wind
tunnel time,'' he said. ``Well, that's $2,000 an hour for that.
They've got the resources to make a big effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were here testing, and the 25 car, Wally Dallenbach \Rowned
by Hendrick\S, he had three crew chiefs working on that car. That's
three guys who are making big bucks working on that one car. That's
what you're having to compete with.''
</P>
<P>
   Under-funded owners like Falk can't afford the full-time
engineers and specialists that the top teams have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may build five sets of shocks a day, go out and practice,
come back in and take them apart, rebuild them and have them ready
for the next day,'' said Jeff Hammond, crew chief for the
Roush-owned car driven by Chad Little. ``What it costs is the man
who has to take it apart and put it back together. The man who's
really good at that is a specialist, so you wind up paying a
specialist to rebuild, rebuild, rebuild.''
RACING FOR DOLLARS
</P>
<P>
   One factor that separates the haves from the have-nots is the
difference in sponsorship dollars. The range between the top end
and bottom end is as much as $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   But while being on the high end obviously helps, it isn't the
only indicator of success. Money can purchase a lot of things, but
it cannot buy an instant championship.
</P>
<P>
   Texas millionaire Tim Beverly has money, and not just from his
Tyler Jet business. Beverly, who became a Winston Cup owner when he
purchased Darrell Waltrip's team last March, has a major sponsor in
Lucky Dog 10-10-345 for the car driven by Rich Bickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to go big-time auto racing,'' Beverly said.
``We're not here just to ride around. We're not here to see if we
can finish in the top 20. You can get to that echelon, the top 10
in points, the top five in points.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Beverly realizes a top-20 finish in the team's first
full season would be a good result. The team can afford the best
equipment, but it takes time to build a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next two years, three years, we want to be in that
situation to where we're competing for that championship,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It should take at least that long to attract another necessary
ingredient for a championship run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the right personnel is the most important thing,''
Burton said. ``There's not enough quality personnel to go around
for all 50 teams. It turns into a recruiting war, we will offer you
this much money and you're going to get this and that.''
</P>
<P>
   The right personnel includes a talented crew chief. Ray
Evernham, Todd Parrott and Jimmy Fennig, who run the teams for
Gordon, Jarrett and Martin, respectively, are among the best in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams have as much money as anybody else, but they
don't have that guy in charge who knows exactly what to do with the
money and how to get the right people in there,'' Jarrett said.
``Todd Parrott is definitely the backbone of this race team. He's
the one who came in and made all of this work.''
</P>
<P>
   A talented driver also is required, but in an era where
technology is so important, even the best driver can't make a slow
car go any faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drivers definitely make a difference, but you can't do it on
your own,'' Pemberton said. ``You have to have a good crew and
everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the ``everything else'' is people who want to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go down here and do a dollar by dollar breakdown of all
the teams, you'll find out there's enough dollars there to get the
job done,'' Hammond said. ``But the intangible is they just don't
have the will to do it. You've got to have the want to.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have the will, it doesn't matter how much other
stuff you've got.''

WINSTON CUP PROJECTED TOP 10

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   1999 WINSTON CUP PROJECTED TOP 10 No. 1 Driver: Jeff Gordon Age:
27 Team: Hendrick Motorsports Car/sponsor: No. 24 DuPont Automotive
Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo Career highlights: Has won three of
the last four Winston Cup championships, including two in a row;
NASCAR's youngest three-time champion. 1998 finish: First, thanks
to a single-season record-tying 13 victories 1999 projected finish:
Still the one Scouting report: Gordon, crew chief Ray Evernham and
the Rainbow Warriors may not win another 13 races this season but
there is nothing to suggest this team is going to lose focus.
Gordon's seven poles and 13 victories were obvious keys to the
domination he exhibited during 1998. What's not so obvious? Gordon
finished in the top 10 _ and on the lead lap _ in the final 20
races of 1998. And Gordon will start today's season-opening Daytona
500 on the pole.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Driver: Dale Jarrett Age: 42 Team: Robert Yates Racing
Car/sponsor: No. 88 Quality Care/Ford Credit Ford Taurus Career
highlights: Two-time winner of the Daytona 500 (1993 and 1996);
finished third or better in points for third consecutive year in
1998 1998 finish: Third, 345 points behind Mark Martin 1999
projected finish: Up to second Scouting report: Only Jarrett knows
how much his performance suffered last year while he battled a gall
bladder condition. Jarrett freely admits his team went into the
1998 season not knowing what to expect from the new Taurus. This
year, crew chief Todd Parrott has an inventory of cars at his
disposal. So like D.J.'s health, machinery is not an issue. Jarrett
said he and Parrott must either show up with the ``best car'' more
often or figure out how to adjust the car and/or make a late-race
strategy move to win more than the three races they bagged in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 Driver: Mark Martin Age: 40 Team: Roush Racing
Car/sponsor: No. 6 Valvoline/Cummins Ford Taurus Career highlights:
Three-time Winston Cup points runnerup, including last year by 364
points to Jeff Gordon; won record fourth IROC championship 1998
finish: Second, despite career highs in wins (seven), top-fives
(22), top-10s (26) and winnings ($4.3 million). 1999 projected
finish: Down to third Scouting report: Nobody on the planet races
harder than Martin. But even with career numbers, he could not
catch the 24 car. Specifically, Martin scored 321 fewer points than
Gordon in the four carburetor restrictor plate races, accounting
for all but 43 points of his overall deficit. Martin's victory in
the Bud Shootout last Sunday definitely showed Roush has closed the
plate engine gap over the winter.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 Driver: Rusty Wallace Age: 42 Team: Penske/Kranefuss
Racing Car/sponsor: No. 2 Miller Lite Ford Taurus Career
highlights: Winston Cup champion in 1989; has won a race for 13
consecutive years 1998 finish: Fifth, his best effort since placing
third in 1994 1999 projected finish: Up to fourth Scouting report:
Wallace's trademark enthusiasm took on real substance during the
off-season, when he posted the fastest overall speed (193.129 mph)
in winter testing. Wallace also cut his DNFs _ Did Not Finish
results _ from 11 in 1997 to two last year. Wallace started out hot
last year, leading the points chase for eight consecutive weeks. A
second season of working with teammate Jeremy Mayfield should
improve the performances of both in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 Driver: Jeff Burton Age: 31 Team: Roush Racing
Car/sponsor: No. 99 Exide Batteries Ford Taurus Career highlights:
Won first three races of his career, including inaugural 500-mile
event at Texas Motor Speedway, in 1997 en route to fourth-place
points finish 1998 finish: Fifth, based on career-highs in
top-fives (18) and top-10s (23). 1999 projected finish: Idling in
fifth Scouting report: Mark Martin's stablemate and Jack Roush's
rising star was done-in by five finishes of 36th or worse last
season. Burton also must improve on his qualifying efforts if he
wants to be a bonafide frontrunner. He has not won a Cup pole since
since Aug. 16, 1996 at Michigan Speedway _ 75 races ago.
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 Driver: Bobby Labonte Age: 34 Team: Joe Gibbs Racing
Car/sponsor: No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac Grand Prix Career
highlights: Has won at least one race in each of his four seasons
with Gibbs' team; posted single-season high in winnings with $2.9
million last year 1998 finish: Career-best sixth, topped by three
poles and 18 top-10s 1999 projected finish: Stuck in sixth Scouting
report: Either with or without the carburetor restrictor plate,
Labonte has established himself as Pontiac's top driver and a
superspeedway superstar. Gibbs' plate engines are plenty powerful,
as Labonte proved while winning his Twin 125-mile qualifying race
on Thursday. Gibbs wants this team to move up three spots in the
standings this year, wishful thinking unless Labonte can cut his
six DNFs to one or two. Who knows, rookie teammate Tony Stewart may
even help as a drafting partner on the superspeedways.
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 Driver: Dale Earnhardt Age: 47 Team: Richard Childress
Racing Car/sponsor: No. 3 GM Goodwrench Service Plus Chevrolet
Monte Carlo Career highlights: NASCAR's second seven-time Winston
Cup champion; career earnings of $33,377,129 at the end of 1998
leads all forms of motorsports 1998 finish: Eighth, the sixth
consecutive year he's been among the top-10 and 18th overall 1999
projected finish: A wise-cracking seventh Scouting report:
Earnhardt has not won a Cup championship since 1994, but he always
looks like his old intimidating self at Daytona in February. This
time he's back as defending Daytona 500 champion for the first
time, and his record 10th consecutive Twin 125-mile qualifying race
victory Thursday marks him as a contender today. Earnhardt and
Childress insist they have retooled and reinvigorated their
programs and themselves over the winter _ in search of that elusive
eighth championship. Earnhardt's legions of fans want to believe.
</P>
<P>
   No. 8 Driver: Jeremy Mayfield Age: 29 Team: Penske/Kranefuss
Racing Car/sponsor: No. 12 Mobil 1 Ford Taurus Career highlight(s):
Scored first career victory at Pocono Raceway last June; led points
four times during the first 16 races of 1998. 1998 finish:
Career-best seventh 1999 projected finish: One step back to eighth
Scouting report: Mayfield reaped the benefits of his first year as
teammate to Rusty Wallace in 1998. Mayfield definitely was the hot
driver of the season's first half, when he was being touted as
someone who could challenge Jeff Gordon for the championship. But
after his victory at Pocono, Mayfield finished outside the top 15
in 11 of the final 18 races. Mayfield insists that Wallace is a
championship contender _ and so is he. Together, they could make
race day miserable for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   No. 9 Driver: Terry Labonte Age: 42 Team: Hendrick Motorsports
Car/sponsor: No. 5 Kellogg's Chevrolet Monte Carlo Career
highlights: Two-time Cup champion (1984 and 1996); NASCAR's Iron
Man will make his record 603rd consecutive start in the Daytona 500
1998 finish: Ninth, 27 points out of eighth 1999 projected finish:
Ninth again Scouting report: Labonte's consistency may not fire up
a lot of fans, but it has allowed him to finish in the top-10 for
five consecutive seasons. Labonte was ranked second in points after
10 races, but his top-fives (five) and top-10s (15) were his fewest
since 1993. The return of team owner Rick Hendrick should provide a
morale boost for Labonte and crew chief Andy Graves, who have spent
the last two years in the shadows cast by teammates Jeff Gordon and
Ray Evernham.
</P>
<P>
   No. 10 Driver: Mike Skinner Age: 41 Team: Richard Childress
Racing Car/sponsor: No. 31 Lowe's Chevrolet Monte Carlo Career
highlights: Won 1997 Daytona 500 pole in his 16th Cup start en
route to rookie of the year title; won third annual NASCAR
demonstration race in Japan 1998 finish: 21st, up nine spots from
1997 1999 projected finish: A breakthrough 10th Scouting report:
Skinner and veteran crew chief Larry McReynolds apparently have
found that elusive chemistry that McReynolds and Dale Earnhardt
never could locate. Skinner improved 15 points positions, to 21st,
over the season's final 20 races under McReynolds' guidance.
Skinner's eight top-10s and three top-fives all came after Larry
Mac replaced Kevin Hamlin. Skinner, the first NASCAR Craftsman
Truck Series champion in 1995, has only 76 Cup starts on his
resume. In McReynolds, he has the perfect mentor. McReynolds says
there is no reason this team can't finish among the top four in
points _ and win two or three races. Why not start with a huge
upset in the Daytona 500?

HENDRICK'S RETURN TO NASCAR DRIVES GORDON'S DESIRE TO EXCEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Jeff Gordon always had the motivation to
drive a race car. Through 42 victories and three NASCAR Winston Cup
championships, Gordon's almost hypnotic need to exceed largely has
been self-induced.
</P>
<P>
   His rivals and peers in the garage area have noticed. As the
start of the 1999 season awaits at Daytona International Speedway
today, few believe Gordon and that three-car crowd at Hendrick
Motorsports are about to self-destruct.
</P>
<P>
   Not with Gordon, NASCAR's youngest three-time champion, barely
entering his prime at 27.
</P>
<P>
   Not with workaholic crew chief Ray Evernham calling the shots.
</P>
<P>
   And not with the return of team founder Rick Hendrick.
</P>
<P>
   Battling bone-marrow cancer for the past two years, and after
serving a year of house arrest for a messy mail fraud charge,
Hendrick has returned to NASCAR's extended family.
</P>
<P>
   An emotional Gordon has noticed, as he prepares to drive in the
Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of this whole organization is to take Rick to Victory
Lane,'' said Gordon, who will start the 200-lap race around the
high-banked, 2.5-mile trioval from the pole. ``We felt like we took
him to Victory Lane several times over the last few years. But he
wasn't there in the flesh. That's what's going to be very exciting
for us.''
MISSING HENDRICK
</P>
<P>
   Hendrick celebrated Gordon's first championship in 1995 and
native Texan Terry Labonte's heroic drive to the title despite a
broken finger in 1996. But Hendrick was diagnosed with bone marrow
cancer in February 1997 and missed the team's dramatic 1-2-3 sweep
of the Daytona 500 with Gordon, Labonte and then-teammate Ricky
Craven.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Hendrick also was up to his lawyers in a scandal
involving preferential treatment to American Honda executives from
his Charlotte-based Hendrick Automotive Group. He pled guilty to
one count of mail fraud, and in light of his deteriorating physical
condition, was placed on home detention for one year.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrick was barred from contact with his racing team in 1997
and 1998, years that ended with Gordon winning 10 and a
record-tying 13 races, respectively, and consecutive Winston Cup
points championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all feel like we missed Rick being here a lot,'' said
Gordon, who broke down into tears several times on the awards stage
at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City while attempting to
talk about Hendrick in December 1997. ``We all feel pretty
fortunate to get through the things we got through the last few
years without him here. At the same time, it wasn't the same with
him gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say we're going to have a year like we had
last year. But I hope we can keep up some level of the competition
we've had over the last three or four years. Just for him, so we
can see the excitement on his face when he's standing in Victory
Lane. Just so he can be part of a championship battle. Just so he
can experience the things that he wasn't able to experience while
he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's at the Daytona 500 with one of his three teams. I
certainly feel like we've got a good shot at it.''
CRUISE CONTROL
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hendrick's legal and health setbacks, Hendrick
Motorsports enters this season having won a record four consecutive
driver's championships and 47 of 127 races since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been quite a cruise for this group,'' said Hendrick, who
turned over day-to-day operation of his race teams to brother John
Hendrick in 1998. John Hendrick carries the title of team president
this year. Rick Hendrick remains the team's chief executive
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got, in my opinion, the best in the business right
here,'' said Rick, who is continuing chemotherapy. ``I've got some
wicked medicine that I think is doing a wicked job on the disease.
In a 500-mile race, I'm on lap about 400. ... Some days you're
lucky to get up. The goals keep changing. But if I stay with it,
there's a possibility and a probability maybe I could be cured.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrick, 49, paused and added, ``I plan on having a lot of fun
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon could assure that with a season anywhere close to
approaching his 1998 numbers. His 13 victories tied Richard Petty's
record for most in NASCAR's modern era, which dates from 1972. En
route to his third title in four years, Gordon captured an
unprecedented fourth consecutive Pepsi Southern 500, became the
first two-time winner of the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis, swept
the road-course events at Sonoma, Calif., and Watkins Glen, N.Y.,
claimed two $1 million bonuses in Winston's No Bull 5 program and a
record $9.3 million in winnings.
</P>
<P>
   He led the series with seven poles, 26 top-five and 28 top-10
finishes in 33 starts. After winning just three of the season's
first 15 events, he closed by capturing 10 of the final 18 and
three of the last four.
</P>
<P>
   In 189 career Cup starts, Gordon has earned $26,009,046, which
is fourth on the all-time list.
DRIVER OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, driver of the No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes
Chevrolet Monte Carlo, was the runaway choice for Driver of the
Year. He joined NASCAR's Darrell Waltrip and retired Indy-car and
Formula One hero Mario Andretti as three-time winners of that
honor.
</P>
<P>
   By season's end, Gordon and his Rainbow Warriors crew were being
named in the same sentence with record-setting home run slugger
Mark McGwire, the NBA's Chicago Bulls and World Series champion New
York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we accomplished last year was unbelieveable. I look back
at it and I shake my head,'' said Gordon, who is 13th on NASCAR's
all-time victory list. ``I'm probably one of the few people when
1998 came to the New Year's countdown _ that 10, nine, eight _ I
wasn't liking that. I wanted it to keep going. I wanted to live '98
for the rest of my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once '98 was over, we had new goals for 1999. Every year,
Ray and I look at what we've accomplished the year before and
during that year and we're trying to get better and better. We hope
we're going to raise the bar this year, but I don't know if that
means we're going to win 10 or 13 races. We've got the same team,
same morale and I think the same attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Evernham, who also will oversee Gordon's five-race Busch Grand
National Series schedule, said the gains his team can make each
year inside the NASCAR Winston Cup rulebook are getting smaller and
smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, everybody else is going to step it up, too,''
Evernham said. ``The bottom line is when that first wheel rolls,
nobody cares anymore. They don't care if you won 13, 14 or none.
It's Square One. You've got to work a little bit harder on top. But
on the other hand, we're not racing somebody else. We're racing
ourselves.''

OATES CAN SEE OWNER IS SERIOUS ABOUT SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers owner Tom Hicks drew a line in the
sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take a step backward,'' he said. ``I'm
realistic enough to know that only one team wins, but I want to
make sure that we continue to climb the ladder and ultimately win
the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The economics of major-league baseball today demand his
position.
</P>
<P>
   The defending American League West champion's 1999 payroll
likely will exceed $80 million, and its owner projects the
franchise ``losing $5 (million) or $10 million'' despite an
increase in ticket prices for the third consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know I support them and give them the resources to do
their job,'' Hicks said of his management team. ``I expect
reasonable performance in return. People will be held accountable
as they should be and as they are in the real world every day.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves manager Johnny Oates the person most accountable for
the Rangers' on-field performance and Hicks' produce-or-perish
declaration.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as pressure goes, that's part of this job,'' said
Oates, who has led the team to division titles in two of the past
three years, the only championships in team history. ``We live in a
performance-oriented society. Nothing speaks greater volumes along
those lines than professional athletics. If you don't perform, it's
a tough profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' journey begins Thursday when pitchers and catchers
report to the organization's Port Charlotte, Fla., camp. The first
workout is scheduled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Peppy optimism regarding a third division title in four seasons
permeates the organization. Hicks, who also owns the National
Hockey League's Stars, drew a comparison between his two
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the Stars. We had a great team three years ago and got
upset in the first round,'' he said. ``We went deep in the playoffs
last year. Our fans probably will be disappointed this year if we
don't make it to the \RStanley\S Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty tough duty, but I think Rangers fans should be
disappointed _ as their owner would be _ if we don't repeat as AL
West champs, even though we've got a tough race ahead with the
Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks demonstrated his desire to win an AL West title during the
1998 season. The owner supported an additional $2.6 million in
players' salaries for the season's final two months with general
manager Doug Melvin's additions of right-hander Todd Stottlemyre,
shortstop Royce Clayton and third baseman Todd Zeile through two
July 31 trades.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers survived August and utilized five consecutive
September victories against the Angels to ensure their AL West
championship, but Hicks remained noncommittal regarding Oates'
future and offered hints of reservations during that period.
</P>
<P>
   Oates and members of his staff were antsy enough to inquire
about other employment possibilities during the season's final
week. Hicks waited until the morning after the Rangers clinched the
division title _ with two games remaining _ to extend his manager
an invitation to return for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was important for this franchise that we achieve
what we felt was a reasonable goal of winning the AL West once we
made those deals at the trade deadline,'' Hicks said then. ``It
doesn't mean they wouldn't have been back if they hadn't won it,
but I would have wanted some answers as to why.''
</P>
<P>
   The defending World Series champion New York Yankees will enter
this season as the prohibitive favorite to again represent the
American League in the World Series, but that did not prevent Hicks
from supporting the Rangers' escalating payroll this winter. The
Commissioner's Office computed the Rangers' final 1998 payroll as
the seventh-highest in baseball at $67,956,293. The final 1999
payroll likely will exceed $80 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to take this team to the next level,'' Hicks
said. ``The fact that we've won the AL West two of the past three
years is a huge change for this franchise. I want to keep that
momentum. We've got a solid foundation and the nucleus to have a
championship ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the decision to lose money this season to keep our
team intact so we'll stay at a championship-caliber level while we
wait for the younger players to develop that will bring our payroll
more in line with where it needs to be. We'll end up losing $5 or
$10 million, but that's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view that as an investment to keep the team at that
championship level. We've been around 3 million in attendance. I'd
love to see the attendance grow to 3.2 or 3.4 million. I think if
we give the fans the right product, there's a good chance that will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A time also will come when division titles no longer satisfy the
Rangers' owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, certainly not from my perspective as the owner,'' Hicks
said. ``I do want to win a World Series. I want to win the Stanley
Cup in hockey. There's a progression you make. You usually don't go
win it all the first year, but you climb the ladder a little bit
more each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, you eventually have a chance to win it all. There
are 29 disappointed owners and their fans who don't make it. I
think we've got a reasonable shot of getting there someday, and I'm
talking about within the next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates echoed that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want us to be satisfied or happy with division
championships,'' the manager said. ``I don't want our players
thinking that way. I don't want our fans thinking that way. I don't
want the media thinking that way. The goal in this business is not
to win the division, even though it took us a long time to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal now is whatever it takes to find a way to get to the
next level. We want that expectation of us. We don't want to be
satisfied with just being a division winner.''

TEXAS ROAD RACER BALANCES MOTHERHOOD WITH TRAINING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHARLES CLINES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jody Hawkins loves to run. She has been doing it for more than
half her life, and she has run with and against the best in the
world. And she doesn't want to stop.
</P>
<P>
   She does slow down, though, for children.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, Hawkins, 32, gave birth to two sons. It
has made reaching the world-ranked status she enjoyed in 1993 and
'94 harder, but she doesn't mind. Hawkins wants to be a top woman
runner, but her top priority is being the best mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my tradeoff,'' said the Blooming Grove resident who fits
training around husband Mark and sons Skyler, 18 months, and
Hunter, 3 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can train full time and be the best there is, or you can
be the mother of two. I have two wonderful sons, and that's my
tradeoff. I'm not saying you can't be the best and be a mother, but
it's not easy,'' she said while preparing for the Cowtown 10K on
Feb. 27 in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Making her way back is Hawkins' agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, she enjoyed her first injury-free year in almost eight
years and won the Avon National 10K championship. The 10-kilometer
title followed a 28th-place showing in the 1998 Half Marathon World
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Those showings were her best since she was ranked sixth in the
world on the roads by ``Runner's World'' magazine. This month, she
has continued to build on recent successes.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins placed eighth in the Women's National Championship Eight
Kilometer Road Race on Feb. 6 and won the 3M Half Marathon in
Austin the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back races were part of her plan to qualify for the
2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   She has pegged Grandma's Marathon in June in Duluth, Minn., as
her first effort to qualify for the Olympic Trials at 26.2 miles.
</P>
<P>
   All this competition is a prelude to Hawkins' goal of qualifying
for the trials in the 10K and marathon. She's a strong bet for the
10K, but the marathon is an unknown.
</P>
<P>
   She said she's comfortable in longer runs, and it showed in
Austin with her half-marathon time of 1 hour, 14 minutes, 11
seconds after a disappointing 8K effort.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins has run many Fort Worth-Dallas area road races recently,
regaining a taste of what it's like to be back in the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Yet seeing his wife place among local runners was a new
experience for Mark. ``I was so used to seeing her winning or being
in the top finishers that it was a shock to see her finishing third
or even seventh against local athletes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But those races helped Hawkins' 5-kilometer times drop from the
18-minute range to the 16-minute range.
</P>
<P>
   ``After having babies, you just can't take for granted that the
16s are going to come like they used to,'' said Mark, a former NAIA
All-American at Wayland Baptist and an Olympic qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawkinses moved to Blooming Grove, which is about 35 miles
south of Dallas, in 1995 to be near Jody's mother. ``This is a
great opportunity for us,'' Mark said. ``We wanted to get away from
the city, and we both like running on dirt roads to rehab our
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Blooming Grove is where Jody Hawkins grew up, and much of her
family is there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lucky that my mom lives across the street and she can
watch the kids when I go running,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback, then, is almost complete, said Mark: ``We're now
looking to be ranked again.''

EARNHARDT ENJOYING THE RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The questions were different now. Winning
the Daytona 500 changes everything. Just ask Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat, microphone in hand, in a swivel chair perched atop a
platform in the press box at Daytona International Speedway
following his record 10th consecutive victory in Thursday's
Gatorade Twin 125s, Earnhardt knew he would no longer have to face
questions about his agonizing 0-for-19 streak in the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   As he swiveled right, left, then 180 degrees to take in the
panoramic view of the 2.5-mile high-banked trioval while waving to
fans below in the grandstands, Earnhardt seemed delighted to talk
about his long-overdue triumph last Feb. 15 in the crown jewel of
the NASCAR Winston Cup Series.
</P>
<P>
   No longer haunted by demons past, he seemed serenely confident
about winning his second Daytona 500 in his gleaming black No. 3
Goodwrench Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh definitely,'' said Earnhardt's wife, Teresa. ``You could
feel it the moment we got here. He's just having so much more fun
now. He's really enjoying himself here.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his well-documented disappointments at Daytona,
Earnhardt says he loves this place. Always has, always will. It is,
after all, where he has recorded more victories (33) than he has at
any other Winston Cup venue.
</P>
<P>
   Daytona had always seemed to be Earnhardt's domain, save for
Sundays. He has won 12 Gatorade Twin 125s; 7 Busch Grand National
300s; 6 Bud Shootouts; 5 International Race of Champions events; 2
Pepsi 400s; and, most precious of all, that one very elusive
Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love racing here,'' said Earnhardt, whose victory last
year snapped an overall winless streak of 59 races. ``It's always
been neat for me to race at speeds like we race here at Daytona.
Before restrictor plates, it was really fun, and it's still fun
with the restrictor plates, but you've got to really have a great
race car and a good-handling car, and I've been fortunate to be
with a team that's accomplished that every year.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all that hard work, Lady Luck had always frowned
upon Earnhardt and his Richard Childress Racing team on the day of
the big race. That was, of course, before Childress said he was
struck by a good omen while watching the 1998 Super Bowl. When he
saw Denver quarterback John Elway exorcise his demons by guiding
the Broncos to their first Super Bowl title, Childress was
ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw Elway win the Super Bowl,'' Childress said, ``I
called Dale and told him that it was an omen. He was due to win
his, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Other indicators were not as positive. It was a season in which
Earnhardt recorded only five Top 5 finishes, plus three DNFs, and
wound up a distant eighth in the points race _ his worst effort
this decade _ behind repeat series champion Jeff Gordon,
Earnhardt's nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make you proud to have a season like we did,''
Earnhardt said. ``You're not totally out of it because you finished
in the Top 10 in points, but still, it's a situation where you
can't win the championship if you're not competitive, if you don't
finish in the Top 5, if you don't race for the wins. That's where
our team is working hard to get back to.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters more difficult, Earnhardt's team underwent a
midseason shakeup when Childress switched crew chiefs of his
two-car outfit, pairing Earnhardt with Kevin Hamlin and Larry
McReynolds, the veteran who was Earnhardt's crew chief at Daytona,
with driver Mike Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Earnhardt's victory with Hamlin Thursday was
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like for it to have been about the 10th victory with
him,'' Earnhardt said. ``We've got to get our program together, and
I think Kevin and myself have gotten better and better as we've
gone along. I feel good working with Kevin, and Kevin and I were
confident all week.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that when Earnhardt pulled into the pits after
turning several crisp practice laps, he asked Hamlin if he wanted
him to continue practicing.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin shrugged and said, ``Do you?''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt shrugged back. ``What do we need to make changes
for?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Hamlin replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't either,'' Earnhardt said. ``So let's leave it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Earnhardt later, ``I feel good about what we're seeing. I
was really proud for him to win his first race with me. That makes
me proud. We've won a lot of races with different people, but it
makes a lot of difference, the crew chief does, with how hard they
work and what they put into it and how prepared you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it helps to have a little luck on your side, too.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt was made acutely aware of that the day before last
year's race as he smoldered in his garage over an engine problem
that necessitated a complete overhaul. So he was not in the best
mood to meet with some young fans as part of a Make-A-Wish
Foundation event.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's disposition went from sour to sunny when Wessa
Miller, a 6-year-old cancer patient from Kentucky, approached him
and presented him with a penny.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is your lucky penny,'' she said, handing the coin to
Earnhardt, ``and you're going to win the Daytona 500.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt graciously accepted the coin, went back to the garage
area, and glued the lucky charm to the dashboard of his car, which
has since been enshrined, penny and all, in the Daytona USA
motorsports museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here they were, about four or five kids . . . just pretty
happy to be there,'' he said. ``And Wessa was just all smiles,
giving me a penny and wishing me good luck. Here I was, worried
about a bum-runnin' motor and she's got a lot bigger problems than
I have. It made you feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the gesture send a chill up the Intimidator's spine?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, a little,'' Earnhardt said. ``I felt a lot better when I
walked out of there. I told the guys, `You get that thing right and
we'll win this race.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Earnhardt's car has run strong this week, and
it's good to know that Wessa Miller will be rooting for him again
this year. But something still seemed to be missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put in a fresh engine for the race,'' he said,
``and hopefully we'll get that race car out of the museum over
there and pry that penny off the damn dash and glue it on the dash
of that sucker and go. I've got that penny marked, and I'll know if
it's the same one or not. I've got it insured for a million.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference was drawing to a close, and the moderator
announced there was time for one last question. There were no
takers.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a return visit to Victory Lane and Daytona's
towering press box, Earnhardt drew the microphone close to his
lips, grinned, and drawled, ``Save some for Sunday.''

SOONERS' VICTORY SERVED ON TREYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ To say that Oklahoma made yesterday's 102-75
victory over Texas A&AMP;M look easy would be as obvious as saying TV
soap opera fans were tired of the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from a victory at Texas and looking ahead to games with
fellow Big 12 contenders Missouri and Kansas, the Sooners blew past
the Aggies from the get-go for their fifth consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're back on top of their game and they'll probably finish
it out that way,'' A&AMP;M coach Melvin Watkins predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners (18-7, 9-3) are certainly on top of their long-range
shooting game. The league's most prolific 3-point shooting team
followed Wednesday night's 13-trey performance in a one-point win
over the Longhorns by draining 15 long-range bombs, two shy of the
school record. OU equaled a 102-point performance against Western
Carolina in November.
</P>
<P>
   Five Sooners players hit at least two threes. Tim Heskett came
off the bench to connect on 5-of-7 on his way to 17 points. OU also
got 17 from reserve center Victor Avila and a game-high 22 from
point guard Michael Johnson on a 7-for-10 performance that included
a trio of 3-pointers in five attempts.
</P>
<P>
   OU is 28-for-54 from beynd the arc in its last two games and has
netted 104-of-273 in Big 12 action. The Sooners shot a season-best
.582 overall yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a good shooting team,'' coach Kelvin Sampson said. ``We
knew if we kept taking good shots they'd start falling. Sometimes
when you're making shots, you look a little better than you are and
the other team doesn't look as good as they are. A&AMP;M is a better
team than they showed today. We have a good team, but by no stretch
can we start saying we're really good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners now look to a big week with an ESPN ``Big Monday''
game at Missouri before returning home for Kansas on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people say that for the last month,'' Sampson said.
``Those games last week were huge games. We're on a five-game
wining streak. The more you win, the bigger they get. You just
don't get carried away one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing with confidence now,'' said guard Eric Martin,
whose only three buckets were threes. ``But if anything, we need to
raise our level as we go into Missouri and the game after that.
Just because we had a big win today or at Texas, we can't let up.
Coach has done a great job of making us realize that. And we
realize that ourselves.''

   VAIL, Colo. _ ``No! No! This is not happening to me,'' wailed
Kristina Koznick as she spun off the slalom course in the
second-to-last race of the World Alpine Championships Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up this morning thinking I would have a medal around my
neck in a few hours,'' said the 23-year-old Burnsville, Minn.,
skier. ``All last night I was thinking, `It's my time for a medal.'
''
</P>
<P>
   And so it's down to one last chance, one race, one hope left
Sunday for the Americans to be more than genial hosts _ and virtual
spectators _ at this gathering. Bode Miller, the 24-year-old from
Franconia, N.H., and Carrabassett Valley Academy in Maine, skis the
men's slalom, the final event of these games, and the final chance
for a US medal.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's slalom winner was Australia's Zali Steggall, who put
together two solid runs down the ever-changing International
course, with the afternoon run strong enough to bump leader
Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden onto the silver podium step, and Norway's
early leader, Trine Bakke, to the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the second run, Steggall was behind Wiberg by
more than three-10ths of a second, but then went for broke, taking
every risk down the three steep faces and several technical,
cranking turns. Steggall outskied Wiberg by eight-10ths of a
second, meaning that she was faster by more than a full second
through the last 25 gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think my first run was that good, so in the second
run I had nothing to lose,'' said Steggall, 30, who won a slalom
bronze medal at the Nagano Olympics. ``I just took all risks and
didn't think of anything, just going for it.''
</P>
<P>
   On every race day through the two weeks of these ``off-year
Olympics,'' the winning nation has heard its national anthem played
in the square at Vail Village. Almost daily the Austrian and
Norwegian anthems have rung though the frosty, festive air, leaving
thousands of American fans longing just once to hear ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, those hopes were pinned on Koznick, who wanted more
than anything to make up for a disappointing Olympic debut last
year when she got buried early in the first run and never came
back.
</P>
<P>
   But, alas, the best-laid plans in ski racing snap in an instant.
At 10:37 a.m., with American flags fluttering below as Koznick
started her race, it was over in an instant with a spray of snow.
Ten gates into the 45-gate race, Koznick caught an edge and was
down so fast she couldn't remember what happened. ``I just remember
thinking I wanted to get up and start over,'' she said.

WOHLABAUGH STILL FREE _ FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Patriots dodged a big bullet Saturday, and maybe their luck
is beginning to change.
</P>
<P>
   Free agent center Dave Wohlabaugh turned down an offer from the
Cleveland Browns, although they are still in the lead for his
services.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also got lucky when the New Orleans Saints, who
were very interested in Wohlabaugh and wanted him to visit with
head coach Mike Ditka, changed directions and re-signed veteran
center Jerry Fontenot.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Patriots are not in the clear. Wohlabaugh
reportedly is on the list of the Miami Dolphins and ready to visit
with head coach Jimmy Johnson. Wohlabaugh is a favorite of former
Patriots offensive line coach Paul Boudreau, who is now with the
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   The offer Wohlabaugh got from the Browns was highly unusual.
Reportedly, it was for seven years and averaged more than $3.5
million, which would have made him the highest-paid center in
league history.
</P>
<P>
   But Wohlabaugh had a good reason for turning it down.
Reportedly, the offer did not include a signing bonus or guarantees
against injuries. Almost every lucrative free agent contract these
days contains a large signing bonus, which the player gets
immediately, and guarantees on the annual salary, usually for about
half of the length of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   So it is on to Miami for Wohlabaugh, and the Patriots again will
have to hold their breath. If he becomes a Dolphin, he'd be playing
in the same division, against the Patriots twice a year _ a double
whammy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Foxborough, Patriots vice president of business
operations Andy Wasynczuk was hoping he would have the chance to
match any offer Wohlabaugh got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in touch with Alan Herman (Wohlabaugh's agent) on a
daily basis and we have that understanding,'' said Wasynczuk.
</P>
<P>
   But if Herman is to make Wohlabaugh the highest-paid center in
the NFL, a matching New England offer would seem to be out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had a similar understanding about matching offers
with the agent for punter Tom Tupa, Neil Cornrich, but they were in
no way inclined to match the four-year, $6.1 million deal (which
included a $1.8 million signing bonus) that Tupa agreed to with the
Jets on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It's the largest contract in football for a kicker or punter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Bill (Parcells) has it in mind that Tom will be his
backup quarterback as well,'' said Wasynczuk. ``We hated to lose
Tom. He's a good player, a wonderful guy, and we would have loved
to have had him. But during the season, when we needed to turn to
another quarterback when Drew (Bledsoe) was down, it wasn't Tom we
turned to.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is tired of the Jets raiding the Patriots, Wasynczuk
said, ``There's a familiarity with our players, and with
familiarity there is a comfort level that Bill has with those
players. That's understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk added, however, that he is not going to make it a
practice to restructure contracts as often as the Jets do. ``It's
like a credit card,'' said Wasynczuk. ``At some point, the payment
comes due.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk recently did reorganize the contracts of Willie
McGinest and Vincent Brisby, as well as releasing Ferric Collons,
who was scheduled to earn $2.1 million, as the Patriots try to
maneuver for salary cap room.
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk hopes to get something done with defensive tackle
Henry Thomas, though he knows the veteran will get other offers.
``We want Henry and I know Henry wants to be here,'' said
Wasynczuk. ``I know the agent will come back to us if he feels
Henry has received an offer that we need to be aware of. But again,
we have to look at how that would impact our team not only now but
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is being pursued by seven teams, five in the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   Special teamer Larry Whigham and defensive end Devin Wyman, both
unrestricted free agents, will visit with the Minnesota Vikings
Sunday.

TIGHT CAP CAUSING HEADACHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By RON BORGES 
c.1999 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was not a good week for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   If embattled head coach Pete Carroll didn't have enough to worry
about already, he learned Friday that running back Robert Edwards's
knee injury might well end his career, punter Tom Tupa is the
latest defector to the Jets, and center Dave Wohlabaugh will be
testing the free agent waters where they are deepest, in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing the Patriots can do about Edwards but pray that
the nerve damage and three torn ligaments he suffered in a touch
football game will somehow heal, and there may not be much more
than prayer available when it comes to Wohlabaugh, either, if their
claims earlier in the week of being $5 million over the salary cap
are to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots renegotiated several contracts to get under the cap
number of $57.288 million by the NFL deadline but that left them
with little room to operate. The Browns, meanwhile, have nearly $30
million in cap room at their disposal, far more than any
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland head coach Chris Palmer recognizes that center is one
of the key positions in the game and is willing to pay to fill it,
a lesson New England learned in the years before Wohlabaugh's
emergence when then head coach Bill Parcells used to lament, ``That
position is holding us hostage.'' Parcells faced the same problem
in New York when he arrived, so he went out last year and overpaid
Seattle free agent Kevin Mawae, a move that drove up the price of
centers even before Wohlabaugh went on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Patriots have little firepower to combat a run at
Wohlabaugh by the Browns and could be hit with the additional
whammy of Bronco Pro Bowler Tom Nalen having his contract extended
another four years for an average of around $4 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   That would set the market for the position and make Wohlabaugh a
$3 million- to $3.5 million-a-year player at a time when the
Patriots are struggling to find cap room and Cleveland is rolling
in dough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Cleveland wants a free agent, they'll get him,'' said New
Orleans Saints president Bill Kuharich Friday. ``If you get in a
competition with them, you've got a problem. They can pay almost
any price and for you to compete with them your roster is going to
be affected. You may be able to sign someone but you'll pay so much
you'll have to get rid of several other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised New England didn't get Wohlabaugh done before
he became a free agent because he's the best center available. If
he gets on the open market, he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it becomes a domino situation. If New England loses him,
they have to get someone, so they take a guy like (the Giants'
Lance) Scott or (Washington's) Cory Raymer from the next tier down
and have to overpay him, and that escalates everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It also would weaken an offensive line already struggling with
age and a lack of productivity. The Patriots know this, of course,
but the question is can they do anything about it?
</P>
<P>
   If Wohlabaugh goes, the dismantling of a team that was in the
Super Bowl three years ago will have continued, and there is a
point at which such defections reach critical mass, as the Steelers
finally learned last year. New England may not be there yet, but it
may not be far off.
</P>
<P>

   The Browns' plan for building their franchise became obvious in
the expansion draft. Cleveland took 37 players but only two had a
salary cap value greater than $1 million, and the total expenditure
was just over $18 million. That has left the Browns with so much
room under the cap that it puzzled a man who knows a thing or two
about building a team from scratch. ``They took a slightly
different approach than we did,'' said Michael Huyghue, the
Jacksonville Jaguars' senior vice president for football
operations. ``We had a view with youth in mind, as they do, but we
felt the greatest strength was in the college draft, then free
agency, then the expansion draft. They perhaps put more emphasis on
free agency first, judging by their approach to the expansion list.
No one has ever been able to spend $30 million in cap room in a
year because you'd be spending more than double that (in
contracts), but they have that kind of room. You'd have to do a
very heavy amount of spending to eat up even $20 million in cap
room. When we did it, we felt (the expansion draft) was an
opportunity to experiment with a few veteran players where you
could only pay the cash portion of their salary and cut them at the
end of camp if things didn't work out.'' Instead, Cleveland went
almost exclusively with youth, drafting only one player over 30 _
San Francisco linebacker James Williams. Beyond that, they went for
players who cost little and primarily played one of two positions _
offensive line or defensive back. Of the Browns' 37 selections, 10
were defensive backs and nine offensive linemen. Jim Pyne will
forever be remembered as the first of the new Browns, being their
No. 1 selection after starting 16 games for the Lions last year at
center. But center may not be his position in Cleveland because he
is considered a better guard (which he played in Tampa Bay), even
though he prefers being over the ball. If the Browns sign
Wohlabaugh, they would shift Pyne to guard and have 40 percent of a
good line in place . . . The Ravens were not among the teams making
last-minute decisions to put franchise tags on their top free
agents, in part because of the acrimonious results of doing so with
offensive lineman Wally Williams a year ago. Baltimore considered
putting the tag back on Williams or on offensive tackle Orlando
Brown, a move that would have guaranteed one of them $3.369 million
in 1999. Instead, Baltimore let both go on the open market, and new
head coach Brian Billick wasn't happy about it. ``I don't think any
player likes being franchised, which is a little irritating,''
Billick said. ``All these guys signed off on the collective
bargaining agreement and I haven't heard any player say, `Gee, it's
great that I'm a franchise player.' They're all squealing like
stuck pigs the minute you put that tag on them but that's part of
the deal.'' So is such players receiving no signing bonus but
rather 16 equal salary payments, which explains part of their
disgruntlement . . . The Tennessee Titans are interested in talking
with defensive linemen Mark Wheeler and Henry Thomas, two Patriot
free agents . . . Billick's efforts to land Minnesota quarterback
Brad Johnson are cooling, although he said he expects a decision to
be made early this week. Minnesota reportedly opened trade talks by
asking for the Ravens' No. 1 pick (10th overall) and defensive end
Michael McCrary, who was second in the AFC with 14 1/2 sacks last
year. Baltimore rejected that, and six other offers have since been
made between the teams. Wearying of this, Baltimore is now
considering a deal with Detroit for Scott Mitchell, who would cost
Baltimore only a second-round pick . . . If anyone thought free
agency would not be as insane as always, the Eagles proved
otherwise when they made a preemptive signing Thursday of former
Boston College All-America defensive end Mike Mamula. To avoid
letting Mamula enter free agency, the Eagles agreed to pay him a
little more than $11 million over the next four years plus
incentives that could push his deal over $14 million. What had
Mamula done last year to convince the Eagles he was worth such a
ransom? How about tear his knee to shreds and miss the entire
season? Well then, you might say, what did he do in 1997 that
convinced the Eagles he could be their next great pass rusher? How
about make four sacks? In the four seasons since Mamula became
Philadelphia's surprise No. 1 draft pick, he has averaged 4.6 sacks
and made his biggest headline in a barroom rather than on the
field, when he was accused of exposing himself to a waitress while
in a drunken stupor. But agent Brad Blank convinced the
Philadelphia brass that teaming a healthy Mamula with Hugh Douglas
(12 sacks last season) could bring him back to the form he showed
in his first two seasons, when he had a total of 14 sacks while
teamed with William Fuller . . . Wasn't it just about this time
last year that doom was predicted for the Jets because of the
signing of Curtis Martin to a $36 million offer sheet? Weren't they
supposed to be burdened with salary cap problems for years, while
the Patriots were home free? So what happened? Today the Jets have
$5 million-$6 million to spend while New England is saying it can't
afford to do anything. Now, with Edwards's injury, New England not
only has no money, it also has no running back . . . According to
sources, former Chiefs quarterback (and Patriots draftee) Rich
Gannon has been signed by the Raiders, whose erstwhile quarterback,
Jeff George, will be in St. Louis Monday talking to the Rams.

SPRING TRAINING IS LESS THAN ROMANTIC FOR SOME PITCHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Pitchers and catchers report'' are supposedly some of the most
romantic words that can be uttered in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But for Kevin Appier, Ken Hill and many other pitchers, the next
seven weeks will be a deadly serious time after they report to
spring training. Their success is crucial to both their team and
their career, and how they pitch in spring training will watched
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   At look at some pivotal pitchers and what they're facing this
spring:
</P>
<P>
   ]Appier: The Royals righthander is trying to comeback from
arthroscopic shoulder surgery a year ago. He made three starts in
September and allowed 13 runs in 15 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He'll make $4.8 million this year, and the Royals would love to
trade him for two or three prospects. But he must show he's
healthy. The Rangers will have some interest as do the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ]Hill: The Angels righthander missed two months last year
because of elbow surgery and was 1-1 with a 4.44 earned-run average
in five starts when he returned. He has not had a good season since
helping the Rangers win the division in 1996. The Angels can't win
without him.
</P>
<P>
   ]John Burkett: He had a bad year in 1998 until his last two
starts when he delivered two crucial victories over Oakland and
Anaheim. He's 34, but he should still be a solid, dependable
starter. The Rangers need that.
</P>
<P>
   ]Roger Clemens: The Blue Jays believe he'll be in camp with the
rest of the staff next week. But a deal is still likely, with the
Astros and Indians the leading candidates. If he does show up in
the Blue Jays' camp, he'll have to deal with the wrath of Pat
Hentgen and other Blue Jays teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ]Hideo Nomo: He has rapidly regressed since his terrific rookie
season in 1995. The Mets took a chance on him with a mid-season
trade last year and he was 4-5 with a 4.82 ERA in 17 appearances.
He was 1-4 with a 6.18 ERA in the final two months.
</P>
<P>
   The reports say he has lost some confidence, resulting in
control problems. He walked 5.4 batters per nine innings last year.
The Mets signed Allen Watson in the off-season, giving them a
fifth-starter alternative if Nomo is still struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ]Mark Wohlers: The Braves reliever, plagued by injuries and
personal problems, fell apart last year and couldn't throw the ball
over the plate. He has still been erratic in winter workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ]Chris Holt: The Astros are hoping the former Dallas Baptist
star can compete for a fifth spot in the rotation. He missed all of
last year with shoulder surgery after going 8-12 with a 3.52 ERA as
a rookie in 1997. He had some control problems pitching in winter
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ]Kerry Wood: The Cubs Rookie of the Year sensation stepped up
his off-season conditioning program and says he is over the elbow
problems that bothered him at the end of last year. New pitching
coach Marty McDermitt worked closely with him in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ]Jim Abbott: He was 5-0 with a 4.55 ERA in five starts with the
White Sox late last year, his first appearance in the major leagues
since 1996. Now he's with the Brewers, who are desperate. He could
be their Opening Day pitcher, which says more about how bad the
Brewers are than how far back Abbott has come.
</P>
<P>
   ]Dave Mlicki: This guy is a decent starter, but he doesn't
figure into the Dodgers' rotation. A spring trade is possible.
</P>
<P>
   ]Shawn Estes: If the Giants are going to contend, then their
19-game winner from 1997 must be better than 7-12 with a 5.06 ERA,
his numbers in '98.
</P>
<P>
   ]Brian Anderson: The pitching-rich Arizona Diamondbacks are
likely to trade this lefthander before the spring is over. He was
12-13 with a 4.33 ERA last year and makes $1.8 million. The
Diamondbacks want a corner outfielder who can hit.
</P>
<P>
   ]Ken Cloude: The Mariners do a poor job of developing young
pitchers. They thought Cloude would be special, but he's 12-12 with
a 6.06 ERA in 40 major-league games.
</P>
<P>
   ]Blake Stein: The Athletics' second-year righthander carries the
burden of being what's left from the Mark McGwire trade. He was 5-9
with a 6.37 ERA as a rookie but has a good arm.
</P>
<P>
   ]Jaret Wright: He was great for the Indians in the 1997
playoffs, but visions of being a No. 1 starter were dampened last
year when he went 12-10 with a 4.72 ERA. The talent is still there
for a breakthrough season.
</P>
<P>
   ]Justin Thompson: The Tigers lefthander struggled last year to
overcome elbow problems. He should be stronger this year and a
legitimate All-Star candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ]Hideki Irabu: The Japanese Nolan Ryan has turned into just
another fifth starter in America. He was 13-9 with a 4.06 ERA
during the regular season but completely ignored in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ]Bobby Witt: He's in camp with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on a
minor-league contract, trying to crack a rotation of Rolando
Arrojo, Wilson Alvarez, Tony Saunders, Julio Santana, Bryan Rekar.
It could be his last stand.

SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS HURT TYSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The guy who says he never gets a break got his 100th
second chance last week but he may need a 101st to keep his boxing
career alive.
</P>
<P>
   When Mike Tyson was told he could serve 60 days of his one-year
sentence for misdemeanor assault and then enter a work-release
program that would allow him to train and fight, no one was more
relieved than executives at Showtime and promoters Mat Tinley and
Dan Goossen. But their relief could be temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime is said to have advanced Tyson between $13 million and
$23 million (depending on whom you believe) against future
earnings, in addition to the $10 million it paid him for his Jan.
16 fight with Frans Botha, so he could pay off back taxes and other
bills. Goossen's company, America Presents, is on the hook for
another $5 million in advances.
</P>
<P>
   Both stood to be chasing that money for some time if Tyson was
unable to fight for another year, and they still stand to lose it
if Tyson's probation is revoked in Indiana and he is forced to
complete the four years left on his 1992 rape sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's probation officer, George Walker, said last week from
Indianapolis that he will ask the Indiana judge to consider
revoking probation as a result of Tyson's pleading no contest to
the two counts of misdemeanor assault that landed him back in jail.
If that happens, all bets are off on his future. But Judge Patricia
Gifford could simply extend his probation beyond its scheduled end
next month rather than lock him up.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the relative minor nature of Tyson's offenses in
Maryland, she might well do that, and once again Tyson would be off
the hook. But either way, his April 24 fight will be postponed and
the earliest it could be rescheduled would be this summer, so until
that time his list of creditors grows.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson apologists continue to claim he was railroaded in Maryland
because of his celebrity, but the fact is, were he not a celebrity,
his probation would have been revoked and he would have been
rousted out of bed to face Gifford within hours of the initial
assaults. That is what happens to ex-cons on parole or probation
for violent acts, especially those with a long record of scrapes
with the law. If they get into trouble, they go to jail, not to Las
Vegas to fight for $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   That this latest chapter in his tortured life ended with his
arms handcuffed behind his back as he was pushed into a police
wagon and taken to the Montgomery County Detention Center was sadly
predictable. Unfortunately, so was the Maryland court's decision to
soften his sentence and bend over backward for Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of when Tyson goes back into training or fights
again, he will be broke and past his prime, a fighter with so much
ring rust on him that it is difficult to believe he can ever
approach the great promise he once showed when he became the
youngest man in history to win the heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
   He will still be something else, too. He will still be the
person most responsible for his own demise.
</P>
<P>
   That Tyson has been used and abused for much of his life is
obvious. He is the product of a difficult childhood, a hard
neighborhood, and a profession that has used him like a donkey
throughout his adult life and is using him still.
</P>
<P>
   Even one of his harshest critics concedes that. But Teddy Atlas,
Tyson's trainer during much of his amateur career, adds the proper
perspective, ``Sure he was exploited. Absolutely. But he exploited
himself, too. People conveniently forget the choices he's made. He
always wanted to just be able to do what he wanted. He was
exploited by a lot of people, but it was a joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never had to live a real life where he had to make
decisions and face the consequences because financially things
always ended sunny-side up. No matter what choice he made, somebody
was always there to straighten things out for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never was asked to develop emotionally or socially. You see
guys like (Shelly) Finkel, apologists for Tyson, and you ask
yourself what would they be saying about what he's done if a
disease suddenly took control of both his arms. See what his
apologists would say then. See if they'd still be there or if
they'd be off with some other guy like (Fernando) Vargas or (David)
Tua.''
</P>
<P>
   As Maryland assistant state attorney Carol Crawford said, ``The
dark cloud of money has hung over this case from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the day Tyson arrived at Cus D'Amato's house as a teenage
tough in reform school with a gift for causing concussions,
everything about him has been colored by money. It is why every
moment of his life has been bathed in the bright lights of scrutiny
no man could long survive but it is also why he continues to make
millions long after he should have been ignored as a loser in
life's battle.
</P>
<P>
   But now Tyson cannot fight the way he once did. Now he cannot
pack arenas with fans as he once did or sell pay-per-view buys as
he once did. Through his own actions and decisions, he has
transformed himself from a great boxer into a circus act, but he is
not even a clown or a high-wire act anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has become the guy who climbs into the cannon and is shot
across the big top, helpless to affect what is to come. In such a
circumstance, people pay to see the crash, not the man involved in
it.
</P>
<P>
   That's a sad way for the youngest heavyweight champion in boxing
history to end up, but there he is  &UR; today &LR;  _ broke, beaten down by
life and Evander Holyfield, jailed, and almost certain to end up
one fight short of paying off his bills. One fight short of getting
what he most needs from boxing _ out of it.

WHERE WOULD MAVS FIT INTO HICKS EMPIRE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever deal may be brewing between Ross Perot Jr. and Tom
Hicks, it's not likely that Perot will give up his majority
interest in the Mavericks, causing insiders to wonder exactly what
the two business moguls are planning.
</P>
<P>
   The initial report indicated that Hicks would purchase 10 to 15
percent interest in the Mavs. It's not likely all of that would
come from Perot, who owns somewhere between 53 and 54 percent of
the club.
</P>
<P>
   If Perot gives up anything more than 4 percent, he'll no longer
have majority interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to happen,'' says one Mavs insider.
</P>
<P>
   Auto dealership magnate David McDavid is the second largest
shareholder with 14 percent and Richard Rainwater, the former Fort
Worth entrepreneur, owns 12 percent. There's been some speculation
that Hicks might be buying Rainwater's percentage, leaving Perot as
majority shareholder, but that has not been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, a renowned wheeler-dealer, is not a man who generally
wants a minority interest in anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not his style either,'' the source says.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hicks wanting a small piece of the Mavs' to enhance his
chances of adding the Mavs to his TV programming empire, that's a
possibility, but with Perot still the majority owner, there's no
guarantee that would make a difference.
MR. HICKS' NEIGHBORHOOD
</P>
<P>
   Hicks on Rangers economics: ``We thought Randy Johnson could
make enough of a difference that we convinced ourselves that it was
worth the investment. We did the same thing in trying to work a
deal to get Roger Clemens. It's the reality of the sport today. The
economics are being driven by a handful of large-market teams. The
Texas Rangers are kind of on the fringe of that group. We can't
compete heads up with them, but we can stay in the neighborhood.''
COVER BOY
</P>
<P>
   TCU head coach Dennis Franchione has been notified by Dave
Campbell's Texas Football magazine that he and Texas coach Mack
Brown will be featured on next year's cover under the headline,
``Changing the Face of Texas Football.'' First time TCU has been on
the mag's cover since Jim Wacker and Kenneth Davis graced it in
1985. Then again, maybe we shouldn't have mentioned that part.
ROCKET'S RED GLARE
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Roger Clemens to show up with Toronto's pitchers
and catchers at Dunedin, Fla., any time soon, even though the Blue
Jays open camp this week. There's no benefit to Clemens to try to
settle into a situation in such disarray, especially with some
insiders saying that a deal with Houston has already been reached
and that the only thing holding up an announcement is the
commissioner's office concluding its investigation of Astros' owner
Drayton MacLane for tampering.
STOMACH MUSCLE
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to replace Mo Vaughn, the Red Sox have at least
gone for bulk by signing Bob Hamelin. When Hamelin played with a
mostly anonymous team in Kansas City a couple of years ago, a
Rangers' coach referred to the Royals as ``eight nobodies and a
bartender.'' Finally, a replacement for Sam at Cheers.
COMINGS AND GOINGS
</P>
<P>
   Mike Capps, who gave up a career as a CNN reporter to pursue an
announcing career in baseball, has moved his home from Dallas to
New York and will do play-by-play for the Atlantic City Surf in the
independent Atlantic League (former Rangers GM Joe Klein is
president) this season. In the meantime, Capps is doing free-lance
work for WNBC-TV in New York.
RIBBITS
</P>
<P>
   Franchione has apparently had a sit down with
receiver-turned-quarterback Patrick Batteaux and told him he will
be moving back to wide receiver next season. He's cool with that.
... Two disturbing notes from the TCU basketball stat sheet: The
Frogs have turned the ball over more times than their opponents
this season, and their foes have taken more shots. When was the
last time that happened to a Billy Tubbs team? ... Word from NBA
scouts is that TCU's Lee Nailon is being projected as a first-round
pick in the next draft, probably somewhere between 10 and 15.
CHIPS AND DIPS
</P>
<P>
   Good news for Port Charlotte dispatchers: the famed 776
Restaurant and Lounge, closed down since last summer, has been sold
to new owners and hopes to re-open by March 1. Cross your fingers.
... Biggest non-Mavs related ovation at Reunion Arena Thursday
night was for Rangers catcher Pudge Rodriguez and wife Maribel.
Better than the one for Emmitt Smith even. ... Mariners' manager
Lou Piniella says he expects his team to be picked third in AL
West: ``But I know this: We're not going to finish third. We're
going to finish on top.''
</P>
<P>
   REVO'S RIMSHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Williams hires Master P as his agent and makes the
announcement from a Baton Rouge casino? Uh oh, sounds like one of
Tom Hicks' kids is in trouble again.
</P>
<P>
   This IOC dirty business of bribes and payoffs is beginning to
make the old Southwest Conference scandals of the '80s look like
kids playing Candyland.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mavs' first four games, poor Steve Nash bit through his
tongue, broke his nose, missed almost every shot he's taken and
blamed himself after every loss. Maybe he should change his name to
Steve Gnash.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe's Peter Gammons says a National League scout
once filed this report on hefty new Red Sox DH Bob Hamelin: ``His
best tool is his fork.'' Ba-da-boom.

HARTFORD A TORCH BEARER FOR SPIRIT OF BUYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And the winning bid for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games goes to .
. .
</P>
<P>
   HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT!!!!!!
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. How come it took so long to arrive at this natural
merger of need and greed?
</P>
<P>
   Disclosures of the last month taught us that the Olympics can be
bought. We know that those sanctimonious members of the
International Olympic Committee will gladly give the Games to the
highest bidder. We also know that the state of Connecticut will pay
any price to feel ``big league.'' So now the Lords of the Rings
have chosen Hartford for 2008. And it's a natural.
</P>
<P>
   What a time this is for the once-maligned capital city of the
Nutmeg State. Hartford's remarkable renaissance has become global
news.
</P>
<P>
   And to think that it all started with the announcement that Bob
Kraft was moving his football team to Hartford. That broke the
logjam. Shortly after Kraft revealed his plan, Hartford was awarded
the 2000 Democratic National Convention, the 2004 World's Fair, and
the 2003 Ryder Cup. There also will be a visit from the Pope, but
Vatican officials warned that His Holiness will not kiss any of the
contaminated soil around the Yo-Adriaen's Landing site.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. Hartford this summer will be the site of the
Beatles reunion concert, and officials in France are expected to
announce that the annual Cannes Film Festival will be permanently
moved to Showcase Cinema in East Hartford and renamed the Hartford
Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say we have an inferiority complex,'' quipped Hartford
Mayor Mike Peters. ``Well, I guess this will shut them up.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that the 2008 Games will be going to Hartford
came after all IOC members received free million-dollar life
insurance policies from Hartford Olympic Committee members (don't
laugh; you think it's easy getting a term-life policy for Juan
Antonio Samaranch?), scholarships to Yale for their kids, and
genuine Hartford cigar wrappers. With sheeplike precision, the
Connecticut Legislature also was active in the bidding, promising
IOC members Super Bowl tickets and ``walking-around money,'' which
was casually requested in random e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland also announced that the new Yale Bowl will serve as
soccer stadium for the 2008 Olympics. Cycling will be held in
nearby Avon, Conn., and Hartford's Colt Park will be Hartford's
version of Atlanta's Centennial Park.
</P>
<P>
   Having bought the Olympics, the Democratic Convention, the
World's Fair, the Ryder Cup, the Beatles, the Cannes Film Festival,
and the Patriots, Hartford now has its sights set on future Super
Bowls, but that can't happen until there is a football stadium, and
it's still not clear when the Patriots will begin playing in their
new $375 million playpen. Connecticut Gov. John Rowland and Kraft
have been greco-roman wrestling on the carpet of the governor's
mansion in their efforts to resolve potential problems over a steam
plant and removal of toxic waste.
</P>
<P>
   In accordance with the latest round of negotiations between the
Patriots and Rowland, the team is expected to start playing games
in Hartford sometime around 2009 _ or the year after the Red Sox
win their next World Series, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the governor and Kraft are still saying nice
things. After winning the Olympic Games, Rowland went out of his
way to recognize Kraft, a man who loves to be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owe a lot of this to Robert Kraft,'' said the governor.
``He was the first one to believe in us. Once we got the Patriots,
other people started to take Hartford seriously again. Plus, we
found out that if you fork over ridiculous sums to make the rich
richer, they'll come to your city no matter how dreadful it appears
to be. Hey, it worked for Atlanta. Why not us?''
</P>
<P>
   Hartford citizens applauded the announcement. IOC officials
expressed their glee by rattling their jewelry.

GORDON READY TO PUT UP ANOTHER STRONG FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ At almost every race in the NASCAR Winston
Cup Series, Jeff Gordon has come to be regarded as the man to beat.
When the the 51st season kicks off with Sunday's Daytona 500, it
will be no different for the two-time defending (and three-time
overall) Winston Cup champion from Pittsboro, Ind., who will start
from the pole position in an all-Hoosier front row alongside Tony
Stewart, a rookie from Rushville, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderboy don't bother me none down here,'' quipped Dale
Earnhardt, the 1998 Daytona 500 winner who ranks as the winningest
driver at Daytona International Speedway with 33 career victories
to his name.
</P>
<P>
   But Earnhardt's jocularity gave way to a certain resignation
when he added, ``He'll be tough just the same, just like the rest
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even tougher.
</P>
<P>
   When Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas gives the command,
``Gentlemen, start your engines!'' and Green Bay Packers
quarterback Brett Favre unfurls the green flag as the honorary
starter, Gordon is likely to be the man everyone will be gunning
for. The posted purse is an estimated $8 million, with $1.1 million
set aside for the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every race we go to, there's a certain amount of pressure we
put on ourselves,'' said Gordon, who last year tied Richard Petty's
modern record with 13 victories and is attempting to become only
the second three-peat Winston Cup champion, after Cale Yarborough
(1976-78). ``I don't really pay attention to what's written in the
papers or what's on TV. I'm on the pole, and we've got a fast race
car. I think we've got the combination to win the Daytona 500 this
year, the best I've ever had, and I think we've got an even
stronger team than we had last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pressure I'm putting on myself, that we're putting on
ourselves. It's not you're on the pole; it's you should win.''
</P>
<P>
   As an added incentive, Gordon will be one of five drivers _
along with Dale Jarrett, Terry Labonte, Jimmy Spencer, and Jeremy
Mayfield _ vying for the $1 million Winston No Bull 5 bonus, which
also will be paid to one of five select fans whose driver wins the
race. Gordon qualified for the bonus by finishing in the Top 5 at
the previous No Bull 5 event, Oct. 11 at Talladega, Ala., won by
Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gordon won two of the three No Bull 5 bonuses he was
eligible for, all of which bolstered his season winnings to a
record $9,306,584.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already a big enough race,'' Gordon said. ``And you put
an extra million dollars out there for the drivers and you put an
extra million dollars out there for the fans, I can't think of a
better way to get the season started. We've got a good car. We'll
see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon can expect stiff opposition from the No. 6 Valvoline Ford
Taurus of Mark Martin, runner-up to Gordon in last year's points
chase who gave a glimpse of his strength when he won last Sunday's
Bud Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who will start ninth, is among seven drivers in the Top
10 starting positions gunning for their first Daytona 500 victory.
The others: Stewart, on the outside pole; 1998 runner-up Bobby
Labonte, Stewart's stablemate with Joe Gibbs Racing who will start
third; Jeff Burton, who will start fifth; No. 6 starter Mayfield,
who recorded his best career finish in the Daytona 500 last year
with a third-place effort; Ken Schrader, who will start seventh;
and No. 10 starter Rusty Wallace, Mayfield's Penske-Kranefuss
teammate who also recorded his best 500 finish with a fifth last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting out front and staying there is important,'' Gordon
said. ``There's going to be some shuffling going on and there's
certain times in the race when that stuff's OK, but after you get
past the halfway point of the race, you want to get the lead and
keep it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means you have to have good pit stops to be able to stay
out front and you've got to work hard to stay in front of those
guys and not let them get a run on you.''

Texas Tech compounds Kansas' free fall
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LUBBOCK _ It became apparent it was going to be a strange game
Saturday when a Texas Tech cheerleader was ejected for mouthing off
to a referee in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   YoungIt became stranger when the Texas Tech Red Raiders rallied
from a 14-point second-half deficit to knock off the No. 24-ranked
Kansas Jayhawks 90-84 for the first time in school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a will to win,'' said junior point guard Rayford Young,
who had a career-high 41 points. ``I wanted to win this game so
bad. It's been a tough year. At the beginning of the year, I
circled the Kansas game (on the schedule). I figured we'd win all
the other games, then get to Kansas and upset them. We didn't do
that, but we took care of this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The win hurts Kansas (16-8, 8-4 in the Big 12) more than it
helps Texas Tech. An ugly loss at home to unranked Nebraska on
Wednesday night, coupled with this one, the fifth loss in nine
games, nearly guarantees the Jayhawks will go into the Big 12
tournament unranked.
</P>
<P>
   Young was outstanding, particularly down the stretch, when he
accounted for Tech's final 10 points, going 10-for-10 from the
free-throw line. He also hit the 3-pointer that put Tech (12-13,
4-8) on top 70-69 with 4:20 left. That 3 came in the midst of 15
consecutive points by Young.
</P>
<P>
   Young was 9-for-17 from the field, including 5-for-7 from
3-point range. He made all 18 free-throw attempts, pulled down
three rebounds and had one steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing a better job in our four-out, one-in passing
game,'' Tech coach James Dickey said. ``That gives us more
potential options on the perimeter. Rayford did a good job picking
spots. We did a good job realizing he was hot and getting the ball
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-half turnaround began at the 10:08 mark when Tech
mounted a 9-1 run that began on a tip-in by Andy Ellis (12 points),
then continued as Young hit a 3-pointer, followed by a layup and
two free throws to cut a 62-48 Kansas edge to 63-57. Young, who
scored 15 consecutive points for the Raiders and 18-of-20 during
this stint, nailed back-to-back 3s and two free throws, cutting the
lead to three. After a jump shot by Ellis, he canned the 3-pointer
that gave Texas Tech its first lead of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can get the ball inside, get a couple of buckets
and fouls, you have to drop down on us,'' Ellis said. ``And when
you do that and Ray is hitting on the outside, you have to choose
one or the other. They left Ray and that was the wrong choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders outscored Kansas 60-48 in the second half, including
a 19-5 run over 5:23 to make up the 14-point margin. But even a
seven-point edge with 58 seconds left was threatened, saved only by
the hot hand of Young. Kansas freshman guard Jeff Boschee hit three
consecutive 3 pointers in only 22 seconds, the final one cutting
the lead to two.
</P>
<P>
   Young made all 12 free throws in the final two minutes to ice
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Tech had led through most of the first half, but never could
stretch it to more than five. But Kansas scored 12 of the final 14
points to give the Jayhawks a six-point edge, 36-30 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't feel good to be on this side of a comeback,'' said
Kansas coach Roy Williams, whose Jayhawks rallied from a 14-point
deficit for a 86-77 victory the last time they played in Lubbock
(1997). ``Give them credit for being something in the second half.
We've got to get better and quit being so tentative. We have got to
learn to finish games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders have won two consecutive games after beating Baylor
on Wednesday night. They took a six-game losing streak into the
Baylor contest and have won only four times in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as a conference performance, this was a big, big,
game,'' Dickey said.

Texas A&AMP;M gets caught in OU's line of fire
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Following a turnover on his team's first possession that led to a
basket, Clifton Cook did not hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   The junior guard came down the floor and stroked a 3-pointer to
put Texas A&AMP;M on top.
</P>
<P>
   With three seconds left in the first half, Cook pulled a repeat
on the offensive end, this time dribbling past a screen to drain
another trey from just right of the circle.
</P>
<P>
   Both shots were beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   What happened between the two shots was very ugly for the
Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M, which after an 0-5 start had won four of its last six games
to gain some respect in the Big 12 Conference, slipped back to the
bad old days with an all-too-forgettable performance against
Oklahoma, falling 102-75 Saturday at the Lloyd Noble Center.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma, which beat first-place Texas on Michael Johnson's late
jumper Wednesday, got more heroics from the senior point guard
against the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson hit 5 of 7 shots from the floor in the first half,
including three 3-pointers, and finished with a game-high 22
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate to get an easy steal from the start,'' Johnson
said. ``The opportunity came for me to shoot the ball, and that's
what I did. I didn't come out looking forward to scoring, but hey,
the opportunities were there and I took it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies didn't do much with their opportunities. A&AMP;M missed
nine consecutive shots after Cook's opening 3-pointer and
eventually fell behind by as many as 23 before Cook's final basket
of the half left the Aggies facing a 48-28 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We threw the kitchen sink out there. It just didn't work
today,'' A&AMP;M coach Melvin Watkins said. ``But we're a better
basketball team than that. They've got good players and they hit
shots. That pretty much sums it up.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no way A&AMP;M, which hit just 27 percent of its shots in
the first half (9-of-33), could be this bad. Conversely, there is
no way Oklahoma could be this good.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help matters that two of A&AMP;M's starters _ Shanne Jones
and Jerald Brown _ were slowed by the flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team is such that there's not too much room for error,''
said Watkins, whose team fell to 11-11. ``When two of your starters
are sick, you become awfully, awfully thin. It's not too pretty
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no complaining from Oklahoma. The Sooners hit a
season-high 58 percent from the floor (32-for-55), which included
scorching the nets for a season-high 15 3-pointers in 25 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Five Sooners hit at least two 3-pointers and six players scored
in double figures for Oklahoma, which improved to 18-7 overall and
9-3 in conference play, a half game behind first-place Texas, which
plays at Oklahoma State today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just caught us on the wrong day,'' said Oklahoma coach
Kelvin Sampson, whose team has a five-game winning streak after
losing four in a row. ``When the ball goes in, it makes us all look
a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   ``People overreact when things go good and overreact when things
go bad. We're not as good as we looked today, or as bad as we
looked when we were on that losing streak.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M had only 13 turnovers, but hit just 24-of-64 from the field
and made only 7 of 26 3-point tries.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson led the defensive charge out front, harassing Cook from
the start and contributing to a 4-of-18 afternoon with 12 points
for A&AMP;M's leading scorer. Jones led the Aggies with 14 points, but
he did not fare well from the floor either, going 4-for-12.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Schmidt contributed 13 points and Aaron Jack had a nice
day off the bench with 12 points on 4-for-5 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But that was far too little against the hot-shooting Sooners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were bombing,'' Watkins said. ``We were thinking about
putting a sixth man out there. Some of them were NBA 3s. That's
confidence. When you hit early, your confidence really gets
going.''

McNair at Tagliabue's mercy for Houston team
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WHAT we have here is a failure to communicate. Some NFL owners
hoping to place the next expansion team in Los Angeles have pledged
to do ``whatever it takes'' to get it there, to quote one longtime
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Others have been wowed by Houston's NFL expansion effort, which
has only been perfect every step of the way, and say Houston leads
the race. Still others say they feel strongly both ways, or are
reluctant to expand. This is mostly the old guard, which lives up
to its name by guarding things closely _ like their lucrative
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue seems to tell everyone
exactly what they want to hear. One moment, Tagliabue voices
support for a league-imposed plan similar to the one that put a
team in Cleveland. The next, he tells the Houston group there is no
such plan and his comments about the effort were misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   And in the middle of it all is Houston billionaire and expansion
leader Bob McNair. Cool Hand Bob.
</P>
<P>
   His personality has greatly impressed the NFL inmates. His
attention to detail, his answering of every challenge, his charisma
and leadership abilities have endeared him to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   But despite it all, what is McNair to believe? Like Luke, Cool
Hand Bob remains a prisoner of the warden's notions no matter how
much everyone in this expansion drama is pulling for him.
</P>
<P>
   McNair confident he'll win
</P>
<P>
   He is shackled by the massive Los Angeles market, unable to
escape its value to the NFL and Tagliabue's vision. He is unable to
distinguish whether those owners telling him they are on his side
might be patting him on the back with one hand but have a knife
placed in the other by Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   McNair has been unable to use his powers of persuasion to break
through the bars that surround the Houston bid. He is confident the
team will come to Houston and in a perfect world he should be
confident. He has a diligent righthand man in Steve Patterson
working every moment of every day toward the expansion bid.
</P>
<P>
   He has a strong television market _ the 11th-largest, which is
bigger than 21 existing teams. He has corporate support and a
football passion in this city that opinion polls say consistently
ranks higher than that in LA. The Houston bid is so much better, so
much more airtight than LA's, it shouldn't even be a contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done everything the NFL has asked of us,'' McNair said.
``We've met all the requirements they've set forth for us and quite
frankly, Los Angeles has not. It's going to be very difficult for
prudent business people to turn that down.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tagliabue, suddenly the most powerful commissioner in all of
sports, is the warden. He holds the keys for all the NFL's business
people, prudent or not.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue can tell Houston one thing and LA another because it's
his game. The NFL is his world. He can nudge this owner in a
certain direction, swing a deal with another, threaten another and
always get his way, especially when it comes to wrangling the
numerous new ownership groups that have profited handsomely from
Tagliabue's recent decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1987, Tagliabue has kept labor peace within the league.
The current NFL television contract is a whopping $87 billion deal,
which puts on average $70 million a year in each owner's pockets.
He has tried to make the NFL product attractive. And he handled the
brilliant move to quickly get Cleveland another franchise _ a
nearly $1 billion coup.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tagliabue will make the call on expansion. No matter how
much charisma McNair flashes, no matter anything, no one will carry
more clout in the expansion sweepstakes than the warden. And it's
tough fighting the warden when you're in shackles.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue exerts undue influence
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue has seen TV ratings in Los Angeles fall since the Rams
moved out of LA. With the NFL's TV negotiations likely to reopen in
2002, it is easy to see why Tagliabue might be more inclined to
work the backdoor and covertly push for a team in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he is worried civic support in Houston and the lack
thereof in Los Angeles would be a worry for him, Tagliabue said,
``In short, no.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners meeting scheduled for Wednesday likely will not end
with a vote on expansion. Instead, Tagliabue will try to gather
support for expansion and then put the issue to a vote between
Houston and LA at the March 14-18 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   McNair likely will be the most deserving potential owner. But
the call will be Tagliabue's and the inmates likely will do what
the warden says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're being strung out,'' Patterson said of
Tagliabue's public accolades for Houston but reported deal-making
for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Said McNair: ``I know we're the underdogs and I don't mind that
at all. The prospect of them saying we can't do it is enough to
spur me on. We have to find a way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston group has communicated its case perfectly to the
owners. But more than anything, it has to convince Tagliabue, and
that is a trick no less impressive than breaking out of shackles.

HORNETS HURTING MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Bass figured he had it all in place. He had a mobile front
line, players who could handle the ball as well as post up. He'd
taken some heat for signing Derrick Coleman, but he liked the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see us being every bit as good as we were last year,
even better,'' said the Charlotte Hornets' basketball boss. ``Then,
in a matter of about five days, we were wiped out.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice? Gone for a month, perhaps forever. Anthony Mason?
Gone for the year. That mobile, ball-handling, post-up front line?
Say hello to Chuck Person and J.R. Reid, two calcified vets.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have dramatically altered the landscape in the Eastern
Conference, though you may recall it was a lot worse last year in
terms of missing star power leaguewide. Alonzo Mourning, John
Stockton, and Scottie Pippen all started last season hors de combat
and were soon joined for extended absences by Shaquille O'Neal,
Patrick Ewing, Hakeem Olajuwon, Penny Hardaway, and half the
Milwaukee Bucks. It isn't that bad this year _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have lost Latrell Sprewell. The Heat, like the
Hornets, have lost 40 percent of their starting lineup and a lot of
their pop. The Nets are nicked. But no one got blindsided worse
than the Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   First, they lost both of their free agent centers, which, of
course, has nothing to do with injuries and everything to do with
team management. But losing Rice and then Mason turned them from a
playoff contender _ they won 51 games last year _ into a lottery
lock.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dave Cowens has to go with Reid, Person, and Chucky Brown,
all of whom were penciled in as bench players, which is charitable
but accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked our bench,'' Bass said. ``But now I don't like it so
much now because it's our starting lineup. I've seen injuries
before, but nothing like this, nothing like losing your top two
players at the same time. That's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither injury is lockout-related, although Bass believes that
Rice's elbow problems would have been taken care of over the summer
had teams been allowed to contact players. Mason tore a biceps
during practice (similar to Ted Johnson's injury) and already has
had surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, you think after a lockout that guys will have
tendinitis, or they'll be overweight, or there'll be swelling of
the joints,'' Bass said. ``Or a guy will turn an ankle. But that
wasn't the case with Mase. It was a freak thing, a complete
detachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass says he has no clue how to right the ship, if it can be
righted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't got this solved yet,'' he said. ``I haven't come up
with any plan.''
</P>
<P>
   He has company a few hours south in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat can relate. They haven't lost their top two, although
Mourning and Tim Hardaway, who are 1-2, looked like 11-12 against
the Celtics last week. But Voshon Lenard (stress fracture in his
leg) finally had surgery Friday and could be out for the year.
Jamal Mashburn? Who can say? He's out indefinitely with a bad bone
bruise and he has a Royal Doulton frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a roll of the dice,'' says Miami GM Randy Pfund. ``Just
ask Chris Ford. If Milwaukee stayed healthy last year, he'd
probably still be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn came to camp in sensational shape and everything was
pointing toward a terrific year. The Heat even resisted efforts
from a lot of teams _ including the Celtics _ to pry away the
ex-Kentuckian. (We're also told that Cleveland, Philadelphia, and
Portland were interested.)
</P>
<P>
   Lenard was undeniably the weakest of the starting five, but
nonetheless capable of explosive bursts that could turn games
around. More to the point, the Heat don't have anyone ready to step
into either position to provide scoring, although Pat Riley is
looking at old friend Blue Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we have players who can fill their minutes, they don't
have the capability to score like Mash and Voshon,'' Pfund said.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean in the big picture? Who knows? Miami can't
seriously be seen as the division favorite anymore, but will Riley
allow them to fall? Riley always has been able to get players to
give more because he could convince them that the rewards were
available. Will the players still buy that?
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will plod along until Sprewell returns and the Nets,
if they don't fall too far astern, should be interesting if they
get healthy. Say goodbye to the Hornets, though. And, as you'll see
below, their problems with Rice go a lot further than simply a bum
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' current six-day respite between games is tied for
the longest in the league this abbreviated season. Only one other
team, the Wizards, has a similar six-day break; eight teams have no
breaks longer than two days between games. Everyone pays, of
course, and the Wizards will play 16 times in 24 days after their
respite. ``This may be the last time this season that we are going
to have any extended contact in terms of practice time,'' said
Wizards coach Bernie Bickerstaff. ``This break really comes at a
crucial time for us because we basically had four guys who had
little or no training camp. This will give them an opportunity to
get in the work that they need.'' One of those, of course, is point
guard Rod Strickland, who signed at the end of camp. How big is he?
``As he goes, we go,'' Bickerstaff said. ``There's no rhythm right
now, especially on offense.'' Bickerstaff put the Wizards through
three-a-days in training camp, although he said the middle session
was ``on-floor review of what we did in the morning and a preview
of what we were to do at night.'' . . . Some other schedule
oddities: Milwaukee is one of those teams with no break longer than
two days, the only one in the East. The Bucks have four such breaks
this month, but pay for it next month when they play 19 games in 31
days, including two sets of three-in-three days. Seattle has 12 of
the first 24 days off, but then has a hideous stretch in late March
and early April when it plays five times in six days, all on the
road. The best schedule? Try Portland. The Blazers have at least
two days between games twice each month, and once in May. And while
they play two sets of three-in-three, one of those is the Texas
three-step and the other is two home games with a short trip to
Vancouver in the middle . . . As for Rice, his situation with
Charlotte may be beyond repair. Agent David Falk already is
``suggesting'' that the Hornets trade Rice because they don't want
to pay him. Falk did the same thing a few years back with Mourning
and worked the deal with Miami, which saw Rice go to Charlotte.
Rice isn't even rehabbing in Charlotte; he's in Miami doing
childbirth duty in between elbow lifts. ``It's hard for us to
monitor his progress,'' Bass said. ``It'd be a lot easier if he was
here.'' There also was a deal with the Lakers that Rice apparently
didn't want, although we can't see the downside for him there. Can
Bass repair this thing? ``We're going to make every effort to do
it,'' Bass said. ``Am I confident that we can? I don't have an
answer to that. But we are going to make the effort.'' Commissioner
David Stern even weighed in on the situation. ``If I could give
some advice to Glen, I would say he should worry about healing,''
the commissioner said. ``This whole notion of a player or his agent
shopping what an owner will or will not do in order to put pressure
on an owner to either make the trade or sign the contract is
ultimately destructive either to the team or the player.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Early returns on the first set of three-in-threes? Not good.
Atlanta, Detroit, and Miami all lost playing their third game in
three nights. The Hawks probably looked the worst, scoring 69
points against the Nets while shooting 29.5 percent. Detroit lost
in Philadelphia but scored 86 points and shot 43.2 percent. Miami
was home against the Celtics, who, lest we forget, were themselves
playing their fourth game in five nights. Maybe the Heat would have
won had Riley figured out what was obvious to everyone else: Dan
Majerle can't guard Paul Pierce . . . Speaking of the Celtics'
offense, former Boston assistant and general man-about-town Don
Casey watched the Miami game and liked what he saw. ``I like what
they're doing a lot,'' he said. ``No one else moves the players
around like he does. It's something that the rest of the league
simply isn't used to seeing. Everyone talks about his defense, but
I like what he's doing at the other end.'' . . . The season is 10
days old and we already have a leader in the clubhouse for first
coach to be fired: Gregg Popovich of the Spurs. San Antonio made
some quality additions, got Sean Elliott back, and is still
struggling (there was a bad loss at home to the Lakers). Why San
Antonio insists on starting Jaren Jackson is another head-scratcher
. . . What does this say about the NBA? Now that Hersey Hawkins's
streak of 461 consecutive starts has ended (he's been supplanted by
Billy Owens) and Michael Jordan has retired, the new leader for
consecutive starts is Seattle's Gary Payton, at 190. However, three
of the next four iron men are Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, and Antoine
Walker, who among them have seven years of NBA experience. Walker
entered the season having started 136 straight games and is now at
140 and counting, good for fifth. Allen, who came in the same year,
began the season with 153 straight starts . . . Stern was asked if
this year's conference-oriented schedule might be instituted in
future seasons. That would mean perhaps sacrificing some
nonconference games (and opponents) for more games with rivals.
Could he envision such a thing? ``I really can't,'' the commish
said. ``I think we like the interleague-play notion that we have. I
think that we, at least in the short run, plan to continue that and
not to take that single game away from our fans.'' . . . The
Celtics used the occasion of Valentine's Day to send out reminders
to former season ticket-holders. According to one, Doug Tyrrell,
the message went thusly: ``Roses are red, sugar is sweet, we can't
wait to see you back in your seat.'' It had no impact on Tyrrell.
``I was quite choked up, but I'm not coming back to my seat,'' he
said. ``I'm canceling my season tickets, which I have had since
1981, because it hasn't been the same since they moved into the
FleetCenter.''

Barkley out 3 to 4 weeks
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Charles Barkley was just playing too well not to have surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the league in rebounding and off to the second-best
individual rebounding start ever in the NBA, Barkley could not
allow his injured left knee to bring his play back toward last
season's frustrating limp. Too much more had become possible to
risk that.
</P>
<P>
   When his knee discomfort at Saturday's practice became
unbearable and his play unacceptable, Barkley called Rockets team
physician Dr. Bruce Moseley to Westside Tennis Club, and after an
examination of the partially torn medial meniscus in Barkley's left
knee, arthroscopic surgery was scheduled for 3 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to miss three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to do it now than wait until later,'' Barkley
said. ``We have a grueling schedule coming up. We play seven games
in nine (actually 10) days. If I didn't do this, it was only going
to get worse. I made the mistake last year with the hernia, not
getting it done when I should have. I don't want to make the same
mistake twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Through five games, possibly all played with the knee injury,
Barkley has averaged 19.2 points, four assists and a league-best 17
rebounds. His five consecutive games with at least 15 rebounds to
start the season is second in NBA history only to Wilt
Chamberlain's 11-game streak to begin the 1970 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always frustrating when you get hurt,'' Barkley, 35, said
of the interruption to his rapid start. ``There's no such thing as
minor surgery, unless they're doing it on somebody else. It's not a
major, major deal that will hinder me in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to stay optimistic. Life is about ups and downs. I can
either walk around miserable about it or I can keep a stiff upper
lip. This is just a small obstacle for me. I put too much time into
this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Moseley said the work Barkley put in to prepare for the season,
besides showing in his play, will help him rehabilitate and remain
strong when he returns. Barkley has added daily workouts with
Scottie Pippen and his trainer Tim Grover, including one before
Saturday's practice, and can resume as soon as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swelling hasn't really gone up, but now when he runs up
and down the court, he feels it,'' Moseley said. ``If it's not
going to have any symptoms, we can watch it. But if it's going to
have symptoms, it needs to be taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the nice things about small cartilage tears.
For the first day or so, he'll have to take it easy. But then, he
can start to rehab, to push hard without worrying about tearing
anything else. He can be as quickly as Monday morning on the
exercise bike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think (three to four weeks) is a very reasonable time
estimation. But it's one of those deals as soon as he feels
comfortable on the court again he could be back. Charles is in
great shape. We don't intend for him to lose any of that. The
stronger you start, the more strength you keep and the more quickly
you get your strength back. With that being the case, we're going
to push this thing hard and go as fast as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich: ``He'll be in good shape.
He'll take care of his body. He's been doing real well. I just feel
he's going to have a good recovery. That's just a gut feeling. It's
not a medical feeling. It's just a feeling with the way he was
working.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of using the few days off to prepare for a grueling
stretch of nine games in 13 days that begins Tuesday against the
Suns, the Rockets will have to use a good deal of their time to
adjust to the loss of Barkley. Othella Harrington could be the
choice to replace Barkley in the starting lineup, but Tomjanovich
could prefer to keep Harrington in his current role to maintain the
energy lift he has provided off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said he hasn't decided about the lineup change
Barkley's injury requires. But as well as Harrington has played,
Barkley's loss is certain to be felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tough, especially with the way he has been playing,''
Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon said. ``He has been a major factor
for our success. As the coach was saying before the season, we're
going to face adversity and we have to respond to that. Everybody
has to respond to the situation and grow closer to compensate.
</P>
<P>
   ``To lose a player like Charles Barkley, obviously that's going
to have an impact on the team. But to have a championship
character, you have to respond and compensate to keep it going
until he gets back.''
</P>
<P>
   But it would have been worse, Barkley said, to allow his game to
deteriorate while time passed in which he could have repaired the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been bothering me,'' Barkley said before leaving for Las
Vegas to attend the Oscar De La Hoya-Ike Quartey fight. ``I've been
having a hard time. But we're going to do the surgery. It's
unfortunate that I have to miss games, because my only goal really
was to play in every game. The problem really was my other leg was
getting sore from overcompensating, which always happens. They
didn't want me to take any chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get it done and go forward. I never complain
about missing games. People have more serious problems than that.
But these guys can keep it together. This is a fun team to play on.
They'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   So will Barkley, something he could not say a year ago when he
played unhappily with pain. Having seen the way things could be for
the past week, sacrificing three weeks seemed an easy choice.

Learning process begins for rookie Stewart
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Starting up front in the Daytona 500 is one
thing; finishing up front is something else.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the message most of the drivers have for rookie
Tony Stewart, who is the first person since Houston's A.J. Foyt to
start on the front row for both the Daytona 500 and the
Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   When the green flag waves today for the start of the 41st
Daytona 500, Stewart will be side-by-side with pole-sitter Jeff
Gordon, a man he raced against as a teen-ager on short tracks in
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the icon of the series,'' Stewart said of Gordon. ``But
the thing I remember about him is he helped me get one of my first
good midget rides years ago. I didn't even know Jeff and he did
that on his own. It shows the type of person he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Both drivers are 27, but Gordon has six years of experience in
Winston Cup racing, including three championships in the last four
years. Stewart, a former Indy Racing League champion, is learning
the ropes in NASCAR's premiere series after spending last year
splitting his time between the IRL and the Busch Grand National
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew a long time ago that Tony was going to be a great
race-car driver,'' Gordon said. ``We've had similar paths, and it's
great to see him here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I told Tony I got schooled quite a bit when I was a rookie
in 1993. I told him he's going to learn a lot. I think Dale
(Earnhardt) is going to be schooling him some at the start of this
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt gave Stewart a few lessons Thursday in one of the Twin
125 qualifying races. Earnhardt won the race by moving past
Stewart, but Earnhardt believed Stewart was using some dangerous
tactics to try to block Earnhardt and a line of cars from moving to
the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a mirror-driving son of a gun,'' Earnhardt said of
Stewart. ``He was holding me up a bit, and if your car is not
strong enough you just can't do that. He forced me down on the
apron on the backstretch. If that had been the last lap of the
Daytona 500, he would have found himself spinning around in
circles. But he has a good car and he'll learn.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Earnhardt will start on the outside of Row 2
today, directly behind Stewart. Bobby Labonte, Stewart's teammate,
will start on the inside of Row 2 behind Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony did a good job of staying out of trouble in the
qualifying race,'' Labonte said. ``He fell back to ninth, then
moved back up to sixth. That's what he needed to do. We know we
will be racing close together at the start Sunday and we'll try to
team up as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he had no intentions of taking any chances in the
qualifier since he knew his starting spot was assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a chance for me to focus on learning,'' Stewart said.
``I didn't have to stick my nose in a place where I might end up in
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get ganged up on like I did Thursday, all you can do
is look for the first available hole and try to slip back in line.
I learned a lot, but I'm not going to say what I learned because I
don't want these other guys to know. And Bobby makes sure I know
everything I need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte said the other drivers already have learned that Stewart
has what it takes to push his car to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people knew Tony had talent,'' Labonte said. ``But I
think they were surprised to see what he did in qualifying.''
</P>
<P>
   One person who wasn't surprised was Joe Gibbs, who hired Stewart
last season and gave him a year on the Busch circuit before making
him Labonte's teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any limit on Tony,'' Gibbs said. ``Of
course, he has some things he has to learn, but the guy is a racer.
He's going to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs already had one top driver in Labonte, who proved last
year that he is a contender for a Winston Cup title. But it remains
to be seen how the multicar setup will affect him.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that Labonte wasn't keen on the idea of having a
rookie teammate, but he insists he no longer feels that way after
working with Stewart over the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Labonte, Bobby's older brother, still thinks Bobby will
suffer initially by having Stewart on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new team brings down the first team,'' Terry said. ``Nothing
against Tony, but I think it will be hard for Bobby to have as much
success as he had last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart earned a reputation in the IRL of being a bit of a
hothead who sometimes pushed his car beyond its limits. But he has
been humble and unassuming the last two weeks at Daytona, saying he
plans to take a more conservative approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to take this race, and this season, as a time to learn
everything I can,'' Stewart said. ``In this race, I want to gain as
much knowledge as possible and stay out of trouble. I don't want to
be the guy that starts a 20-car pileup. You are going to see me be
real patient out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart could have stayed in open-wheel racing and had a
successful career, but he said he wanted to challenge himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt all along this is the right decision for me because I
wanted to be in the No. 1 racing series in the world,'' Stewart
said. ``But I wanted to make sure I had the right pieces in place
before I did it.''

RIENDEAU IN RUSSIA, AND TENDS TO LIKE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry David Thoreau went to the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Cousin Vinny Riendeau went to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? Because I've always thought of this as a magical place,''
said the former Bruins netminder, reached Friday by telephone in
Togliatti, some 600 miles west of Moscow. ``And the truth is, it is
magical.''
</P>
<P>
   Riendeau, 32, played his last game with the Bruins, and his last
in the NHL, in the 1994-95 season. In the last three-plus seasons,
he has played for two clubs in Germany, one Switzerland, another in
Winnipeg (IHL), and he began this season playing in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Ayr, the only team in Scotland,'' he said. ``I guess you
could say I'm a traveling man.''
</P>
<P>
   Riendeau's Quebec-based agent, Alain Tanguay, called him a
couple of weeks ago, asking if he knew of a goalie who would like
to play in Russia. Riendeau initially said no, only to reconsider
when he began to blend some childhood memories with his own spirit
of adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remembered back to '72, when I was a boy in school,'' he
said. ``Canada played Russia, and it was such a big deal. They
stopped school for us to watch it. Right from then, I was always
interested in the Russian players. I was amazed at the skills the
Russians had. There was just something magical about them, how they
played.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon suiting up in Togliatti, for a club sponsored by the
automaker Lata, Riendeau became the first North American-born
ex-NHLer ever to play in the top Russian League. He has played in
two games, won both (4-1, 9-0) and expects to stay in net through
at least one round of the playoffs. Togliatti ranks sixth in the
22-team league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a kid again,'' said Riendeau. ``It's total hockey;
I am at the rink all day. We have two hours at the rink in the
morning, running and lifting weights, and then two hours on the ice
each night. If I was 19 years old, thinking about doing this for 10
years, I might not feel the same about the whole thing. I might not
like that. But the day goes fast. I come back at night after
practice, eat, make calls, and that's about it. It's lonely. It was
lonely last year in Lugano, too. But, it's not like you are going
off to war, not knowing if you're ever coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll be back in Quebec in the spring, reunited with his wife
and three children (all adopted from Acapulco). Next year, he might
return to Europe; a couple of German clubs have inquired about his
services. He's not looking at Russia as some great steppingstone,
just a stop along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where it leads, I can't predict,'' he said. ``I did it for the
experience, that's all. I like to do that, try something that I
never would have experienced otherwise. Just a once-in-a-lifetime
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the experience is strange. A few teammates speak some
basic English, and he can communicate in broken German with his
coach. Otherwise, he spends much of his time in silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy's in the room, yelling or bitching, I've got no idea
what he's saying,'' said Riendeau. ``I don't read Russian, so I
don't know if the papers are saying good things or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Does his team have a nickname?
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't tell you,'' said Riendeau. ``How would I know?
Everything's in Russian.''
</P>
<P>
   What he knows is what he sees. He sees magic. He sees everything
he expected and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions are not great in Russia,'' he said. ``For me,
it's fine. I see the hotel and the arena. But for many people it's
a hard life here, and for them, hockey is special. It's special for
the kids, the fans, the players. You see it in their eyes. It's the
chance for a kid to dream of a better life. If you are successful
in sport and hockey, it's a better life. For a lot of people, it's
a chance to get out of a difficult country. When they are at the
rink, their eyes are big.''

   The Travel section in last Sunday's Globe carried word that a
new cruise ship, Voyager of the Seas, will include a
240-square-foot skating rink, used for passenger skating and ice
shows. That's roughly the size of the neutral zone, right? Wonder
what happens if (1) A ship with a neutral-zone trap sails through
the Bermuda Triangle; (2) Jacques Lemaire just happens to be on
board. Personally, I'd take my chances on the good ship Titanic
Redux, thank you . . . Pavel Bure's new deal, agreed to last week
in Florida, could bring him another $11 million if it is stretched
to a sixth season (2004-05), grossing a total of $58 million. Sets
the bar pretty high for some of this summer's big Group 2
(high-compensation) free agents: Eric Lindros, Paul Kariya, and
Peter Forsberg. The trailer on the play is Ottawa's Alexei Yashin,
who will make $3.3 million next season, the final year of a
five-year pact . . . Rocket Richard was in Molson Centre last
Saturday night to show the Montreal crowd the new trophy in his
name, which will be awarded annually to the league's top goal
scorer. The Rocket, now 77, has shown some renewed pep after coming
down with abdominal cancer last year . . . The old Montreal Forum,
at the corner of Ste. Catherine and Atwater Streets, is still being
converted into a multimedia complex that will include 30 movie
screens, arcades, and an interactive hockey exhibit. Construction
workers say that each night, shortly after 10 p.m., a ghost bangs
aimlessly around the debris, muttering, ``Too many men, too many
men . . .'' . . . Now that he's cracked 400 wins, Avalanche
netminder Patrick Roy can take aim on Glenn Hall (407) for the No.
4 spot in career wins. The others ahead of St. Patrick: Terry
Sawchuk (447), Jacques Plante (434), and Tony Esposito (423).
Colorado defenseman Sylvain Lefebvre equates 400 victories for a
netminder to 600 goals for a forward. It's close, but 10 players
have cracked 600, including Mark Messier this season . . . Fred
Cusick appears to be headed back to the broadcast booth, to be
joined by ex-Bruin defenseman Brad Park. If the deal gets done this
week, the duo will handle nine of the Lowell Lock Monsters AHL
broadcasts on Media One, the cable outlet that serves the Merrimack
Valley and parts of Cape Cod. Another ex-Bruin, Brian Propp,
recently joined the Flyers' broadcast team. At least two other
former Bruins, Peter McNab (Avalanche) and Charlie Simmer (Coyotes)
also work the mike, not to mention Phil Esposito handling
anchor-desk duties for Fox. Locally, of course, four more ex-Bruins
_ Bob Beers and John Bucyk (WBZ radio), Gord Kluzak (NESN), and
Andy Brickley (Channel 38) _ have traded spots on the bench for
seats in the broadcast booth . . . Lightning owner Art Williams has
found the sea of red ink too deep for his liking and is looking for
a partner to buy up to 49 percent of the Bolts. He says he has two
candidates, one with prior NHL ownership experience (is that you
again, Richard Gordon?). Meanwhile, Alexandre Daigle's new deal in
Tampa calls for a base of about $1 million, with incentives that
would almost double it . . . The holes in his defensive game aside,
Calgary defenseman Phil Housley went into weekend action in need of
only five goals to reach 300. Only three other blue liners have hit
the plateau: Paul Coffey, Ray Bourque, and Denis Potvin . . . That
one-year deal Steve Smith signed to come back with the Flames this
season has a no-trade clause. He says he won't go anywhere.
Translation: If someone wants to acquire him and add another year
at $1 million or more, perhaps he'd listen.

   Not a bad farewell for Ron Francis at Maple Leaf Gardens
Wednesday night. Flanked by Gary Roberts and Sami Kapanen, the
veteran pivot, who grew up in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, popped in
two goals and three assists in the Hurricanes' 6-5 win over the
Leafs. The Leafs played their final game in the Gardens Saturday
night _ vs. the sad sack Blackhawks _ and open their new Air Canada
Centre Saturday against the Habs. Leafs goalie Curtis Joseph wore a
special mask, one painted with a picture of the Gardens, for the
occasion. He planned to wear it only Saturday night . . . Hockey's
World Championships, the annual spring vacation for NHLers not in
the Stanley Cup hunt, will be in Oslo this spring and St.
Petersburg (ex-Soviet Union) the following April. But the IIHF is
expected to slot the 2001 tournament for February, a move that all
but prohibits NHL participation _ unless clubs want to furlough
their minor leaguers. If the February format is adopted, look for
the World Championships not to be held in 2002, when the Olympics
take center stage that month . . . Randy Cunneyworth's goal for the
Sabres Thursday night, in a 5-2 pasting of the Habs, was his first
in a Buffalo uniform since Nov. 15, 1981, the longest such drought
(he's been elsewhere, folks) in NHL history . . . Lemaire, soon
after he was hired in Montreal as GM Rejean Houle's top aide, said
he was interested in moving into the top job. ``I see all the paper
on Rejean's desk and it reminds me of Serge Savard's desk when he
was GM,'' said Lemaire. ``I'm not one for paperwork.'' As the Habs
continue their freefall, however, Houle looks destined for the
heave-ho. If Lemaire can't hack the paper weight, maybe the Habs
will split the job, leaving Lemaire the most important work _
deciding who can play _ and letting someone else battle it out with
agents . . . Wendel Clark's offensive touch has all but disappeared
in Tampa, but his name will get hot around the March 23 trading
deadline. One rumor had the Sabres' Matthew Barnaby, who has
requested a trade, heading to the Bolts, but word around Tampa is
that there have been no inquiries from western New York. Detroit
and St. Louis are expected to take a run at the 32-year-old left
wing . . . Alexei Zhamnov is in the Dirk Graham doghouse in
Chicago, after being benched last Saturday in Phoenix and then
coming down with a bad back two days later in practice. There won't
be many suitors, but possible landing spots are the Rangers or
Maple Leafs, both of whom can use legitimate scoring depth and can
afford to pay him $3 million for each of the next two seasons. Look
for the Hawks to deal Chris Chelios, possibly to the Flyers for
20-year-old wing Dainius Zubrus. It won't be a popular move, but
it's rare that a club can cash in a 37-year-old warhorse for a
youngster with true upside. Here in Boston that would be like
sending Bourque to the Red Wings for, say, Mathieu Dandenault (23)
and Tomas Holmstrom (26) _ terribly unsavory but tantalizing . . .
Ex-Oiler backup Fred Brathwaite was in the Flames' net last week
for a 3-2 win over his old teammates. Last summer, torn between two
offers (Europe or the Canadian national squad), Brathwaite phoned
Oiler boss Glen Sather and asked for advice. Forget Europe, said
Sather, because it would take the hard-working goalie out of the
loop. Brathwaite stayed with Team Maple Leaf and, sure enough, got
his shot with the Flames amid all their netminding injuries. Great
counseling by Sather, even if it did take 2 points out of his
pocket.

Rockets seek a team adjustment
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The Rockets _ and all things considered, the world _ have one
Charles Barkley. They cannot insert Othella Harrington or anyone
else into Barkley's spot and expect them to rebound, pass and score
as Barkley has and with Barkley's style.
</P>
<P>
   They similarly will not seek a roster addition. Antoine Carr is
roughly two weeks away from coming back from his knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Rockets will adjust to losing Barkley for three to
four weeks after his arthroscopic knee surgery today. They will try
to do something else, hoping to do it well enough to make up for
what Barkley had done so well before his injury forced surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
``We're just starting to get used to that chemistry. And Charles is
different than other players. He catches the ball in different
areas. It's going to be an adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rockets forward Scottie Pippen: ``You can't calculate what
Charles brings to the team. Everything he does on the court doesn't
show on the stat sheet. It's going to be tough. He's been
rebounding the heck out of the ball. He's been scoring big for us.
It's going to be tough to bring back what Charles is doing, with
the intimidation factor he brings as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington, though not necessarily the automatic replacement in
the starting lineup, surely will pick up many of the minutes.
Harrington is second in the NBA in field-goal percentage and runs
the floor well.
</P>
<P>
   But he does not draw the double teams Barkley exploits with his
passing and the Rockets use to key much of their offense. And those
plays are relatively low-risk, especially this early in a season
that began with little time for training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of recapturing what Barkley brings, the Rockets likely
will look for something to take its place. Instead of getting easy
baskets when left open by defenses concentrating on Barkley inside,
the Rockets could look for easy baskets in transition to utilize
Harrington's speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to come together as a team,'' Pippen said. ``I don't
think I have to alter my game in Charles' absence. `O' (Harrington)
brings a different style to our offensive game. It gives us the
opportunity to run the ball a little more; using his speed and
quickness to get early baskets should be great for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope everybody is up for the challenge. It's going to
be a big challenge for us. We have to start looking to create our
offense early on instead of going to a half-court game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great if we have Hakeem (Olajuwon) down there and he's
giving us some points down inside. But we have to look to get some
early baskets in our transition. That's where `O' is going to be
big for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon also can have a larger role in the low post. But he
also said if the entire roster plays better it could make the
Rockets a stronger team in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to step up,'' Olajuwon said. ``Everybody on the team
has to step up to compensate. That's the quality and the
characteristics of a championship team. You have a major player
out, but they still manage to find a way to win. That's what we
have to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Barkley's injury, the concerns about the Rockets' age
are sure to surface. If the knock had been the team's key players
were too old to avoid injuries, Barkley's would seem a case in
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an injury,'' Barkley said. ``This is not us breaking
down because we're old. I just got hurt. The doctor said it's just
a small little thing. Once it's fixed it's over with.''
</P>
<P>
   And Pippen has experience with an older team that did not suffer
the sort of injuries that prevented postseason success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any truth to that,'' Pippen said. ``I
played with the Chicago Bulls that were said to be an old team. The
old teams have more success. Injuries happen. Things just happen.
You can't say there's not going to be an injury. We happened to
lose an important piece to our puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great opportunity for this team to show we can
exist without Charles. We have to show we can exist without one of
our key players. I think we're ready for the challenge.''

HAMM HAPPY TO TAKE THE STAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE -- The queen of U.S. women's soccer is much more than
her charming good looks, endorsement appeal or her witty sense of
humor -- she also happens to be the world's best player, too.
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm not only carries the future of U.S. women's soccer on
her shoulders, she carries the torch throughout the world as well.
</P>
<P>
   So when the four-time U.S. player of the year was given the
microphone in front of a room of reporters before Saturday's final
press conference promoting today's match pitting the U.S. National
team against the FIFA World All-Stars at San Jose's Spartan Stadium
beginning at 5 p.m. -- she was ready to make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In short, when the FIFA women's World Cup begins this summer in
the United States and ends July 10 in the final at the Rose Bowl,
Hamm is hoping women's soccer will leave a legacy and pave the way
for many more little Hamm's to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Today's game, coupled with the World Cup draw at halftime, is
just the beginning of this event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on a stage now where I think we always should have
been,'' Hamm said of the World Cup. ``We're getting the respect
that we deserve. No longer is the World Cup a tournament, it is an
event. It is an event to showcase the best players in the world and
I think you have that here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm, playing the ambassador role well, said it's time to give
women's soccer the support it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the players have invested their time and now I think
it's time for you the media to make this a breakthrough event,''
Hamm said. ``Let's do what's right and make this (world cup) an
opportunity of a lifetime for others who have dreamed like we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   At the half of today's game, a stage will be assembled at
midfield to announce the final draw which will place all 16
qualifying countries into groups of four. It will also determine
first round opponents and the cities and stadiums in which they
will play.
</P>
<P>
   China, Germany, Norway (1995 World cup champion) and the U.S.
have been chosen as the top seeds and will head the four groups.
The remaining 12 teams will be placed into three ``pots as
determined by FIFA criteria.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any team none of the four seeds want to draw in
their group it is the improving Brazillian team. It is already
believed whoever draws Brazil will be dubbed the group of death.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. defender Bradi Chastain, however, said she doesn't care how
this chips fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lotto, hopefully we will come out winners,'' she said.
``To make it to the final you have to play the best teams in the
world. If we have to play Brazil in our own bracket, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time a women's all-star team has ever been
assembled. On the surface, it seems like nothing more than a
friendly, but it has become spirited the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   The FIFA team is made up of one player from each of the 16
qualifying teams and a few others from other countries. With the
U.S. team recognized as the top team in the World, the all-stars
don't want to be upstaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are highly motivated,'' said Graziele of Brazil. ``Every
girl on this team would like to beat the United States. It's a
dream for all of us to be here, but to beat them would be something
special because a lot of us won't have much of a chance when the
tournament starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain shook her head when someone asked if the game will
represent a typical unorganized all-star affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the Pro Bowl, this isn't where guys have gone
through their whole season and now they're on the beach having a
few mai tai's before the game,'' Chastain said. ``This is a very
competitive game and a chance for us to sharpen our skills. I can
guarantee, it's going to be competitive. The fans deserve a
competitive game and we're going to give them one.''

LAKERS' PLAYERS YAWN OVER RODMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Lakers got a glimpse of their potential future
Saturday: Reporters swarming around, peppering players with
questions about a guy who was nowhere near the premises.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly as it might be if Dennis Rodman indeed joins the team
and sticks with old habits _ namely skipping practices while
teammates deal with the distraction of explaining his absence.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, according to some media reports, has decided to join the
Lakers. But a team spokesman said no deal has been signed, and
there hasn't been a peep out of Rodman or his fleet of agents.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-dressing former Chicago Bull has been mulling whether
to accept Lakers owner Jerry Buss' offer to play for the veterans'
minimum salary, $610,000 for the shortened season. Buss himself
said recently he thought it was ``doubtful'' Rodman, who earned $18
million over the last two seasons, would play for that relatively
small sum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have mentioned many times that we wanted him, I think it's
up to him. I think the situation is very close,'' said Shaquille
O'Neal, a former Rodman critic who now advocates acquiring the
seven-time rebounding champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays with a lot of determination,'' O'Neal said. ``He does
what he does well. He plays good defense and he rebounds the ball
well. . . . I'm not really concerned with what he does off the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   But is Rodman coming? No one wearing purple and gold seemed to
know or be particularly concerned about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ain't no telling about him. He might be doing this just
to keep his name alive,'' said Lakers forward Robert Horry, who
added that Rodman hasn't been much on players' minds. ``I don't
think it really matters to us. It matters to the media, because the
media wants to know what he's going to do. To us, we don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowtime: That plodding, methodical team that appears to be
masquerading as the Lakers is, alas, the Lakers, sans ``Showtime''
pyrotechnics. Through five games, the Lakers are averaging a paltry
89.6 points, 20th in the NBA, and about 17 points below last year's
league-leading average.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is the running game, which is nearly nonexistent.
So far the Lakers are scoring just 5.2 points per game off the fast
break, a decidedly un-Lakerlike statistic.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is conditioning after a shortened training
camp and exhibition schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would still be in preseason, normally, and we just don't
have the habits yet,'' coach Del Harris said. ``Running is a hard
thing. That's why very few teams really have much of a running
game. It takes a lot of work and a lot of coaching, a lot of timing
and a total commitment on the part of the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry said teams are anticipating the fast breaks and setting up
quickly, but he also admitted players' tendency to go the less
strenuous route.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got such a good set-up game with Shaq that sometimes you
figure, hell, why should we push it? We'll just post the big fella
up and get easy baskets.''

Given an opening, Weiss gains men's skating title
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SALT LAKE CITY _ In other years, he often as not found himself
skating for second place, lost in the shadow of a more celebrated
rival.
</P>
<P>
   This was different, and cast in the favorite's role, Michael
Weiss was ready to move up the chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been close to it the last couple of years,'' the
22-year-old Fairfax, Va., native said after winning his first
United States Figure Skating Association title Saturday afternoon
at the Delta Center. ``It feels great to be the champion of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put in a lot of hard work. Now, I can go out and
celebrate and have a pizza tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, who finished second to Todd Eldredge the past two years,
becomes the top U.S. hope heading into next month's world
championships in Helsinki, Finland. He is joined on the world team
by Trifun Zivanovic, 23, from Los Angeles, and Timothy Goebel, 18,
of Rolling Meadows, Ill., who placed second and third.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, though, it was a competition that called more for
pepperoni than caviar.
</P>
<P>
   If there was the expectation for something sensational, it did
not materialize. Weiss, the heavy favorite after Eldredge chose not
to compete, fell on his first jump (a quad toe), but recovered to
land eight triples and earned four 5.9s on his artistic line from
the nine-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a surprise, it was Zivanovic, who never had
finished better than seventh in two previous senior nationals. Not
only was he a solid second here, but he was placed first by judge
Janet McLeod of Norwalk, Calif. (Weiss got the other eight No. 1s.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Uplifting, one of the greatest feelings in my whole life,'' he
said after getting a standing ovation from the crowd of
approximately 4,220. ``A dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was controversy, meanwhile, it was over the bronze
medal, where Goebel barely edged Matthew Savoie of Peoria, Ill.,
getting five No. 3 placements to four for Savoie (who also got a
second and a fifth).
</P>
<P>
   Goebel fell twice and had to throw in a triple axel late in his
program to make up for an earlier miss. In a close call, he might
have gotten the edge for the final spot on the world team as the
first American man to land a quadruple jump in competition and a
consensus better prospect for down the road.

ISLANDERS TIE SABRES, 2-2  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ For Tommy Salo, it was an opportunity, one that
he never could have expected to see again as an Islander.
</P>
<P>
   The trade that brought Felix Potvin to New York supposedly
sealed Salo's departure. Salo was not traded, as he anticipated
when the deal for Potvin was made, but he was relegated to fill-in
duty, starting just five games since the Jan. 9 deal. And when
Potvin suffered a strained groin on Friday night, the door opened
for Salo again.
</P>
<P>
   The injury to Potvin gave Salo an opportunity, for whatever it
is worth, to play for what could be a five-game stretch. In the
first game of that span, Salo was solid Saturday night, stopping 24
shots and matching Buffalo's Dominik Hasek, acrobatic save for
acrobatic save. He was good enough to earn the Islanders a 2-2 tie
with the Sabres at Marine Midland Arena. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy, as Salo faced repeated threats late in the game
and the Islanders had to kill a two-minute hooking penalty on
Zigmund Palffy beginning with 2 minutes 7 seconds remaining in the
overtime session. With just 40 seconds left in regulation, Miroslav
Satan charged to the net and fired a shot from close range, but
Salo deflected the puck, sending it safely over the net. Aleksei
Zhitnik fired a blast from the right circle with 30 seconds left in
overtime that Salo knocked away, and then Salo smothered a rebound
attempt by Michael Peca.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders trailed by 2-1 entering the final period, but they
pulled even when Mariusz Czerkawski carried the puck into the
Sabres' zone along the left side, faked once, then fired a shot
from the left circle that beat Hasek to the near post at 5:41 of
the period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders fell behind at 6:18 of the first period when Satan
scored his 23rd goal of the season on a nice feed from Derek
Plante. But two minutes later, after Palffy was sent off for a
four-minute high-sticking penalty, the Islanders evened the score
with a short-handed goal when Robert Reichel swiped the puck from
Darryl Shannon just inside the Buffalo blue line and charged in
alone against Hasek. Reichel carried the puck all the way to the
net, faking and then slipping a backhand around the glove of Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   In the first period, the Islanders stymied the Sabres for six
minutes while playing a man down. Salo had a lot to do with that,
making a spectacular save on a point-blank shot by Michal Grosek.
</P>
<P>
   But Salo's failure to clear the puck early in the second period
put the Islanders back in a hole. He tried to send the puck around
the boards, but it was kept in by Randy Cunneyworth, who fed the
former Islander Paul Kruse. Kruse beat Salo to his glove side, his
second goal of the season and second in the last two games, and the
Sabres led by 2-1. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Kruse left New York in a trade for Jason Dawe on March 24,
1998, he was critical of Mike Milbury, then the Islanders' coach
and general manager. With Milbury serving as just the general
manager now, Kruse still was critical. He was quoted in The Buffalo
News Saturday as saying: ``Mike is a hard guy to understand. I
didn't understand him too well. I don't know if he did what he had
to do. The guys didn't really have any direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruse went on: ``It was very negative around the rink all the
time. There were trade rumors every day. It was hard showing up at
the rink, listening to the press, and hearing what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely that negative thoughts have floated through
Salo's mind since the trade that brought Potvin to the Islanders.
The job is Salo's for now, with Potvin's struggles taking a turn
for the worse on Friday night. In dropping his record to 1-6-1
since joining the Islanders, Potvin suffered a groin strain late in
the 2-1 loss to the Nashville Predators, and it will sideline him
for 7 to 10 days. Wade Flaherty was called up from Lowell and
joined the team Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were taking a shot from the boards in the third period,''
Potvin said of Friday night's game. ``I kicked my leg out to stop
it and the puck got tipped before it came to me, and I kind of
twisted. It was hurting. It wasn't too bad when the game was going.
When I was going down it was hurting, but I was trying to stay in
the game. This is the first time it ever happened to me. During the
game, I wasn't too sure if it was bad or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Potvin should have assumed that it would be, as most things have
been for him since he joined the Islanders on Jan. 9. Embroiled in
controversy since the team has been unable to trade Salo, the
incumbent goaltender, Potvin has been singed for a 3.86 goals
against average. ``They say bad things make you stronger,'' Potvin
said. ``They told me 7 to 10 days, but we'll go for seven and make
sure it feels good when I come back. There is no doubt that it's
not what I was hoping for, coming back. It makes it harder, but
again, you can't get down on yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to work and eventually it's going to come back to
normal. I'll keep working hard. I feel like it will come back. I
feel like I'm making some good saves.''

RUTGERS BEATS BOSTON COLLEGE, 75-62  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RON DICKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ Rutgers has talked about earning a berth in
the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament for its
seniors, Geoff Billet and Rob Hodgson. Saturday night, the Scarlet
Knights' underclassmen's actions spoke louder than words.
</P>
<P>
   While Billet and Hodgson played minor roles in the 75-62 victory
over Boston College, the sophomore Jeff Greer and his young
teammates turned ferocious. Rutgers shot 69 percent in the second
half, blasting through B.C.'s wilting defense. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights opened the second half with a 15-4 burst to
turn a 10-point halftime deficit into a 37-36 lead after a tip-in
by Dahntay Jones, a freshman guard whose energetic play resulted in
8 points in the game and a shift in momentum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Greer's turn. Swooping inside and showing a deft
touch outside, Greer scored 15 points in a six-minute span, hitting
all of his shots from the field, to build the lead to 53-44. He
finished with 21 points (making 4 of 6 on 3-point attempts) and a
game-high nine rebounds as Rutgers improved to 17-7 over all and
9-5 in the Big East.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College, which fell to 5-17 and 3-11, received 21 points
from Kenny Walls, who went 5 of 8 on 3-pointers. Michael Cotton
added 18 points. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joel Salvi, the Rutgers freshman center who had 10 points and
six rebounds in 16 inspired minutes, hit two free throws, and
Rashod Kent, the freshman starting center who collected 16 points
and several crowd-pleasing floor burns, made a double-clutch layup
on a breakaway to increase the lead to 57-44. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With just under two minutes left, the Rutgers students began
chanting: ``We want UConn. We want UConn.'' Rutgers, riding a
three-game winning streak, will play the first-place Huskies in
Storrs, Conn., on Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Billet, who had 9 quiet points against B.C., and
Hodgson, who scored 7, can take heart that their less experienced
teammates might provide support to give Rutgers a realistic chance
at an upset against the Huskies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers already has its most victories since 1990-91, when it
earned its last tournament berth, and has beaten 12 opponents by
double digits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before a sellout crowd, the icy-shooting Knights struggled to
stay within double digits of the Eagles in the first half. They
trailed by 32-22 at halftime, reeling from 28 percent field-goal
shooting (8 of 29). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers' drive toward a post-season tournament is winning over
even more fans. More than 100 shivered in line 90 minutes before
game time to buy tickets returned by Boston College. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fans might have been wondering if it was worth the hardship
early on. Boston College, which had a three-game winning streak
snapped by Connecticut on Wednesday, launched an 8-0 run capped by
Kenny Walls' 3-pointer to give B.C. a 21-13 lead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jones' jumper in the lane closed the gap to 21-15, and a blocked
shot that looked more like a volleyball spike by Kent seemed to
give Rutgers momentum. But the Scarlet Knights threw up two clunky
shots and a poor alley-oop pass on three straight possessions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mostly unchallenged, Walls burned the Knights with consecutive
3-pointers to push B.C. ahead by 27-15. Walls' hot hand (4 of 6
from 3-point range) compensated for the absence of guard Kenny
Harley, the conference's best 3-point shooter at 47 percent, who
was suspended for fighting in the UConn game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers had managed just one field goal in nearly nine minutes,
but was down just 28-20 after Salvi's dunk with 2 minutes 35
seconds left. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All Rutgers could muster after that was two free throws by
Salvi. Meanwhile, Brian Bross and Willie Deane floated in jumpers
to give the Eagles a 10-point lead heading into the locker room. &QL;

DEVILS BEAT HURRICANES, 6-4  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Devils committed several
transgressions Saturday night, such as the rare double of taking
two penalties in the same period for having too many men on the
ice. They also preoccupied themselves at times with taunting the
opposing bench rather than focusing on playing hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their lack of discipline _ which included Vadim
Sharifijanov's taking three penalties in a row and Randy McKay's
drawing a 10-minute misconduct for no reason _ the Devils ended a
four-game streak at home without a victory with a 6-4 triumph over
the Carolina Hurricanes at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Niedermayer, Krzysztof Oliwa, Brendan Morrison, Petr
Sykora, Jay Pandolfo and McKay scored the goals, in that order, for
the Devils (30-18-6), who ended their longest streak without a
victory at home since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the goals in the game, played before a crowd of 17,023,
came in the last three minutes on a night of sluggish and
undisciplined hockey by two teams that fancy themselves as
contenders for the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ranheim had two goals and Bates Battaglia and Ron Francis
one each for the Hurricanes (25-21-9) against Martin Brodeur, who
made 26 saves in his 46th appearance of the season. Brodeur ended a
three-game losing streak and improved his record to 24-16-6. Four
of his victories have come in four meetings with the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed after losing their three previous games at home, the
Devils started with enthusiasm Saturday night and forced the
Hurricanes into their zone from the opening face-off. The Devils
scored first, but they failed to sustain their attack and the
Hurricanes took the next six shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took the lead twice in the first 5 minutes 16 seconds
on goals by Niedermayer and Oliwa, but the Hurricanes came back to
tie each time, despite playing without Keith Primeau, their captain
and leading scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer's goal came just 36 seconds after the opening
face-off on the first shot of the game, a blistering slap shot from
near the top of the right circle to the far upper corner of the
net. It was his sixth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Battaglia tied it at 1-1 just seconds after he stepped out of
the penalty box. He broke away alone and beat Brodeur with a simple
backhander for his third goal of the season, at 4:56.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils grabbed a 2-1 lead just 20 seconds later, when Oliwa
stepped in front of the crease on the left side and deflected Ken
Daneyko's shot from the left point past Trevor Kidd for his fifth
goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hurricanes tied it again, this time when Francis beat
Brodeur from the low slot after the Devils blew two chances to
clear the puck. The goal, at 10:06, was the 11th of the season for
Francis and gave him his 1,466th point, 2 short of passing Stan
Mikita for eighth place on the career scoring list.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison and Sykora gave the Devils a 4-2 lead in the second
period. Morrison's goal was his seventh of the season and his first
in nine games, while Sykora's came on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Ranheim narrowed the gap to 4-3 with 69 seconds left in the
second period. It was his sixth goal of the season.

   &UR; A MOTHER'S PLACE: CHOOSING WORK AND FAMILY WITHOUT GUILT OR
BLAME &LR;  By Susan Chira. Harper Perennial, $13. Chira, the deputy
foreign editor of The New York Times, argues that parenting and
working are compatible and helpful to mothers and children, and
that day care is not harmful. In 1998 the Times reviewer Carol
Tavris said this ``splendid book ... makes an eloquent,
well-documented case that motherhood does not require martyrdom.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RIVEN ROCK &LR;  By T. Coraghessan Boyle. Penguin, $13.95. Stanley
McCormick is a rich schizoid who spends 20 years holed up in his
California mansion out of sight of women because he both loves and
hates them too much. That includes his wife, a scientist,
suffragist and lifelong virgin who remains loyal to her husband
through all his years of madness. Surprisingly, both characters in
this ambitious novel are based on actual early-20th-century
figures. In 1998 D.M. Thomas wrote that even though the prose
strayed toward the purple, ``the book is filled with good writing
and richly observed scenes; it has humanity and humor in
abundance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PAINTING BY NUMBERS: KOMAR AND MELAMID'S SCIENTIFIC GUIDE TO
ART &LR;  Edited by JoAnn Wypijewski. University of California, $24.95.
Noting the gap between a democratic culture and its elitist art
world, two mischievous Soviet exiles, Vitaly Komar and Alexander
Melamid, conducted opinion polls to find out what people prefer to
see in paintings, and then set out to give the public what it
wants. Their audacious project is ``funny, prickly, complex,
humane, dense with implications and a baited trap for ideologues
and hypocrites,'' Luc Sante wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MANET'S MODERNISM: OR, THE FACE OF PAINTING IN THE 1860S &LR;  By
Michael Fried. University of Chicago, $35. This book explains the
pioneering quality of Manet's work, which was considered to be ugly
and obscure in its day. In 1996 Arthur C. Danto called this ``art
history of the highest originality and distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TURN, MAGIC WHEEL &LR;  By Dawn Powell. Steerforth, $14. In this
comic novel set in prewar New York, a young writer betrays a close
friend by publishing a book that trashes her former husband, a
famous novelist living abroad, and exposes her as sadly delusional
about her past. In 1936 in The New York Times Book Review, Edith H.
Walton called this ``a barbed and immensely entertaining satire on
a certain phase of New York's literary life.'' The same publisher
has reissued one of Powell's earlier novels,  &UR; DANCE NIGHT &LR;  ($14), a
love story about two sensitive teen-agers who dream of escaping
their working-class Ohio town, where all the social life takes
place at the local dance hall. ``Out of `Dance Night' emerge
unforgettably real people, drawn with an unerring instinct for
characterization,'' the Times Book Review said in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER: A STORY OF TWO TOWNS, A DEATH, AND
AMERICA'S DILEMMA &LR;  By Alex Kotlowitz. Anchor/Doubleday, $14.95. A
Wall Street Journal reporter probes the death of a black teen-ager
in Michigan, revealing a sharp divide between the local black and
white communities and a mystery full of contradictions. The result
is ``a chronicle of American racial attitudes seen through the
lenses of a signal event and a specimen landscape,'' Alec Wilkinson
wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT'S GOING ON: PERSONAL ESSAYS &LR;  By Nathan McCall. Vintage,
$11. This takes on such topical subjects as the African-American
middle class and the culture of pickup basketball. In 1997 the
reviewer Michael E. Ross found the terrain to be somewhat familiar,
but praised the author's ``moral authority.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JESUS SAVES &LR;  By Darcey Steinke. Grove, $12. The parallel
stories of two troubled girls _ a teen-ager abducted from summer
camp and a Lutheran minister's daughter with a seriously twisted
boyfriend _ give the author an opportunity to explore the
strip-mall culture and Gothic religious sensibility of the suburban
South. In 1997 Catherine Texier called this ``a consistently and
disturbingly beautiful'' novel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE VIEW FROM POMPEY'S HEAD &LR;  By Hamilton Basso. Louisiana State
University, $16.95. Anson Page is a young Wall Street lawyer
dispatched to his Southern hometown to solve a thorny business
crisis; revisiting his roots, he discovers he abandoned a part of
himself when he moved to the city. The reviewer John Brooks called
this ``the most pleasantly and sensibly romantic novel to come my
way in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HERMITS: THE INSIGHTS OF SOLITUDE &LR;  By Peter France. St.
Martin's Griffin, $13.95. The author finds much to admire in the
lives of famous hermits through the ages, notably their redemptive
spirit and formidable skills of discernment. In 1997 the reviewer
Carol Zaleski called this ``a gently understated affirmation of the
solitude for which many of us long.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SALT &LR;  By Earl Lovelace. Persea, $15. This Trinidadian novel
revolves around a spinner of folk tales who represents the island's
native values, and a teacher turned politician whose adherence to
European ideals consigns him to a life of disillusionment. In 1997
the reviewer William Ferguson praised the book's ``generous,
torrential prose.''

AUTO LEASE BACK SELLERS OF TEN LOSE CARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Glendale resident Robert Haran drove his truck to a Phoenix
leasing company, desperate for a $500 loan.
</P>
<P>
   After a flurry of paper signing, he drove out with money, daily
lease payments for the truck he no longer owned and, if the deal is
figured like a loan, an annual interest rate of nearly 260 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Haran, like thousands of Arizonans unable to get loans from
banks, credit unions, family or friends, is turning to a growing
state industry of sale/lease-back businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising in Valley newspapers and offering quick cash for car
titles, the sale/lease-back companies say they're meeting a market
need: They give money to people no one else will help.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups say the companies _ 65 statewide and 40 in
the Valley _ are preying on financially troubled people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to get out of debt by doing this and you get deeper,''
said Rosemary Shahan, president of a non-profit California consumer
group, CARS. ``It's like quicksand.''
</P>
<P>
   The deals are a license to steal people's cars, Shahan says.
</P>
<P>
   And the Arizona attorney general says one of the companies is
breaking state usury laws that protect the public from too-high
interest rates. If prosecutors win the case _ apparently the first
of its kind in Arizona _ it would be an ominous signal to the
industry. &QL; 
PRICE FOR BAD CREDIT
</P>
<P>
   But these companies do have their satisfied customers.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Peter Hackstedde was down and out, strapped for
cash &UR; and flat out of credit. And he had to pay off an income tax
debt. The 46-year-old stockbroker signed over title to his paid-off
1992 Volkswagen Cabriolet, at the time worth about $11,000.
Phoenix's SAL Leasing gave him $2,500. He then leased his car back
for $9 a day.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of two months he paid back the $2,500 to purchase his
car back _ plus $540 in lease payments _ or a 131 percent annual
interest fee, if calculated like a loan.
</P>
<P>
   Hackstedde said he went back twice again to SAL Leasing for
money and still has his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is they don't offer an alternative,'' Hackstedde
said. ``The little guy needs this. If you have bad credit it's the
price you have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix attorney Ronald Meyer is defending SAL Leasing against
the attorney general's suit but is blunt about the service the
company is providing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a device, just like a pawnshop, to give people
liquidity,'' he said. ``The people who go through this process have
no credit. Granted, the interest rate is high. It's that or
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest rate sounds ominous, but it accurately reflects
the risk of the market. If you close that (market) off, the
individuals will simply move on to something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said it's time the state recognized the need and regulated
the high-risk loan business.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyist Kevin DeMenna said opposition to making high-risk
car-title loans legal ``limits consumer choice under the mantle of
consumer protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, DeMenna unsuccessfully pushed a bill for an
out-of-state car-title loan company that would have raised the
state's legal interest rate on small loans to 300 percent for
car-title loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we fail to understand is a demographic element exists
between no credit and extensive credit,'' DeMenna said. ``The point
is real simple: These individuals who have title to their vehicle
have some element of creditworthiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Hugh Hegyi, along with consumer
advocates, calls that reasoning ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all sorts of businesses advertising that they'll
give you a loan if you have no credit or bad credit _ and they'll
do it at a legal rate,'' said Hegyi. The legal high-risk,
high-interest finance companies charge about 29.9 percent, an
interest rate permitted by state law, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a very high interest rate,'' Hegyi said. ``And these
places are making money hand over fist.''
</P>
<P>
   These legal high-risk finance companies must also comply with
the state's Consumer Lending Act, and explain the loan to their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with sale/lease back is also the whole deceptive
nature of what they do,'' said Todd Lang, Community Legal Services'
consumer attorney. Clients come into his office who never
understood their sale/lease back deals and are horrified that they
lost a car valued at $7,000 or $9,000 for a $1,500 loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they pretend it's not a loan, they don't disclose
anything,'' Lang said about the sale/lease back companies. &QL; 
NOT ALL HAPPY STORIES
</P>
<P>
   The deal Haran struck cost him his truck.
</P>
<P>
   He got behind on the payments to SAL Leasing and late fees
mounted. According to Haran's contract, once a payment was three
days late a $25 fee was assessed and his lease payments nearly
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Haran suddenly found himself faced with swelling debt, no way to
pay it back, no way to repurchase his truck and a threatening
letter from the company demanding his 1994 truck and telling him it
had already been reported stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a dam broke,'' said Haran, who now drives a 1988
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I didn't read it thoroughly enough. Maybe I should have
taken the papers home. They tell you to do that,'' said Haran, 47,
a Marine veteran of the Vietnam War and Legislative District 17's
Republican chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it should be legal. If you're going to advertise
as a loan, make it a loan. I wish I never went down there.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure how many people lose their cars in
sale/lease-back deals. The attorney general's research into one
company shows about one out of seven customers loses the car. &QL; 
LOAN OR LEASE?
</P>
<P>
   Lending money on a vehicle title is not illegal _ as long as
lenders are licensed and charge less than 36 percent annual
interest. State law caps interest at 36 percent for one-time loans
under $10,000 and credit cards. It also applies to revolving loans
under $25,000 that are secured by home equity.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the law is to make sure finance companies do not
take advantage of people who need money, Hegyi said.
</P>
<P>
   Sale/lease-back businesses get a higher return and attempt to
avoid usury laws by structuring their deals as leases, not loans,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deals are simple and require little more from the customer
than a paid-off car, a license, an extra car key and proof of an
address. Most are completed in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The customer sells the car to the company for about 10 to 20
percent of its retail Blue Book value. The company keeps the title
it now owns.
</P>
<P>
   The customer leases back the car for a daily rate. If the
customer makes all the payments, he can buy back his car for the
original purchase price within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lease payments are made twice a month and the customer is
responsible for maintaining liability insurance on the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The state Attorney General's Office calculated that the rate at
SAL Leasing ranged from $5 to $14 a day. If it is calculated as a
loan, the company charged an average of 214 percent annual interest
rate. &QL; 
CHANGES PROPOSED
</P>
<P>
   The high-risk, high-interest loan industry serves low-income
people with no credit or bad credit. Under Arizona's usury laws,
these finance companies must be licensed and keep their interest
rates within the legal 36 percent cap.
</P>
<P>
   Many finance companies want that interest cap to be removed, and
the idea has support at the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the proposed &UR; bill, to allow 300 percent interest on
car-title loans, passed the House before it was stopped by the
attorney general's complaints. This year, there are no specific
car-title loan bills, but at least two bills being considered by
lawmakers would remove interest limits on small loans.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, national consumer groups and some state
attorneys general have fought to preserve usury laws and stop the
spread of high interest title loans or similarly structured
sale/lease-back deals.
</P>
<P>
   Title loans are legal in about 25 states, but interest rates
companies are allowed to charge vary from 30 percent a year to 264
percent. They flourish, advocates say, only in states that permit
very high interest limits or have no usury laws and, therefore, no
cap on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They target people who are living hand to mouth, who are
financially vulnerable, and they know they're easy prey,'' said
CARS' Shahan.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Burkholder, an attorney and executive director of the
Consumer Law Center of the South, has been tracking the growth of
the legal car-title loan business, which she calls ``legalized
extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Those in the car-title loan industry like to say they are
meeting a big need and taking a big risk, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's the risk? There are two kinds of car-title loan
businesses: places that want to take your car _ they're hoping
you'll miss a payment _ and others who just want to keep you in
debt.'' &QL;

TKACHUK'S STAND LEAVES HIM SITTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Coyotes'  &UR; Keith Tkachuk has been folded and
mutilated in front of the crease all year and decided enough was
enough in Saturday's 4-1 win over Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a two-minute instigating penalty, a five-minute
major for pummeling Colorado's  &UR; Sylvain Lefebvre and a 10-minute
misconduct. It sidelined him for all but four minutes of the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   It also wiped out the final 41 seconds of a Coyotes'
first-period power play chance, which would normally infuriate
Coach
 &UR; Jim Schoenfeld, who wasn't the least bit upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to make a stand sometimes,'' Schoenfeld said. ``He's
big and strong enough to take care of himself. He can't put himself
in a position to allow opposition players to take liberties with
him at the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does, No. 1, he can't play his game. No. 2, he'll be on
the injury shelf all the time because of the cross checks and other
nonsense that goes on there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk was puzzled over the instigator and misconduct penalties
levied by referee  &UR; Don Koharski. The incident started after he was
cross checked several times on the back of his bare neck by
Lefebvre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when you go to the front of the net a lot of stuff
happens,'' said Tkachuk, who has had to play with broken ribs
acquired in net skirmishes. ``I've had too many injuries this year
by cross checks, especially my ribs, and I'm just sick of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld said the Coyotes will review the tape and likely
appeal the instigator penalty. Three instigator penalties means a
one game suspension. &QL; 
No foul
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes also weren't pleased with the two holding calls by
Koharski that gave Colorado a two-man advantage for 1:29 in the
final period with Phoenix ahead 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad call,'' said  &UR; Juha Ylonen, who was whistled for
holding behind the net for the first penalty. ``I knocked the guy
down in front of the net. He got up and we were digging for the
puck. He fell down on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 31 seconds later, fellow Finn  &UR; Teppo Numminen joined Ylonen
in the sin bin for holding superstar  &UR; Peter Forsberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a weak call, but it happens when you're playing against
the best players,'' Numminen said. &QL; 
Staying focused
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes often follow big wins with lackluster efforts
against sub .500 teams, which means today's game with Anaheim,
which is 1-0-2 vs. Phoenix, could be testy.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we look past them?'' quizzed Tkachuk. ``Why would we?
We haven't beaten them this year. They have one of the best 1-2
punches in the league in  &UR; (Paul) Kariya and  &UR; (Teemu) Selanne and
are a solid team. We have to prove something to them.'' &QL;

A GAME OF ARENA CHICKEN WITH HOCKEY ON THE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two basic tenets about sports franchises:
</P>
<P>
   You never know how much you want them until they leave. And once
they're gone, it costs twice as much to get them back.
</P>
<P>
   That in mind, what to make of Richard Burke's ``Plan B''? A
revelation from the Coyotes' owner that the only alternative to an
unsuccessful referendum is taking his hockey team to another state?
</P>
<P>
   Or of his Saturday correction that there is no ``Plan B''?
</P>
<P>
   Very likely, nothing but the realization that a hostage game
will not go over well in a state that has kept Bill Bidwill on an
11-year waiting list. A state where guns are in, government is out
and taxes are treated like instruments of the devil. A state full
of migrants who have fled communal backgrounds, with some of them
arriving here only to put up walls, to live in selfish isolation,
to mind their own business without any mandated participation.
</P>
<P>
   So the game of chicken has taken another turn. From veiled
threats to backpedals to not-so-fond farewells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under these circumstances, I wish Mr. Burke well,'' Jerry
Colangelo said on Saturday. ``Be it in Arizona or elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Look, no one wants the Coyotes to leave Arizona. No one wants
the Cardinals to leave. No one wants a demotion to the minor league
of sports towns once you've reached the big time.
</P>
<P>
   For precedent, take a look at Houston, a locale that refused to
build the Oilers a stadium, standing firm on principle as their
football team packed for Tennessee. And look how badly they're
trying to reacquire a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   When there is no other alternative, you do what you must to keep
your sports teams from leaving. And when you cut away all the
rhetoric and political maneuvering and self-serving chatter, that
is the real issue facing the Coyotes, the city of Phoenix and those
who will vote in a May 18 referendum in Scottsdale that will open
the doors to the Los Arcos project.
</P>
<P>
   Is there no other alternative?
</P>
<P>
   Burke claims there isn't, but every opinion on this matter must
be weighed against vested interest. Of course, the Coyotes want
their own arena. Of course, Burke wants out from under Colangelo's
roof. Of course, they'll tell you there is no other option.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Coyotes are also convinced that Arizona's
embrace of hockey is a residue of their slick marketing efforts and
their self-lauded business acumen. What they don't realize is this:
</P>
<P>
   Part of their acceptance is a result of their current address.
By sharing a building with the Suns, by playing next door to the
Diamondbacks, they are part of the triangle. Part of the sporting
renaissance in the Valley. Part of the athletic epicenter that
helps define a new identity.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of something bigger than just hockey, a feeling
that has translated into some mass-market appeal. Maybe not in
tickets sold, but in the public conscience.
</P>
<P>
   On Scottsdale and McDowell roads, they will be a hockey team and
nothing more. Certainly good enough for the puck-heads, but if the
team is not largely successful on the ice, they will slip back into
the shadows of a cult following. Bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   If the Coyotes move to Scottsdale, Colangelo will likely bring
in a minor league hockey team to America West Arena. To fulfill the
required amount of dates for his suite-holders. To spite Burke, as
if that weren't reason enough. You can bet on that, too.
</P>
<P>
   It is times like this when you know who is representing whom and
just how much backbone your politicians possess. If America West
Arena is really owned by the city of Phoenix, couldn't the mayor
step in and work something out? Find a way to make two men
financially cohabit under one roof?
</P>
<P>
   When the plans are unveiled in the near future, we will know
whether the city's $10 million reconfiguration plan is a viable
option or just a crude slap in the face, a way to say they tried to
make things work.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it's just as interesting that Burke has dismissed the
idea out of hand, vowing Friday that under no circumstances will he
remain at America West Arena once his lease expires in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised and disappointed by Mr. Burke's comments
regarding the fact that the Coyotes are finished at America West
Arena,'' Colangelo said. ``I was happy to bring the NHL to Phoenix,
and my goal was for it to remain there as long as there was a
hockey team in Arizona. But that's totally out of my control now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but you can't convince me that there isn't a way to divvy
up the revenue streams floating through AWA if the seating problem
is corrected. That is, if the city really owns the building, if
it's really serving the constituents and not just Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   It is a time like this that a city steps up or bows its head in
shame.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, this battle is getting crazy, with behind-the-scenes
posturing starting to slip into our lives. Now that Burke has
sought out newspaper space to deny ``unpublished'' rumors, what's
next? A claymation confrontation between Colangelo and Burke on
MTV's ``Celebrity Death Match''?
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the mysterious disappearance of `Plan B`, where
could Burke go? The NHL is a party keg that's nearly tapped, with
teams already popping up in the strangest outposts. In two years,
they'll be at 30 teams. Unless Burke wants to return to Canada,
where their dollar is worth 56 cents here, the options aren't good.
</P>
<P>
   It's both funny and sad what Colangelo's power does to people.
No doubt, part of Burke's reluctance to hang around AWA is the
creeping suspicion that he'll never get a fair shake; the paranoia
that emerges when you believe everyone in town bows to King Jerry.
And at the end of the day, maybe they do.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Mr. Burke, meet Mr. Bidwill.
</P>
<P>
   For now, there may be no better spectator sport than the
dynamics of ownership in Arizona. If not for the consequences. &QL;

ACES AT HEART: D-BACKS HAVE ALL THE CARDS FOR GOOD STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Remember the feeling you had as a kid? Flying down the
road on your bicycles, cards attached to the spokes with
clothespins. Free as the breeze, hardly a care in the world.
Flap-flap-flap.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks pitching coach Mark Connor is starting to have that
feeling. He's ready to put on his purple jacket, sunglasses and cap
and go for a ride when pitchers and catchers report to Tucson
Electric Park on Wednesday and begin workouts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the deep pockets of Managing General Partner Jerry
Colangelo, the pitching staff was upgraded in a big way over the
winter. That will allow Connor to attach several aces to his spokes
and maybe even a wild card or two.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrivals are left-hander Randy Johnson, right-hander
Todd Stottlemyre, right-hander Armando Reynoso, all starters, and
left-handed middle reliever Greg Swindell. Reliables returning from
the inaugural rotation are right-hander Andy Benes and left-hander
Omar Daal.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Gregg Olson returns as the closer after his 30
saves resurrected his career.
</P>
<P>
   And Connor's primary wild card will be left-hander Brian
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The club's top pick in the expansion draft, Anderson finished
12-13 in 32 starts. Because of the recent additions, rumors have
been circulating regarding his possible trade. But he's not likely
to go until later in the spring, after other clubs have assessed
their needs and the Diamondbacks have done likewise.
</P>
<P>
   If Anderson stays, he probably would go to the bullpen, although
Connor says he will get starters' innings in the spring. Simply
put, Anderson provides flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Arizona will have the best rotation in the National
League, other than Atlanta. That remains to be seen. No one is more
anxious to find out than Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a group of guys with proven track records, but
they still have to go out and perform,'' Connor said. ``It does
make you feel a little more secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor will monitor 30 pitchers, including 10 non-roster
invitees. He has seen Johnson, Stottlemyre, Reynoso and Swindell
from the opposing dugout over the years, but will sit down with
each and talk about what throwing approach allows them to get the
most out of their spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to go out there to try and kill somebody,''
Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our rotation is somewhat set, but we do have that flexibility.
Anderson has started, as has Amaury Telemaco (the right-hander had
18 starts for Arizona in 1998). It reminds me of one year when I
was with the Yankees. We had seven or eight guys capable of
starting and wondered what would happen, but it all shook out by
the end of the spring and that took care of it. That should happen
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 35, has a career record of 143-79 with a 3.36 ERA and
2,329 strikeouts. Connor knows there aren't many new things he can
impart to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a case of me moving in and showing him all these
things, but what he needs me to do for him, such as look at his
mechanics and making sure he maintains his consistency,'' Connor
said. ``He knows what he has to do. It's more a matter of me
putting the ball in his hand and giving him a pat on the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor said Stottlemyre, who was a combined 14-13 for St. Louis
and Texas in 1998, has many similarities to Benes, who was 14-13
for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd can locate three or four pitches very well, he's durable
and is a great athlete,'' Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks will be careful with Reynoso, who was 7-3 with
the New York Mets last season as he rebounded from shoulder and
elbow surgeries. Connor has watched Reynoso on tape and said he has
a very solid delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a power guy, but he can change speeds very
effectively,'' Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Swindell, 32, is a one-time starter who had added length to his
career with the move to the bullpen. Swindell pitched in a combined
81 games (90 innings) for Minnesota and Boston and says he is
capable of pitching in at least 100 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that will happen, but Greg will be a very
valuable addition. He's been around, and he knows how to pitch,''
Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Daal, who recently signed a new two-year contract, finished
fifth in the NL in ERA at 2.88 despite an 8-12 record. He pitched
about 60 innings over the winter in his native Venezuela, and
Connor expects him to be the same type pitcher he was in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Telemaco came to Arizona from the Chicago Cubs via the waiver
wire in May, was put in the bullpen and then became a starter. The
club likes him better in the bullpen, where Connor said he threw
4-5 mph faster than he did as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Olson long has been known for a nasty curveball, but Connor said
the key to his resurgence has been an ability to rely on other
pitches when the curve isn't working and his continual adjustment
to hitters and situations.
</P>
<P>
   If Olson struggles, young right-hander Ben Ford (13 saves at
Triple-A Tucson) or Cuban right-hander Vladimir Nunez could step
in. Connor said the 6-foot-7, 23-year-old Ford needs better command
of his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Since defecting from Cuba and coming to Arizona as a free agent
in 1996, Nunez has matured as a person and as a pitcher, Connor
said. He has added a split-finger pitch and a stint in the Arizona
Fall League in 1998 should add to his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter figures to have six men in the bullpen.
With Olson and Swindell locked in for two spots, that leaves
Telemaco, Ford, Nunez, right-handers Bobby Chouinard, Aaron Small,
Clint Sodowsky, left-hander Brian Shouse and non-roster
right-handers Frank Castillo and Dan Carlson to battle for the
other four.
</P>
<P>
   The team's top three young pitching prospects _ right-handers
Brad Penny and John Patterson and left-hander Nick Bierbrodt _ also
will be in camp as non-roster invitees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to take innings away from the other guys,
but they'll get a good look. They think they belong here, and
they're going to see what it's really like. It will be good
experience for them,'' Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   This will be quite a different camp from 1998. Connor wants to
hear the flap-flap-flap of those aces on the spokes and will keep
his fingers crossed that the tires don't go flat-flat-flat. &QL;

BACK TO SQUARE 1 MOST LIKELY MOVE FOR BLACKHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Toronto Maple Leafs and the rest of the NHL said goodbye to
storied Maple Leaf Gardens on Saturday night. How fitting it was to
see the woeful Chicago Blackhawks on hand for the farewell.
</P>
<P>
   This once-proud franchise has hit absolute rock bottom and is on
the verge of saying goodbye again, this time to more of its
underachieving players. Chicago took a seven-game losing streak
into Saturday's game at Toronto, and General Manager  &UR; Bob Murray
promised changes are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to do something, we're going to do it now,'' he
said. ``I don't believe in waiting for the (March 23 trading)
deadline. A team like Detroit can do that and add a player. But we
can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray must decide whether his team still has any kind of shot
at making the playoffs. If not, then he will scrap the season,
pawning off high-priced and veteran players in exchange for
prospects and draft picks to start a total rebuilding process.
</P>
<P>
   Expect the latter. There already has been talk about dealing
captain  &UR; Chris Chelios and promising forwards  &UR; Eric Daze, Ethan
Moreau and former Coyotes  &UR; Alexei Zhamnov and  &UR; Chad Kilger. And
now, veteran center  &UR; Doug Gilmour, for whom the club shelled out
$16 million over three years this summer as one of the most
sought-after free agents on the market, reportedly is on the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I heard it,'' a grim-faced Gilmour said.
</P>
<P>
   Chelios is so steammed that his name keeps being mentioned in
trade rumors that he requested a one-on-one meeting with Blackhawks
Owner  &UR; Bill Wirtz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I signed here for three years to retire here,'' Chelios said.
``I'm a Blackhawk, and I want to stay here. I'm not the type of guy
who wants out when things get tough.''
</P>
<P>
   He may have no choice, but the club obviously will treat Chelios
a little differently than others. Players like Zhamnov and Gilmour
could be less fortunate. Coach  &UR; Dirk Graham benched Zhamnov during
the first period of Chicago's 3-0 loss to the Coyotes last weekend
in Phoenix, and Zhamnov showed up for practice the next day with a
mysterious back ailment.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted all sorts of questions in Chicago, mainly if
players like Zhamnov have already quit on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't lie about injuries,'' Zhamnov said.
</P>
<P>
   A perplexed-looking Graham, whose first-year job status also is
in question, stood by Zhamnov's story. Defenseman  &UR; Dave Manson said
he hasn't seen any signs _ yet _ of a player revolt or tanking on
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knock on wood,'' he said. ``So far, nothing like that has
really happened. For the most part, the guys have been really good
at sticking together and trying to make it work. It hasn't been
easy, but at least everybody's trying.'' &QL; 
Nearing Sawchuk's record
</P>
<P>
   Colorado goalie  &UR; Patrick Roy became just the fifth netminder in
NHL history to reach the 400-victory milestone last week and is
well within shot of catching  &UR; Terry Sawchuk for the most wins ever.
</P>
<P>
   Sawchuk finished with 447 career victories, followed by  &UR; Jaques
 &UR; Plantes (434),  &UR; Tony Esposito (423) and  &UR; Glenn Hall (407).
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's been a great career,'' said Roy, 33, who began
the season doubting himself and his abilities after a 1-6-1 start.
``I never thought I'd get to 400 wins and now I have a chance to
catch the No. 1 guy. That's my objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy could catch Sawchuk's win total at some point late next
season. &QL; 
Dino's dilemma
</P>
<P>
   Chronic back problems once again have knocked  &UR; Dino Ciccarelli
out of commission with the Florida Panthers. He went back on the
injured list for the fourth time this season on Monday, his 39th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' he said. ``I'm not playing the way I want
to play and I'm not happy with it. I want to get better for the
home stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Ciccarelli, who has been limited to 14 games this season,
dismissed talk of potential retirement, saying he's not ready to
leave the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried at all about this ending my career,'' said
Ciccarelli, who has 608 goals and 1,200 points in 1,232 career
games. ``There's still a lot of fire in this body. I still enjoy
the game and can contribute.'' &QL; 
Ready Freddie
</P>
<P>
   Veteran defenseman  &UR; Fredrik Olausson of the Mighty Ducks of
Anaheim is on pace for one of his best seasons ever with 14 goals
and 38 points entering today's game against the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   His 14 goals already have tied  &UR; Bill Houlder's &UR; Anaheim
single-season record by a defenseman, and he's just eight points
shy of setting the single-season points record set by  &UR; Dmitri
Mironov.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Olausson last weekend joined the 500-point club,
becoming just the 37th blueliner in history to reach the milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty much subdued everything,'' teammate  &UR; Kevin Haller
said. ``But that's an amazing accomplishment that a lot of
defenseman, myself included, won't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Olausson, who scored two goals and had two assists during a 5-3
win on Wednesday over Philadelphia, has the second-most points of
any NHL defenseman born outside North America. He trails only Hall
of Famer  &UR; Borje Salming, who retired in 1990 with 787 points.
</P>
<P>
   Can he catch Salming?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's way up there,'' Olausson said, ``but if I get four points
every night I might.'' &QL; 
Calgary's stampede
</P>
<P>
   They're in danger of not making the playoffs. They're in danger
of losing their star forward,  &UR; Theo Fleury, to a trade or free
agency. But the ho-hum Calgary Flames are dangerous themselves when
it comes to upending teams that are on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   Back on Dec. 18, they beat New Jersey, 5-2, to snap the Devils'
eight-game unbeaten streak. On Jan. 8, they snuffed Dallas, 1-0, to
snap the Stars' 15-game unbeaten streak. And on Tuesday, they shut
down Colorado, 2-1, ending a franchise-record 12-game winning
streak by the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   One would think a little trend like that might put an extra jump
in the Flames' skates. Well, Coach  &UR; Brian Sutter didn't seem too
impressed when asked about it the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't give a (expletive) about that or who we're playing,''
he sniffed. &QL;

MUSIC AT HEART OF SKATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY - Figure skating is the Valentine's Day of
sports.
</P>
<P>
   It's hugs and kisses. Hearts and flowers, red roses mostly,
laced with baby's breath. Bouquets sailed onto the ice Saturday
night like arrows shot from a winged archer's bow.
</P>
<P>
   When Michelle Kwan finished skating and flashed her winning
smile, here came the flowers, armloads of them. The Delta Center
never smelled so good.
</P>
<P>
   The sustained applause for the champion was an elaborate
heart-shaped greeting card. Inside, its sentimental message read,
``We love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Guys read this and gag. Most couldn't care less about figure
skating. The male mind can't understand how skating can be the most
popular Winter Olympics sport. Or why the finals of the U.S. Figure
Skating Championships drew a huge television audience, as they do
every year.
</P>
<P>
   The event had little suspense. The outcome was almost
preordained. In a class by herself, Kwan was certain to repeat as
champion unless she froze with stage fright or fell down during her
four-minute routine and couldn't get up. No chance of that. So why
the universal appeal?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the theatrical element,'' said Dick Button, the TV
announcer and former Olympic gold medalist. ``Skating has beauty.
It has choreography. It has personality.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the ``music,'' Cupid.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine sequinned pixies revolving around the rink in total
silence. What would the sport be like without the accompaniment of
harps and crying violins? Show tunes and rhapsodies fill the arena
and energize the skaters and transform a check list of technical
spins and jumps into a ``performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Operas. Symphonies. Concertos. Ballets. Tchaikovsky. Beethoven.
Strauss. You can't get that kind of culture at a Coyotes game or at
BOB.
</P>
<P>
   Want to win a sports bar bet? Ask a friend to name the music
Kwan selected for her freestyle program. When the guy stops
laughing and says, ``Yeah, like ``you'' know,'' you slap down a
bill and deliver the answer. ``Ariane.'' By Jules Massenet.
</P>
<P>
   No one was going to beat Kwan after she double-axeled and
triple-lutz-double-toe-looped her way through the short program to
the music of ``Carmen''.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that most guys were unimpressed with Michelle's
characterization because they've never seen ``Carmen,'' which, I
discovered after some serious research, is a famous opera, by
Bizet.
</P>
<P>
   Act I. Carmen is a cigarette girl. She rolls smokes, regular
size and king. One day outside the factory, she meets a soldier
named Don Jose. Don Jose falls in love. Later, Carmen stabs a
fellow female worker, who files a grievance with the union.
Soldiers handcuff Carmen and leave her in Don Jose's custody. Don
Jose lets her go. Carmen runs away.
</P>
<P>
   Act II. A tavern. Carmen is wearing an off-the-shoulder blouse
and clicking her castanets. The great bullfighter Escamillo walks
in. He orders a margarita. Rocks. No salt. Carmen, who isn't shy,
slides up to the famous toreador. ``Hi, sailor. Like some
company?'' Escamillo is smitten. But he has a bull to fight. He
needs his sleep. He leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a court martial, Don Jose appears. He is lovesick. Don
Jose deserts and follows his temptress into the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Act III. The mountains. Carmen is tired of Don Jose. She no
longer dances for him. She won't even fix him breakfast. She can't
get her mind off the bullfighter. Escamillo comes looking for her.
He and Don Jose exchange words. Don Jose leaves to be with his
dying mother. Escamillo goes off to fight another bull.
</P>
<P>
   Act IV. A square in Seville. It is the day of the bullfight.
Escamillo appears, with Carmen on his arm. Giving her a kiss and
assuring this won't take long, he parades into the ring. The crowd
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Don Jose shows up. He pleads for Carmen's love and gives her a
Valentine's gift _ a nightie from Victoria's Secret. Carmen tells
Don Jose to get lost. ``Please,'' Don Jose begs. Beat it, Carmen
says. Don Jose, a sore loser, stabs Carmen in the back. Carmen
dies. &QL;

COYOTES BACK IN FORM  
 KHABIBULIN FINALLY BEATS COLORADO, ROY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Statistically, it was a game between teams going
opposite directions _ one toward elite status and the other
seemingly bent toward a return to the mediocrity that has been its
history.
</P>
<P>
   A team that was 16-6-1 in its past 23 games and winner of 12 of
its past 13 vs. one that started fast but was 9-8-6 in its past 23.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what? Statistics do lie. And the term mediocrity wasn't in
the Coyotes' vocabulary Saturday as they whipped the red-hot
Colorado Avalanche and goalie Patrick Roy, 4-1. The victory kept
the Coyotes two points behind front-running Dallas in the Pacific
Division.
</P>
<P>
   By no means was it easy, although the Coyotes showed serious
signs of returning to early-season form with a solid,
tight-checking, defensive game to run their record to 3-0-1 against
the Avalanche this year.
</P>
<P>
   To wit:
</P>
<P>
   In whipping Roy for the first time in his career, Coyotes goalie
Nikolai Khabibulin stopped 25 of 26 shots and, with his 117th
career victory, became the franchise's all-time winning netminder.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes received scoring from unexpected sources. Defenseman
Deron Quint tied the game at 1 with his second goal of the season
in the second period, and Juha Ylonen, with his sixth goal,
provided a needed third-period insurance score.
</P>
<P>
   They were without captain Keith Tkachuk for all but four minutes
of the second period. He was whistled for pummeling Colorado's
Sylvain Lefebvre. He was also handed an instigating penalty and a
10-minute misconduct at the end of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant captain Jeremy Roenick made up for Tkachuk's absence
with a goal against Roy at 19:05 of the second period to provide a
huge momentum boost.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Greg Adams kept up his torrid pace _ 12 points in his
last 10 games _ with two key assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes had to protect a 2-1 lead for 1:29 in the third
period against a power play that has executed at 24 percent over
the last 13 games. They didn't give up a shot, thanks to the
absence of the injured Sandis Ozolinsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the biggest penalty kill we've had all year,'' Roenick
said of Colorado's two-man edge. ``We're up a goal, and they have a
two-man edge for nearly two minutes, and they didn't get a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys on the bench had a good feeling after that. We
talked before the game about using this game as a propellent for
the tough stretch we have coming up. It's great to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes will face stiff challenges at home from Anaheim
tonight and Philadelphia on Tuesday before embarking on a
seven-game, 14-day road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a solid team effort,'' Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld
said. ``We were a little tentative at the start because we've
beaten them twice this year, but never with all their players, and
we wondered how we would really match up with them. From the second
half of the first period, though, we played well.''
</P>
<P>
   The only time Colorado cracked Khabibulin came just 18 seconds
into Colorado's first power play at 7:15 of the first, when Joe
Sakic knocked home a rebound directed right at Khabibulin off
Claude Lemieux's slap shot. Say bye, Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the franchise record is nice, but the win for the team
is bigger,'' said Khabibulin, who now has a career 3-9-1 record
against Colorado. ``This was also the first time I've ever beaten
Patrick, so that really makes me feel good. I haven't played well
against this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``But everybody played very consistent in front of me. This is
the kind of hockey we played earlier this year. We played hard and
smart.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last seven games, Khabibulin has a 0.99 goals-against
average and a 5-1-1 record with two shutouts, making him a
candidate for NHL player of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Quint, too, was excited about beating Roy.
</P>
<P>
   He took advantage of a rare moment of indecision by Adam Foote
to cancel out Sakic's goal just 31 seconds into a second-period
power play, beating Roy with a wrister into the upper corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised when Foote didn't come over on me
quicker, so I took the shot,'' Quint said. ``When I have kids, I
can tell 'em I got one against the greatest goalie who ever
played.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenick took Teppo Numminen's pass that hopped over Lefebvre's
stick just before the red line and skated in on Roy unmolested for
the game winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick played it great,'' Schoenfeld said. ``It was just a
tremendous goal. He didn't give much of an angle, but Jeremy took
the puck from the angle he was on and pulled it back before he
shot. Without the nifty hand movement, Roy had it shut down.'' &QL;

PHOENIX NEIGHBORHOOD'S HOPEFUL SIGNS LOST IN SPASMS OF VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS FISCUS  
 and WILLIAM HERMANN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tidy homes with flowerpots on fence posts. Inviting benches
under shade trees. A neighborhood barbershop.
</P>
<P>
   This is a community where federal dollars help neighbors better
themselves, like the $40,000 loan that helped Marc Rogers expand
his business.
</P>
<P>
   It's a community where crime statistics have dropped
significantly since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And it's the same community that saw nine people gunned down in
less than 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The toll: six dead, three injured and a week's worth of glare in
the media spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood near Broadway Road is neither all good or all
bad, but an unusual _ and extreme _ blend of both. Well-kept homes
owned by couples who have lived here for decades sit next to rows
of vacant lots filled with broken glass. A house the size of a shed
sits just down the block from new homes that are the pride of the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars and untold hours of sweat have been poured
into improving the area, but the list of needs is as long as, or
perhaps longer than, the list of accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The problems facing this neighborhood mirror the challenges
faced in other urban areas around the Valley _ and around the
country _ where police, city leaders and some residents struggle to
turn things around.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area in the spotlight is roughly between 16th and
32nd streets, Broadway and Roeser roads, in south-central Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to picture the whole area as crack houses and
burned-out and boarded-up homes. It's easy to picture criminals
passing the time until they decide to go shoot someone.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality has shades of a neighborhood trying to shake the
coat of despair, of law-abiding citizens who have lived here for
decades, of a community abounding in churches. There are three at
one intersection, and about 25 to 30 in the surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
   And crime is down between 20th and 28th streets, Roeser Road and
Elwood Street. According to police, violent crime in 1998 was down
29 percent from 1996; total crime dropped 18 percent; gang-involved
crime is down 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Councilman Cody Williams grew up blocks from the recent
shootings. He walks through vacant lot after vacant lot littered
with endless broken glass. But when he closes his eyes he sees what
the area could be.
</P>
<P>
   It's like dealing with a weed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``If you scrape the top off, it looks good for a while but it's
going to come back unless you deal with the root.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; That means more is needed than a police crackdown, he says.
It's about the ``need to see dirt turned'' to build on vacant lots,
bring in more homeowners rather than renters, and attract more
businesses to add more jobs. &QL; 
AID FOR THE AREA
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has funneled considerable money into trying to stabilize
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, more than $3 million in various federal funds and
some city bond funds has been committed to a ``neighborhood
initiative area'' between 24th and 32nd streets, from the Salt
River to Roeser Road.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, workers have renovated 35 houses, the
city has donated 231 gallons of paint, and volunteers and city
crews removed graffiti from 143 buildings or walls.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three years, the federal government has handed out
about $250,000 to run various jobs programs in the community and
invested another $500,000 in a 20-square mile area that includes
the neighborhood. Additionally, $200,000 in private funds has been
commited to keep the jobs programs going.
</P>
<P>
   Also near Broadway and 24th street, Phoenix and property owners
demolished at least 49 structures in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix bought the Rainbow Market at 24th Street and Broadway,
considered by many to be a crime magnet, and plans to demolish it.
But it remains open while a court fight continues.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's help like a $40,000 loan through a federal program
that helped Marc Rogers expand his neighborhood barbershop. He has
hired three barbers and a cosmetologist thanks to the loan for his
shop at 17th street and Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And there's the $3,000 in federal dollars that allowed Denise
Rogers to finish beauty school. &QL; 
NEW HOMES GOING UP
</P>
<P>
   There's something else in the neighborhood: new homes, being
built through the Community Excellence Project.
</P>
<P>
   The non-profit community development corporation was formed in
1990. It is &UR; funded with municipal, state, federal and private
sector assistance.
</P>
<P>
   CEP has built three new homes in the neighborhood, with three
more under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Estes, 31, recently moved into a CEP house with his two
children and his wife-to-be. His house is a freshly painted gray,
with green trim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so glad to be here, so glad to have such a nice place,''
Estes says as he prepares dinner for himself and his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``To own your own home means a lot. I've lived in this area a
long time, worked hard for a long time, and now feel like I'm
getting somewhere. I'm also glad my kids will have their own home,
have the same sense of pride I have.''
</P>
<P>
   New homes benefit more than just the new residents; they also
boost neighborhood pride. Jennifer Baker was in the neighborhood to
visit her grandmother, who lives across the street from Estes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those new houses are where shacks once were,'' Baker says.
``Giving people help to get into houses like those is about the
best thing anyone can do. You see what it has done for this
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Tisha Laddell, 14, lives in a neat and trim ranch-style house
next door to a CEP house.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel safer when their houses look nice,`' Tisha says,
tossing a football outside with her 9-year-old brother, Gyrell.
</P>
<P>
   But for every fresh new home there are countless dilapidated
places.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see that there are more vacant lots here than there
are houses. Period,'' Williams says of the neighborhood. ``I doubt
there's a place anywhere where you can count 10 houses contiguously
in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Phoenix City Councilman Phil Gordon, a member of the council's
housing and neighborhoods subcommittee, says, ``This is a wake-up
call.'' Rather than ``peanut-buttering the problem,'' he says the
city and others need to go deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Williams talks of more than $200 million set aside by the state
for matching funds for desert preservation. He wonders why even 10
percent of that could not be set aside to address critical needs in
neighborhoods like this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any cactus that's in jeopardy right now. . . .
You know, these people are talking about the fear for their lives
and their safety in this community.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, 24th street seems to divide two worlds.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of 24th Street are master-planned lots and homes
with garages and carports. On the other side are shed-size homes,
some of which lack even a driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem: Many of the homes east of 24th Street were
annexed into the city, and the homes and streets and lots were not
master-planned, or designed to city standards.
</P>
<P>
   Adding quality homes to the area is the goal of CEP Director
Gail Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers have to be in the lower to moderate income bracket,
have reasonable credit, be employed,'' she says. ``We also hope to
attract people who are, like, 25 years old to their 40s, because
there are so many older people already here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessie Jackson, 61, and her husband have lived in the same
well-kept house on Corona Avenue for 31 years. All of their six
children, they say, have made successful lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``New houses alone are not going to do it!'' she says. ``Young
people in this neighborhood have to be made to stay in school and
have to be helped to find jobs when they aren't in school, so they
will be busy working and learning about responsibility and not be
out on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The CEP is also involved in employment training, crime
prevention and care services for young people and families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, `Where are the parents of these young girls
and boys who go wrong?' '' Knight says. ``What is happening in
their homes that we are subjected to this behavior? Where is the
responsibility?'' &QL; 
MONEY NOT ALWAYS ANSWER
</P>
<P>
   Serious crime and problems persist in the Broadway neighborhood
_ and in other troubled areas _ despite all of the dollars and
programs designed to help.
</P>
<P>
   The city has established half a dozen ``neighborhood initiative
areas'' in the 1990s, pledging to remove blighted properties, fill
vacant lots with new homes, improve infrastructure and beef up code
enforcement in trouble spots. The city also pushes youth programs
and social services. The targeted areas range from Sunnyslope to
south-central Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   One area _ the Longview neighborhood _ received $4.7 million in
funding, and city officials point to several successes there: a
$1.4 million community center, 33 new homes and 70 remodeled ones,
10 new streetlights and about 100 gallons of paint used to fight
graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   And since 1993, about $6 million in federal funds and some city
bonds have gone into the Garfield area.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still trash and there's still junk cars, but I think
all the vacant boarded-up buildings are down,'' says Maryann
Ustick, director of Phoenix's Neighborhood Services department.
</P>
<P>
   Ustick said that nationwide, the average time to turn around a
neighborhood is 7 to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's minimum,'' she says. &QL; 
HOPE FOR THE FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   As for the Broadway neighborhood, as bad as some parts of the
area seem, many hold out hope.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hope rests in the work of CEP.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hope rests in the city's ``Four Corners'' project,
which it sees as a way to revitalize the four corners of the 24th
Street and Broadway intersection. Problem properties or vacant land
could become retail shops or other developments.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has also hired a consultant and is looking at financing
options for a housing and commercial redevelopment in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements can happen.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Williams stands in a dirt lot and looks at a building
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``That used to be the most notorious drug hangout in the state
of Arizona,'' he says. ``People were shot, stabbed, robbed and in
some cases killed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the police and city cracked down on the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shut down this community once before . . . and stopped
preachers, teachers, pimps and pushers until all we stopped were
preachers and teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   A non-profit took over the building and turned it into a
community center.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to the present, and Phoenix police will have an
increased presence in the neighborhood for a couple of weeks. Then
what happens?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have a coordinated community, city and private
effort, we'll be back dealing with similar issues in the future,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must systemically change the existing conditions of this
community and give the residents a fighting chance for a better
quality of life.'' &QL;

MCCAIN: A PRISONER OF AMBITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. John Sidney McCain III is no longer a prisoner of war, but
for the next two years he'll play one on TV. And in the newspapers.
And on radio. And billboards. And bumper stickers. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   The 5{ years McCain spent in a Vietnamese prison camp sets him
apart from all the other candidates. They're his ticket to power
and, even better, his shield from criticism.
</P>
<P>
   On a radio talk show 10 years ago, the future presidential
candidate slipped up and said, ``One of the things I've never tried
to do is exploit my Vietnam service to my country, because it would
be totally inappropriate to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't true at the time.
</P>
<P>
   It's even less so now.
</P>
<P>
   The only way McCain gets into the White House is if the story of
McCain never gets out of the Hanoi Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   And it won't.
</P>
<P>
   Not if the toadies at places like the ``New York Times'' and the
``Wall Street Journal'' and the major TV networks have their way.
</P>
<P>
   Even ``60 Minutes'' tough guy Mike Wallace is among McCain's
media bootlickers, saying, ``I'm thinking I may quit my job if he
gets the (Republican) nomination. I'm impressed by his
independence, by his willingness to take on tough ones. By his
honesty about himself.'' &QL; 
DON'T EXPECT MUCH
</P>
<P>
   They're smitten with the fact McCain was a POW.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, don't expect reporters outside of Arizona to
ask McCain much about the $112,000 in campaign contributions he
took from S&AMP;L kingpin Charlie Keating, returning it only after
publicity made it too embarrassing to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Or about the vacations McCain and his family took at Charlie's
hideaway in the Bahamas. Or about the shopping-center venture
McCain's wife, Cindy, and her father had with Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect them to ask McCain about Cindy's little problem
stealing drugs meant for impoverished children.
</P>
<P>
   They may praise McCain for fighting Big Tobacco, but don't
expect them to ask him why he doesn't complain about Big Alcohol,
or if it has anything to with his father-in-law's beer
distributorship.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect them to ask McCain why he has accepted speaking
invitations from fringe groups like the gay-bashing Oregon Citizens
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Or why he didn't come to the defense of Barry Goldwater when
Arizona Republicans wanted to remove Goldwater's name from state
party headquarters for saying Congress should lay off Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Or about his first marriage, in which McCain acted a lot like
McClinton.
</P>
<P>
   Or about his known temper tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to question McCain. &QL; 
SOMETHING TO FALL BACK ON
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who try it can expect him to reach into his past and
throw down his get-out-of-a-jam-free card. It happened once to some
writers grilling McCain about Keating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the Vietnamese didn't question my ethics,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   You can't beat that.
</P>
<P>
   So, don't expect anyone outside Arizona to ask what happened to
the McCain who told a wire service reporter 10 years ago, ``I'm
devoting all my efforts to being the Arizona senator and not the
POW senator.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's even subtly worked his prisoner-of-war experience into
the statement he released about voting to convict Clinton at the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my former profession,'' he said, ``those who violated their
sworn oath were punished severely and considered outcasts from our
society. . . . Although I may admit to failure in my private life,
I have at all times, and to the best of my ability, kept faith with
every oath I have ever sworn to this country. I have known some men
who kept that faith at the cost of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain suffered horribly in Vietnam. He earned the right to use
that experience any way he wants, and that includes getting
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Why be coy?
</P>
<P>
   Be upfront. Be direct. Make the ``McCain for President''
campaign slogan:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a POW for 5{ years; you people owe me.'' &QL;

LENDING-RATE BILL FLIRTED WITH ACCUSED MOB FIGURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona legislators came perilously close to opening the state
to a Georgia-based lending company with alleged ties to organized
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Two Valley lawmakers introduced a bill last year that would have
let the lenders charge annual interest rates as high as 300 percent
on loans secured by car titles _ more than eight times the current
cap.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed by Title Loans of America, an Atlanta company, and two
well-known Arizona lobbyists, the bill was championed by its
backers as a free enterprise issue.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation passed the House 31-25, but died in the Senate
after an attack by the Attorney General's Office, which opposed the
bill because of the high interest rates it would have allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Organized crime issues did not surface at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Title Loans of America is leading an effort to get similar bills
passed in state legislatures, buying up lobbyists and spreading
campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   A principal owner of Title Loans of America is Alvin Malnik,
banned from New Jersey casinos in 1993 because, officials there
alleged, he had ties to organized criminal activities and
participated in illegal transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Malnik did not respond to requests for interviews at Title Loans
of America's Georgia offices or at a restaurant he owns in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Malnik told ``Consumer Reports'' magazine in July that the
allegations by the New Jersey Casino Commission are ``entirely
baseless.''
</P>
<P>
   Malnik, now in his 60s, who lives on a lavish 22-acre estate in
Boca Raton, Fla., was cleared of tax evasion charges in 1985 and
remains a member in good standing of the Florida Bar Association,
according to a March story in Florida's ``Sun-Sentinel'' newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   A 1980 report by the New Jersey Gaming Commission called Malnik
``a close business associate of Meyer Lansky and other reputed
organized crime figures. Moreover, the federal law enforcement
authorities have long believed Mr. Malnik to be involved in
organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Lansky grew from small-time bootlegging to the leader of a crime
corporation active in Cuba, Las Vegas and Miami during the 1950s
and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The two Arizona lawmakers who co-sponsored the bill, Reps. Wes
Marsh, R-Scottsdale, and Jim Weiers, R-north Phoenix, said they did
not know about the alleged organized crime connection.
</P>
<P>
   Weiers _ then Rules chairman and now House majority whip _
laughed when asked if he knew who owned the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously not,'' said Weiers. The lawmaker said he was
approached by a Title Loans of America lobbyist who is a former
member of the Florida Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Weiers said he is in the business of making high-risk,
high-interest loans to people with poor or no credit through
dealerships of new and used cars, but said the bill was designed
only for those in the title-loan business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it was explained to me, I thought, `Why should
government be interfering with free enterprise?' '' Weiers said.
``Would I put my name on anything like this again? No.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marsh, a health care consultant, said he didn't have a clue
about the connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to protect consumers and allow access to capital,''
Marsh said. ``I think there was good intentions on my part. I was
truly trying t help people.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiers said he is returning a $150 campaign contribution made
last January by a part-owner of the company. Marsh said if he finds
a contribution from Title Loans of America was made to his
campaign, he also will return it.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he was pushing the legislation, Weiers said that
passing the bill was the only way Atlanta-based Title Loans of
America would do business in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I understand it, if they don't get these kinds of
percentage rates, they're not going to come into the state,''
Weiers told ``The Arizona Republic'' in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists Kevin DeMenna and Steven Betts, an attorney at
Gallagher &AMP; Kennedy, said they were hired by former Florida
legislator Don Tucker on behalf of Title Loans of America to lobby
for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker was reached at his office phone number and identified
himself, but hung up when asked about Title Loans of America.
Tucker failed to respond to numerous messages left on his answering
machine.
</P>
<P>
   DeMenna denied he knew who owned the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``My firm and my advocacy will not be associated with gaming
interests of any type, tobacco or the licensed beverage industry.
It takes me to a place I'm not comfortable going,'' DeMenna said.
</P>
<P>
   Betts said he has no comment about the ownership of Title Loans
of America, but would investigate if the company approached him
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we didn't know,'' Betts said. ``We did some checking
on the company, and other states gave them a clean bill of
health.''
</P>
<P>
   Title Loans of America is leading a state-by-state effort to
legalize the high-interest deals.
</P>
<P>
   Its lobbyists say it operates in 18 states. Consumer advocates
say it operates under different names in about 12 to 15 states.
</P>
<P>
   Title loans are legal in about 25 states, including Arizona, but
interest rates companies are allowed to charge vary from 30 percent
a year to 264 percent. In Arizona the cap is 36 percent. Some
states that permit title loans have no usury laws and, therefore,
no cap on interest-rates.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The company offers small loans, in exchange for the title to a
customer's paid-off car.
</P>
<P>
   It charges very high interest rates and lets the customer drive
the car. If a customer cannot make the loan payments, the company
picks up the automobile it owns.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyist Betts said he supported the Arizona legislation as a
way to give an indigent person a chance to pay a medical bill or
purchase tools for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usury laws in general are the result of overzealous consumer
protection advocates,'' DeMenna said.
</P>
<P>
   Then-Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods opposed the Arizona
bill and said high-interest car-title loans would be dangerous for
people out of cash and credit, who would be overwhelmed by payments
and quickly lose their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Title Loans of America has unsuccessfully tried to raise
interest caps in California, Oklahoma and Arizona and set up shop.
But it succeeded in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go in, buy a few legislators off, and they set up the law
and move their business in,'' said Lynn Drysdale, a staff attorney
with Florida Legal Services. In 1995 the Florida Legislature passed
a title-lending law allowing an annual interest rate of 264
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Title Loans of America hired a former Florida state legislator
to lobby the bill through and the ``Florida Times-Union'' in
Jacksonville reported last month that the growing industry as a
whole gave at least $122,000 in campaign contributions during a
two-year period that began Nov. 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Two attempts to rescind the Florida law have failed, and some
Florida cities and counties are now trying to outlaw the loans.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, Title Loans of America owners and executives made
about $2,000 in campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Terry E. Fields, listed by the Georgia secretary of state as
chief financial officer of Title Loans of America, donated $760 to
Tom McGovern's failed campaign for attorney general, Arizona
election reports show.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Aycox, a part-owner of Title Loans of America and listed as
CEO, donated $500 to Gov. Jane Hull's campaign; $200 to Rep. Jeff
Groscost, an East Valley Republican and speaker of the House; $150
each to the campaigns of Sen. John Wettaw, a Flagstaff Republican,
Sen. Scott Bundgaard, a Glendale Republican, and Weiers; and $125
to Rep. Linda Gray, a Glendale Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Aycox's legislative contribution showed him as an executive,
then CEO/president, and then an owner of a company called Tel-Link,
a company with the same Georgia address as Title Loans of America.
</P>
<P>
   In a January 1997 sworn deposition for a Georgia civil action,
Aycox, then president and part-owner of Title Loans of America,
revealed Malnik as an owner of U.S. Title Trust, which owns 50
percent of Title Loans of America.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In the same deposition, Aycox reported that he is a 33 percent
owner and Kenneth Partiss of Atlanta was a 17 percent owner.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Partiss was among 84 defendants indicted in Miami after
a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration drug-smuggling probe that
covered 20 states. He was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Aycox and Partiss did not respond to requests for interviews
left at Atlanta headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after Malnik's 1959 graduation from the University of
Miami Law School he moved into offices of Metro Mortgage Loan Co.,
a reputed front corporation for Alfred Mones, an alleged
``principal member of the Mafia's bookmaking and loan-sharking
organization,'' said a 1980 report by the New Jersey Division of
Gaming Enforcement. The report quotes federal witnesses who called
Malnik an employee of Lansky.
</P>
<P>
   The report states that in 1961 Malnik and a partner started the
Bank of World Commerce, a shell bank that secretly funneled
millions of dollars into Bahamian banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the nation's top gangsters were involved with BWC,''
the report said. Malnik was charged in Florida in 1969 with
underreporting his income and was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966 a fraud indictment resulted from another business deal
with organized crime figures but was never prosecuted. Malnik then
became a business partner with Samuel E. Cohen, who was convicted
in 1971 of conspiring to violate the Commodity Exchange Act. The
same year, Cohen was indicted along with Lansky for a skimming
operation at a Las Vegas casino. Cohen pleaded guilty to filing
false income tax returns and served one year in jail. &QL;

MUSEUM ADDITIONS BROADEN PHOENIX ART SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the $10 million Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art opens
today _ and the $18.2 million Heard Museum expansion opens in two
weeks _ perhaps Phoenix will finally begin to put to rest the
inferiority complex that has plagued it over its supposed lack of
cultural scope and sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed at how the cultural landscape of the Valley has
grown,'' says Robert Knight, the new director of the Scottsdale
Museum. ``We're just starting to come into our own.''
</P>
<P>
   The openings cap a time of nearly frenzied expansion. In the
space of three years _ beginning with the 1996 opening of the
enlarged Phoenix Art Museum _ three of the four most important
mainstream art venues in the Valley will have doubled their
exhibition space. It is an astonishing vote of confidence by museum
boards, administrators and the voters who started the whole process
in 1988 with the passage of the $1 billion bond referendum that, in
part, allowed the Phoenix Art Museum to begin its expansion and
redesign.
</P>
<P>
   Knight points out that the Valley may be reaching what has
always been called a ``critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, the more cultural institutions, the better.
That's what makes a community great. That's why I go to New York,
L.A., Chicago or San Francisco. I can see more than one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers that tell the story of the Valley's arts growth are
astonishing. In 1988, the Phoenix Art Museum saw 177,808 people
enter its doors; in 1998, that number increased to 324,976, fueled
by its massive ``Splendors of Ancient Egypt'' exhibit. The
Scottsdale Center counted 61,000 visits to its galleries in the
1988-89 season; by '96-'97, it was 136,000.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 239 art galleries listed in the Yellow Pages.
There are 59 producing theater companies, almost triple what
existed 10 years ago. There are even 10 contemporary dance
companies in the Valley. And the same bond issue that funded the
art museum expansion helped fund the new Central Library, science
center and history museum, and the restoration of the Orpheum and
Phoenix theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is interesting to look back 10 years,'' said Shelley Cohn,
director of the Arizona Commission on the Arts. ``Back then, in the
winter of 1989, we had three of our major performing-arts
institutions who said they wouldn't open the following fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Things looked bleak. The symphony, the ballet and Arizona
Theater Company were all on the edge of bankruptcy. Today, they are
all strong.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the health of the arts cannot be judged only by numbers. Art
is a stubbornly subjective thing, and it is difficult to determine
just when numbers correlate to quality.
</P>
<P>
   Heard Museum Director Martin Sullivan has a sense. ``We're
absolutely ready to be taken as big city,'' he said, pointing out
that over the next year four national arts professional groups have
chosen the Valley as the site for their annual meetings, including
the National Museum Trustee Association and the Association of Art
Museum Directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't only the general public, but our peers in the
industry that are curious and interested in seeing for themselves
what we are doing in Phoenix,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Art Museum Director Jim Ballinger agrees. ``Absolutely.
As we enter the 21st century, Phoenix has become a place people are
interested in and want to find out about, to see what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expansion has seen us able to attract an Egypt and a
Monet,'' Ballinger said. ``The same thing will happen to the Heard
and to the Scottsdale museum,'' Ballinger said. ``It creates a
tremendous synergy.''
</P>
<P>
   And with locally curated shows, such as the Phoenix Art Museum's
current ``Copper as Canvas'' show, going elsewhere to be seen _ it
travels to the Hague when it closes here _ Ballinger said, ``not
only is the world coming to Phoenix, but we're sending things to
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At Arizona State University's Art Museum, Director Marilyn
Zeitlin agrees about the growth but warns that buildings aren't
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need to work on our collections. If collections and
programs are weak, it doesn't matter how big your building is.
That's where we'll all be working. With the exception of the Heard,
which already has a world-class collection, we all have a lot of
work to do in collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of mediocrity, frankly. And it's tough to move
to the next level with collections. But if we're all smart, we're
not all going to go after the same work. A degree of specialization
in each museum helps.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see where the new Scottsdale museum
goes, in terms of its collection and programs, Zeitlin said. ``I've
always admired their commitment to local artists. That has been
their great strength, and I hope that will continue. It is
important for us to have specialties, to divide things up, and it
would be nice to coordinate some shows _ we already have several
such projects lined up.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight agrees. ``I hate competition among museums. I think
you'll see us working more collaboratively with the Phoenix Art
Museum, ASU and the Heard to create programs and projects that will
have significance Valley-wide, something bigger and better than any
one of us could do individually.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that has changed over the past decade is the
attitude of newcomers to the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be the bane of local museums that people who moved
here from the Midwest often maintained their loyalty to their
former states, often giving money back there rather than here. But
that pattern is changing, and recent residents have begun seeing
Phoenix as a place worth investing both time and money in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing people come here, buy homes, put beautiful work
into the homes, and then participate on our boards and offer
financial support,'' Zeitlin said. ``There's a huge change in
perception of us as a place for good, good work and not just
leftovers. Some of that message we've intentionally promulgated.''
</P>
<P>
   New residents used to come largely from the upper Midwest,
Ballinger said, but now many Southern Californians are coming, and
others from the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``That only enriches what the art community might see and do,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Valley has faced the problem that corporate giving was
also often aimed at home-office states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be realistic about not having too many Fortune-500
headquarters in town,'' Ballinger said. ``We tend to focus on big
companies, but we have to get the mid-size companies, the new ones,
to be more involved in what is happening here. And that will
probably happen.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that will help, they all agree, is the state arts
endowment, which passed the Legislature in 1996 and puts aside $2
million per year for 10 years. That money is deposited into the
state treasury and its income is administered by the Arizona
Commission on the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all this growth and development, funding for arts is
still and always will be fragile,'' Cohn said. ``It demands a
strong partnership between the private sector and government to
assure the arts are available to all our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The end result can be a brighter, more vibrant city and a place
people will want to make their homes for the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said that when there are too many things to do at
night, so you have to miss some of the things you want to see, the
place is turning into a real city,'' Zeitlin said. ``That is
starting to happen here.'' &QL;

NEIGHBOR (Phoenix) _ Tidy homes with flower pots on fence posts.
Inviting benches under shade trees. A neighborhood barber shop.
This is a community where federal dollars help neighbors better
themselves, like the $40,000 loan that helped Marc Rogers expand
his business. It's a community where crime statistics have dropped
significantly since 1996. And it's the same community that saw nine
people gunned down in less than 72 hours. The toll: six dead, three
injured and a week's worth of glare in the media spotlight. BY
CHRIS FISCUS. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CAR-LEASE (undated) _ Glendale resident Robert Haran drove his
truck to a Phoenix leasing company, desperate for a $500 loan.
After a flurry of paper signing, he drove out with money, daily
lease payments for the truck he no longer owned and, if the deal is
figured like a loan, an annual interest rate of nearly 260 percent.
Haran, like thousands of Arizonans unable to get loans from banks,
credit unions, family or friends, is turning to a growing state
industry of sale/lease-back businesses. By PAT KOSSAN. Story will
move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CARMOB _ Arizona legislators came perilously close to opening the
state to a Georgia-based lending company with alleged ties to
organized crime. Two Valley lawmakers introduced a bill last year
that would have let the lenders charge annual interest rates as
high as 300 percent on loans secured by car titles _ more than
eight times the current cap. By PAT KOSSAN. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ART _ As the $10 million Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art
opens Sunday _ and the $18.2 million Heard Museum expansion opens
in two weeks _ perhaps Phoenix will finally begin to put to rest
the inferiority complex that has plagued it over its supposed lack
of cultural scope and sophistication. By RICHARD NILSEN. Story will
move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NUDE-CAR (New River, Ariz.) _ What now in Arizona? A car show at a
nudist colony, giving new meaning to the term, Cruisin'. By RICHARD
RUELAS. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Undated) _ Arizona Sen. John Sidney McCain III is
no longer a prisoner of war, but for the next two years he'll play
one on TV. And in the newpapers. And on radio. And billboards. And
bumper stickers. And campaign buttons. And so on. The one thing
McCain desparately wants to become _ president _ is completely
dependant on the one thing McCain desparately wanted to avoid
becoming _ a POW. By E.J. MONTINI Story will move in the ``A'' and
``K'' categories. &QL;

MCCAIN: A PRISONER OF AMBITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. John Sidney McCain III is no longer a prisoner of war, but
for the next two years he'll play one on TV. And in the newspapers.
And on radio. And billboards. And bumper stickers. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   The 5{ years McCain spent in a Vietnamese prison camp sets him
apart from all the other candidates. They're his ticket to power
and, even better, his shield from criticism.
</P>
<P>
   On a radio talk show 10 years ago, the future presidential
candidate slipped up and said, ``One of the things I've never tried
to do is exploit my Vietnam service to my country, because it would
be totally inappropriate to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't true at the time.
</P>
<P>
   It's even less so now.
</P>
<P>
   The only way McCain gets into the White House is if the story of
McCain never gets out of the Hanoi Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   And it won't.
</P>
<P>
   Not if the toadies at places like the ``New York Times'' and the
``Wall Street Journal'' and the major TV networks have their way.
</P>
<P>
   Even ``60 Minutes'' tough guy Mike Wallace is among McCain's
media bootlickers, saying, ``I'm thinking I may quit my job if he
gets the (Republican) nomination. I'm impressed by his
independence, by his willingness to take on tough ones. By his
honesty about himself.'' &QL; 
DON'T EXPECT MUCH
</P>
<P>
   They're smitten with the fact McCain was a POW.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, don't expect reporters outside of Arizona to
ask McCain much about the $112,000 in campaign contributions he
took from S&AMP;L kingpin Charlie Keating, returning it only after
publicity made it too embarrassing to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Or about the vacations McCain and his family took at Charlie's
hideaway in the Bahamas. Or about the shopping-center venture
McCain's wife, Cindy, and her father had with Charlie.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect them to ask McCain about Cindy's little problem
stealing drugs meant for impoverished children.
</P>
<P>
   They may praise McCain for fighting Big Tobacco, but don't
expect them to ask him why he doesn't complain about Big Alcohol,
or if it has anything to with his father-in-law's beer
distributorship.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect them to ask McCain why he has accepted speaking
invitations from fringe groups like the gay-bashing Oregon Citizens
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Or why he didn't come to the defense of Barry Goldwater when
Arizona Republicans wanted to remove Goldwater's name from state
party headquarters for saying Congress should lay off Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Or about his first marriage, in which McCain acted a lot like
McClinton.
</P>
<P>
   Or about his known temper tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to question McCain. &QL; 
SOMETHING TO FALL BACK ON
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who try it can expect him to reach into his past and
throw down his get-out-of-a-jam-free card. It happened once to some
writers grilling McCain about Keating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the Vietnamese didn't question my ethics,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   You can't beat that.
</P>
<P>
   So, don't expect anyone outside Arizona to ask what happened to
the McCain who told a wire service reporter 10 years ago, ``I'm
devoting all my efforts to being the Arizona senator and not the
POW senator.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's even subtly worked his prisoner-of-war experience into
the statement he released about voting to convict Clinton at the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my former profession,'' he said, ``those who violated their
sworn oath were punished severely and considered outcasts from our
society. . . . Although I may admit to failure in my private life,
I have at all times, and to the best of my ability, kept faith with
every oath I have ever sworn to this country. I have known some men
who kept that faith at the cost of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain suffered horribly in Vietnam. He earned the right to use
that experience any way he wants, and that includes getting
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Why be coy?
</P>
<P>
   Be upfront. Be direct. Make the ``McCain for President''
campaign slogan:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a POW for 5{ years; you people owe me.'' &QL;

CAR BUFFS IN THE BUFF; RESORT PUTS ITS LIFESTYLE ON ON DISPLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RIVER, Ariz. _ Only one convertible, but several tops down
Saturday at the nudist car show.
</P>
<P>
   And some bottoms too.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day to display bodies down at the Shangri-La Nudist
Resort in New River. Most were bright, shiny and attractive. The
ones on the cars, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bashful,'' said Wes Prescott, in a huge
understatement. Technically, the 70-year-old wasn't nude _ loafers
covered his feet and socks sheltered his legs up to the knees. ``I
think human bodies are the most beautiful things in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   A close second in his admiration Saturday was a cherry-red 1929
Ford Model A _ a car just as old as he.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's broken down more times in its life than I
have,'' he chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   More than 580 buttoned-up types showed up at the nudist colony,
said Horst Kraus, the resort's owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest influx of textiled (clothed) folks we've ever
had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the most fabric at the nudist resort is the huge
American flag flapping in the breeze. But Kraus said all the
clothes on display at Saturday's car show didn't chap the nudists'
hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't give a hoot,'' he said. ``To us, it's a natural way
of living.''
</P>
<P>
   The nudists did have something up their sleeves. The resort
owner thought that auto enthusiasts lured to the resort would
cotton to life without clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could happen,'' said Garrett Beckman, 18, of Phoenix. ``But
not today.''
</P>
<P>
   Leilani Hill, 19, of Phoenix, was giggling non-stop, the sight
of bare bodies, keeping her in stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no,'' she said when asked about getting in the altogether.
``Maybe if I was in Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kraus said that even if he didn't sell anybody a membership
to the resort, it's worth it to expose the bare facts about the
nudist lifestyle to the public: They're not a bunch of young,
taut-bodied, nymphomaniacs.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the disappointment of some.
</P>
<P>
   The nudist resort has strict requirements for entry and
membership, Kraus said. Gawkers and pickup artists are not allowed.
Saturday's car show was probably the only time someone could
compliment the condition of someone's seat and not be kicked out.
</P>
<P>
   Nudists also got a chance to wax poetic about being in the buff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids who grow up here learn to look you straight in the
face,'' said Don Morse, 57, of Peoria, ``and they're very polite.''
</P>
<P>
   Car owners often found themselves jawing with naked men. But
that seemed to be lost among the talk of buying stripped-down cars
and investing a pound of flesh to restore them.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Gomez, 67, of Phoenix, gladly accepted Morse's naked
compliment on his 1935 Ford pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez offered a compliment of his own: ``I like your tan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's dull right now,'' Morse said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will get better,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   As a car show, it wasn't much. Only about 25 cars had their
hoods up for inspection. Owners showed up for the same reason
others did: curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect it to be as open as it is,'' said Rich
Kragner, 37, of Phoenix, sitting next to his 1966 Dodge Charger.
``It's not for me, but its OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Kragner said he might consider doffing his duds if he wasn't
surrounded by other auto buffs he'd see at the next car show.
</P>
<P>
   But he did learn something in his hours at the resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder to keep a (human) body up. It's easier to keep a
car up.'' &QL;

YOUTH BRINGING IMPRESSIVE SKILLS TO NASCAR

   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ NASCAR's future looks promising.
</P>
<P>
   Along with youngsters  &UR; Dale Earnhardt Jr. and  &UR; Matt Kenseth,
teenagers such as  &UR; Adam Petty and  &UR; Casey Atwood appear to have the

<P>
   Petty and Atwood each are 18 years old, and each driver spent

   Even race winner  &UR; Randy LaJoie, a two-time series champion, was
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good, real good,'' LaJoie said. ``I think I'll be
chasing them more than they'll be chasing me this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood and Petty still were running second and third as late as
Lap 116 of the 120-lap race. Then, Petty fell out of the draft and
dropped back, finishing sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood was tagged from behind by  &UR; Andy Hillenburg on Lap 119 and
crashed hard near the start-finish line, winding up 17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming down to the white flag, it was show time,'' Hillenburg
said. ``I punched the 27 car (Atwood) to get him going because I
pretty much was figuring on shooting him to the lead and me going
to second, then try to put the same move on him down there in Turn
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated that we got into him, but, man, coming down to the
white flag at Daytona, you just don't back off. He lifted and I hit
him square. I didn't want to turn him because I could have turned
myself, too.'' &QL; 
Injury update &QL; 
Thankfully, there was only one serious injury from all the crashes
during Saturday's NASCAR Busch Series race.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Andy Santerre suffered a lower right leg fracture and will fly
home to Charlotte, N.C., where he likely will undergo surgery. &QL; 
Happy hour &QL; 
 &UR; Chad Little was Chad Big during the final NASCAR Winston Cup
practice late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Little went 192.353 mph, the fastest of all drivers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Terry Labonte was next at 192.217 and Bobby Hamilton was third
fastest at 192.189 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Pole-sitter  &UR; Jeff Gordon went 191.233 mph (10th fastest), and
defending champion  &UR; Dale Earnhardt was 14th at 191.115 mph. &QL; 
Passing interest &QL; 
Green Bay quarterback  &UR; Brett Favre and  &UR; Dale Jarrett have formed a
NASCAR Busch Series team in which Jarrett will drive in 11 races
and Winston Cup teammate  &UR; Kenny Irwin Jr. will start three.
</P>
<P>
   One of the targeted races is Nov. 6 at Phoenix International
Raceway, but it's uncertain who will drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in Mississippi, I always thought that football was
Number 1, but when people found out I was going to the Daytona 500,
no one wanted to talk about Super Bowls or how we were going to do
next year,'' Favre said. ``They wanted to talk about how I could
get them tickets to get in the pits.'' &QL; 
Sterling and `The Duke' &QL; 
To aid the  &UR; John Wayne Cancer Institute, The Duke's likeness will
appear on the hood of  &UR; Sterling Marlin's car in two races this
season _ at the Nov. 7 race at Phoenix International Raceway and
the March 28 race at Texas Motor Speedway. &QL;

A MISSION IMPOSSIBLE?  
 DAYTONA ROOKIE ACCEPTS CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ This is where it all started. This is
where NASCAR founder Bill France gathered together several friends
in a hotel lounge more than a half century ago and collectively
inhaled stock-car racing's first breath of salty air.
</P>
<P>
   My, how it's changed.
</P>
<P>
   But today in the Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway,
Tony Stewart could change it forever.
</P>
<P>
   By winning in front of the largest mass of humanity this side of
the Indianapolis 500, Stewart could become the first rookie in
NASCAR history to capture ``The Great American Race.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have made valiant efforts. All have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Stewart will be different. Maybe, but not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the talented newcomer nearly grabbed the pole position,
only to lose it to Jeff Gordon (195.067 mph), the final driver to
make a qualifying attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But qualifying and a 500-mile race are as different as a lamb
next to a wolf.
</P>
<P>
   In one, a driver is alone for two laps on a 2.5-mile paved oval,
alone to battle the asphalt and a ticking clock.
</P>
<P>
   In the other, a driver is forced to endure a near three-hour,
high-speed chase against 42 other cars, knowing the slightest
hiccup or wrong move could trigger an avalanche of crumpled
machinery.
</P>
<P>
   It's a daunting assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's one Stewart has waited nearly an entire life to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed if you're a good race-car driver, you can
drive anything,'' said Stewart, whose credentials are impeccable
after collaring U.S. Auto Club's ``Triple Crown (Silver Bullet,
sprint and midget championships) in 1995 and, then, the Indy Racing
League crown two years later. ``There are a lot of good race
drivers that have done that. Jeff's (Gordon) one of them. He drove
quarter-midgets, sprint cars and midgets, then came (to NASCAR) and
was successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did the same thing and went to Indy cars from those things.
I didn't go up through Indy Lights. I think with a good race
driver, you put him in the right equipment, he's going to show what
he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 27, has a bullfighter's bravado. If he's frightened or
even somewhat leery of the immediate task, it's hidden beneath
steely eyes.
</P>
<P>
   No, Stewart can't be intimidated. But he can be beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was snookered by one of the sport's all-time bests, if
not the best, in a Twin 125 qualifying race Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt easily pushed by Stewart to take the lead early
in the race, then watched in his rear-view mirror as Stewart was
shuffled backwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a lot,'' said Stewart, who, with car owner Joe
Gibbs' blessing, also will make an effort to win May's Indy 500.
``(But) if I told you what I learned, I'd be telling everybody else
what I'd learned and I'm not going to help them any.''
</P>
<P>
   What Stewart learned is what everybody learns the first time he
is placed in the dicey throes of a restrictor plate race.
</P>
<P>
   One bobble and it's bye-bye baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll learn,'' Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, everyone learns.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone wins the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   It took Earnhardt 20 miserable years to finally end the one
mountain he had failed to scale.
</P>
<P>
   It took Darrell Waltrip 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace never has won it and he's been driving full-time
since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Terry Labonte, whose Daytona skunkings go back to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget Mark Martin. Although one of the sport's most
proficient and respected drivers, Martin can't seem to buy a
respectable Daytona showing.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, however, refuses to let one race spoil an entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one memory of Daytona that stands out, it would be
disappointment,'' Martin said. ``I haven't had the triumphs that I
would be looking for here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to win would just be another trophy on the mantel. I
wouldn't put any additional emphasis on it. I race every race to
win. Whether we win them all, run second in them all or run last in
them all, we still give our best effort every race.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens to Martin, to Wallace, to Labonte or even to
Stewart this year, there always will be next year. And the year
after that.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart knows it. So does Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this (season) is going to be a tough step, a big step
for us,'' said Gibbs, a three-time Super Bowl-winning coach with
the Washington Redskins. ``But we looked long and hard to try and
find the right driver, and we think we found him.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember hearing Tony Stewart's name quite a bit and knew he
was really going to be a great race car driver,'' Gordon said. ``I
think it's a great asset to NASCAR Winston Cup racing to have him
in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being involved with Joe Gibbs Racing and having good sponsors,
that gives him the same opportunities that I had in (1993) when I
was a rookie and look how it's paid off for me. I think the same
things are going to come for Tony.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, just maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to get schooled a lot,'' said Stewart. ``It's those
lessons that you learn that you have to remember in order to be
successful in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me, it's a big book. It's bigger than the
``Encyclopaedia Britannica.'' There's chapter after chapter that
must be learned in order to be good in this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Stewart has learned nearly enough to be good enough to
win the Daytona 500 is a question yet to be answered. &QL;

CAUTION FLAG HELPS LAJOIE WIN NAPA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ About the only undamaged piece of hardware
to survive the crash-filled NAPA Auto Parts 300 on Saturday at
Daytona International Speedway was the trophy Randy LaJoie held
aloft in victory lane.
</P>
<P>
   Five accidents, including a spectacular wreck that somehow
spared teenage whiz Casey Atwood injury, marred the season-opening
NASCAR Busch Series race.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one was seriously injured, NASCAR's garage looked
like a junkyard afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the crashes involved multiple vehicles. Five in one,
eight in another and a whopping 10 in a third.
</P>
<P>
   But the most frightening accident involved only Atwood, who took
a hit from a trailing Andy Hillenburg as the field neared the start
of the final lap.
</P>
<P>
   The impact sent Atwood, who had been running second to LaJoie,
into the wall and upside down on the Chevrolet Monte Carlo's roof.
The car continued sliding on its roof until it reached the grassy
infield, which lifted the machine and sent it into a series of four
barrel rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood's mangled heap came to rest right-side up 40 feet past
the finish line, and a second later, he crawled out and waved to
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wondered what that felt like (flipping),'' Atwood
said. ``Now I know. I don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident forced the 120-lap race to end under the shield of
a caution flag, which probably suited LaJoie and the remaining
survivors from the original 43-car starting field just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Atwood go for his ride (in my mirror),'' LaJoie said.
``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Adam Petty, son of Kyle Petty and grandson of the great
Richard Petty, was running third late in the race until faulty
handling dropped him to sixth at the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   When Petty spotted Atwood, he grew concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably my best friend at the racetrack,'' said Petty,
who like Atwood, is only 18 and deemed a rising star. ``Some of the
moves (drivers) were making, I wouldn't even make on a computer
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hillin, who finished fifth, also didn't like what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to do this (restrictor-plate racing) every week, I
don't know if I'd be a race-car driver,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LaJoie was just happy to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured somebody would make a run at me,'' said LaJoie, who
passed runner-up Jeff Green on Lap 101. ``I thought I could keep
them at bay a little bit, but I was going to make my car wide if I
had to there at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   LaJoie didn't have to, but he did need the help of a Lap 59
caution flag.
</P>
<P>
   LaJoie, who was on pit road getting serviced for a loose rear
tire, was able to remain on the lead lap because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a break,'' LaJoie said. ``That saved our day. Our left
rear tire came loose and I thought I was going to wreck on the
backstretch. Then, we came in, got the (caution) flag and we're
able to stay on the lead lap.''
</P>
<P>
   An eight-car, Lap 78 accident ended an impressive run by
defending series champion Dale Earnhardt Jr. Earnhardt, who crashed
during happy hour practice Friday, had to start at the rear in a
back-up car.  &QL;

DOCTOR RETURNS HOME TO SAVANNAH TO SERVE THE POOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to correct coding)   By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Dr. Debbie Davis recently burst into an
examining room of the Westside Urban Health Center on the ragged
stretch of Bay Street, about four miles west of the historic
district's cobblestones and serene Colonial squares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me get my hug,'' she told Mary Gray, 73, a retired mental
home housemother who beamed and threw out her arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for my Christmas present,'' Dr. Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling up her stool, squeezing her patient's knee, Dr. Davis
asked ``What is it today?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rashes,'' said Ms. Gray, who has some hypertension and
arthritis chronically.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor examined the rash on Ms. Gray's arms, declared it
hives, then moved to other issues. ``Your blood pressure looks
fabulous,'' Dr. Davis said. ``Your weight is OK. You're looking
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor made Ms. Gray an appointment for a pap smear. ``For
the rashes,'' Dr. Davis said, ``we'll go with the shot, the salve
and the pill.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Phoenix-Davis is an exuberant but harried pioneer in
minority and indigent medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Like many poor urban neighborhoods and rural communities, those
served by the three Westside Urban Health Center clinics are short
of doctors, black or white. There are few African-American doctors
relative to the nation's black population.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, in a population that is 13 percent black, less than
4 percent of all doctors are black. In Savannah, where more than 50
percent of the 137,000 residents are black, 30 of 540 physicians
are black, or less than 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the disparities have stirred concern among advocates of
African-Americans, as well as historically black medical schools
like Morehouse, especially in the face of new research showing
disparities in the health of black and white Americans. Blacks have
shorter productive lives than whites and experience more prostate
cancer, strokes, heart disease, AIDS and obesity and deaths from
breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Davis understands the way they live, the flaws in their
diets and the financial constraints that sometimes make health care
a low priority. The patients say they find her easy to talk to.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not taking the position that the problem of
African-Americans need be solved only by having more black
physicians,'' said Dr. Louis Sullivan, the president of Morehouse,
who was Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Bush
Administration. ``A white physician can be just as effective.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sullivan said familiarity with patients' race and heritage
led to better care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's knowing what questions to ask,'' Sullivan said. ``It's
knowing that if you prescribe a $50 medicine, the patient might not
have the funds. And it's trust, communication, things that affect
compliance. Coming back to the doctor when they should. Taking
medicine when they should.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Davis rose from this largely black neighborhood of housing
projects to become student body president at Savannah High School
and graduate fourth in her class of 400. With scholarships and
loans she went on to graduate from Emory University and the
Morehouse School of Medicine. Seven years ago, the mother of two,
Dr. Davis returned to serve the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one black surgeon in Savannah,'' Dr. Davis said, ``no
black nephrologist, one black gastroenterologist, two black
pediatricians, both women, no black dermatologists.''
</P>
<P>
   A visit in one of Dr. Davis' examining rooms is an occasion to
chat about family members, and for the many who share her Christian
faith, a moment to celebrate the healing powers of the Lord. An
ordained Pentacostal minister, Dr. Davis jokes that she dispenses
``Gospills'' and writes ``prescriptures.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinics like those where Dr. Davis works are straining these
days as the number of the uninsured people grows, to more than 43
million now, according to the Census Bureau, about 12 million more
than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Savannah, the poor, the uninsured and the underinsured can
turn to the Westside clinics, which, with the support of federal
and Chatham County subsidies, charge $12 a visit and nothing at all
to penniless patients.
</P>
<P>
   For patients in need of specialists, except in immediate
life-threatening cases, Dr. Davis said: ``I have to send them to
specialty clinics because the doctors won't see them in their
offices. And they have clinics only once a week or once a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, however, impedes the care of Osborne Lemon, 62, for
whom Dr. Davis has become more than the crutch supporting his
health. Retired two years ago as a maintenance man for the local
housing authority, he is diabetic and blind in one eye and has
congestive heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was instrumental in helping me obtain my disability,''
Lemon said. ``She wrote them a letter.'' He was deemed eligible for
a Social Security disability check, of $697 a month, and that made
him eligible for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a crimson beret, jeans and a Van Gogh beard, ashen-faced
with fear, Lemon sat one day in a clinic examining room. He had
gained 20 pounds in a week and that morning he had awakened
coughing and gasping.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Davis told him that because of his heart condition, his
lungs were filling with fluid. Pills would not do. He needed high
doses of an intravenous diuretic, and for that he would have to go
to Candler General Hospital. ``This is mild and it's early,'' she
assured him.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Davis says she perseveres. She attributes that to her
parents, now divorced. Her father, a laborer for a trucking
company, rues having dropped out of high school. Her mother, an
elementary school teacher, earned a master's degree in education.
``They stressed education,'' Dr. Davis said. ``Stressed it,
stressed it, stressed it.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer after her freshman year at Emory, it all seemed for
naught. ``I got pregnant,'' she said. ``I was depressed. I was
going to call it all quits. But my mom told me to move past it, and
she took my son so I could finish school.''
</P>
<P>
   A month after the birth of her son, now a freshman at Georgia
Tech, the doctor said, ``I got saved and gave my life to Christ.''
She married in medical school, had her daughter, now 11, and was
divorced five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a student, she came to know the debt and dunning notices that
ravage the poor. Her biggest debt now is the $80,000 she owes for
medical school, which she is paying off at a rate of $1,000 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   A lesson learned about debt, she bought her red eight-year-old
Ford Explorer used, for $10,000 cash. She and her daughter live in
a black subdivision, in a 2,400-square-foot house with three
bedrooms and two-and-a-half baths that she bought three years ago
for $96,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Davis' salary is $112,000, of which she gives 10 percent to
her church. She said she had never given a thought to a
better-paying career in private medicine because a salaried job
allows her to spend more time with patients. Hefty, at 5 feet 5
inches, Dr. Davis relates to obesity among black women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to bring about change when you are part of what
you are trying to change,'' she said. ``I was raised on pigs' feet
and pigs' tails. Cottage cheese? Get real.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   She opened the door to an examining room and greeted a
43-year-old patient, a woman near tears. ``Knees are hurting,'' she
told the doctor. ``The weight got them.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman weighed 414 pounds. The doctor discussed diet pills
and nutrition with the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm down to 235 from 265 in two years,'' Dr. Davis said. ``If
I can do it, you can do it. If you get to 250-260, that's
reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients here discuss their preference for Dr. Davis not in
terms of race but in those of manner and style.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Kearse, 69, who is black and suffers from hypertension,
has watched Dr. Davis from childhood. ``I just like what she is,''
Mrs. Kearse said. ``I'm so proud of her. She comes from out of my
neighborhood.''

ST. JOHN'S BEATS VILLANOVA, 82-75  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Jarvis stood on the baseline for a few minutes
during the game Saturday night, his hands on his hips, surrounded
by the St. John's cheerleaders, looking like an overgrown,
overdressed pep squad member with little to celebrate. The Red
Storm was struggling to establish its offense in the first half
against Villanova and only much later, when his team was up by 15
late in the second half and Villanova had taken its second timeout
within a minute, did Jarvis seem to relax.
</P>
<P>
   Not for long. No. 11 St. John's blew a large lead late in the
second half, a troubling pattern lately, before beating Villanova,
82-75, with the breathtaking passes and powerful rebounds now
expected of a team marching toward the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any bad news from this game, it came near the end,
when Bootsy Thornton left the court doubled over in pain after
re-aggravating a sprain of his left thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, playing with his thumb heavily taped, had 14 points
and 17 rebounds Saturday night, but it was unclear what his
condition would be for St. John's game Monday against Providence.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's (20-6, 11-3) received a boost from Tyrone Grant
returning to the starting lineup at center. Grant had 8 points and
grabbed nine rebounds in the first half. He had missed a month with
a fracture in his right wrist, a time that Grant found frustrating
as he watched his teammates squander leads as they came close to
beating Duke and Connecticut, a phenomenon Coach Mike Jarvis
blamed, in part, on exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   With Grant's return, St. John's was back to full strength _ and
a full complement of offensive options _ with just five games left
in the regular season.

   ``Besides the obvious that he's going to get you 10 rebounds and
10 points, he gives you a presence that we really don't have,''
Jarvis said before the game. ``He's a legitimate inside scoring
threat. Forget about the fact that he's not really a center, that's
how we have to play him. And he gives us another heady veteran who
really knows the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Villanova (18-7, 9-6) has been one of the hottest Big East teams
over the last month. The Wildcats point guard John Celestand leads
the league in assists in Big East games (he had 26 assists to five
turnovers in his previous three games). Villanova had won seven of
its last eight before Saturday night, and seems assured of
receiving an invitation to the National Collegiate Athletic
Association Tournament just one year after going 12-17 in the wake
of the sudden departure of Tim Thomas for the National Basketball
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Lappas' switch to a smaller, more mobile lineup _
center Rafal Bigus was sent to the bench, Malik Allen moved to
center from power forward and freshman Brooks Sales took over at
power forward _ has meant better ball-handling and defensive
matchups. Villanova's rise from the middle of the pack with no
stars to a league power was obvious in a 75-60 humbling of Syracuse
in the Carrier Dome, when the Wildcats held the Orangemen to 32.3
percent shooting from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Villanova is still a bigger team than St. John's, a fact that
gave Lappas little comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to box out,'' he said before the game. ``They're a
tremendous offensive rebounding team. When people talk about teams
being big, they're athletic and quick and that's what makes them
such great, tenacious rebounders. The big thing is to limit them to
one shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Villanova did that for the early part of the first half. St.
John's played poorly at both ends of the court early, failing to
solve Villanova's zone defense (they shot just 37.5 percent from
the field and were 3 of 16 from 3-point range) and compounded the
problem by not pounding the offensive boards until midway through
the first half. The Red Storm fell behind by 15-6 and seemed unable
to deal with Villanova's fine perimeter shooters.
</P>
<P>
   On one of his two first-half 3-pointers, the closest member of
the St. John's team to Brian Lynch was Jarvis. A Ron Artest
3-pointer and Reggie Jessie layup closed the gap, but they quickly
faded to an 8-point deficit, 26-18, with 8:24 left.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's seemed to be in trouble then, with Artest and Erick
Barkley both on the bench with two fouls and Villanova still
hitting from outside. They were 7 of 16 on 3-pointers, including 3
of 4 from Celestand. Jarvis even had St. John's playing a zone
defense for a while.
</P>
<P>
   But St. John's seemed to find its offensive rhythm and its
toughness on the boards when Barkley and Artest returned to the
game with 8:14 left. Artest, who had eight first-half points, had a
lay-in, Grant had a layup and finished the 3-point play and after a
3-pointer by Jermaine Medley, Jessie grabbed an offensive rebound
and layup to close the Villanova lead to 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's finished the first half with 11 offensive rebounds
and had 10 second chance points in the first half as they rallied
to lead at the half by 37-36 when Thornton tipped in a Chudney Gray
miss at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The start of the second half was like watching a recent NBA
game: lots of fouls, little scoring.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's had five team fouls with 15:00 left and Villanova did
not score in the first five minutes of the half. Then again, St.
John's got only a layup from Lavor Postell to hold its lead at
39-38.
</P>
<P>
   An Artest offensive rebound and layup and an Artest layup on a
three-on-one following a Jessie rebound opened St. John's biggest
lead, 53-48, with 13:54 left to play.
</P>
<P>
   The run went on from there, with Jessie leading three straight
possessions with three magnificent passes.
</P>
<P>
   But St. John's, which has struggled to put away recent opponents
even after gaining a big lead, withered again.
</P>
<P>
   After a few missed foul shots, a bad foul by Barkley on
Celestand for a 3-point play and a Lynch 3-pointer, the lead was
down to 76-71 with :28.3 left.
